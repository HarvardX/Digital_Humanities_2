the letters  the occasional miscellany in prose and verse  consisting of a variety of letters written originally to a young gentleman who designed to go into holy orders with a specimen of sacred poetry and sermons  omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci hor vol i  by john wallis a m late of queen s college oxford  newcastle upon tyne printed by john gooding on the si       to her grace the duchess of richmond and lenox madam to fly to the beautiful the good and the great as to guardianangels for protection has been the practice of humble adventurers for fame in all ages but which of these virtues out shines the other in your grace requires a nicer judgment than mine to determine i can only distinguish that they give a kind of glory and luster to each other i can only say they are so eminently conspicuous together as to make your graces person seem to the wondering eye like a paradise and your soul a cherubim within to guard it i can only discover to the world a part of your graces excellencies and that too according to the measure of my own weakness like those who have surveyed some celestial luminary or constellation i can only tell of a new and shining world above me but not all the riches and glories of the place  there are some of your graces virtues of a public nature such as candor benevolence and generosity which display themselves in such an amiable variety of lights that not to perceive them or to deny them to be yours would be as ungrateful as not to perceive or to deny the suns existence at the same time that we feel its beneficial and extensive influence the noble manner in which your grace seems to enjoy riches would almost tempt one to think that fortune if i may so speak had consulted reason when she bestowed them on you since the world has more cause to wish you the addition than envy you the abundance   for merit hence is heard amidst its blushes dawning arts arise the gloomy clouds which ignorance or fear spread over the paths of virtue are dispelled servility retires and every heart with public cares is warmed  your graces encouragement of learning is the more extraordinary at a time when many think they but too well recompense an author if they honor him with a barren praise  i have the public voice to attest what i have now advanced concerning your grace and therefore i hope i shall not be suspected of uttering those obliging falsehoods which many of our moderns can do without blushing  and here madam i am proud that i cannot flatter if i say your private virtues have deserved to be set as an example to a lessdegenerate lesstainted age they approach so near to singularity in ours that i can hardly make a panegyric to your grace without a satyr on many others and therefore this is a theme that i must cast in shades and leave your grace to the testimony and satisfaction of your own mind which though a silent encomium is still the best this epistolary address keeps its distance and goes no farther than my heart there it is i feel all the transport and joy imaginable when i see virtue encouraged and learning patronisd and rewarded by your graces noble family  that it may long enjoy the full vintage of its flowing honors is the sincere and earnest wish of  madam your grace s most obedient most humble and most devoted servant john wallis  the preface written by a friend the author of these volumes is too well convinced of his own weakness to be pleased with any thing he has written and he has so little of the selfopinion of a writer in him that he has imposed the task upon another to say something concerning his work after a review of so considerable a body of men as the clergy he has modestly attempted to show why the number of good orators among them is so inconsiderable why so few so very few of those who are bred to the church become masters of the force and charms of eloquence  though he may not have pointed out all the several reasons that might be assigned for it yet in obedience to a young gentlemans commands who designed to go into holy orders he has very freely let him into his sentiments about every particular relating to this subject and he entered the more boldly upon the enquiry from this consideration that no embellishment of style could be expected from him in a letter epistolary writing must resemble a natural conversation though it may be a little better than what the generality of people are supposed to speak extempore as a picture may be like though handsomer than the original  in a disquisition of so much importance he thought it no ill method to exhibit the most material accomplishments required in a divine and the blemishes he ought carefully to beware of and to set in the most conspicuous point of view obvious examples for illustrationsake he has endeavored to produce such instances of offenders both in eloquence and morals as may convince any impartial person that by proper means coxcomb after coxcomb may be gently led off the sacred stage and persuaded to part with every glaring particularity which drew them into the ministry or the pulpit to be laughed at some men have a strange inclination to branch out into extremes and will be dilating themselves into the ridiculous unless some benevolent hand takes the trouble to prune their luxuriances to pare away the redundancies of fancy till they are left in the becoming simplicity of action and delivery  had some of our modern preachers but the least spark of emulation in them they would blush to find the little progress they have made in the study of eloquence at an age in which many others have succeeded so well as to be able to give sweetness to the eye charm to the tongue and grace to motion and to point their arguments with all the life and spirit with all the edge and flame that wit or judgment or example could give them  it is strange indeed to see how differently the vanity of preachers runs it is the boast of many a one of but a raw fancy and untaught unpracticed ear which has not had an opportunity to form itself and become truly musical that by his genius alone and a natural rapidity of style and thought and an elaborate freedom and facility of action he is able to carry all the affections of his hearers before him others again with a wondrous affected air lisp in the pulpit as in their cradles and their pretty stammering tongues which nothing besides their ignorance can excuse speak continually in wretched pun and quibble and even a later race scarce free of this infirmity and aiming at a false sublime with crowded simile and mixed metaphor become rather ridiculous in endeavoring to discover the pains they have taken to be oratorical  the way of form and method in many of the sermons we hear preached has so little force toward the winning our attention that it is apter to tire us than the meter of the old ballad of the children in the wood we no sooner hear the text given out the subject divided and subdivided with first of the first and so forth as order requires than instantly we begin a strife with nature which otherwise might surprise us in the soft fetters of sleep to the great disgrace of the preacher and scandal of the audience  the manner of dividing a discourse into plain firsts and seconds only is of late grown so much out of fashion i think that it is the unpolished countryorator alone almost who presents his audience with a divisible discourse the wellbred courtdivine exhorts in polite essay and is ashamed to bring his simple twos and threes concerning hell torments before a fashionable assembly  the truth of all this may easily be apprehended by those who know any thing of the present state of pulpiteloquence or are in the least fitted to judge of the manner of the common preachers of the times  whoever has been an observer of action and grace in preaching must of necessity have discovered the great difference in this respect between such persons as have had the assistance of nature and a simple rude education only and such as have had the advantage of forming themselves under the best masters at oxford or cambridge there are some men indeed so happily formed by nature herself that with the greatest simplicity or rudeness of education they have still something of a natural grace and comeliness in their action and delivery and there are others of a better education who by a wrong aim and injudicious affectation of grace are of all people the farthest removed from it it is undeniable however that the perfection of grace in preaching can be found only among the people of a liberal education and even among the graceful of this kind those still are found the gracefullest who early in their youth have learned their exercises under the best and ablest masters such as a an eminent tutor at queens college oxon fothergill or a a tutor at st johns college cambridge rutherforth  it is remarked that by the help of imitation and the force of example merely such a comeliness of language and delivery is acquired with such apt motions and freedom of action as on all ordinary occasions may enable a man to demean himself prettily enough in the pulpit but when upon farther occasion trial is made in an extraordinary way when sermons of the genteeler kind are to be preached twill easily appear who of the preachers have been formed by the most excellent rudiments and masters and who on the other side have wanted the opportunity and means of forming themselves after the better models methinks i can distinguish the man of liberal education and pregnant genius by the fine drapery and beautiful coloring of his style which always has a certain fullness without grossness is gentle yet lively and strong and such that its excellency lies in its equally partaking a moderate share of both kinds i observe it is attended with a coloring which appears handsome not from the daubing of paint but the flush of health  i am sensible that other topics than what my friends letters are upon would have been more to the liking of some people for human nature is so formed that he who flatters men for his own interest pleases more than he who has no view but public benefit and some men there are of so confused a thought and so irregularly formed within themselves that it is no more than natural for them to be displeased and to find fault with the bestnaturd and most benevolent performances but about such our author need not be under the least concern as to what their sentiments of him may be so long as he has the countenance and encouragement of the most worthy of his profession  a man that should pursue learning even with the disinterested spirit of a amid the van of persia was a youth named teribazus not for golden stores not for wide pastures traversed over with herds with bleating thousands or with bounding steeds nor yet for power nor splendid honor famed rich was his mind in every art divine and through the paths of science had he walked the votary of wisdom in the years when tender down invests the ruddy cheek he with the magi turned the hallowed page of zoroastres then his towering soul high on the plumes of contemplation soared and from the lofty babylonian fane with learned chaldeans traced the mystic sphere there numbered over the vivid fires that gleam upon the dusky bosom of the night nor on the sands of ganges were unheard the indian sages from sequestered bowers while as attention wondered they disclosed the powers of nature whether in the woods the fruitful glebe or flower or healing plant the limpid waters or the ambient air or in the purer element of fire the fertile plains where great sesostris reigned mysterious egypt next the youth surveyed from elephantis where impetuous nile precipitates his waters to the sea which far below receives the sevnfold stream thence over the ionick coast he strayed nor passed miletus by which once enraptured heard the tongue of thales nor prienes walls where wisdom dwelt with bias nor the seat of pittacus along the lesbian shore here two melodious numbers charmed his ear which flowed from orpheus and musaeus old and thee o father of immortal verse maeonides whose strains through every age time with his own eternal lip shall sing  back to his native susa then he turned his wandering steps  vide mr glover s leonidas l   teribazus would need more than all the abilities of that noble persian to convince the worthless part of the world of his discretion unless he had made some improvement in the pleasures of the palate in wealth and luxury  it will evidently appear that from the beginning of this epistolatory work he has varied his style according to the nature of the subject he is upon and has taken the liberty now and then to depart a little from the course of it that he might introduce a greater variety of sentiments indulge his correspondent with agreeable digressions to entertain and relieve his juvenile mind whose improvement pleasure and instruction he had solely in view  whatever some men may think the letters are real and not precise and formal treatises designed for the press though it is become indeed so common a practice among authors to feign a correspondency and give the title of private letters to pieces addressed to the public that i should not at all wonder if some people looked upon these epistles merely as fictitious like those of seneca to his friend lucilius or those of ancient sophists grammarians or rhetoricians  it will be expected perhaps that i should say something with regard to the poem of the royal penitent and the exhortation the design of these is to show the advantage that sacred has over profane poetry the treasures of it are almost infinite and it fares with those that study it as with a traveller when he ascends a rising ground every new step enlarges his horizon and presents new countries new pleasures to his eye our northern island will in time i hope burn with as many altars to the sacred muse as did formerly in cyprus delphos or any of those warmer grecian climates to venus and apollo  the subscribers names a mark anesley esquire john anesley esquire

burdus mr thomas fish letter i dear sir i am glad to hear of your resolution to enter into the service of god you could not possibly choose a better master provided you are but sufficiently qualified to serve such a master well and to acquit yourself with honor in the exercise of the ministerial office all the duties and qualifications which are requisite to the pastoral charge seem to me to be summoned up in these few words of the apostle st paul to timothy    timothy ii    study to show thyself approved unto god a workman that needs not be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth  for by being approved unto god does not probably signify more than the pleasing him fearing loving and honoring him does that is by leading a religious and virtuous life according to the rules of the gospel thus romans xvi  0 apelles is said to be approved in christ and he is said to be the  the good the upright or approved man not he who commends himself but whom the lord   cor x    commends by being a workman that needs not be ashamed i take to be meant such an one who is skilful in his profession one that is qualified with competent learning and skill for the discharge of the pastoral office for a minister that wants these qualifications had need to be ashamed because it is a very great shame for any workman whatsoever to work or practice in that profession or calling which he does not understand for a man cannot have the face so much as to excuse his ignorance in that matter which he professes to know by rightly dividing the word of truth i understand the teaching sound and orthodox doctrine the interpreting the scripture truly and genuinely without heretical false erroneous or whimsical glosses which st paul does so often caution against in many places of his epistles for dividing the word signifies teaching or interpreting it being a metaphor probably taken from the jewish sections or divisions of the law one division of which was read and commented upon every sabbath day so that to divide the word came to signify the interpreting commenting or preaching upon such a division of it  a good life then according to the apostle is a duty which is particularly incumbent upon us of the clergy  we must study to approve ourselves unto god colors artfully spread upon canvas may entertain the eye but never affect the heart and he who takes no care to add to the natural graces of his eloquence any excellent qualities may be allowed still to amuse as a picture but not to triumph over the affections of his auditors the eloquence of a bad man is so involved in smoke that it does not appear in half its beauty but that of a good man shows itself in such a variety of corresponding agreeable lights that it shines as it were in an universal blaze his sermons receive a luster from his life and his delivery though not so graceful as that of a tillotson has however the power of charming without this irradiating power the proudest divine ought to know whatever he may think to the contrary that his finest sentiments both in his pulpitharangues and in common conversation are uninformd and dead it is the good the upright the approved man only can deliver his discourse or his opinion with dignity can rouse a desponding or check an outrageous sinner can chastise the enormities of the age or applaud virtue innocence and integrity for how can the vicious preacher be warm in exhorting to devotion how can he be vehement in reclaiming the reprobate how can be gracefully recommend piety and virtue how can he be successful in soothing the afflicted or desponding christian it is impossible that a hearer should ever be impressed with sorrow with hatred with detestation of sin with dread of punishment it is impossible to move him to penitence to tears and contrition unless the preacher shall appear possessed of all these good dispositions which he aims to awaken in others a wicked clergyman is a ridiculous character there is never a sunday he goes to church but his congregation are witnesses of his folly and impudence he never ascends the rostrum but he undergoes a severe trial and every time he reads prayers it is renewed for there is scarcely any one who hears him that has not a quicker a more piercing eye to the defects of his life than the beauties of his delivery so that of whatsoever complexion his immoralities may be they cast a cloud over all his excellencies i must own indeed he that has made but one false step or committed one single error in life is not immediately pronounced a stranger to virtue and goodness the goodnatured world always throws the mantle of charity over it because it is impossible for frail man to be free from all fault i have known it an advantage to many that they have committed mistakes in their first setting out in the world because they have thus improved their caution and prudence and the remembrance of former miscarriages has put them upon repairing little slips with extraordinary success to desire indeed to be free from all fault whilst we are frail men is an extravagant pitch of arrogance and as often to stumble against the same stone and not to learn caution even when the event chastises our rashness is even far beneath the character of a man  as there is nothing so distasteful to an audience as a bad clergyman so there is nothing they so much adore as a good one they are struck with the beauty of inward character the harmony and numbers of the heart the just regulation of the affections which form the manners of an orator  i shall therefore enter into a more particular discussion of those virtues or moral qualifications which the roman orator styles the handmaids of eloquence and which we of this profession are under an indispensible obligation to practice if we would approve ourselves unto god or our hearers as eloquent divines  the first virtue i shall mention as more particularly necessary for us to practice is humility there is not indeed any degree of meanness in the pastoral office which should engage clergymen to be more condescensive than others for they have rather reason to value themselves upon the dignity of it but such is the nature of their employ that it being their business to assist and instruct persons of all ranks and qualities as well the poor as the rich it is impossible without a considerable degree of humility and condescension that they should in any tolerable measure perform their duty we must with as much sincerity and application instruct the poorest child in our parish in the principles of religion as if we had in charge the son of caesar we must with as great readiness visit in their sickness the poor almsman and beggar in their squalid cotrage as we do those great persons that lie expiring in pomp and splendour it is an intolerable arrogance for us upon a great preferment to put on a mein of grandeur and a supercilious carriage and to despise those poorer laborers in the gospel who have met with a less bountiful reward if any clergyman were to set a value upon himself it should be upon the conscientious discharge of his office for the elder only that rules well is worthy of double honor for the church must never value herself upon her patrimony because her best and purest ages were when she inherited nothing but persecution and we find in scripture an abundance of commendations and blessings upon good and faithful pastors but it is for feeding the sheep and not for the weight of their fleece and it is as great a fault in a clergyman to be proud of great parts and learning not only because these are the gists of god as well as other things but because these qualifications when accompanied with pride do very little good nay commonly a great deal of mischief in gods church for the learnedest men though good are not always the most successful pastors though paul plants and apollos waters yet it is god that gives the increase a painful and industrious though less learned minister may gain more souls to christ than the most learned gamaliels for oftentimes poor ignorant wretches which stand unaffected by all the rational strength of some great doctors of the law are roused up to repentance and a sense of religion by the weak performances of some of the meanest of the sons of the prophets  there is a pretty remarkable story of a country clergyman which as perhaps you have not heard i shall here insert and for a matter of fact this gentleman had a son who being deficient in point of learning was refused deacons orders by a certain worthy prelate a few years ago it was such a grief to him that he went personally to his lordship and begged hard that his son might not return with such a slur to the university and be discouraged from making better use of his time my lord said the clergyman be pleased but to admit my son to deacons orders and i will engage that he shall appear before your lordship the next time with a better stock of learning and approve himself not unworthy of your future favor when i was about his age i got into orders though but indifferently furnished with learning for i had been very remiss in my studies a few years after being promoted to a living i found my parishioners mostly dissenters which for a while made me a little dissatisfied now your lordship may perhaps wonder how i did to manage them being not overburthend at my first setting out with divinity why my lord i took this method which effectually answered my desire whenever i had any occasion of speaking with them either at my own house or any other place my carriage toward them was never divested of good manners and i never made my company distasteful to them on the score of opinion i frequently had them to spend an evening with me and our discourse was chiefly confined to such things as fall in countrymens way by these means and doing them all the good turns in my power i had much of their company and can now with comfort say that of all the dissenters in my parish that went to the meeting i have not one now that goes to it they all come as duly to church as the rest of my people  this my lord was my case and i leave it to your lordships candor and consideration the good bishop i have been told was so pleased with this country clergymans honest simplicity and plain dealing that he obliged him and ordained his son  this story if duly considered is enough to quell the pride of those clergymen who unmeasurably value themselves upon their learning and great preferment and look upon others only as the caterpillars in the vineyard such endowments single of themselves are no qualifications for a christian ministry and they may as well be possessed by the proud priests of baal or bacchus by pagan flamens or mohammedan mufties  so true is it that men who excel in other respects nay shine in other lights of life are frequently more deficient in that address that mild humanity which wins the affections of mankind than in talents to raise themselves to honorable stations the haughty and dogmatical are often substituted in the room of the friendly benevolent and obliging as to the objection that we might perhaps be overbold with greatness and make acquaintance with it in too familiar a manner if it was humble and condescensive i answer it may be just with respect to those gentlemen whose only qualifications lie in form and distance but not to those of real merit a becoming freedom simplicity and openness of behavior methinks when extended to men of sense and prudence will never lessen greatness at all but rather like the regular apertures of a building add beauty to the whole without diminishing the strength of any part of it  the superior clergy should be the support and ornament of the priesthood they are placed in higher orbs not that like meteors their ominous blaze should be the gaze and terror of their less happy brethren but that like stars they may illuminate and beautify animate and impregnate the inferior world for they like them should have an enlarged prospect a swift and constant motion a bountiful and benign influence   but man proud man dressed in a little brief authority most ignorant of what he is most assured his glassy essence like an angry ape plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven as makes the angels weep shakespeare a large share of this indecorum of behavior belongs to those i believe who have contracted the reverse of affability and civil manners in their infancy for pride is a passion which instead of being restrained is usually indulged in children so that it is indeed no wonder if the effects of it are very unfortunately felt in society for it will be hard perhaps for one to give a reason why that temper which was used to delight in insult over servants or inferiors in a kitchen or a nursery should not afterward be the occasion of equal mischief in the public itself  it has been known likewise to be perfectly reigning in those who have long indulged themselves in an habitual moroseness in a collegelife there are certain negligences or peccadillos in behavior toward inferiors contracted there which sometimes reduce gentlemen into a perfect apathy toward others that are not their equals in birth or fortune or learning or preferments ever afterward when we go to an university we find that as fortune holds the glass things have quite different faces in the imaginations of many of the graver sort of academicks we find that there is scarce one in five of the fellows of a college can be tolerably civil to any gentleman of less rank than a nobleman a gentlemancommoner or a graduate hence it is that others catch the infection noblemen or gentlemencommoners will only keep company with the fellows or with one another a graduate with a graduate or men of the same standing so that by these foolish distinctions the poor scholar or servitor in a tattered gown though of ever so much merit has rarely but very rarely the benefit of keeping company with his superiors which i must own i mention with concern as it is a great disadvantage to youth when they first go to an university and would gladly learn manners as well as sciences if a poor scholar should happen to neglect or forget the ceremony of putting off his cap in passing one of the fellows in the collegequadrangle it is a thousand to one but he is made to fast that day by being put out of commons or else he perceives his mistake not only in his dinner but at it likewise for if the proud gentleman that thinks himself slighted should happen to sit provostplace as they call it he sits at the head of his table in all the agonies of concealed ill nature and his discourse is made up of half sentences and dark allusions both disagreeable and unintelligible to all present so that the scholars that wait at table can only stare each other wildly in the face and stand with a malicious sneer wishing the dinner was over and inwardly commiserating the condition of one another when gentlemen of such a saturnine complexion retire from the exercise of magisterial authority over a few poor scholars and enter into life their behavior is commonly attended with a great many disagreeable sullennesses toward their inferiors or dependants upon the slightest displeasure nay whether in or out of humor they have contracted such an aversion to tattered robes that for the most part they fly the society of the poor such men forget that they give the world the same advantage over their reputation which a more criminal conduct would do    hae nugoe seria ducunt in mala the young gentleman therefore that goes to an university has great need of counsel and direction i would have him consult god in the first place and next the most humble the most devout and experienced tutor and companions he can find out for he stands in a place where many ways meet and if he takes the wrong he will certainly wander far and it may be never recover the right he may float a long long while upon the billows of pride and folly before he recovers the haven of wisdom and humility  how considerable a part of happiness is lost by those who seem by the eminence of their condition to be above ordinary human commerce and who affect a sort of distant strangeness toward their inferiors will be easily apprehended by one who is not exceedingly illnatured such a refervd uncommunicative unfriendly greatness must of all others be the most distasteful and gloomy state nor can it possibly be esteemed other than sound and thorough wretchedness a grating and disgustful feeling without the least mixture of any thing soft gentle or agreeable how great must be the shocks of disappointment the stings of affront and the agonies of a working antipathy against the multiplied objects of offense to the haughty proud man who with a severe aspect and a pompous lofty tone of authority guards his greatness as a gruff bully does a mistress wherever such a creature turns himself which ever way he casts his eye every thing around him must appear ghastly and horrid every thing hostile and as it were bent against a private and single being who is thus divided by pride from every thing beneath him and has nothing soft or pleasing from the side of friendship in the inferior world how little does such a mortal know the extent and power and pleasure of humility and to what an heroic pitch a soul may rise which feels the thorough force of it never was humility practiced but with increasing joy which makes the practiser still more in love with the fair act it leaves behind it the perception of a delicious ease and an overflowing of soft and pleasing sensation i would to god that enormous pride and distance did never appear among us that humility and a just reverence for mankind and civility and affable manners did always take place we should then feel nothing but the enlivening influence of the benevolent and obliging the courteous and unreservd temper which is a perfect stranger to the untoward delights of a dissocial community  i shall conclude this epistle lest i should fall under the imputation of being prolix with ardently wishing that all of us may be able to say with david psalm cxxxi lord i am not highminded i have no proud looks i do not exercise myself in great matters which are too high for me but i refrain my soul and keep it low as a child that is weaned from his mother yea my soul is even as a weaned child our savior has so often pronounced the humblest man the greatest in the kingdom of heaven he has so often promised the first place and the greatest exaltation to the lowest condescensions he was himself so illustrious an example of lowliness of mind of poverty of spirit and the apostle has so expressly asserted his phil ii joy and crown to be the reward of his humility that i can never think dear sir that we can ever rise to a more eminent height than that to which the imitation of this virtue of our lord and master will advance us  i am etc  letter ii dear sir another virtue we are particularly to practice is patience for i am sure no order of men in the world have more occasion to exercise it if we should give way to passion and peevishness our whole life would be one continual fret we had need of a great deal of patience in the instruction and admonition of those that are under our care to see what slow progress they make in the knowledge of divine truths how perverse the younger sort are to learn their duty and how refractory and stubborn the elder are to retain their vicious habits with how great a facility even children can apprehend any thing that is lewd and wicked and how dull and stupid their very parents are whilst we are preaching to them what is good how that when we speak to them in demonstration and power making out to them as clear as the sun the agreeableness the pleasure and happiness of a virtuous course of life and the inevitable misery of a bad one and when to this we farther add the efforts of a pious zeal and the charms of a grateful eloquence and yet notwithstanding all this to make no more impression upon their hearts than the strokes do upon the hardened anvil  we had need be considerable masters of this virtue when we find how many men are become our enemies because we tell them the truth that when we preach up religion and virtue we are looked upon as so many knavish cheats and impostors by the atheistical and profane whilst we endeavor to maintain the unity and apostolic government of our church whilst we warn men of the great danger of an unreasonable separation we are traduced by the resolved schismatic as the agents of rome and the advocates only of a more covert and disguised popery that when we teach the quiet and peaceableness of primitive christianity the guilt and danger of faction and rebellion to think we should be censured for the miscarriages of some this way as the mercenaries of government and the promoters of a despotick power to think farther yet how the inferior clergy should be set up as the mark of ridicule and contempt that they should have reason to complain of more grievances than their superiors can boast of immunities that no injustices are so frequently committed nor so hardly redressed as what are done to them that they should in many places be the sport of the gentry and be liable to all the unmannerly mirth of the commonalty that their very name should pass for a jest and every thing though never so nauseously silly when they are the subject presently commence wit and go for a thing that is well said  now to be able to conflict with these and many more grievances and difficulties in the exercise of our office we must be armed with a great deal of patience and wait for a recompense in another world for our sufferings here this and this only has kept up the spirits of my neighbor eulalius  eulalius may be said now to be one of your very rich clergymen not worth a groat who is little known and much esteemed by his few friends thankful for what mercies he receives and humble under chastisement he is despised by the world for his poverty and pities the world for its weakness is a friend to mankind and an enemy to nothing but vice a lady of his acquaintance told him one day she was sorry he had the misfortune of being so poorly provided for in the church and asked him if he had no better chance for preferment chance misfortune and good or bad luck madam replied he are words without a meaning or they signify the direction of providence if you have no meaning in these words you tell me you are sorry for nothing if you have it is impious for it is thinking the source of mercy cruel but as i think better of you i take them to be words of course he who depends on providence can never want a support but say we are neglected and all our endeavors for a decent support prove fruitless he who considers that death will soon relieve him will by that reflection not be dismayed but find his constancy supported  we are all but actors on the worlds great stage some play without some with an equipage death drops the curtain and the farce is over and all distinctions cease twixt rich and poor were the good and virtuous of mankind madam wholly prosperous in this life did goodness never meet with opposition or merit lie under a cloud where would be the trial victory or crown of virtue where would the virtues have their theater or whence their names where would be temperance or selfdenial where patience meekness magnanimity whence would these have their being what merit except from hardship what virtue without a conflict  eulalius though in these low circumstances is often telling his friends that he is very happy   dulces pendent circum oscula nati casta pudicitiam servat domus  virg georg l   and that he looks upon his condition to be for the best which puts me in mind of a gentleman who coming from ireland to england and going into the packetboat and the enteringrope breaking fell into the pinnace and broke his leg well said he it is all for the better his friends asked him how he could think breaking his leg attended with the loss of his voyage etc could be for the better providence vidence replied he knows best i am still of opinion it is for the better he was carried back the packetboat sailed foundered in her passage and but one man was saved  and here it is pleasant to observe that though the pavilion of the almighty be thick clouds and he walks upon the wings of the wind though his providence be a great abyss and the swiftness and secrecy of his actings elude our search and baffle our enquiries so that we cannot discern when he acts by prerogative when by law yet as is plain from this relation he does frequently exert a supernatural force and virtue for our preservation  a low condition in the world seems to all my friend a terrible misfortune its sound is so and that is all life methinks is various enough and if one livelihood fails another may succeed if one rank of life cannot be supported a clergyman may flourish very well in another it is but descending a step lower and the event would abundantly atone for the condescension it is well known the mercantile world is indebted to an ingenious poor clergyman to his neglected merit for the curious invention of the stocking frame being out of bread and ignorant of any means of subsistence by divinity he lived for some time upon what his wife got by knitting and by curiously observing the playing of the needles whilst she was at work he framed in his mind the famous model of the frame which has since proved of such singular advantage to that branch of the british manufactures that it affords good bread to thousands  i remember a little story of a gentleman of gascoigne who inherited two thousand crowns a year from his father commenced marquis at paris and being a very volatile genius soon got the better of his fortune and was reduced to the lowest ebb of wretchedness yet in the midst of it he never lost his spirit and courage or impotently repined at what was not to be remedied but with the small pittance he had left purchased a mule and turned watercarrier some time after which as he was trafficking his merchandise up and down the streets he happened to meet two of his old companions who would have avoided him for fear of giving him pain at being caught in such an equipage but he prevented them sprung forward to salute them with his usual freedom and when they seemed to pity his ill fortune briskly interrupted them by saying  that he had forty thousand crowns worth of water in the seyne but for want of servants he was obliged to sell it himself  i am afraid very few among us in distress display such a fortitude and greatness of soul our pride will not suffer us to do it and we rather choose to have that very pride wounded every day in our lives by laying ourselves open to the rich mans contumely to insults and new grievance in entreating obligations to endure which with patience should be beneath the spirit of the sacred orator as to all other sufferings we may rejoice in them with eulalius and with our blessed lord endure the cross and despise the shame  i am dear sir yours etc  letter iii dear sir we of this profession are likewise

boldness his holy name and word from blasphemy and those things which are consecrated to his service from profanation we must afford all the advice and encouragement we can for men to observe his

them out of the snares of the devil and to lead them into the way of salvation to grieve at their miscarriages and to rejoice at their amendment to endeavor to our utmost to promote piety and true religion to enlarge the confines of the gospel and the kingdom of our blessed lord  and so likewise as to riches which the vain world so courts and admires we must not take them for our masters but with a decent humility condescend to be easy in the situation we are in and endeavor rather by our deserts to invite preferments to us than make any tendency to them we must not when we are advanced to the most plentiful station in the church only fill our bosoms with the fruits and raise families upon its revenues nor yet if we meet with disappointments must we be impatient but study to live decently creditably and contentedly according to our conditions  i have often thought that the great polite ancients had nobler notions of wealth than we have and behaved with much more patience and magnanimity than we generally do under the want of it many of them hugged their poverty more than even some men do a bishopric the famous grecian lyrick alcaeus on whose tongue dwelt rapture and

without reaping any other advantage from a prodigious great conquest but a good conscience and a fair character continued in his former poverty and laborious way of life the same man being both the pattern and strict guardian of public moderation when the senate would have assigned him a considerable share of land he was content with the same quantity which he had given others which was but four acres often using this expression that he was a bad citizen who could not be contented with what satisfied others here he built a country house which he called after his name and when the sabines whom

every human endowment in comparison with riches and think that there can be no real greatness or distinguished merit without a flow of wealth and preferment to attend to the narration that historians give us of these eminent heathens  respicere exemplar vitae morumque jubebo doctum imitatorem et veras hinc ducere voces hor de art poet the private conversation which passed between c fabricius and king pyrrhus who wanted to make a trial of his constancy and selfdenial is so remarkable that i shall here set part of it down  c fabricius said the king as i sincerely desire to have all the rest of the romans for my friends so especially i do you whom i esteem to excel all others for your conduct both in civil and military affairs yet i am sorry to see that you want one thing for your circumstances are too narrow to enable you to keep up the port becoming men of quality i will not suffer this frown of fortune to make you uneasy any longer for i will give you such plenty of gold and silver in money and plate as will set you above the most opulent roman in point of riches because i am persuaded that nothing can be more worthy my princely station and fortune than relieving the oppressive poverty of men of merit who have preferred glory to the heaping up of riches i look upon this as a most glorious act as an act by which a prince raises the most illustrious monuments of his royal magnificence and offers the most solemn and acceptable sacrifice to the gods therefore if you will allow me to assist you with my riches i shall esteem it as a benefit received rather than bestowed  to which c fabricius after a short silence answered  my poverty is so far from being a burden or inconvenience to me that on the contrary whenever i compare myself to the rich my condition seems to be infinitely happier and i number myself amongst those few whose lot it is to enjoy all the felicity possible in this life and when thus ranked i feel the greatest inward delight and am thankful for my poverty for while i deem it idle and foolish to covet superfluity and my little field when well cultivated and laid out affords me all necessaries i know not for what purpose i ought to be solicitous about greater wealth for all nourishment is most pleasant to me when seasoned with hunger and all drink grateful when i am adry i procure myself easy and quiet sleep by labor if my clothes keep out cold i am satisfied with them in housholdfurniture i like that best which is most fit and convenient for the use to which it is applied and at the same time cheapest wherefore i should be doubly unjust if i should accuse fortune for not having afforded me more riches than my nature requires which neither inspires me with a desire of superfluities or dexterity to procure them  therefore with this indigence of mine i look upon myself as richer than the most opulent of other men nay than even you yourself for i have so much that i can desire no more as to you would you have come over to italy if you had not thought yourself poor notwithstanding you possess epirus and other dominions ay but say you wealth fairly enables us to do good to others and my poverty puts it out of my power to help any one but truly this gives me no more trouble than that i am not more than ordinary furnished with other things that god has not granted me uncommon knowledge nor the art of prophecy for the benefit of those who want them nor many other excellent endowments and if i employ the talents i possess for the interest of my native state and friends if by assisting every man in every respect that i am capable i suffer my good offices to extend to all i think hitherto i am free from crime on this score nor can you in justice call these things mean and trifling which you pretend to set so high a value upon and are so ready to purchase at the expense of great treasure  we are informed that the king having heard him talk in this manner desisted from farther trial of his virtue at that time but next day he ordered fabricius to be called to him and in order to frighten him having placed an elephant behind a curtain at their backs as they were discoursing together the curtain was drawn up all of a sudden at the command of the king and the beast laid his trunk on fabriciuss head and set up a terrible noise and braying but the undaunted hero turned about very calmly and smiling said your gold could not tempt me yesterday nor has your beast frighted me today  the same fabricius whose whole sideboard of plate consisted only of a silver saltseller and a little dish which stood on a stool of cornelwood when the samnite ambassadors brought him money and fine furniture carried his hands wide open to his ears thence to his eyes nose mouth throat and at last down to his belly saying while i can govern these i shall want nothing but do ye carry back the money to them who need it  pare away vanity and ambition dear sir and there is no solid and natural contentment but may be had with the smallest income or preferment if we have not a stately brick house and the costliest sort of furniture we may perhaps have as convenient a little cottage as c fabricius or m curious had with decent necessaries in it and if we have not a bottle of port or falernian we may have plenty of spring water which is every whit as clear and wholesome as if it darted from the breasts of a marble nymph or the urn of a river god  if we cannot be moderate in our desires no greatness can satisfy or content us still if we could mount up a little higher in the church if we could get that rectory or that deanery or that bishopric we would be happy we would obtain all our wishes but yet at last when we have got up to the very top of the peak of teneriff to the very summit of preferment we are in exceeding great danger of breaking our necks downwards but in no possibility of ascending upwards into the seat of tranquillity above the moon the first ambitious men in the world the old giants are said to have made an attempt of scaling heaven in despite of the gods and that they cast ossa upon olympus and pelion upon ossa two or three mountains more they thought would have done their business but the thunder of omnipotence spoiled all their work when they were come to the third story  it is recorded of the same pyrrhus king of epirus whom i just now mentioned that fighting for one territory after another was his constant amusement to the last gasp without ever arriving at the merry hour which he proposed as the issue of all his victories for he was knocked in

well sit down and be merry over our bowls and what answered his minister hinders us from doing that now  men of great parts and learning who are ever uneasy always restless in their cures and struggling for wealth and grandeur as children do for rattles are as weak as pyrrhus and weaker than children the harmless babes indeed are innocently amused with the tinkling of the bells but the amusement of the ecclesiastic infants is attended both with the loss of time and reputation they are in a continual hunt after baubles till the end of the lottery of life approaches till the last minute like the last benefitticket upon the wheel puts a stop to their career  i often look upon these aged children or gamblers for preferment in the same merry light with those that sly down from a steeple dance on a rope whistle sing walk run hop or tumble into the golden lap of fortune it is not unlikely but some of them are gamblers all their childish days that they may not seem to want activity or life and spirit to be engaged in the busy scenes of life like diogenes who upon the approach of philip of macedon with an army toward corinth and the inhabitants running in great consternation with materials for its defense took his tub which was his dwelling and with great industry rolled it up and down the craneum the usual place of his residence before the city and being asked the reason of his whimsical labor answered he did it that he might not be the only idle person among so many that were in action  but to be serious we of the clergy ought of all men to show a contempt of worldly things we must not ambitiously aspire to great preferment nor indecently progg and solicit for any by a criminal lowliness or sawning obsequiousness of behavior by a servile submission and falling into the corrupt taste and pleasures of great people though i know they are reckoned essential qualities and accomplishments for a man that would nowadays rise in the world but it is observable that those that arrive at preferment this way would gladly forget the steps of that detestable ladder by which they ascended into it and eagerly wish that others would forget it too like a stream running as soon as it enlarges itself as far it can from its little fountain and laboring as it were by its circlings and wanderings to conceal the meanness of its rise   it is a common proof that lowliness is young ambitions ladder whereto the climber upwards turns his face but when he once attains the upmost round he then unto the ladder turns his back looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend   i am etc shakespeare  letter iv dear sir as we of this profession must not take the riches so neither must we take the pleasures of the world for our masters we must not prefer them to that intellectual pleasure and divine peace which is attainable by men alone and denied to beings of a lower class any man may see the great disproportion there is between the resind pleasures of conscious innocence and sensual gratifications unless he has parted with his noblest prerogative his reason and by intemperate and disorderly living made thinking his torment the pleasure of sense that is not resind by virtue is like a landflood impetuous muddy and irregular it leaves nothing behind it but a group of impurity but the pleasure of virtue is like a stream which runs indeed within its banks but it runs smooth and clear and is as pure as the limpid fountain from whence it flows  purity of heart is of all others the most excellent as well as the most elevated virtue and therefore a poor greek maiden being asked what fortune she would bring her husband answered truly and bravely  i will bring him what is more valuable than any treasure a heart unspotted and that portion of virtue without a stain which was all that descended to me from my parents  the wild academicks give ample testimony of the slavery and wretchedness of vice they may extol their criminal delights to the skies and point their wit as sharply as they please against a virtuous regular conduct but when they come afterward to pay the necessary tribute to their commanding pleasures we hear their pathetick moans and find the inward discord and calamity of their lives we may often read in their looks the dolorous confession in behalf of virtue and see in their very eyes how the case stands  nam veroe voces tum demum pectore ab imo eliciuntur  who can express the horrors that flow in upon the men of pleasure when cool reflection brings their guilty scenes to view how

prelate was surpised when he read the following answer which the cardinal immediately sent him  his old eminence advises you to extinguish your passion his majesty orders you to continue in your diocese till further orders and requires that your life and conversation may be as pure as the air you breathe and that you make no other use of your good state of health but to discharge the duties of your function  we of this profession must also be very moderate in the enjoyment of those other good things which god has allotted us such as our diet dress and clothing  when people see a clergyman laboring and toiling among a squadron of dishes grunting under the load and repletion of the strongest meats panting almost in vain for breath but quite in vain for thought and reminded only of his existence by the unsavory returns of an olio what good can they expect from such inglorious work  what life in all that ample body say what heavenly particle inspires the clay distempers of all

be extremely delicate in our choice of diversions we must often tread in the rugged tract even when there is little occasion for it desire must be frequently confined within the circle prescribed by custom only when there would be really no harm with decency to indulge it for though in the very road to virtue there are several primrosepaths to use the expression of laertes in shakespeare which may invite the step without leading absolutely out of the road itself or offering any indecent prospect to the view yet the world expects a clergyman should tread the direct road without going to the right or left for fear he should wander too far or trip in the circumflex  although a fondness for the entertainments of the stage is the prevailing temper of the age we live in yet it would but ill become us to give any encouragement to them for the false notions of honor there propagated the agreeable shade which is cast over unlawful love and the ridicule and contempt with which all seriousness and religion is generally treated makes me think it too dangerous for the young and unbecoming the old the gay the polite and the witty may perhaps run the rigg upon us the toupees may laugh at us and the ladies frown upon us if we do not make a party with them to the playhouse but we must not regard that i am indeed ashamed to tell you that a man may read the comedies of the ancient heathens with less offense to his modesty and virtue than those of modern christians a vicious sentiment in a theatrical performance at athens would have cost the poet his liberty or life when euripides made one of his actors say  riches are the supreme good and with reason excite the admiration of gods and men  the whole theater rose upon him and he had been banished immediately if he had not desired patience till the end of the play where the speaker of this sentence perishes miserably were the stage under proper regulations it would be a rational and agreeable entertainment and i cannot see why a clergyman as well as another person might not then go to a play it might then as much help as it now hinders the the cause of virtue  we must never frequent gaminghouses to play at billiards etc but fly from the infection of them with horror it is really my opinion that this single depravity puts thousands of people in the kingdom to greater expense than would maintain the sciences in all their glory  gaming was so much disesteemd among the greatest of men formerly that the king of parthia is reported to have sent a bale of golden dice to demetrius on purpose to upbraid his inconstancy and cobilon the lacedemonian being sent to corinth for obtaining a mutual league and friendship between those two cities when he saw the captains and senators of corinth playing at dice returned without doing any thing saying that he would not so much as tarnish the glory of the spartans as that it should be said they had made a league with gamesters  i am far from being an enemy to the entertainment of a concert i even think music a science peculiarly necessary amongst us to soften our rugged genius to prepare the way to politeness and goodbreeding in homer we read of a harper to whom alcinoes and ulysses willingly lent their ears in virgil jopas both sings and plays while dido and aeneas give attention such is the force of music that orpheus assuaged the tempest of the argonauts with a song and if there be any authority in fables we find that though argus had his head guarded with a hundred eyes yet they were all charmed asleep with the sound of one single pipe music has charms to soothe and tamethe horrid savage rocks and deserts are respondent to the voice ciceros orat for archias but even this taste for musical diversions a man may encourage with too great profusion and he may become a dupe to sounds to the prejudice of his understanding  though i am for taking the highest care to exhilerate religion yet i would by no means encourage your going to dance etc at assemblies dancing may be a very necessary qualification for youth as it gives a person a genteel carriage and an easy graceful behavior but i dont know of any business a gentleman in holy orders has with it when cyrus the great demanded the advice of his counselors about the best method of keeping a nation which he had conquered in subjection he was advised to let singers and dancers be introduced amongst them and let their youth be brought up in learning the lute and they would soon languish into foppery and effeminacy and lose all sense of liberty this will always be the case whenever like the far unlike in manners to the greeks appear the lydians wantonness and sport were all their care beside caisters stream or smooth meander winding silent by or near pactolus wave among the vines of tmolus rising or the wealthy tide of goldensanded hermus they allure the sight enchanted with the graceful dance or with melodious sweetness charm the ear and melt to softest

melt the heart or with his pipes awakning strains invite the lovely dames of lydia to the dance they graceful over the verdant level moved in varied measures while the cooling breeze beneath their swelling garments wantoned over their snowy breasts and smooth caisters wave sostgliding murmured by leonidas lib   lycis shall be more admired than the manly eloquence of a archbishop of york hutton a bishop of st asaph drummond or a prebendary of worcester tottie  cautiousness and circumspection in our taking a glass at a tavern or at our own houses is a duty which is also more particularly incumbent upon us of the clergy  it is true our savior exhorts us to cheerfulness and good humor in the strongest manner and under the most familiar and pleasant images even the first miracle he ever wrought carries with it a certain agreeable festivity and alacrity and old nestor in homer as sage a soul as he was could take a cherruping glass and be very merry  which ausonius translates concussit quamvis potantem nestora clamor but we may sometimes by our imprudent freedoms betray weaker christians into real sin they for instance by keeping the same company or the same hours which we do may act very wickedly for it is not to be supposed that they should have so much metaphysics as to distinguish between an unseasonable sitting for discoursesake or for drink we must therefore abridge ourselves of many little liberties which other men lawfully take both in our words and behavior in company we must avoid not only guilt but scandal too because scandal may do as much mischief in our profession as guilt and men will be as far from imitating our practice or practicing our doctrines if they believe us to be immoral as if we were really so we must attemper our discourse over a glass with a decent cheerfulness and as it were a pleasant unaffected seriousness for by this we may even then probably obtain the conversion of some misguided persons who are averse to our communion only for the general neglect of this or at least we shall gain their better opinion and we ourselves shall not be the worse men for it i confess the wicked hypocrisy of those pretended godly ministers in cromwells days that were carrying on rebellion and sacrilege with so much sanctimonious preciseness has entailed such a lasting scandal upon the outward form of godliness as has made good men ever since very cautious of using it but in opposition to them we have perhaps carried the point too far on the other side we have given them occasion to censure some of our freedoms as we have done their preciseness very worthy of our attention is the behavior of aristippus aristippus wore neither the formal beard nor the sour severe aspect of an instructor but mingling himself in all companies artfully picked occasions as if by chance to rectify an error or prevent a vice by this means his virtue became the fashion and men were reformed from vice while they thought they were only growing polite  because it is always expected dear sir that men of a liberal education should be no strangers to good breeding we must by no means neglect the culture of that social virtue  a virtue that has all the heightening of embellishment and gracefulness it is benevolence brought into action with all the assemblage of propriety and excellence it is the friend of society and the polish of science it regulates life and conduct refines upon happiness enlarges the circle of enjoyment and is the improvement of pleasure it obliges us to behave with decency and elegance and quickens our attention to the good qualities of others complaisance is indeed its resemblance but only as a shadow is of a substance it is only the varnish the masque of it good breeding is the real ornament of the soul made visible and set in the fairest point of light our modern complaisance like false wit has something glaring in it which strikes the injudicious with a kind of admiration but like false wit has no other effect on people of sense than to produce ridicule and contempt  the design of schools the use of universities the benefit of conversation should all in some measure center in this great point  good breeding no one can be properly called a gentleman who has not made use of every opportunity to enrich his own capacity and settle the elements of good behavior which he may improve at leisure there are numbers of persons of our profession who may justly claim reputation for a single excellence that in all others are defective and inconsiderable for the want of this general accomplishment  a variety of incidents agree to make the want of it very common bad principles of education when at school an ill choice of acquaintance at entering into the university the unhappy bluntness of tutors who undertake to inform us and an untoward disposition of our own but the frequency or confirmation of an evil should never discourage us from endeavoring to surmount it and if it is grown quite desperate there is the more necessity for opposing it with the greater vigor i must own that little oddities and singularities of behavior in a gentleman of a liberal education whose mind is very much accustomed to a habit of study and thoughtfulness may be sometimes excused with candor and indulgence they may be only like spots perhaps in the sun or asperities in a diamond or may be as moles and dimples which hinder not a face from being beautiful though that beauty be not regular or of the number of those amiable imperfections which we see in the fair sex and which we pass over without a strict examination when they are accompanied with greater graces  there is another particular in my opinion dear sir of no small consequence to the support of our character and that is to retain in our memory our poor kindred and relations though never so remote for nothing is more unbecoming a clergyman than a forgetfulness either of his poor friends or his parents which is always imputed to an affected disdainful superiority and pride  a gentleman who was on the road of algiers some years ago was an eye and ear witness of the following story  one day as some christian captives who had been ransomed were going to be discharged the towncruizers brought in a swedish vessel one of them hearing it was of that nation and being from thence himself was very desirous to see the crew when to his great surprise he saw his own father who was master of the ship in company the son knew the father but the father who had lost him when a youth many years knew not the son having given him up as dead long before not hearing any thing of him the son soon made himself known to the father who embraced him with great tenderness but their unhappiness to meet in that place was grievous to them both the young man addressed himself to his father in this manner  the slavery you are going into will be insupportable to you and soon put an end to your life the thoughts of which is death to me i have been here a great many years and know the country the people and their work if they will accept of me in your room i will go back into slavery and you shall go home again i know if it should please god to enable you i shall be redeemed if not gods will be done the moors readily accepted the exchange so the father returned home and the son back in his stead into slavery  gelon the son of hiero king of syracuse who after living upwards of fifty years died before his father from a moderation and affection very uncommon among men chose rather to want his kingdom for ever than be deprived of his father whom he honored with a strict duty and obedience to the last minute of his life  justin in his history gives us a description of filial and parental affection which is extremely moving and pathetick it is that part where he is speaking of the approaching death of agathocles the sicilian tyrant and of his wife and children going into exile  discedentes parvuli flebili ululatu amplexi patrem tenebant ex altera part uxor maritum non amplius visura osculis fatigabat nec minus senis lacrymae miserabiles erant flebant by morientem patrem ille exules liberos hi discessu suo solitudinem patris aegri senis ille in spem regni relinqui in egestate lugebat inter haec regia omnis assistentium fletibus tam crudelis discidii impleta resonabat  just hist l    josephs affectionate behavior to his brethren as it is related in holy writ after the death of his father jacob is attended with every circumstance of fraternal love and regard and deserves our most serious consideration  and when josephs brethren saw that their father was dead they said joseph will peradventure hate us and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him  and they sent messengers unto joseph saying thy father did command before he died saying  so shall ye say unto joseph forgive i pray thee now the trespass of thy brethren and their sin for they did unto thee evil and now we pray thee forgive the trespass of the servants of the god of thy father and joseph wept when they spoke unto him  and his brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we be thy servants  and joseph said unto them fear not for am i in the place of god  but as for you ye thought evil against me but god meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive  now therefore fear ye not i will nourish you and your little ones and he comforted them and spoke kindly unto them genesis l    to      i am dear sir yours etc  letter v dear sir another virtue which we are particularly obliged to practice is charity  we know the apostle recommended charity as the principal of all christian virtues the top and height of our religion he prefers it not only before faith and hope but even sets it beyond martyrdom itself  if i give my body to be burnt and have not charity etc we therefore that are the preachers of righteousness and the propagators of this blessed religion must be eminently charitable in our censures of other men we must hope all things of them believe the best not mistrust worse than does plainly appear excuse as far as possible their failures and draw a veil over their infirmities we are conscious of that they may not be espied by others if there should be any so uncharitable as without reason to censure our behavior so as to endeavor to lessen us in the opinion of our parishioners we must remember that scandal never fails to recoil with double force on the authors it is a noxious but transitory vapor which vanishes at the first appearance of light we must reprove them gently but not use them with inhumanity and should they still keep pecking at us it will not be worth our while to inflict any heavy ecclesiastical censure upon them spiritualcourtofficers like knavish physicians seek employment enough for themselves and would be glad to see every parish in a diocese always diseased that men might apply to them for cure besides our enemies may be such that they may not deserve our concern so as to feel the weight of our indignation and the vengeance of a spiritual court  a merchant who resided sometimes at bencolen bought a tame elephant there whom he suffered to go at large this animal used to walk about the streets in as civil and familiar a manner as any of the inhabitants and wonderfully delighted himself in visiting the shops particularly those which sold herbs and fruit where he was always well received excepting only by a couple of brutal cobblers who dwelt in that quarter these fellows without any reason took offense at the generous creature and had once or twice attempted to wound his proboscis with their awls the noble animal who knew it was beneath him to crush them did not disdain to chastise them he filled his large muscular trunk with a considerable quantity of water not the cleanest and advancing to them as usual covered them at once with a dirty flood the fools were laughed at and the vengeance applauded  a noble mastiff being once attacked by a parcel of little yelping curs and scorning to encounter such reptiles contented himself with p  ssing upon them as they crept at his heels  wise men have upon all occasions treated slanderers with contempt diogenes hearing a vociferous assassin of characters exclaiming against plato and charging him with a thousand faults told him with great spirit and justness sir your malice is all thrown away you will no more be believed in speaking evil of him than i should be if i spoke good of you and pelopidas made a very proper answer to some who to curry favor with him impeached certain brave soldiers of having spoke disrespectively of him behind his back it may be said he but you will give me leave to act according to the best evidence i have as for their actions i have been eyewitness of them and as to their words i have only heard what you have been pleased to tell me  we must retain kind and easy thoughts of those my friend who differ in judgment from us especially upon the score of religion to think as far as may be that they do it upon unfeigned conviction of conscience and for the sake gods glory but however we must have a very great care of unchurching whole countries and nations by the blast of one choleric expression  nor are we only obliged to this mental charity which will cost us nothing but to be also liberally charitable and bountiful of those good things god has blessed us with of which there are two principal branches hospitality and alms the apostle does in two places recommend hospitality to the clergy   timothy iii   and titus i   in that early time of the church when the revenues were so miserably small and therefore undoubtedly it is a duty much more incumbent upon us in these ages when we are more amply provided for this has been always looked upon by the heathens as a most generous virtue and the want of it a note of barbarity  axylus hospitable rich and good near fair arisbas walls his native place he held a seat a friend to human race fast by the road his ever open door obliged the wealthy and relieved the poor hom l vi v    in homer s odyss l xv v    there is an admirable rule to be observed in the practice of hospitality  alike he thwarts the hospitable end who drives the free or stays the hasty friend true friendships laws are by this rule expressed welcome the coming speed the parting guest   the doors of the noble roman poplicola were always opened on the outside to save the people the common civility of asking entrance where all were equally admitted where nothing that was reasonable was denied where even misfortune was a powerful recommendation nay i may add where want itself was a powerful mediator and next to merit  to strike a friendless or helpless person the stranger the poor and needy was reckoned a cruel and barbarous action in homers days when ulysses in the disguise of a beggar was struck by artinous the other suitors though represented as profligate persons are shocked at and condemn the action  ill fits the stranger and the poor to wound unblest thy hand if in this low disguise wanders perhaps some inmate of the skies they curious often of mortal actions deign in forms like these to round the earth and main just and unjust recording in their mind hom odyss l    v      the gods revere the poor and stranger are their peculiar care to jove their cause and their revenge belongs he wanders with them and he feels their wrongs hom odyss l   v      the use of hospitality formerly was to entertain chiefly travelers upon the road before the world was generally provided with houses of public entertainment but since its office is to accommodate persons of a lower rank with more grateful provision than their fortunes can attain to to afford a free recourse to decayed persons to eat with us whose condition is not so abject as to take up with a formal alms and with the remainder of our ample provisions to let the poor have a convenient sustenance there are likewise several canons of the church to enforce this liberality but generally our liberal education makes us very seldom defective this way unless it be some few of our order that are sunk to the lowest degree of baseness whom neither gods word nor shame nor the contempt of all good men can work upon  we must likewise to our abilities be charitable to the poor and this is our duty to do in common with other christians but then we have higher obligations to it because we must recommend the doctrines we preach more effectually by our example but chiefly because the endowments of the church do in some measure belong to the poor and for some ages of christianity the poor had a fourth part to their share of the ecclesiastical revenue  the poor are as it were the orphans of heaven they have a demand on us as well as others for the necessaries of life and besides there is an authority due to distress and as none of human race is above the reach of sorrow so none should be above hearing the voice of it the heathen poet in commending the charity of dido to the trojans spoke like a christian non ignara mali miseris succurrere disco when sharp misery to use an expression of the divine shakespeares has worn a man to the bone when his eyes have lost all their spirit when his hair and beard is become wild and neglected and every muscle of his face expressive of famine and despair when he is so depressed by calamities as not to be able to look upwards or hope for comfort nay unwilling to receive it as if so painful a being was not worth preserving and death the only relief that was truly to be wished for every generous heart must bleed methinks that humanity should be liable to so much woe and wretchedness and there are in the world persons of such great merit such fine qualities reduced to this melancholy circumstance by such a series of strange accidents that one would think they were left by providence on purpose for objects on which the son of fortune should exercise his humanity and virtue and believe me in serving any of these poor unhappy people we would find a more sensible pleasure than can possibly arise from all the monied bliss of bags and coffers the splendor of equipage or the excess of the epicures table  there are some persons indeed who rather choose to fatten as vagrants than sweet away their lives in honest labor and industry and there are others with artificial sores and artificial legs who counterfeit the dress and guise of wretchedness so well that no painter can help them to a circumstance which can heighten the image but these have no right to our charity they are worth no bodys notice but the legislatures and as i think they are a public nuisance mankind has a sort of demand on every magistrate to have it removed out of the way but he must be of a savage nature that would turn such objects of commiseration away with contempt who have the strongest claim for compassion and assistance such as those who are unable to support themselves by any business or employment such as those whose natural pride and modesty will not suffer them to complain who pine in secret without a chance for relief without a friend to assist them or the most distant hope of better days who perhaps are forced to appear gay and smiling in the midst of agony and sit mournful spectators of the profusion of others in trifles which would be a comfortable support and happiness to them such as those who are compelled to throw themselves on the mercy of their fellow creatures and trust entirely to providence for their preservation were there no divine command that enjoined us to look upon these as persons who had a natural right to all we could spare we should beside i think reckon it our highest glory to make them easy  the history of peru assures us that their incas esteemed above all their titles that the highest which called them lovers of the poor a name more glorious than the faelix pius and augustus of the roman emperors which were epithets of flattery deserved by few of them  some of our polite moderns have contracted such a reverse of what we call urbanity or civil manners to the poor that to see or meet a person in distress is offensive the very aspect of one in need is a disturbance to them and they are sure always to hate at first sight this inhumane barbarous savage temper is the immediate opposite to that noble affection which the good eumaeus in homer had for the poor and the helpless stranger  my present labors food and drink procure and more the pleasure to relieve the poor odyss l xv v     my heart has learnt to glow for others good and melt at others woe odyss l xviii v     it is mine with food the hungry to supply and cloth the naked

are the most numerous of any  the poor widow mentioned in holy writ threw her mite into the treasury indeed a small matter in itself but her own want made it a great proof of her charitable disposition retrenching her own subsistence and the necessaries of life to contribute to the relief of the necessities of others  how does st paul magnify the charity of the churches of macedonia   cor viii     in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality for to their power i bear record yea and beyond their power they were willing of themselves  dr hough the late bishop of worcester was actuated by a secret celestial influence to undervalue the splendid encumbrances the overflowings of churchrevenues to diffuse joy and gladness through the tortured anxious soul loaded with affliction to support a falling family to give encouragement to the diligent hand to preserve the portion of the helpless orphan and to raise the head of the aged widow the mourning husband and the unhappy stranger the lowliness the humanity the sweetness of dr houghs temper prompted him daily to exert some noble inclination or other for the service of his fellow creatures and made his superiority in the church not only a blessing to mankind but also the source of innumerable satisfactions an ocean of joys to himself such is the effulgence of the reputation he has left behind him so great the dignity of his charitable character that it may challenge time to consume the trophies it has reared while every monument erected by art or labor must yield to age and moulder into dust  thus much for the moral qualifications which we of the clergy are under an indispensible obligation to practice if we would approve ourselves unto god or our hearers as eloquent divines how a clergyman is to be qualified as to learning etc or that he may be an able speaker or a workman that needs not be ashamed i shall point out to you in our future correspondence  i am dear sir yours etc  letter vi dear sir i shall now touch upon some general qualifications which all that are of the body of the clergy especially in these ages of literature ought to be furnished with and first a moderate skill in philosophy is requisite in our profession logic i think is undeniably necessary for every one who pretends to learning and skill in the arrangement and disposition of his sentiments or ideas and if we would become masters of fine reasoning we must not only apply ourselves closely to the study of logic but also take care that the aristotelian authors we read be of the right sort this country never produced a more modest useful or entertaining one to begin with in my opinion than dr watts he steers to the coasts of this kind of philosophy with as much caution as if he was afraid of splitting upon the rock of some unwarrantable desire and what i reckon is very much to his praise he never grows trifling or troubles us with what is of no importance and has this excellency beside which few authors of this rank have he writes in a manner that is very taking and intelligible to young gentlemen and furnishes them with all the necessary materials for their improvement  i have always thought that logic would go down more glibly with most of our young students especially in some colleges if they were not crammed so much with it i am sensible it would suit more with their inclinations and they would not so often mutiny and declare war against venerable crackenthorp and burgesdicious a man who has a genius and whose profession should lead him to the study of divinity should not methinks spend so much of his time in altercation as they do who grow gray almost in studying the wiles and subtilties of it but as to this matter i resign my judgment with entire condescension to my superiors i shall only add that to me there appears to be a great deal of difference between the practice of aristotle and our modern schoolmen he by the same mental eye with which he took in the power and quality of every object in nature likewise surveyed the properties of eloquence which at the same time had but a second place in his esteem but the others who are such dear lovers of disputation dwell almost upon that single province they want the prudence and good sense of aristotle though in this single point they outdo him in practice and application  mr vide ocilvys description of asia etc fol edit p  0 ocilvy in his description of persia tells us that the persians have all aristotles works translated into arabic and call him danja piala that is the cup of the world for as we may use the cup to refresh ourselves so we may likewise to inebriation so according to their opinion we may use and misuse philosophy for they say that strong liquor and philosophy make good orators but excess of both makes wise men fools  a moderate skill in ethics and the vulgar metaphysics physiology and the mathematics is also requisite dear sir in our profession  morality gives a rationale a demonstrative rectitude or pravity of the virtues and vices we are speaking to it adds a mighty gust especially to those of a philosophical palate which a bare scripturereasoning has no effect upon the vulgar metaphysics is essential to divinity as it is handled in later ages without some portion of it we cannot be able to dispute or write or talk divinity in proper terms physiology and the mathematics seem the most remote from our profession and yet we may see of what consequence they are to divinity from reading mr boyles lectures how strong how forcible is truth physically and mathematically demonstrated how guarded and fortified is our religion on all hands how keen and poignant is every argument cutting and mauling the adversary and driving him out of all his entrenchments the most copious and solid the most compact and nervous preachers which this nation ever had were some of the writers of these lectures  there is also this advantage arising from physical and mathematical knowledge besides that of clearing up a mans thoughts and giving him a just taste of right and wrong reasoning it makes the human mind generally sensible of its own worth and excellence and perceive that it is intimately allied to that of the divinity which must afford it a ravishing satisfaction the very reflection upon the power and nature of god makes a good man emulous of imitating his divine perfections neither does he think that he is placed here as an idle spectator when he observes the dependence of the parts of each system of the creation and of the several systems upon one another and how they all contribute to proclaim the wisdom of that almighty being that gave them existence  how does such a genius as vicar of farrington in hampshire etc and fellow of the royal society dr hales break forth from amidst the darkness that involves human understanding he appears like one of another species the plan of this habitable globe lies open to him he seems not unacquainted with the general laws that govern it and while with the transport of a philosopher he beholds and admires the glorious work he is capable of paying at once a more devout and rational homage to his maker his example methinks should inspire us with a generous ambition should engage us to endeavor to improve our faculties and to exercise them conformable to the rank we now hold among reasonable beings and the hope we have of being one day advanced to a more exalted station  we of this profession ought also to be qualified with a considerable knowledge in the holy scriptures our blessed lord gives it as a command to all men to search the john v    scriptures and st paul tells timothy   timothy iii    that the scriptures are only able to make him wise unto salvation we see how excellently learned all the apostles were this way whilst they neglected the use of other literature which is abundantly sufficient to show that we of the clergy ought to make the study of the scriptures our chiefest concern it is requisite therefore for us to be competent masters of the phraseology of scripture to be able to express divine truths in scriptureterms thereby to avoid the frequent mistakes which are incident to human expressions and to raise the affections and warm the hearts of devout christians which this eloquence does infinitely beyond all the little arts of a profane rhetoric we must study the scriptures to be able to allege apposite examples from thence of the truths we are enforcing and to bring proofs and assertions of the same truths out of the sacred oracles which to good men are more undeniable than all the demonstrations of reason we must study the scriptures to be able to understand some difficult passages therein which are apt to lie uneasy upon our minds till we have discovered the sense of them which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest to their own destruction and which persons under our care are often wont to ask our information in we must also study them to be able to understand the types and prophecies of our blessed savior to see how those formerly unintelligible ceremonies of the law are but expiatory rites and receive their full completion in the great sacrifice of the son of god how all the dusky prophesies clear up and concenter in him what a world of strange fortuitous events hit in and conspire together to make out the predictions concerning him it is requisite that we should study the scripture that we may be masters of its chronology which alone of all other history affords the firm grounds to that art to be able to defend it against or reconcile it with the oppositions of profane authors and lastly that we may be able to solve those seeming contradictions which atheistical men pick up in it to expose its credit and as an assistance to do this the better we must have a competent skill in the greek and hebrew languages which these holy books were wrote in to consider the words and construction of the original text and what variation the common interpreters do make from it to find the use of those and other synonimous words in other places to consider the particular idioms metaphors transitions etc in these languages and by this means oftentimes a very mean knowledge in those tongues may give a good and true interpretation of a place which has been blunderd upon by very great critics  we ought likewise to have a complete knowledge in controversial divinity besides the controversies which we are to manage with atheists and infidels by reason of the woeful divisions of christianity which is crumbled into so many sects it is the duty of our order to maintain the truth against so many erroneous opposers there are some of these that strike at the very fundamentals of religion and the main articles of faith such as are chiefly the socinians and papists others that entertain very erroneous opinions concerning the discipline and government of the church as the anabaptists independents and presbyterians now it is requisite we should have an insight into all these controversies to be able to answer all the objections which such men bring against our religion to confute their opinions with arguments either brought from scripture reason or antiquity or all of them to know what cavils and exceptions they raise against the arguments of our divines and to prove upon them the invalidity of such replies to show what fallacious and jejune interpretations they put upon scripture and what distortions and falsifications they use toward ancient writers  thus we must be every way prepared for our defense and have every weapon ready to enter the lists with them and then when we are attacked we cannot be thrown into any confusion or perplexity by their grimace and tone which i have always observed are mighty helps to dullness and are frequently made use of by dull fellows of all persuasions  but though nothing can be so necessary as to have always ready those arms which at the same time can discover every controversial quirk and defend us from those who would entangle us in the snares of their questionary debates yet whenever we have occasion to speak of god or his attributes we ought to be inwardly affected and in our outward expressions appear to be so with the unmeasurable distance there is between a most perfect and omnipotent creator and a mere impotent creature it is not without some indignation as well as astonishment that i see some among us who little considering what god is and what they themselves are presume to talk of him and his attributes as freely and unpremeditately as if they were talking of a geometrical figure or a mechanical engine so that the least presumptuous discourse of the nature and perfections of that unparalled being as if they were objects their intellects can grasp and scruple not to dogmatise about those abstruse subjects as freely as about other things that are confessedly within the reach of human reason or perhaps are to be found among the more familiar objects of sense  how often do we hear mr puzzle even from the pulpit discourse of god and his attributes as if he comprehended the height the breadth and depth of his wisdom and knew the extent of his greatness and power and all his perfections with an air of confidence he tells us of such and such things being consistent or inconsistent with the deity how he is under such and such a necessity as if he were of the cabinetcouncil of the king of kings if mr puzzle is not too wise in his own conceit to consult his bible he will there see how vain and foolish and presumptuous it is to be engaged in such deep researches the secret things belong unto the lord but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever that we may do all the words of this law is the reflection of moses when i applied mine heart to know wisdom says the wise man and to see the business done upon the earth then i beheld all the work of god that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun because though a man labor to seek it out yet he shall not find it yea further though a wise man think to know it yet shall he not be able to find it  seek not out the things says the wise son of sirack that are too hard for thee neither search the things that are above thy strength but what is commanded thee think thereupon with reverence for it is not needful for thee to see with thine eyes the things that are in secret be not curious in unnecessary matters for more things are shown unto thee than men understand for many are deveivd by their own vain opinion and an evil suspicion has overthrown their judgment can thou says job by searching find out god can thou find out the almighty to perfection it is as high as heaven what can thou do deeper than hell what can thou know  the fallen angels are described by milton in his paradise lost as touched with a curiosity like mr puzzles of discovering the measures of the divine economy amidst the horror and melancholy they were in and unable to find out either the antecedents or the consequents the beginning or the end of it  others apart sat on a hill retired in thoughts more elevate and reasoned high of providence foreknowledge will and fate fixed fate free will foreknowledge absolute and found no end in wandering mazes lost however mr puzzle may please himself with an opinion of his own wisdom he cannot with all his boasted reason account for the ways of nature even for the meanest of her productions can he tell me why the violet is arrayed in purple why the sunflower glows wiih yellow and the lilly appears in white can he so much as form a conjecture by what surprising chemistry nature from the same soil extracts the delicious but different juices of innumerable sorts of fruits can he even tell me how the apple and cherry become round the pear and fig oblong how the walnut acquires a shell that is broke with difficulty whilst the mulberry growing near it has a skin so tender that it scarce endures the touch can he tell me why grapes hang in clusters why some fruits on aspiring lofty trees some on bushes and others on the ground if these things which seem so trifling are beyond the reach of human understanding how great must be mr puzzles folly assurance and presumption when he takes upon him to comprehend the ways and dispensations of the almighty and insolently dares pretend to know the extent of his wisdom and power and his other glorious perfections this is more than an honest heathen durst do who thought our words ought to be few and those becoming the tardy apprehensions of men concerning the wise dispositions of providence and the perfections of an omnipotent creator  sicut aeguum est homini de potestate deorum timide et pauca dicannus  cic orat pro lege manilia we ought to have my friend a moderate insight into casuistical points we that have undertaken the pastoral charge have frequently under our care heedless persons that will run unadvisedly into sin which they do not know to be such and scrupulous persons who forbear many good and innocent actions for fear of offending or whose consciences trouble them when they have committed them therefore it is requisite we should in some measure be conversant in casuistical divinity to be able to understand how circumstances create or improve the pravity or goodness of moral actions what are the exact boundaries of vice and virtue by what manner sins are aggravated or mitigated how obligations are made confirmed or vacated how far oaths are obligatory and in what sense imposed and taken how far it is lawful to comply with superior authority and for the sake of peace and union these things we ought to be able readily to determine for the sake of those who may frequently be supposed to seek advice from us  we must also have a competent knowledge in ecclesiastical history and the writings of the fathers we who are the defenders of the faith ought to know how it has been delivered down to us what opposition has been made against it by scepticks and how it has been defended by the orthodox what afflictions have happened to the church by persecuting emperors and what privileges it has gained by the pious and religious what great and holy bishops have graced their respective sees by their learning wisdom and piety and how many others have been the torment of their dioceses and the pest of the church we must be conversant likewise in the diverse councils of the several ages to see with what alacrity those holy fathers came from all parts of the world to defend their religion and to give an account of their traditionary faith in their respective districts down from the apostolical times what a pious zeal they showed and what learned speeches they made against the heretical innovations what excellent explications of faith they formed and what admirable canons and laws of the church we must carefully study the writings of the ancient fathers especially the apologetical polemical and practical to know what admirable vindications of christianity they made against the malicious imputationss of the pagans how by a wonderful strength of reason and learning they overturned the very foundation of the ethnic theology made the doctrine of the cross triumph over all the glories of this world and even bore down the heathens by the force of their own rhetoric to see the heresies of the valintinians manichees arians and others perfectly struck through with the pens of these admirable writers and lastly to find in their practical tracts such a force and such a warmth as is inimitable in these later ages that one may plainly have a taste of the very souls of these good men in their writings  i am dear sir yours etc  letter vii dear sir we of this profession must endeavor to make ourselves masters of a nervous sweet and musical style for it is not enough that we are barely heard but we must temper our thoughts with the softest harmony of words that we may convince the reason and move the passions of our hearers vide longin sect    harmonious composition has not only a natural tendency to please and to persuade but inspires an audience to a wonderful degree with generous ardour and passion fine notes in music have a surprising effect on the passions of men do they not fill the breast with an inspired warmth and lift the heart into heavenly transport the very limbs receive motion from the notes and the hearer though he has no skill at all in music is sensible however that all its turns make a strong impression on his body and mind the sounds of any musical instrument are in themselves insignificant yet by the changes of the air the agreement of the chords and symphony of the parts they give extraordinary pleasure as we daily experience to the minds of an audience yet these are only spurious images and faint imitations of the persuasive voice of man and far from the genuine effects and operations of human nature  what an opinion therefore may we justly form of fine composition the effect of that harmony which nature has implanted in the voice of man does it not by an elegant structure and marshalling of sounds convey the passions of the speaker into the breasts of his audience does it not seize their attention and by framing an edifice of words to suit the sublimity of thoughts delight and transport and raise those ideas of dignity and grandeur in others which it shares itself  it is the judgment of the cicero de orat lib   roman orator that to use ones self much to reading and writing is the only way in the world to arrive at a perfection and grace of style we must therefore carefully read the best authors and hear with the utmost attention the most celebrated preachers and be as studious of observing the beauties of a charming discourse as a florist would the colors of a fine auricula or a botanist the form of a curious plant all this i confess is very troublesome but give me the genius that is thus exercised this is the soil that eloquence will thrive and flourish in as a tree that is a good bearer shoots out into expressions of kindness and bends beneath its own precious load to the hand of the gatherer when the ground about it is meliorated and enriched with culture so the eloquence of a cultivated genius will immediately break out into swanlike music and flow from his lips with such delicious sweetness as to fill his audience with melody and rapture  horace that great judge of fine writing bids us place before our eyes the great polite ancients of athens as mirrors and exemplars to form to elevate and enoble our style and sentiments by   vos exemplaria graeca nocturna versate manu versate diurna this my friend must be our ambition this should be the fixed and lasting scope of all our labors we must spare no pains to educate our style and thoughts to grandeur and impregnate them with the noble language and generous ideas of others that our own compositions may receive a kind of beautiful glow and flavor from theirs  nor is an imitation of the finest pieces or copying out those bright originals of athens or rome or our own or neighboring nations to be looked upon as plagiarism but as consistent with the nicest honor was not i used says cicero to translate a book of platos and zenophons by which i acquired this advantage that in rendering the greek i had read over into latin i not only fell upon the most elegant and yet the most usual expressions but was in the course of my translations led into an imitation of their manner and to introduce some new words into the language of my countrymen which i took care should be just and apropo vid cicero de orat lib   cicero the imitator of zenophon and plato was not longin sect    herodotus the constant imitator of homer did not stesichorus was inventor of the lyrick chorus he was born according to suidas in the   th olympiad if he had kept within due bounds says quinctilian he seems to have been able to come the nearest to a rivalship with homer vid quinctil instit   stesichorus and archilochus imitate him more than herodotus and did not it was a common report in the age that plato lived in that bees dropped honey on his lips as he lay in the cradle and it is said that the night before he was placed under the tuition of socrates the philosopher dreamed he had embraced a young swan in his bosom who after his feathers were fullgrown stretched out his wings and soared to an immense height in the air singing all the time with an inexpressible sweetness this shows at least what a great opinion they then entertained of his eloquence since they thought its appearance worthy to be ushered into the world with omens and prognostics plato more than all of them who from the copious homerick fountain has drawn a thousand rivulets to cherish and improve his own productions homer had engrossed the admiration of the learned world and wore the laurels without a rival the divine plato therefore was inspired with a noble emulation to contend the prize with him and though he did not succeed in his own way yet he had noble success in another for the style of his prose has a poetical sweetness majesty and elevation and he is justly esteemed the homer of philosophers the roman orator was so great an admirer of him that he said if jupiter conversed with men he would talk in the language of plato  a greater prize than the glory and renown of the celebrated ancients and moders can never be contended for where victory crowns with neverdying applause when even a defeat in such a competition is attended with honor and advantage plato in all probability had never written so smoothly delicately and poetically and with the nicest decoration had not his godlike spirit carried him forwards in the noblest career to the imitation of homer neither do i think that cicero had ever been the sovereign of forensian pleading or that his eloquence had been so exquisitely and beautifully finished had he not like a youthful champion been ambitious of entering the lists with the greeks and by applying himself entirely to the imitation of those excellent models united in his manner the force of demosthenes the delicious copiousness of plato the sweetness of isocrates and the divine simplicity of zenophon by this means he so fertilizd his genius that his eloquence seems to pour itself forth not like the streams of a little rivulet but the rapidity of a flood  if dear sir men of our profession were but inspired with an ambition and thirst of excelling one another in the arts of fine composition or emulous of imitating the style and manner of the best writers this nation affords their reasoning would be much closer their style more harmonious and agreeable to the ear and their sentiments have more of the spirit and flavor of divinity it is evident that some in their sermons rather than take pains make use of sordid and blemished terms others again curtail and mince their periods and a third fort shamefully spin them out into a vast extent whereby their life and spirit evaporate and all their strength is lost by being quite overstretchd numerous instances might be produced to prove this out of modern sermons published by men of no small note and very sober understandings  that a judicious vid longin sect  0 choice of proper and magnificent terms has wonderful effects in winning upon and entertaining an audience cannot i think be denied for it is from hence that the greatest writers derive with indefatigable care the grandeur the beauty the solemnity the weight the strength and the energy of their expressions this clothes a composition in the most beautiful dress makes it shine like a picture in all the gaiety of color and in a word it animates our thoughts and inspires them with a kind of vocal life but though fine words are indeed the peculiar light in which our thoughts must shine yet they should not every where swell and look big for vulgar terms are sometimes much more significant than the most ornamental can possibly be they are easily understood because borrowed from common life and what is most familiar to us soonest engages our belief some writers very frequently make use of common and vulgar terms that have not the least air of elegance to recommend them yet by musically disposing and artfully connecting such terms they cloth their periods in a kind of pomp and exaltation and dexterously conceal their intrinsic lowness  it is observable that some of our modern preachers are more happy in the style than in the sentiments of their sermons their language is very often noble and sonorous but the sense either very trifling or else so obscured by the sounding phrases hard metaphors and forced expressions in which it is clothed that it is difficult to find it out for my part i should prefer a noble sentiment that is depressed with homely language infinitely before a vulgar one that is blown up with all the sound and pomp of expression sublime thoughts either by means of a great affinity they bear to the springs and movements of our souls or by their own superlative luster always outshine the artifices of rhetoric whose appearance they cover with a veil of superior beauties for as the stars are quite dimmed and obscured when the sun breaks out in all its blazing rays so pompous phrases and towering lofty expressions are entirely overshadowed by the superior splendour of noble sentiments  to the formation of a style our reading and imitation if they be of the right sort must principally contribute whatever sermons we hear or however polite and agreeable their characters may be who preach them if the authors we read or imitate are of another kind we shall find our palate strangely turned their way we are unhappier in this respect for being scholars and imitators if our studies and patterns be ill chosen nor can i for this reason think it proper to call a man wellread who reads and imitates many authors since he must of necessity have more ill models than good and be more stuffed with bombast ill fancy and wry thought than filled with solid sense and just imagination  though to pass a right judgment upon compositions is generally the effect of a long experience and the last improvement of study and observation yet since you request it i shall give you my opinion concerning as many authors in our profession as i think it needful for you to read at present and you may single out which you please for your imitation  if you would have your understanding charmed your affections captivated and your passions directed and restrained by the powers of rhetoric you must read dr tillotson there is gracefulness there is strength there is spirit there is dignity in all he says such a divine power and energy i think never displayed itself in so easy and genteel a flow and command of sentiment and expression as the sermons of this excellent prelate  dr south has brought in a species of eloquence in his sermons that is almost peculiar to himself and rarely to be met with among our divines he abounds with turns of wit which are inexpressibly fine and is prodigiously dextrous at irony or sneer his strokes of raillery are vastly genteel apposite and proper in matters of controversy with what humor does he ridicule his adversaries and with what dexterity does he sting in the midst of a smile how skilful at managing an argument wit is not excluded by the importance of the subject nor its weight lessened by the humor  dr scots book of the christian life is admirably well written wherein we meet with the simple language of truth which though unadorned and without pomp is pure and perspicuous  there are lively strokes of passion and numerous beauties in archbishop of york dr sharps sermons such as show the inherent greatness of his soul he strikes with powerful might at the adversaries of our religion is enflamed with a servent and yet peaceable vehemence and ardour his style particularly excells in smoothness and an easy and peaceable flow of the words and yet it has such an elevation as to excite an extraordinary emotion in those especially who are to be brought over by soft and gentle insinuation  bishop pearsons book on the creed is a complete and delicate performance though he launches out into the depths of divinity and soars to the sublimest eminence yet he never drops like many others unfortunately down but still preserves his own intrinsic grandeur his arguments run rapidly along immediately strike the imagination inflame us with the warmth and fire of his own genius and carry all before them by the weight and solemnity of thought and expression  there is something extraordinary something more than humanly great in dr atterburys sermons and for this reason has the inimitable and godlike mr pope unmoved by partiality and unbiased by envy awarded the laurels to this great author which flourish still green and will flourish as long as the name of pope has an harmonious sound to an english ear to write in a language that is graceful and proper that is distinguished by certain masterly touches and an artful polish that would have shone in the days of attick elegance is the peculiar character of dr atterbury  in passing their judgment of dr clarks sermons men commonly muster his imperfections so that the remembrance of his faults sticks indelibly in their minds and that of his excellencies is quickly worn out for my part though i cannot by any means be blind or partial to his faults i have always thought that his sermons are very grand and beautiful compositions not like those of a low and groveling genius who never endangers himself by aiming at grandeur but still goes on in the same uniform secure track the whole universe is scarce sufficient for the extensive reach and piercing speculation of dr clarks understanding his lofty genius is frequently aspiring to prodigious and amazing heights which expose him to sudden falls and such falls sometimes work the good of men and besides in the judgment of the best critics what is truly grand in the midst of some faults is preferable to that which has nothing extraordinary in its best parts correct however throughout and faultless  for a smooth and polite style mr seed is very much admired that theology of the schools which he found undowerd as it were unattended and in a dishabille he has enriched with all the wealth the pride and ornament of language he gives us some fine similies and allusions which were they not too much by too eager a pursuit of elegance says longinus a subject becomes dry and insipid and those persons continues he commonly fail in this particular who by an ill managed zeal for a neat correct and above all a sweet style are hurried into a heavy nauseous affectation vid longin sect     crowded would be very taking and agreeable like stars they would cast a kind of blaze about them they would illuminate and give a luster to his sermons  there are very few geniuss that write more gracefully or copiously than the present bishop of oxford dr secker and he has this peculiar talent that besides an extraordinary gravity a spirit of benevolence and cheerfulness glows in his compositions which gives them a matchless dignity not only persuades but even throws an audience into transport  i do not know of an author that meets with more general applause than archdeacon of carlisle mr law persons of different humors ages professions and inclinations all agree in the same joint approbation of his writings which union of assent gives them an indisputable title to our esteem  when you have a competent share of acquired as well as natural taste my friend you may easily discover the value of any performance yourself from a bare recital of it for if it is intrinsically good the mind is naturally elevated by it and so sensibly affected with its lively strokes that it swells with transport and an inward pride as if what had been only heard had been the product of its own invention but if we find that it transports not the soul nor exalts our thoughts that it calls not up into our minds ideas more enlarged than what the mere sound of the words convey but on attentive examination its dignity lessens and declines we may conclude that whatever pierces no deeper than the ears can never deserve our applause or imitation  these few authors i have named to you according to their time and age have provided us with the richest ore to their eternal honor they have attempted to throw off the horrid discord of antiquated prose false grandeur impotence and puerility of sentiments they have happily broken the ice for those who are to follow them and who treading in their footsteps may at leisure heighten and polish the english language lead the ear and understanding to finer pleasure and find out the true permanent harmonious idiom which alone can satisfy a just judgment and godlike apprehension  whenever we are engaged in compositions of the genteeler kind such as require grandeur of style and exalted sentiments it will then be of excellent use to raise in ourselves such reflections as these  how in this case would dr tillotson or dr south have raised their thoughts  how would dr sharp dr pearson or dr atterbury for these celebrated preachers being proposed by us for our pattern and imitation will in some degree lift up our souls to the standard of their own genius it will be yet of greater use if to the preceding reflections we add these  what would dr secker or mr law think of this piece or what judgment would they pass upon it how would they have expressed themselves it is really a noble enterprise to frame such a theater and tribunal to sit on our own compositions and submit them to a scrutiny in which such eminent writers must preside as our judges and be at the same time our evidence by this method we must inevitably arrive at such a perfection of style as to be able to give the english language its due muscling as the painters say of a good piece its due body and proportion and also the natural ornaments of correctness simplicity and grace  but of this more in my next letter  i am dear sir yours etc  letter viii dear sir to give majesty sweetness politeness to a discourse to make it strike to give it the finishing touches of eloquence to work it up with as much of the pathetick as is needful we must have a moderate skill in poetry a man must be so much of a poet at least as to be able to diversify his style with the finest flowers of sentiment and expression but they must not run through the whole of a discourse but only such particular places as that they may serve like jewels and distinctions in dress for the finical ornaments of a discourse and a continued affectation of excellence gives disgust it is not only unpleasant to the ear but also to the intellectual faculties the same observation holds as to our other senses we are less pleased with those flowers and plants that have too high a perfume and fragrance than those that have but a moderate scent and one would rather choose to smell at the rose than the muskcranesbill even in the handling fruit there is a degree of softness and smoothness so a sermon or discourse if it has an undiversifyd heightning and embellishment of style affords no lasting pleasure besides if it have all the advantage of poetical coloring it ought to have some shade that that which is illuminated may cast a greater luster  if we would embellish our style by the substance as it were and groundcolouring of poetical sublimity and grandeur we must apply ourselves diligently to the study of the holy scriptures it would be worth our while to digest them so in our minds as to have them almost by heart for we should have both nobler sentiments and expressions if we applied sacred to profane eloquence  the effect and beauty of sacred poetry you will perceive in some measure though imperfectly from the two following specimens i have chose the pathetick kind and studied to represent the amiableness of virtue by such foils and contrarieties as david the man after gods own heart furnishes us with and which serve as graces if i may so speak in poetical limning and render this music of the passions more seraphick powerful and enchanting had this been attempted by some abler hand you would have been led with delight and rapture anxiety and concern by turns through the labyrinth of the affections and interested whether you would or no in the passions of the royal penitent and in the exhortation annexed you would presently have understood the reality of those charms in the sacred writings which by my weak endeavors perhaps you will imagine not to be half so commanding natural and so powerful or capable of pleasing a judicious polite ear and muselike understanding  the royal penitent etc a sacred poem  the royal penitent or human frailty delineated in the person of david a sacred poem   delirant reges

appearance of a specious ill pursued with labor purchased with deceit enjoyed with shame and finished with regret nor end the evils of the crime therein lusts but the threshold to the gates of sin this well thou know for thou have found it lead to the invasion of the nuptial bed the base deception of the fraudful word and the friend murdered by the hostile sword for this the insatiate sword

unbelieving foes since pleas for vice the libertine may bring from this excess of judahs fav rite king die shall the offspring of the adultrous womb fixed is his fate and unreversd the doom thus spoke

rebellious son yet in the anguish of a father sad with ashes sprinkled and with sackcloth clad should grieve the conquest that his death must cost and all the rebel in the son be lost farther he saw him destined to sustain a deeper anguish and a keener pain when summoned by the unrelenting seer to the sad choice of famine plague or war how each keen arrow from the almightys bow should pierce his soul with the severest woe while gasping he surveys on every side the guiltless thousands for the monarchs pride oppressed with grief he saw his hoary age by adonijahs plot and factious rage and even in death transmitting with his crown invidious vengeance to his favorite son these he foresaw yet wisely these suppressed safe in the close recesses of his breast for heaven in pity to our state

and home returned while david in the expiring child beheld the sad predictions of the seer fulfilled apart in bitterness of soul he sat and his repentance as his crime was great by his example warned may we beware of tempting vice and shun the fatal snare or by the frailty of our passions led atone with sorrow for the loathed misdeed on each offense a sad remembrance cast and mend the future as we mourn the past the royal penitents exhortation  the exhortation of the royal penitent  a sacred poem  being a paraphrase on psalm cvii  the royal penitents exhortation how gracious and how great the heavenly king in praises endless as his mercy sing sing they his praise who rescued by his hand from hostile nations sought an happy land from distant realms the numerous wandrers joined some left the north and some the south behind or from the east began their tedious way or lands that last enjoy departing day long did they wander with erroneous toil through the blind mazes of a desartsoil no city there the weary troops received no food refreshed no grateful drink relieved taught by distress from god they seek release he hears their prayers he bids their sufferings cease leads them in safety to their wished repose and in a city terminates their woes sing then his praise ye sons of earth proclaim your god your maker your delivrers fame with heavenly goodness bountiful he feeds the famished soul that his assistance needs such as in misery and in fetters bound the shades of death and darksome night surround because their gods indulgence they abused slighted his counsels and his laws refused till angry justice destined them to bear helpless the heavy miseries of war their god they sought when humbled and enslaved he heard forgave he pitied and he saved sing then his praise ye sons of earth proclaim your god your maker your delivrers fame not gates of brass can his commands restrain and bars of iron are opposed in vain in vain diseases all their terrors bring a contrite heart disarms the grizly king the vengeance deprecates that folly drew the god appeases and averts the woe sing then his praise ye sons of earth proclaim your god your maker your delivrers fame the original is  they that go down to the sea in ships that do business in great waters  these see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep  for he commands and raises the stormy wind which lifts up the waves thereof  they mount up to the heaven they go down again to the depths their soul is melted because of trouble  they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wits end  then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he brings them out of their distress  he makes the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are still  then are they glad because they be quiet so he brings them unto their desired haven  this single passage runs in a higher vein of sublimity and has more spirit in it than all the applauded descriptions of the authors of antiquity put together because when the tempest is in all its rage and fury and the danger become extreme almighty power is introduced to calm at once the bellowing ocean and give preservation to the miserable distressed it ends in that fervency of devotion which such grand occurrences are sitted to raise in the human mind be that their song who in pursuit of gain over the wide watery waste their course maintain when storms at the almightys word begin and threatening death from every surge is seen high over the ridge of some vast wave they go and view all ghastly pale the depths below then stooping down the steep descent they dread enormous mountains swelling over their head unfixd their steps but more confined their mind till to devotion from despair inclined and timely wise upon their god they call hushed are the winds the boisterous billows fall and friendly gales the shattered bark convey over the smooth waters of a peaceful sea sing then his praise ye sons of earth proclaim your god your maker your delivrers fame him let the tribes him let the elders praise with joyous gratitude and tuneful lays powerful with drought the watery meads to spoil and curse with barrenness the fertile soil or pleased to bid new rivers take their course through the waste desert from a rocky source here he commands the hungry to reside erect a city and new domes provide to till the ground the generous vine to plant and blessed with plenty to forget their want joyful to see their offspring numerous grow whilst thriving herds over all the valleys low or when he gives them up to grief a prey and haughty tyrants more oppressive sway them through wild deserts he permits to roam but brings the poor afflicted wretches home supply their wants and settles them in peace and bids their households like their flocks increase the just with joy shall view this heavenly care the sinner shall be struct with silent fear reflection to the wise it shall afford and conscious virtue own a gracious lord in the sacred writings my friend poetry has a finished excellence and rhetoric a majestic flow where did eloquence ever ride in more glory and splendor than in the royal psalmists descriptions of the greatness and power of the almighty with what loftiness and sublimity of diction does he paint the mavelous workings of divine providence where do we read such strange risings and fallings now the faintings and languishings now the terrors and astonishments of despair venting themselves in such high amazing strains as in the   st psalm mr dean of armagh daniels paraphrase of it is extremely beautiful part of which runs thus  great god with conscious blushes lo i come to cry for pardon or receive my doom but oh i die when i thine anger meet prostrate i lay my body at thy feet how can i dare to ask for a reprieve must i still sin and will my god forgive thy justice cannot let thy mercy flow strike then oh strike and give the deadly blow do i still live and do i live to prove the inexhausted tokens of thy love this unexampled goodness wounds me more than even the wrath i merited before oh i am all a blot the foulest shame has stained my scepter and disgraced my name a name which once i could with honor boast but now the father of his peoples lost though darkly thy mysterious prophet spoke while from his lips the fatal message brake fixed and amazed i stood confounded whole too soon his dreadful meaning reach my soul thou art the man  has fixed a deadly smart thou art the man  lies throbbing at my heart i am  whatever thine anger can express nor can my sorrow make my follies less raised and exalted to the first degree thy heavenly will had made the monarch free the fond restraint of man i scorned to own but grasped the full possession of a crown indulged in ease i ruled without control and to its utmost wish enjoyed my soul vain boast of power which vanished into air since i forgot the lord who placed me there was it for this thou gave the glorious land and thy own flock committed to my hand was i the shepherd to go first astray till innocence itself became a prey ah no the fault was mine i stand alone be thine the praise who placed me on the throne the guilt the folly and the shame my own how vile must i appear how lost a thing the worst of tyrants and no more a king o do not thou my abject state despise but let my soul find favor in thine eyes whenever the horrid deed i backward trace my soul rolls inward and forgets her peace waking i dream and in the silent night a frightful vision stalks before my sight the pale uriah walks his dreadful round he shakes his head and points to every wound o foul disgrace to arms who now will go to fight my battles and repel the foe unhurt the coward may to ages stand the brave alone can die by my command oh hold my brain to wild distraction wrought i will not cannot bear the painful thought oh do not fly me for thy mercys sake turn thee oh turn and hear the wretched speak even selfcondemned thy kneeling servant save and raise a drooping sinner from the grave speak mighty god and bid thy servant live let my charmed ears but hear the word  forgive my joyful muse shall bear the tidings round while listening worlds shall catch the grateful sound thus other sinners shall obedient prove and taught by me shall wonder at thy love but oh if stricter justice must be done if my relentless fate comes driving on i stand the mark whatever is decreed be israel safe but let its monarch bleed on me on me thy utmost vengeance take but spare my people for thy mercys sake oh let jerusalem to ages stand build thou her walls and spread her wide command so shall thy name for ever be adored and future worlds like me shall bless the lord   in every page of the royal psalmists compositions there are such pathetick and exalted expressions of fear and love hope and trust and delight in the deity that it is no wonder if such a genuine and sub lime penitence was able to cover a multitude of sins in the closet he seems to be something more indeed than man his prayers are offered with that fervency of zeal that they are like the incense of an angel or saint in glory  what song of triumph was ever writ in higher or more exalted strains than that of give ear o ye heavens says he and i will speak and hear o earth the word of my mouth  my doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distill as the dew as the small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers upon the grass  because i will publish the name of the lord ascribe ye greatness unto our god  he is the rock his rock is perfect for all his ways are judgment a god of truth and without iniquity just and right is he  they have corrupted themselves their spot is not the spot of his children they are a perverse and crooked generation  do ye thus requite the lord o foolish people and unwise is he not thy father that has bought thee has he not made thee and established thee  remember the days of old consider the years of many generations ask thy father and he will show thee thy elders and they will tell thee  when the most high divided to the nations their inheritance when he separated the sons of adam he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of israel  for the lords portion is his people jacob is the lot of his inheritance  he found him in a desert land and in the waste howling wilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye  as an eagle stirs up her nest fluttereth over her young spreads abroad her wings takes them bears them on her wings  so the lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him  he made him ride on the high places of the earth that he might eat the increase of the fields and he made him to suck honey out of the rock and oil out of the flinty rock  butter of kine and milk of sheep with fat of lambs and rams of the breed of bashan and goats with the fat of kidneys of wheat and thou did drink the pure blood of the grape etc moses  how does he accustom us to mount along with him to heroic grandeur when he sets the works of omnipotence in a magnificent light and paints the deity in all his majesty and splendour as in that description of the creation of light and the earthly globe which has been already applauded by vid longin on the sublime part   section   longinus the boileau undertook the defense of this passage and bravely defended it against huet and le clerc who pretended that longinus never saw it though he has actually quoted it and that he never read moses though he has done so exemplary a piece of justice to his merit and left so candid an acknowledgement of it vid boileau s works in four vols   to and mr smith s translation of longinus where he has a note upon this passage   jewish legislator says he having conceived a just idea of the power of god has nobly expressed it in the beginning of his law and god said  what  let there be light and there was light let the earth be and the earth was  can there be more beauty and harmony in numbers than in the song of then sang deborah and barak the son of abinoam on that day saying  praise ye the lord for the avenging of israel when the people willingly offered themselves  hear o ye kings give ear o ye princes i even i will sing unto the lord i will sing praise unto the lord god of israel  lord when thou wentest out of seir when thou marchedst out of the field of edom the earth trembled and the heavens dropped the clouds also dropped water  the mountains melted from before the lord even that sinai from before the lord god of israel  in the days of shamgar the son of anath in the days of joel the highways were unoccupyd and the travelers walked through byways  the inhabitants of the villages ceased they ceased in israel until that i deborah arose that i arose a mother in israel they chose new gods then was war in the gates was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in israel my heart is toward the governors of israel that offered themselves willingly among the people bless ye the lord  speak ye that ride on white asses ye that sit in judgment and walk by the way  they that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the lord even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in israel then shall the people of the lord go down to the gates  awake awake deborah awake awake utter a song arise baruk and lead thy captivity captive thou son of abinoam  then he made him that remains have dominion over the nobles among the people the lord made me have dominion over the mighty  out of ephraim was there a root of them against amaleck after thee benjamin among thy people out of machir came down governors and out of zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer  and the princes of issacar were with deborah even issacar and also barak he was sent on foot into the valley for the divisions of reuben there were great thoughts of heart  why abodest thou among the sheepfolds to hear the bleatings of the flocks for the divisions of reuben there were great searchings of heart  giliad abode beyond jordan and why did dan remain in ships asher continued on the sea shore and abode in his breaches  zebulun and naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field  the kings came and fought then fought the kings of caanan in taanach by the waters of megido they took no gain of money  they fought from heaven the stars in their courses fought against sisera  the river of kishon swept them away that ancient river the river kishon o my soul thou have trodden down strength  then were the horses hooss broken by the means of the prancings the prancings of their mighty ones  curse ye meroz said the angel of the lord curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof because they came not to the help of the lord to the help of the lord against the mighty  blessed above women shall jael the wife of heber the kenite be blessed shall she be above women in the tent  he asked water and she gave him milk she brought forth butter in a lordly dish  she put her hand to the nail and her right hand to the workmans hammer and with the hammer she smote sisera she smote off his head when she had pierced and stricken through his temples  at her feet he bowed he fell he lay down at her feet he bowed he fell where he bowed there he fell down dead  the mother of sisera looked out at a window and cried through the lattess why is his chariot so long in coming why tarry the wheels of his chariots her wise ladies answered her yea she returned answer to herself  have they not sped have they not divided the prey to every man a damsel or two to sisera a prey of diverse colors a prey of diverse colors of needle work of diverse colors of needle work on both sides meet for the necks of them that take the spoil  so let all thine enemies perish o lord but let them that love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his might deborah and baruk  can any thing communicate a more exquisite pleasure to the ear and the understanding than those descriptions of the divine majesty in then answered the lord unto job out of the whirlwind and said  etc  have thou given the horse strength have thou clothed his neck with thunder can thou make him afraid as a grasshopper the glory of his nostrils is terrible  he paweth in the valley and rejoiceth in his strength he goes on to meet the armed men  he mocketh at fear and is not affrighted neither turns he back from the sword  the quiver rattleth against him the glittering spear and the shield  he swalloweth the ground with fierceness and race neither believes he it is the sound of the trumpet  he says among the trumpets ha ha and he smells the battle afar off the thunder of the captains and the shouting   job  where do we find sorrow flowing in such a natural prevailing pathos as in the prophet jeremy one would think that every letter was wrote with a tear every word was the noise of a breaking heart and that the author was one that never breathed but in sighs nor spoke but in a groan  when in turning over the sacred page i read of simeon waiting for and expecting death as weary laborers do the evening shades or the reward of their work when i read st paul with humble impatience expressing his devout desire of death and dissolution i must own my soul glows with desires to die the death of the righteous to breathe itself forth not in a groan but an ejaculation  when the same st paul appears before the corinthians and discourses to them on the resurrection and before his judges festus and agrippa and harangues upon temperance and the day of judgment how full of life and spirit how full of the pathetick is his diction are not his very judges drawn as it were by an engine into compassion and gentleness and made to shudder with fear and trembling by the dignity of the subject and the strength of his arguments agrippa was roused and alarmed and almost persuaded to turn christian this great apostle even in the opinion of there is a strong probability that longinus says his ingenious translator was not only acquainted with the writings of the old testament but with those also of the new since to a manuscript of the latter in the vatican library there is prefixed a passage from some of this authors writings which is preserved there as an instance of his judgment he is drawing up a list of the greatest orators and at the close he says and further paul of tarsus the chief supporter of an opinion not yet established fabricius i own has been so officiously kind in his bieliotheca graeca l   c    as to attribute these words to christian forgery but for what reason i cannot conjecture if for any of real weight and importance certainly he ought not to have concealed them from the world  if longinus ever saw any of the writings of st paul he could not but entertain an high opinion of him such a judge must needs applaud so masterly an orator for where is the writer that can vie with him in sublime and pathetick eloquence demosthenes could rouse up the athenians against philip and cicero strike shame and confusion into the breasts of anthony or cataline and did not the eloquence of st paul though bound in degrading fetters make the oppressive the abandoned felix tremble and almost persuade agrippa in spite of all his prejudice to be a christian homer after his death was looked upon as more than human and temples were erected to his honor and was not st paul admired as a god even whilst he was on earth when the inhabitants of lystra would have sacrificed to him let his writings be examined and judged by the severest test of the severest critics and they cannot be found deficient nay they will appear more abundantly stocked with sublime and pathetick thoughts with strong and beautiful figures with nervous and elegant expressions than any other composition in the world  vid mr smith s preface to his translat of longin p         longinus eminently distinguished himself by his inimitable quickness and sublimity of style  the holy scripture with regard to the divine original and principle of its laws and as to the weight of authority and extent of utility is preferable to all the volumes in the world in the sacred page we are taught not by disputations endless and full of quibbling but by the authority and command of the almighty to hold fast our integrity to subdue our passions to check all our affections to restrain our very thoughts our eyes our hands from all manner of evil the vices the frauds of mankind are threatened to be punished with perdition ignominy with chains with stripes with banishment from the presence of the deity and with eternal death but we see that sincere that just and honest endeavors are to be crowned with honors and rewards glory and immortality the holy scripture in short is above all panegyric it is very truly and emphatically styled by the apostle the gift of god the mother of all eloquence it is not to be equaled either for the flow and copiousness of the expression or the grandeur of the subject by the most eloquent of the heathens every sentence is lofty and sublime and casts as it were a glory round it  i am dear sir yours etc  letter ix dear sir we of this profession ought to have a becoming smoothness of delivery and a lively spirited manner of expression there are some men so harsh so clownish so effeminate in their tone of voice so stuttering so drawling and spiritless in their expression so ungraceful awkward and slovenly in their manner of speaking that they can never be heard discoursing even on the most important subjects with pleasure  and here we may perceive the capital mistake of those who are entrusted with the education of youth they frequently advise parents to breed up their sons to the church without ever consulting their abilities or inclinations the forming of youth was reckoned a matter of that consequence by the polite athenians that the education of their children was under the direction of particular inspectors and censors accountable to the state and indeed it requires the greatest delicacy and strength of mind to perform so difficult and arduous a task as it ought it is exceedingly hard in the beginning especially to pry into the souls of young persons and discover the different bent of genius in each not to say that the dawn of genius is often as flattering as the serenity of an april morning or the bloom of a forward flower seen and admired one moment and lost in the next  a master or tutor ought above all things to have a special attention to the cast of genius with which nature has endowed his pulpils or scholars for we perceive that in the arts the same schools as it were furnish and the same craftsmen and mechanics form scholars in the several arts each unlike the one to the other yet all of them excellent in their kind therefore the tutor or teacher ought to accommodate his manner to the several capacities of youth he must try what becomes them best what lenghts they can go with regard to their voice their strength their lungs and if he finds they have any thing downright averse in their natures for the seize necessary in our profession or any thing shocking in their manner of speaking which the refinements of art and study cannot remedy he should advise them to turn their views to some other way of life and not unmercifully beat and flog out of them as is the practice of but too many the few grains of genius nature has given them an ingenuous mind will sooner be wrought upon by mild treatment than by violence and rigor which rather seem a discharge of the masters spleen and passion than intended for the scholars advantage there is a certain hesitancy and bashfulness in some natures which must not be checked but pushed forward with as much care and diligence as a skilful artist in gardening would the circulation of an exotic plant in his greenhouse or a tree in his orchard that is a bashful bearer severity should never be made use of till all gentler methods have been tried and found unsuccessful then indeed it may be practiced as the ultimate remedy but then too with discretion so as to carry nothing of revenge along with it so as to be no greater than necessity requires and to continue no longer than till it produces either amendment or discovers an utter incapacity for learning  i must own the master is not always to blame for recommending youth that are a little thickskulld have slender parts and slow apprehensions to go into our profession because i believe it is sometimes the parents fault their take a particular liking to it and therefore dee their sons may be of it but in so great so important and weighty an affair of life parents ought to consider the capacities of their children more than their own inclinations yet masters are so far to blame as when they cannot keep their temper and bear the tediousness of learning those with patience who have none of the quickest parts they ought to wait the issue of their hopes however long it may be deferred there are many excellent tempers says an ingenious person which are worthy to be nourished and cultivated with all possible diligence and care that were never designed to be acquainted with aristotle tully or virgil and there are as many who have capacities for understanding every word those great persons have writ and yet were not born to have any relish of their writings such therefore as i intimated before should be sent to some mechanic way of life without respect to their birth if nature designed them for nothing higher for it is no guilt to be an honest plain tradesman or mechanic but before they go to what they have the most natural propensity to let them be allured to habits of virtue and their minds trained to a sense of honor and religion whilst they are in the simplicity of their native innocence full of shame and capable of any impression from that grace of soul and let not the sparks of virtue be extinguished in them for want of patience care and culture the most excellent natures are soon depreciated and spoiled by negligence and impatience and want of proper application to exalt them into good habits  plants and vegetables are cultivated into the production of finer fruit than they would yield without that care natural historians tell us that no fruit grew originally among us besides hips and haws acorns and pignuts with other delicacies of the like nature that our climate of itself and without culture can make no farther advances toward a plumb than to a sloe and carries an apple to no greater perfection than a crab that our melons our peaches our figs our apricocks and cherries are strangers among us imported in different ages and naturalized in our english gardens by culture and that they would all degenerate and fall away into the trash of our own country if they were wholly neglected by the planter and not cultivated but left to the mercy of our sun and soil neither i think can we hope to model a tender conscious spirit into acts of virtue without the same method as is used to improve the vegetable world to cut timber or give new shape to a piece of stone or marble  our modern forward slips of quality put forth nothing but blossoms and continue a kind of overgrown children all their lifetime the reason is young master is not suffered by the fond mamma to be too much plagued with going to school for fear of breaking his spirits making him bookish and so fit for nothing but to make a parson  how do these sparks behave themselves in the prime of life in religion they are generally freethinkers in the worst sense of the word from the want of an early pious education in politics they are slaves to the party whose principles they were brought up in in morals they are loose and above all other evils detest solitude and matrimony the first because it would make them converse with themselves and the latter because it might lead them into the company of a person toward whom they know not how to behave viz that of a modest woman  as to a public or private education it is not yet determined i think which is most eligible sometimes the one and sometimes the other is preferred according to the fancy of people of fine taste as in ancient persia the youth of quality was put to a polite mede for education so the child of distinction about  is happy in having his  for his public or private tutor as young master is only designed for a fine gentleman it would give an unhappy biass to his infantmind to make a good found protestant an orthodox christian or a loyal subject of him the child to be sure is too young to imbibe the principles of disobedience to his god or his prince from the policies and maxims of a  teacher there is no need to make loyalty of either kind habitual to it or to take care that disloyalty do not become so in its stead  but if you were to demand my opinion concerning a public or private education which ought to have the preference i should tell you that the youth who is like a weak bark which in boisterous seas and winds carries too much sall and too little ballast whose judgment is weak and unsteady and whose passions are light and violent as hurricanes ought unquestionably to have a private education but sedater tempers a public one it ought no more to derogate from the excellency of the latter because of the miscarriages of some unhappy natures than some few shipwrecks ought to discredit navigation or the failing of some few traders disparage art and industry it is enough that the experienced and skilful the careful and diligent do generally sail successfully what valuable treasures have been derived to posterity from those famous schools of pythagoras socrates zeno plato aristotle instituted at athens and those of polybius carneades diogenes critolaus and others set up at rome by whose noble precepts and instructions were formed the learned and eminent heroes of antiquity that have done honor to human nature and left such tracts of glory behind them as distinguish the years in which they acted their parts from the ordinary course of time  but to resume as there is a manner of speaking in which nothing shocks an audience nothing can disgust nothing can displease it a manner in which there is nothing that is uncouth harsh or untunable nothing that is awkward rustic or slovenly nothing that is drowsy dry and spiritless we must follow that and endeavor to speak quickly smoothly and gently for an audience of all things cannot endure to hear a sermon drawlingly preached or the divine service negligently slubberd over read in a lifeless cool dispassionate manner or yet spoke with puffing and swelling such is the effect of a feeling manner of speaking that it becomes as it were the picture of our own minds and conciliates the esteem and attention of our hearers the common prayer especially makes a deeper impression upon them when they perceive in us a proper fervor and emotion of soul for as no matter is so combustible as to kindle without the application of fire so no ones mind is so susceptible of the power of devotion as to catch its blaze unless we when we read prayers appear to be so affected as to be all of a flame ourselves in short a becoming pathos and energy of diction animates an audience with uncommon life and spirit and gives mere words the force as it were of inspiration  how pathetick and beautiful is uraniuss manner of reading the common prayer he reads the whole service so distinctly so emphatically so fervently that it is next to an impossibility to be unattentive peoples eyes and thoughts cannot wander as they usually do when some others read but are confined to their prayers their minds are really affected and fervent wishes accompany their words for he reads the confession with such a resigned humility the absolution with such a comfortable authority the thanksgivings with such a religious joy as makes his hearers feel those affectons of the mind that he himself does they seem transported in their addresses to the almighty and as it were in heaven  i would propose this clergyman as a pattern to all those of our profession who murder the divine service by their manner of reading it the example of such an excellent reader would make those that are afraid of stretching their mouths and spoiling their lungs learn to read with clearness loudness and strength and others that affect a rakish negligent air by folding their arms and lolling on their book would be taught by him a decent behavior and a comely erection of body those that read so fast as if impatient of their work may learn by him to speak deliberately there are another sort of persons whom we may call pindarick readers as being confined to no set measure these pronounce five or six words with great deliberation and the five of six subsequent ones with as great celerity the first part of a sentence with a loud exalted voice and the latter part with a low submissive one sometimes again with one sort of tone and immediately after with a very different one these gentlemen might learn of my admired reader uranius an evenness of voice and delivery and all who are innocent of these affectations but read with such an indifferency as if they did not understand the language or were reading a ballad or news paper may be informed by his example of the art of reading prayers movingly and fervently how to place the emphasis and give the proper accent to each word and how to vary the voice according to the nature of the sentence  how great an influence would the service of our church have on the people containing the best prayers that ever were composed and that in terms most affecting most humble and most expressive of our wants and dependence on the subject of our worship disposed in a most proper order and void of all confusion what influence i say would these prayers have were their exalted sense not depreciated by the dispassionate indolence of the readers here complained of but delivered in the manner that uranius does with a due emphasis and apposite rising and variation of voice the sentence concluded with a gentle cadence and in a word with such an accent and turn of speech as is peculiar to prayer  we of this profession my friend ought to keep clear of the indecencies of affectation in preaching for affectation fills the mouths of men with bombast and fustian and gives them such sentiments as proceed rather from a lofty swelling and tumor than a true greatness of mind and such an ungraceful action dress and delivery as makes them perfectly ridiculous geryo has furnished himself with a well combed toupee and an immutable countenance has got a jauntee air opposes his front to the ladies stares sedately between every sentence nor will he give over this his surprising rhetoric till he has stard every one of his fair audience out of countenance  diablintes has got it into his head that the white glove is a great help to a polite preacher if used with skill and judgment the displaying a fine glove as white as lilly when the hand waves gently along with a soft smooth period adds an irresistible force says diablintes to whatever you deliver gives it the stamp of sublime and makes it appear with an inimitable grace and elegance instead of pushing your adversary home in a controversial sermon continues he with mode and figure major and minor there is no more necessary but to make an extension of that hand on which you wear your preaching glove and you will infallibly be adjudged victor by your auditors  sandrocotus holds the thumping the cushion as a powerful auxiliary in the pulpit the thumping it every now and then may supply a pause says he express joy anger or several other passions according to the action or manner you use in thumping it a late celebrated preacher adds he who generally had the good fortune to please on any emergency in the pulpit had immediate recourse to the expressive thump and seldom without success  cyzicenus thinks he charms both the great and small vulgar with the assistance of a beautiful white handkerchief whenever he is like to be at a loss he never makes a hum or ha but whips from under his gown his declamatory handkerchief in so pretty genteel and elegant a manner that it immediately causes a redundancy of wit he tells you fluency of words propriety of expression and impetuosity of diction etc  we see a thousand absurdities committed dear sir by these finical affected coxcombs which the very vulgar i am sure would be ashamed of and the most illiterate hearer condemn but if any one be surpised says the roman orator that these things are discerned and marked by the most vulgar audience he need but only reflect how great and incredible the force of nature is in every thing especially in this for every man has within him a certain tacit sense which enables him to distinguish what is right or wrong in arts and sciences and this without instruction and information if this observation holds good with regard to pictures statues and other works in criticizing which they have less assistance from nature it is much more evident in the judgment they form upon words harmony and delivery because this is a judgment implanted in the senses that are common to all mankind it is a faculty which nature never meant that any rational creature should be absolutely without  cicero de orat lib    the common people are not such stupid clod pates though they want politeness but they can judge of the refinement of those pleasures which nature has dictated i have i assure you seen both wit and pleasantry and discernment among them and as perfect as is needful to their circumstance  a certain lord taking a walk with a gentleman near a country village saw a poor boy dragging a calf home with both his hands you shall see says my lord laughing i will make the boy leave his calf supposing the boy would have pulled off his hat to him but being disappointed sirrah says he dont you see me and do you keep your hat on ant please your lordship to hold my calf replied the boy i will pull it off but at present you see i have my hands full  an illiterate country farmer once took a fancy to hear the latin disputes of doctors at an university he was asked what pleasure he could take in viewing such combatants when he could never know so much as which of the parties got the better for that matter replied the farmer i ant such a fool neither but i can see who is the first that puts the other in a passion nature herself dictated this lesson to the farmer that he who had the better of the argument would be easy and wellhumourd but he who was unable to support his cause by reason would naturally lose his temper and grow violent  i have seen low and uncultivated minds surprizingly affected on beholding those noble pieces of painting the celebrated cartoons of raphael at hampton court to see the silent eloquence the earnest enforcing look the devout gesture of st paul preaching is not a dumb entertainment to the eye of the vulgar but a speaking image to their minds that awakens every drowsy sentiment in them and hurries them by an amazing and imperceptible violence through every passion represented on the living canvas  what draws together the numerous crowds of the small and great vulgar in london to hear dr herring his grace of canterbury the british cicero harangue in the pulpit but the rapture which his language never fails to inspire and that softness of delivery and modest action which engages the attention and charms every faculty there is indeed so much spirit so much force so much passion in his eyes his features and his air nay his very hands have an artless meaning in them so powerful is the torrent of weighty wellchosen expressions so entire his sentiments so just so new with so unaffected so manly a glow that there is not a soul in his audience can help being all in a flame  a modest action and delivery carry an extraordinary prejudice in their favor an irresistible force by recommending the goodness of a mans heart the man who discovers no symptoms of being being abashed at committing indecencies in ciceros opinion deserves not reproof only but punishment so great a veneration had the roma senate for a romae cum multa graeciae civitates questum de injuriis philippi regis macedonum

flagrant misdemeanors of king philip for the sake of the modest eloquence of his son demetrius who was thrown into confusion and silence on barely hearing the long catalogue of his fathers crimes the man who excells in preaching is generally the more sensible of its difficulty he is under the greatest concern how to answer the expectation of his hearers but the man who can compass nothing worthy of his profession worthy of the name of a preacher or worthy the attention of his hearers is seldom under any concern he has not the grace either to blush at or to avoid indecencies some indeed put on a demure look and counterfeit an air of bashfulness and modesty but then it sits upon them with so little ease and grace that an audience presently detects the cheat and detests it for there is as much difference between a natural shame a real emotion of soul and a counterfeit one as there is between the light that glitters in a diamond and that which faintly imitates it in a pebble  thus far dear sir of a clergymans learning and skill in divinity and eloquence  that he may be a workman that needs not be ashamed  to be an excellent preacher i know requires the study and practice of a mans life a peculiar genius and a noble stock of nature but all of us since we are frequently required to speak in public should arrive at such a degree of learning and eloquence as to speak in proper and handsome terms to express ourselves with clearness and with so much gracefulness at least as our matter may not suffer by our language nor our language by our delivery livery but it will be highly useful besides this to adorn our discourse with the more select phrases and refined forms of speech which will make it relish better especially to the auditors of the better breeding to illustrate it when occasion requires with easy and decent metaphors not fordily mean nor prodigiously vast to be able to command the use of natural and elegant similitudes for illustration and not for varnish to know what words to use to aggravate and what to extenuate with a regard had always to truth and sobriety to delineate a virtue or a vice a good or a bad man in such proper and natural colors as may raise the esteem or aversion the love or hatred of our auditors to them at pleasure if we can arrive to this then we shall in a true sense  dominari in concionibus  be lords over the affections of our hearers which if we take care to join with orthodox sound doctrine and good reasoning we shall then have the same advantage for virtue which the devil has against it that is we shall have all the warmth of of mens passions pleading for it  i am dear sir yours etc the postscript dear sir i shall now show you by way of postcript what is required to make a clergyman an orthodox teacher  rightly dividing the word of truth  now to do this he must be lawfully called to the ministry he cannot divide the word rightly if he have a wrong title to do it if he do it upon his own head or upon insufficient authority now i think it is sufficiently proved even to the silencing gainsayer that the only ordinary lawful call into the ministry is by episcopal ordination for we find no ordination in scripture but what was made by the apostles and whom they had before ordained bishops as is clear by the example of paul barnabas and titus and never any ordination by presbyters was ever so much as dreamt of till of late years and that was only to serve a turn at geneva therefore all that come rightly into the clergy must come this way it is not the being of a pert confident humor or a popular noisy eloquence that gives a man a commission to divide the word of truth but this lawful means which christ has instituted this is the only door which our blessed lord has made to come into the church and then he has made the consequence that they who come in otherwise are thieves and robbers without a lawful ordination a man has no more title to the priesthood than he has to the crown and the crime of each presumption is equally great only the laws are more fevere against the one than the other but when god took the execution into his hands the case was otherwise for when korah dathan and abiram usurped the priesthood they found as dreadful a punishment as ever any traitor since  livy in his livys hist vol   l   history tells us that the family of the potitii who had the privilege of performing the priestly office at the altar of hercules called the ara maxima having by the advice of appius the censor instructed some public servants in the solemn rites of their function with a design to commit the exercise of their office to them as their delegates an amazing effect ensued and one says the historian that may justly deter from making any alteration in religion for though there were at that time twelve families of the potitii and thirty persons above the age of fourteen years they all died within the space of one year thereafter and the whole race became extinct nor is it only observed continues he that the name of the potitii perished upon this occasion but also that appius the censor some years after by the lasting resentment of heaven entirely lost the sight of his eyes  he must be no schismatic if a man comes into the church ever so regularly yet if he schismatically makes a separation from it he is no orthodox teacher he does not righty divide the word of truth because he takes wrong measures to do it he has o commission to be a teacher out of the church his orders do not qualify him to set up altar against altar but he acts as heinously as if he preached the gospel without any orders at all our blessed savior in the whole tenor of his doctrine preaches up peace and unity in his dying speech to his disciples he says peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you the apostle does with all the pathetical endearments imaginable engage us to unity if there be any consolation in christ says he if there be any comfort in love etc fulfill ye my joy that ye be all likeminded  noble was that answer of a certain prelate and worthy of a christian bishop to a prime ministers letter containing a reproof for holding some orthodox opinions which the minister did not like  a bishop whose conscience cannot reproach him who likes the place of his residence and has no ambition to live within the sunshine of a court need fear nothing of what your lordship can write to him as a nobleman i pay you respect as a minister of state i have nothing to do with you as a christian i am accountable to god alone it is before his tribunal i hope to render myself acceptable where we must both of us appear shortly and it behooves you my lord to take heed lest you should not find there the same favor as in the courts of men  he must not be an heretic one that holds an erroneous faith concerning the fundamental parts of religion concerning the divinity the incarnation satisfaction of our lord concerning the deity of the holy ghost and the necessity of his grace such an one is so far from being a right divider of the truth that he teaches a false religion and another gospel such an one ought not to continue a member of christs flock much less a teacher and pastor of it  he must not be an obstinate defender of any false or erroneous doctrine of lesser moment for let the doctrine be of ever so small moment it is still an opposition against the truth it is a confronting of gods word and an innovating in the doctrine of the catholic church besides it is very dangerous to have a teacher of such erroneous opinions because it is very natural for the people to imbibe them from him and they may be tempted in time for the esteem they have for their pastor to make a formal schism  for a minister to be an orthodox teacher he must not teach uncertain truths the apostle bids us exhort with sound doctrine not to build with hay and stubble and he himself came with demonstration as well as power and the other apostles taught what they had heard and seen which ought to be well considered by those divines who value themselves upon their newfangled nostrums in divinity and finespun inventions in this science for divinity is a thing which is recommended most by antiquity our faith was but once delivered to the saints and so leaves no room for the wits of later ages but if men must be showing their parts and giving the world a cast of their rare inventions they have a large scope for it elsewhere but by all means they ought to spare divinity  he ought to ground his doctrine upon scripture and the explication of the catholic church to teach doctrines without the confirmation of scripture is to teach the doctrines of men and to explain scripture otherwise than the church of god has done in all ages is always presumption and frequently heresy all doctrines and explications of faith especially were superabundantly sifted by ancient councils and writers when they were matter of debate for so many ages and therefore we ought to stick to their notions and expressions of these facred truths who are supposed to understand them better than any single modern divine who has only conversed with his own thoughts now to remedy this we ought to study divinity first out of the holy scripture and next out of the fathers who let some men say what they will were men of very good sense and talk very intelligibly and though the socinians and remonstrants may have more of method closeness and subtilty they have that which makes alloy for all this a great deal more of heresy  and now my friend i can perceive it is time to put an end to this epistolary correspondence i have taken the liberty you see to laugh upon some occasions and if i have either laughed wrong or been impertinently serious i can be content to be laughed at in my turn for my humor does not very much incline me to melancholy reflections i have very freely and without the least reserve given you my sentiments concerning the necessary qualifications of a minister of the gospel as he is a christian a pastor and a catholic and i pray god if you go into holy orders you may do your duty in all these respects but a good life ought to be the principal of your aim for a wicked life is the worst of heresies and a minister may do more mischief to religion by one ill action than good by a hundred fine sermons nay we undo all we preach by an ill practice for men have reason to think that that doctrine should not have any influence upon their lives which they see has none upon our own to me indeed it seems surprising that an immoral clergyman can have the considence to appear or preach in public for all his declamations against vice are but so many libels against himself and every time he gets up into the pulpit he is but doing a public penance to the whole congregation let me entreat you therefore steadily to adhere to the practice of virtue dare to oppose yourself to the licentious customs of a degenerate age wherever you go and by a good example endeavor to stem the torrent of vice dont blush to own your obligations daily and hourly to that great being who fills the universe with the wondrous exertions of his wisdom and power give him your highest esteem your highest reverence and supreme regard let your devotion to him spring from love and gratitude and never mention his name without a respectful and humble awe regard his favor as the highest blessing and endeavor to imitate and follow the bright example which the blessed author of our religion has set before us believe me my dear friend there is no comparison between a wicked and a good life a good life stored with every moral and religious virtue resembles heaven methinks its cannopy stuck with stars and constellations a clergyman who is conscious of having done his duty enjoys a most refined and rational delight but he who wants the secret witness of an approving conscience is never seen to have that serene composure and selfcomplacency which becomes a minister of christ  in a word let your countenance be open and your bosom close let your beneficence be attended with a familiarity so circumscribed as to impress love and respect and let all your actions appear consistent with the dignity of your profession that you may be upon earth a true image of the deity by giving all mankind certain and impartial marks of your probity and paternal love for the people under your care whose hearts if you gain you possess the most precious of all treasures a treasure which that brave roman flaminium martiale a posthumous alvinus habeba eoque provinciam sortiri cupientem l caecilius metellus pontifex maximus dicta mulcta prohibuit negans fas esse flamini a sacris recedere cujus facti posterioribus quoque temporibus probata ratio est when a posthumous alvinus the high priest of mars presented himself to draw lots for the provinces l caecilius metellus the pontifex maximus declared it unlawful for him to be absent from his sacred function and expressly forbad him to leave it under the pain of sining him this became a precedent among the romans which was observed ever after  frenshem suppl live hist l   c      l caecilius metellus looked upon as sacred and obliged even the high priest of mars a posthumous alvinus to residence and would by no means dispense with his absence from the charge committed to him  as a frequent consideration of the nature of our high office will be a continual encouragement for us to do our duty i shall conclude all with an excellent observation of st chrysostom to this purpose therefore has the lord chosen us to be the lights of the world and the leaven of the lump to be masters and teachers of other christians to be as it were angels associating with men on earth as men conversing with children as those of a spiritual nature with the gross animal and carnal so that by our conversation they might reap an extraordinary advantage  i am dear sir yours etc    a letter to

all the people wept  and the king lamented over abner and said died abner as a fool dies  thy hands were not bound nor thy feet put into fetters as a man falls before wicked men so fellest thou and

verse renowned which sung the deeds of heroes those who fell or those who conquered in their countrys cause the enraptured soul inspiring with the thirst of glory won by virtue his high strain the muses favored from their neighboring groves and blessed with heavenly melody his lyre no more from thespia shall his feet ascend the shady steep of helicon no more the streams divine of aganippes

aspect far excelled whatever the lilly blending with the rose paints on the cheek of beauty soon to fade such as expressed a mind which wisdom rold and sweetness tempered virtues purest light

leonidas l   the faithful woman here mentioned is the royal partner of his bed whose heart oerflowd with the fondest passion and was plunged in sorrows  amid her weeping children sat the queen immovable and mute her swimming eyes fixed on the earth her arms were folded over her laboring bosom blotted with her tears as when a dusky mist involves the sky the moon through all the dreary vapors spreads the radiant vesture of its silver light over the dull face of nature so her charms divinely graceful shone upon her grief brightning the cloud of woe glov leonidas l   it is the part of a man to melt in such cases of a brute not to be moved at all of a christian to be moderate in his regret methinks sir the experience you have had of the world and human chances should steel you enough against the like strokes how many funeralmatches had your eyes seen ere death knocked at your friends door but he might you will say have lived longer true so he might have died sooner what reason have we to think that too hastily taken away which was payable as soon as we received it if his mortality displeased you you should have mourned when it began not when it ends why do we grieve for a wound which no grief can relieve or remedy why bear we not that in another which we must come to ourselves it is for none but our maker to be eternal lie we not all under an unchangeable law under an eternal ordinance to be born and die  the snow and ice of winter may lie crowded together a while and hold out for a month or two but the spring will be sure to melt it all should we chance to pass over our youth and virility safe yet old age will consume us at last  we come into this world as children are sent to school not to live there always but to learn somewhat and then be gone we scramble up from lower to higher forms from our childhood to an age of constancy and gravity but we must be gone when we have learned enough to fit and prepare us for heaven and the sooner we grow fit the sooner we are taken away virtue protects not the body but glorifies the soul as flowers of the fairest hue and glasses of the finest mould wither and break soonest so we commonly see them that excel in virtue to be shortest lived when the ungodly and dissolute are in no peril of death but are fat and frolicksome lusty and strong when the mower or reaper comes weeds and flowers corn and cockle high and low spires ripe and unripe ears are cut down alike so deals the sickle of death with us of what age of what rank soever it makes bold to pare us away the great lords of the earth after all their painted glory and stern ruffling are brought down to the ghastliness and dust of death nay mighty states and kingdoms expire those awful monarchies that spread so far are shrunk to nothing heaven and earth look for a day of dissolution  when all are rated for pollmoney what pride what partiality nay what folly were it to grumble and seek exemption death is a tribute which all pay why then should we grieve and whine when we are called upon for it why should we think to slip the collar alone the only salve for a necessity is a willing compliance with it what should we do but give up a game of our own accord which is so sure to be lost  and as it avails not to quarrel with a law of necessity so it becomes us not to to quarrel with the will of god we must says a rabbin be as bold as leopards as swift as eagles as nimble as hearts and as valiant as lions to do the will of our father which is in heaven and is it not he that kills and makes alive that brings us down to the grave and that raises us up shall sun and moon and stars and elements submit to that high creator and shall man alone who owes him most service spurn at his decrees as that centurion in sacred writ could say of his domestics if he called a servant he came presently if he sent him forth he went so should we behave ourselves to our heavenly master if he keeps us here below in our pilgrimage we must be content to trudge still if he calls us away to himself we must be ready to go what fearful judgments were pronounced on eli and all his house yet he puts them up with this mild acknowledgment it is the lord let him do what seems him good what should a servant do but fulfill his lords pleasure nay it is not only a lord but a father that determines of us even children are many times handled more severely of their loving parents than they would be it is for their good though they discern it not the course which our heavenly father takes with us is no less beneficial however it may gripe and startle our sensual part had a stone or a staff hit us we would look angrily about and prepare to revenge ourselves on the assaulter but should we find the blow given us by a friend or by a great man we depended upon and that it was rather given in love and familiarity than spleen or grudge we would be calm immediately and excuse our choler and count it a courtesy not a wrong so when temporal crosses annoy us the death of our dear associates the loss of our goods the blemishes of our good name in all this would we call to mind that it is but a friends blow but the fatherly stroke of a merciful god how soon would it restrain us from repining how soon bring us into the psalmists tune  o god thy rod and thy staff are so far from bruising and vexing mine heart that they bring me comfort it is a sign of thy favor and familiarity that i am thus touched  the savage indians that were demanded by our late discoverers what they meant in worshipping the sun had this reason at hand  because it brought death upon them they thought it a device and ordinance that could suit with none but the power and goodness of a deity  you sir are deprived of one that was deservedly dear to you but let god be dearer whose high pleasure it was to take him from this world to himself what has he taken but what he once gave you why should he not receive for ever what he lent you but for a time ah how fond are we of our own vexation like ulcerous limbs how do we shrink at every touch many comforts cannot erect us so much as one grief is able to cast us down we are greedy of that which we want and as unthankful for that which we have something is gone we once had and we afflict ourselves for it when there were more reason it should quiet than heighten our grief that we once had it for that we had it was a benefit for which we are owing to god and it would best become us to think of paying our debt to our bountiful lord lo he asks nothing but our patience but our peace peace with ourselves and peace with him there is more left us than we have lost and why will we lose whatsoever we have because we have not a thing that we have lost for that which we have left is wilfully lost while we take no joy in it what injury do we to our own happiness if we place it in things which we want never shall we want matter of dejection if we go to work thus every misers coffer and every merchants ship every full table and every wellfurnishd house we come short of will bring us in a plentiful harvest of perplexity but i beseech you sir to turn your eyes rather on that which god has done for you to bethink yourself how many comforts are left you to season this particular loss how can you think him dead who in the bright echo of his reputation is still remaining with you laelius could cheer himself that his scipio was to him alive still  alive in his glorious virtues alive in his renowned name twas not the innocents death david bemoaned but the rebels when socrates saw his wife storming that such a good man should die unjustly what says he would thou rather have me die a malefactor  if sir you find your heart bleed with such a meditation  ah what a friend has god taken from me let a sweeter one heal it again  what a friend had i given me whenever you look upon the greatness of your loss it must bring to your mind the greatness of your debt and gods great kindness in bestowing such a friend upon you how unthankful is he who so remembereth the loss of a benefit that he forgets the receipt shall we receive good at gods hand and not evil too were it not far better we should submit ourselves to the will of god than the will of god should be squared to ours do we fondly presume that we know what is better for us or wish ourselves better than god does how often have we delighted in hurtful and perilous things how often have our vain longings brought mischief upon us on the other side what gracious tokens of his good will has god shown us when he took our flesh and lived among us and died for us was not his good will toward men proclaimed aloud and is not his will the same in laying the cross on us as in bearing it for us had he not the same tender love and gracious aim in both of doing us good if we reckon it for our good that god would suffer so much for us we may believe it for our good too that he would have ourselves suffer a little all his attributes are vast and infinite his power wisdom and love nor is he thus alone in himself but this to us he loves us better than we love ourselves  infinitely better and he seeks our good more and is more able and skilful to effect it  infinitely more what therefore comes in our heads when we bemoan our mishaps do we think god deceived or spiteful do we think his arm shortened that he cannot prevent an evil far be such thoughts from a christians heart it comes not from any weakness malice or imprudence in him that we are vexed thus but from his infinite power wisdom and goodness and who are we that like the old giants we should fight with heaven and attempt to pull god from his throne and wring his scepter out of his hand  oh let us give him leave who made us for his glory to rule us at his will to that glory he will assuredly bring us if we be guided by his will and counsel in the way to it a passenger at sea takes not upon him to steer and order the ship that wafts him but leaves that to the pilot and master and in a storm obeys his direction most and stirs not a foot against his will but casts out the dearest things that he has at his bidding what think you my friend has god less skill to govern the world than the shipman his bark that which we would do for a man who is to land us on earth shall we not do for a god who would bring us to heaven our crosses are sent us either by an angry god or a favoring one if they are sent in favor why do we spurn at a benefit if in displeasure what should we do but appease it with an humble submission gods anger will be the sooner appeased if we can meet his chastning hand not only with silence and sufferance but even with consent and joy and thanksgiving the old germans well understood this who taught their children when their fingers were cut or scorched to cry god be thanked what heard we from our distressed lord in the garden of gethsemani not my will o father but thine be done and should not this affect us as much as the rueful spectacle did that hebrew host which were besieging the moabites they no sooner saw the kings son offered up for a sacrifice but they departed amazed and vexed when the son of god himself becomes a burntoffering and sacrifices his will to the will of his father shall it not work as fierce an indignation within us against our own stubbornness we solace ourselves in all our extremities to see other men suffering with us and should we not think it a more abundant comfort to see our blessed lord a sharer with us in sorrow and sufferance shall we leave him to climb up to his cross alone and shall we suffer nothing at all with him but run away from the very shadow of a threatening affliction of a seeming distress  why sir should we grieve immoderately to see our friends going from hence who have the angels to convey their souls and to gather up their bodies at the last day nay christ himself bearing them company in all their way why went he down to the grave with us but to save us from the danger and horror of it if it is an unpleasant thing to follow the son of god yet in any case let us not fly from him if we dare not imitate how dare we resist him when we might be like him why do we thus abhor his resemblance oh wretched ingratitude god stampeth upon us the image of his beloved son and we that will not be like christ in sufference become like lucifer in pride nay methinks we become worse for lucifer thought not himself better than his god and we as if we were faultless refuse the stripes which our innocent jesus bore  however we find ourselves stated indeed it becomes us to bear our crosses contentedly for if we see a deep stain of guilt within us were not an high insolence to be loath to suffer justly when christ had those bitter storms of sorrow upon him who never did amiss on the other side if we find no indictments in our own hearts nothing to implead or accuse us we are the more encouraged to be like him who was crucified without a cause if our own guilt brought not our affliction upon us let not impatience bring any guilt on our affliction  should we have met our savior as that cirenian did fainting under his cross and desiring us to carry it a while for him nay should he have laid that precious burden upon our shoulders with his own hands would we churlishly have put it from us would we have pleaded excuse or impatience would we not have carried it away in joy and triumph and have thought ourselves happy to have been crucified on the same tree with the son of god lo this very honor we may come to without going to mount calvary for it god puts our strength to a trial with his own hand imposes this or that particular cross on us a cross far lighter than that our lord bore why do we refuse and abhor it  the son of god was wounded and pierced for me by the bloody hands of ungodly ruffians why should not i suffer a gracious god to touch me why should i not be struck by so good and gentle a hand  when the disciples were tossed at sea and felt a new tempest within themselves to see a man walking on the liquid waves on word from their masters mouth quells them all  be of good comfort it is i  it is i have called this storm upon you it is i can appease it it is i have taken away the serenity of the heavens it is i can restore it again  if he makes us sore says job he can bind us up if he wounds us his hands can make us whole let us therefore wait on him for a salve from whom our sores come  it is true sir you have lost an excellent friend  but what is the almighty hand of your heavenly father any whit shortened has he locked up all his care of you in this urn no cast your care upon him for he cares for you you never saw the righteous forsaken of men often enough but never never of god  but you are not i hope so fixed on the meditation of your own loss but you remember also that to him to die was gain yes it was inexpressible felicity to be taken away from a world in which we are immergd in labor and sorrow for what is the life we dote on but a stage of folly but a sea of mifery which how smoothly soever we sail over yet many a rock many a gulf will cross our way many a storm will toss us and many a rover fright us ere we unlade our bottom in the wished for haven that very period of life which we long for which we are so glad to arrive at our old age what is it else but a loathsome prison even now when we are nearest to death our buried griefs and maladies begin to revive as rivers run in a broader stream when they are ending their course  but if we look into the mysteries of our tender age we shall find that our young infants at their birth begin to weep in their sleep seem to laugh he that deplored the entrance of his life with tears consecrates the image of death with smiles as if he foresaw the anxieties of the one and the sweetness of the other  wisely therefore did god and nature appoint that souls as yet rude and ignorant should be infused into our bodies and kept senseless in the closed womb for fear of loathing so harsh a prison which orpheus thought was nothing else but a punishment laid upon us like that the old tyrants used when they tied the dead and living together for thus says he the pure and immortal soul is served when she is yoked with a rotten corruptible and crazy body and what divorced soul that carries her intellect with her would gladly return this foul way again to lie pent in a dark and polluted womb to be deprived so many months of the light of heaven so many years of the use of reason to run through so many sordid necessities of nature so many mockeries of fortune to take up again the madness of infancy the terrors of childhood the dangers of youth the cares of virility and the griefs of old age i cannot believe any man has lived so happy as to wish his whole life again repeated  none i dare say would desire to recover life but such as deserved it not but such as had abused it  had death methinks no comforts attending upon it the very troubles of life might be enough to render it sweet as weariness gives a relish to rest  it made artabanus laugh to see xerxes so foolishly weeping when from a steep hill he took a view of his numerous army he fell into such passionate moans that such a multitude enough to turn the world upside down must be gone from it so soon it grieved him that they whom himself was precipitating into a present danger of death and sacrificing straight up to the madness of his ambition should be all dead within an hundred years  o xerxes there had been more reason for thee to have bemoaned so long a stay in so cross a world had thou discerned as clearly from that high mount their human anxieties as thou did their human bodies the advantages of death would rather have dried thy tears than the suddenness drawn them out  twere as easy methinks to find a moiling collier with a white and unsullied face as a mortal man not stained with some tincture of grief pick out the bravest darlings of fortune take one of those that had the very surname of happy and great take a sylla or an alexander or a julius caesar even they that commanded all had their lives perplexed and their deaths violent look on augustus whose public reign seemed a perpetual calm found he not many deep vexations at home the want of natural issue the miscarriage of adopted what joy could he take among the treacheries of some the libels of others to see his nearest kinswoman lewd and loose his only successor hateful and unworthy what farther instance need i seek you see dear sir even in this loss that which was one of your greatest joys become an occasion of your just heaviness  suppose now a man deep in debt for which he was bound to pay yearly a grievous and unreasonable use how glad would he be to get out of his creditors lurch to see the main debt cleared and the bond cancelled for the principal being paid the biting interest ceases and is not this the common condition of the sons of men we have our bodies from earth our souls immediately from god both these are lent us but we pay a hard interest in the mean time the bodily pangs that press us hunger and thirst cold and heat sickness and labor and all the variety of corporal distresses what are all these but interestmoney to be daily paid till the principal be restored till the body return to the earth from whence it came on the other side the fears and cares and sorrows and all the troublesome passions of the soul must be paid too for the use of it till the spirit returns to god that gave it how do we wrong ourselves if we come not gladly out of such chargeable debts when socrates had drunk his last hemlock he bad them prepare a sacrifice for aesculapius for the medicinal god he took his death as a remedy that would cure all his griefs  infamy is one of those evils that sticks closest unto us and yet in death it begins to lose its sting who talks now in a virulent manner of an o  d we speak not of the dead but with a kind of reverence even they who while they lived could get nothing but grudge and envy once dead are praised extolled and wished for again  in the judgment of the wise man the day of our death is better than the day of our birth better without question to the virtuous good man who has all his tears and troubles wiped away and better in some measure for the vicious too for though it ends not his misery yet it puts an end to his misdoings and is it not a kindness to wrest a poniard from one that would do nothing but stab himself to deny money to a gaming borrower that would do nothing but cast it way it is no less courtesy to take away life from him that abuses it we reckon that good which brings us profit and is not death beneficial we meet not the king with such awed and composed thoughts as we do a dead corse the very sight of anothers funeral does us good it causing the remembrance or reflection of our own and therefore the catajan priests call the people to public prayers with a trumpet made of the bones of the dead and deck their bodies with beads and jewels of the same stuff and drink commonly out of a skull  but if from our private condition we turn our eyes to the public face of the times we are cast upon have we not cause to count the dead happy it is one of our greatest comforts in public calamities to see our friends and dear associates freed from them and sheltered in some safe retreat were we got into some hideous desert and environed there with roaring and venomous beasts on one side a fierce tiger ready to fly upon us on the other lions or bears with bent and erected paws gaping for us here a cluster of serpents spitting their fire and venom there a troop of savages brandishing their clubs or preparing their arrows to lay us dead what would we give to be gone from such ill neighbors why are we not here in a woeful a plight within outrageous passions encompass us about and tear our hearts with restless desires abroad misfortune and misery and the proud mans contumely wound us daily religion pure and undefiled religion as practiced in the primitive ages of the church is it not grown a very jest and become the scorn of idiots nay do wise heads show a better example do they accustom themselves to entertain their friends and acquaintance with discourse about another world do they mingle the praises of god with the feasts and joys of life do they retire to their country dwellings to contemplate the variety and riches of divine wisdom and bounty in those natural scenes of pleasure which the country affords and do they now and then invite their companions to join with them in offering hallelujahs to god on this account no sacred themes are not now the business of conversation nor are common friendships any way useful or serviceable to the great end of life riot and luxury or sordid profit and interest or else folly trifling and impertinence are the ties the bonds of modern confederacies the ligaments of christian nay of protestant societies the oracles of god or things serious are such unfashionable topics of discourse such unusual nay i may add unwelcome subjects of entertainment every where that the company deserves now to be praised which is only barren and unprofitable not hurtful and wherein we suffer no greater loss than that of our time  i wish says dr lucas in his excellent essay upon happiness that whatever men talk of a treasure in another world they do not now and then think it wisest to have their portion in this how many are there who making a profession of living by faith and looking for the blessed hope and appearance of christ do yet live as if all the business of life were to get and enjoy as much of this world as they can who professing themselves the disciples of the son of god whose heart was lowly his fortune mean and his appearance humble do yet lay out their time their labor their wealth on this one design to make such a show such a figure in the world as may render them the gaze the envy of the neighborhood they live in  such a tender concern for such an eager pursuit after temporal things cannot flow from nay nor consist with purity of heart and poverty of spirit the love of god and a desire of heaven  what an excellent thing must we think that to be which frees us from such a degenerate world which even rectifies the crooked partialities of fortune and makes us as good as those that trod upon us we are not therefore to reckon it as an injury of fortune but as a degree of grace and favor unto us that our course is finished a little sooner than we were aware of for it is as if a traveller in a rainy wintry day should get safe and well to his journeys end or his inn ere sunset which others cannot attain till the dark night has overtaken them  in a cold severe winter we think long till it be passed over till the warm spring and summer arrive and why should not we be as glad to have the hardships of this life exchanged for the joys of a better  were a man necessarily to cross a deep and dangerous river what madness were it in him to grieve or complain that he had met with a bridge or a boat to waft him over they are methinks as foolish who quarrel with death for what is it else but a bridge or boat to waft us to the opposite shore over a flood we must needs pass from a brittle and frail life to a glorious and immortal one  we are not to judge of death by that which it carries us from but by that which it brings us to to get a kingdom or poorer territory we venture our lives and what is a spot of earth to the kingdom of heaven what can we reckon death but our gainfullest hour that adds so much to our felicity as it takes from our life the sooner we die the longer we are happy  see you not how the poor kine that are turned out in winter will be clinging to the stable or barndoor where they know there is better food the world starves and pines us and why run we from deaths door where fullness of joy lies ready for us why mourn we hopelessly for a mouldering body which is in so sure a hope of a resurrection  we see that those men who are any thing skilled in the nature and motion of heavenly bodies are not amazed or troubled at the yearly eclipses of the sun and moon because they know all these obscured planets will quickly recover their light and shine out as clearly as ever they did and we why should we shrink or shudder to see the eyes of our friends closed up in darkness who know these sullen eclipses are to last but a while that after a little interposition of dust these hid and obscure bodies shall shine out as the stars in heaven  when that huge persian army we read of in story was setting forward to invade greece miltiades the athenian general calling his thin troops together presented them with a cocksight imagining that would put courage into them and the device took as he wished for they seeing such an invincible stoutness and eager combat in a couple of birds that they would never yield till both lay dead on the ground snatched up their weapons and marched on despising danger and death we christians have not birds and beasts but reasonable men to give us an example of fortitude in bearing the loss of our friends  our relatives  our other selves we see david wiping his eyes when his child was dead we see job breathing out the praises of god when a violent wind had blown all his sons and daughters away we see that brave dame in the book of maccabees hearing the cries of her murdered sons with as much delight as a musical song nay paganism is able to show us a tiberius a paulus a martius a cato a gallienus at rome a pericles a xenophon an anaxagoras in other places so manfully bearing the death of their domestic friends and children that they have gone presently about their business sat in the senate house and kept their garlands upon their heads and told the world they knew they were mortal men they had begotten and we that know more shall we bear less will not these heathens be eternal monuments of our shame if we lie grovelling in sorrow and raise not up our dejected hearts  the sweet and long acquaintance you had dear sir with him whose loss you lament the upright and innocent course of his life as it gives you the more hope of his present happiness so it gives you the less reason to bewail his dissolution his life was not a mere calm but a gentle breeze it did not consist in mere rest and quiet but a delightful motion even in his retirement he could employ all the vigor of his mind usefully and delightfully nay that very solitude which would have been the prison and  anishment of the busy worldling wa is aradise most undoubtedly if a righteous and unblemished life if a sure faith in his precious redeemer if the fear of god and a fruitful use of his ordinances could bring him to heaven he is become an abiding citizen of that new jerusalem  o if he had but liberty to whisper a few words into your ear would he not thus expostulate my dear friend what do you bewail my departure from you why look where i am in whose soft bosom i lie how glorious how secure i am become is it your own mishap that afflicts you it will be but for a moment i am but gone before and you shortly will follow me and all those i left with you  numbers of our friends says st cyprian expect us above let us therefore dear sir gsp and long for an happy meeting that we may be joined in glory with those with whom we are joined in affection  i am etc  finis
