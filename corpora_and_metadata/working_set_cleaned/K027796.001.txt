 a general view of the epic poem and of the iliad and odyssey extracted from bossu sect i of the nature of epic poetry the fables of poets were originally employed in representing the divine nature according to the notion then conceived of it this sublime subject occasioned the first poets to be called divines and poetry the language of the gods they divided the divine attributes into so many persons because the infirmity of a human mind cannot sufficiently conceive or explain so much power and action in a simplicity so great and indivisible as that of god and perhaps they were also jealous of the advantages they reaped from such excellent and exalted learning and of which they thought the vulgar part of mankind was not worthy  they could not describe the operations of this almighty cause without speaking at the same time of its effects so that to divinity they added physiology and treated of both without quitting the umbrages of their allegorical expressions  but man being the chief and the most noble of all that god produced and nothing being so proper or more useful to poets than this subject they added it to the former and treated of the doctrine of morality after the same manner as they did that of divinity and philosophy and from morality thus treated is formed that kind of poem and fable which we call epic  the poets did the same in morality that the divines had done in divinity but that infinite variety of the actions and operations of the divine nature to which our understanding bears so small a proportion did as it were force them upon dividing the single idea of the only one god into several persons under the different names of jupiter juno neptune and the rest  and on the other hand the nature of moral philosophy being such as never to treat of things in particular but in general the epic poets were obliged to unite in one single idea in one and the same person and in an action which appeared singular all that looked like it in different persons and in various actions which might be thus contained as so many species under their genus  the presence of the deity and the care such an august cause is to be supposed to take about any action obliges the poet to represent this action as great important and managed by res gestae regumque ducumque hor art poet kings and princes it obliges him likewise to think and speak in an elevated way above the vulgar and in a style that may in some fort keep up the character of the divine persons he introduces cui mens divinior atque os magna sonaturum des nominis hujus honorem horat to this end serve the poetical and figurative expression and the majesty of the heroic verse  but all this being divine and surprising may quite ruin all probability therefore the poet should take a peculiar care as to that point since his chief aim is to instruct and without probability any action is less likely to persuade  lastly since precepts ought to be quicquid praecipies esto brevis ut cito dicta percipiant animi dociles teneantque fideles hor poet concise to be the more easily conceived and less oppress the memory and since nothing can be more effectual to this end than proposing one single idea and collecting all things so well together as to be present to our minds all at once therefore the poets have reduced all to one denique sit quodvis simplex duntaxat and unum bid single action under one and the same design and in a body whose members and parts should be homogeneous  what we have observed of the nature of the epic poem gives us a just idea of it and we may define it thus  the epic poem is a discourse invented by art to form the manners by such instructions as are disguised under the allegories of some one important action which is related in verse after a probable diverting and surprising manner  sect ii the fable of the iliad in every design which a man deliberately undertakes the end he proposes is the first thing in his mind and that by which he governs the whole work and all its parts thus since the end of the epic poem is to regulate the manners it is with this first view the poet ought to begin  but there is a great difference between the philosophical and the poetical doctrine of manners the schoolmen content themselves with treating of virtues and vices in general the instructions they give are proper for all states people and for all ages but the poet has a nearer regard to his own country and the necessities of his own nation with this design he makes choice of some piece of morality the most proper and just he can imagine and in order to press this home he makes less use of the force of reasoning than of the power of insinuation accommodating himself to the particular customs and inclinations of those who are to be the subject or the readers of his work  let us now see how homer has acquitted himself in all these respects  he saw the grecians for whom he designed his poem were divided into as many states as they had capital cities each was a body politic apart and had its form of government independent from all the rest and yet these distinct states were very often obliged to unite together in one body against their common enemies these were two very different sorts of government such as could not be comprehended in one maxim of morality and in one single poem  the poet therefore has made two distinct fables of them the one is for greece in general united into one body but composed of parts independent on each other and the other for each particular state considered as they were in time of peace without the former circumstances and the necessity of being united  as for the first sort of government in the union or rather in the confederacy of many independent states experience has always made it appear that nothing so much causes success as a due subordination and a right understanding among the chief commanders and on the other hand the inevitable ruin of such confederacies proceeds from the heats jealousies and ambition of the differerent leaders and the discontents of submitting to a single general all sorts of states and in particular the grecians had dearly experienced this truth so that the most useful and necessary instruction that could be given them was to lay before their eyes the loss which both the people and the princes must of necessity suffer by the ambition discord and obstinacy of the latter  homer then has taken for the foundation of his fable this great truth that a misunderstanding between princes is the ruin of their own states i sing says he the anger of achilles so pernicious to the grecians and the cause of so many heros deaths occasioned by the discord and separation of agamemnon and that prince  but that this truth may be completely and fully known there is need of a second to support it it is necessary in such a design not only to represent the confederate states at first disagreeing among themselves and from thence unfortunate but to show the same states afterward reconciled and united and of consequence victorious  let us now see how he has joined all these in one general action  several princes independent on one another were united against a common enemy the person whom they had elected their general offers an affront to the most valiant of all the confederates this offended prince is so far provoked as to relinquish the union and obstinately refuse to fight for the common cause this misunderstanding gives the enemy such an advantage that the allies are very near quitting their design with dishonor he himself who made the separation is not exempt from sharing the misfortune which he brought upon his party for having permitted his intimate friend to succor them in a great necessity this friend is killed by the enemys general thus the contending princes being both made wiser at their own cost are reconciled and unite again then this valiant prince not only obtains the victory in the public cause but revenges his private wrongs by killing with his own hands the author of the death of his friend  this is the first platform of the poem and the fiction which reduces into one important and universal action all the particulars upon which it turns  in the next place it must be rendered probable by the circumstances of times places and persons some persons must be found out already known by history or otherwise whom we may with probability make the actors and personages of this fable homer has made choice of the siege of troy and feigned that this action happened there to a phantome of his brain whom he would paint valiant and choleric he has given the name of achilles that of agamemnon to his general that of hector to the enemies commander and so to the rest  besides he was obliged to accommodate himself to the manners customs and genius of the greeks his auditors the better to make them attend to the instruction of his poem and to gain their approbation by praising them so that they might the better forgive him the representation of their own faults in some of his chief personages he admirably discharges all these duties by making these brave princes and those victorious people all grecians and the fathers of those he had a mind to commend  but not being content in a work of such a length to propose only the principal point of the moral and to fill up the rest with useless ornaments and foreign incidents he extends this moral by all its necessary consequences as for instance in the subject before us it is not enough to know that a good understanding ought always to be maintained among confederates it is likewise of equal importance that if there happens any division care must be taken to keep it secret from the enemy that their ignorance of this advantage may prevent their making use of it and in the second place when their concord is but counterfeit and only in appearance one should never press the enemy too closely for this would discover the weakness which we ought to conceal from them  the episode of patroclus most admirably furnishes us with these two instructions for when he appeared in the arms of achilles the trojans who took him for that prince now reconciled and united to the confederates immediately gave ground and quitted the advantages they had before over the greeks but patroclus who should have been contented with this success presses upon hector too boldly and by obliging him to fight soon discovers that it was not the true achilles who was clad in his armor but a hero of much inferior prowess so that hector kills him and regains those advantages which the trojans had lost on the opinion that achilles was reconciled  sect iii the fable of the odyssey the odyssey was not designed like the iliad for the instruction of all the states of greece joined in one body but for each state in particular as a state is composed of two parts the head which commands and the members which obey there are instructions requisite for both to teach the one to govern and the others to submit to government  there are two virtues necessary to one in authority prudence to order and care to see his orders put in execution the prudence of a politician is not acquired but by a long experience in all sorts of business and by an acquaintance with all the different forms of governments and states the care of the administration suffers not him that has the government to rely upon others but requires his own presence and kings who are absent from their states are in danger of losing them and give occasion to great disorders and confusion  these two points may be easily united in one and the same man  a king forsakes his kingdom to visit the courts of several princes where he learns the manners and customs of different nations from hence there naturally arises a vast number of incidents of dangers and of adventures very useful for a political institution on the other side this absence gives way to the disorders which happen in his own kingdom and which end not till his return whose presence only can reestablish all things thus the absence of a king has the same effects in this fable as the division of the princes had in the former  the subjects have scarce any need but of one general maxim which is to suffer themselves to be governed and to obey faithfully whatever reason they may imagine against the orders they received it is easy to join this instruction with the other by bestowing on this wise and industrious prince such subjects as in his absence would rather follow their own judgment than his commands and by demonstrating the misfortunes which this disobedience draws upon them the evil consequences which almost infallibly attend these particular notions which are entirely different from the general idaea of him who ought to govern  but as it was necessary that the princes in the iliad should be choleric and quarrelsome so it is necessary in the fable of the odyssey that the chief person should be sage and prudent this raises a difficulty in the fiction because this person ought to be absent for the two reasons aforementioned which are essential to the fable and which constitute the principal aim of it but he cannot absent himself without offending against another maxim of equal importance viz that a king should upon no account leave his country  it is true there are sometimes such necessities as sufficiently excuse the prudence of a politician in this point but such a necessity is a thing important enough of it self to supply matter for another poem and this multiplication of the action would be vicious to prevent which in the first place this necessity and the departure of the hero must be disjoined from the poem and in the second place the hero having been obliged to absent himself for a reason antecedent to the action and placed distinct from the fable he ought not so far to embrace this oppornity of instructing himself as to absent himself voluntarily from his own government for at this rate his absence would be merely voluntary and one might with reason lay to his charge all the disorders which might arrive  thus in the constitution of the fable he ought not to take for his action and for the foundation of his poem the departure of a prince from his own country nor his voluntary stay in any other place but his return and this return retarded against his will this is the first idea homer gives us of it odyss   his hero appears at first in a desolate island sitting upon the side of the sea which with tears in his eyes he looks upon as the obstacle that had so long opposed his return and detained him from revisiting his own dear country  and lastly since this forced delay might more naturally and usually happen to such as make voyages by sea homer has judiciously made choice of a prince whose kingdom was in an island  let us see then how he has feigned all this action making his hero a person in years because years are requisite to instruct a man in prudence and policy  a prince had been obliged to forsake his native country and to head an army of his subjects in a foreign expedition having gloriously performed this enterprise he was marching home again and conducting his subjects to his own state but spite of all the attempts with which his eagerness to return had inspired him he was stopped by the way by tempests for several years and cast upon several countries differing from each other in manners and government in these dangers his companions not always following his orders perished through their own fault the grandees of his country strangely abuse his absence and raise no small disorders at home they consume his estate conspire to destroy his son would constrain his queen to accept of one of them for her husband and indulge themselves in all violence so much the more because they were persuaded he would never return but at last he returns and discovering himself only to his son and some others who had continued firm to him he is an eyewitness of the insolence of his enemies punishes them according to their deserts and restores to his island that tranquillity and repose to which they had been strangers during his absence  as the truth which serves for foundation to this fiction is that the absence of a person from his own home or his neglect of his own affairs is the cause of great disorders so the principal point of the action and the most essential one is the absence of the hero this fills almost all the poem for not only this real absence lasted several years but even when the hero returned he does not discover himself and this prudent disguise from whence he reaped so much advantage has the same effect upon the authors of the disorders and all others who knew him not as his real absence had before so that he is absent as to them till the very moment of their punishment  after the poet had thus composed his fable and joined the fiction to the truth he then makes choice of ulysses the king of the isle of ithaca to maintain the character of his chief personage and bestowed the rest upon telemachus penelope antinous and others whom he calls by what names he pleases  i shall not here insist upon the many excellent advices which are so many parts and natural consequences of the fundamental truth and which the poet very dexterously lays down in those fictions which are the episodes and members of the entire action such for instance are these advices not to intrude ones self into the mysteries of government which the prince keeps secret this is represented to us by the winds shut up in a bullhide which the miserable companions of ulysses would needs be so foolish as to pry into not to suffer ones self to be led away by the seeming charms of an idle and inactive life to which the sirens songs invited improba siren desidia horat not to suffer ones self to be sensualizd by pleasures like those who were changed into brutes by circe and a great many other points of morality necessary for all sorts of people  this poem is more useful to the people than the iliad where the subjects suffer rather by the ill conduct of their princes than through their own miscarriages but in the odyssey it is not the fault of ulysses that is the ruin of his subjects this wise prince leaves untried no method to make them partakers of the benefit of his return thus the poet in the iliad says he sings the anger of achilles which had caused the death of so many grecians and on the contrary in the  odyss   odyssey he tells his readers that the subjects perished through their own fault  sect iv of the unity of the fable aristotle bestows great encomiums on homer for the simplicity of his design because he has included in one single part all that happened at the siege of troy and to this he opposes the ignorance of some poets who imagined that the unity of the fable or action was sufficiently preserved by the unity of the hero and who composed their theseids heracleids and the like wherein they only heaped up in one poem every thing that happened to one personage  he finds fault with those poets who were for reducing the unity of the fable into the unity of the hero because one man may have performed several adventures which it is impossible to reduce under any one and simple head this reducing of all things to unity and simplicity is what horace likewise makes his first rule denique sit quodvis simplex duntaxat and unum  according to these rules it will be allowable to make use of several fables or to speak more correctly of several incidents which may be divided into several fables provided they are so ordered that the unity of the fable be not spoiled this liberty is still greater in the epic poem because it is of a larger extent and ought to be entire and complete  i will explain my self more distinctly by the practice of homer  no doubt but one might make four distinct fables out of these four following instructions   division between those of the same party exposes them entirely to their enemies   conceal your weakness and you will be dreaded as much as if you had none of those imperfections of which they are ignorant   when your strength is only feigned and founded only in the opinion of others never venture so far as if your strength was real   the more you agree together the less hurt can your enemies do you   it is plain i say that each of these particular maxims might serve for the groundwork of a fiction and one might make four distinct fables out of them may one not then put all these into one single epopea not unless one single fable can be made out of all the poet indeed may have so much skill as to unite all into one body as members and parts each of which taken asunder would be imperfect and if he joins them so as that this conjunction shall be no hindrance at all to the unity and the regular simplicity of the fable this is what homer has done with such success in the composition of the iliad    the division between achilles and his allies tended to the ruin of their designs   patroclus comes to their relief in the armor of this hero and hector retreats   but this young man pushing the advantage which his disguize gave him too far ventures to engage with hector himself but not being master of achilles s strength whom he only represented in outward appearance he is killed and by this means leaves the grecian affairs in the same disorder from which in that disguise he came to free them   achilles provoked at the death of his friend is reconciled and revenges his loss by the death of hector these various incidents being thus united do not make different actions and fables but are only the uncompleat and unfinished parts of one and the same action and fable which alone can be said to be complete and entire and all these maxims of the moral are easily reduced into these two parts which in my opinion cannot be separated without enervating the force of both the two parts are these concordia resparvae crescunt discordia magnae dilabuntur salust de bello jug that a right understanding is the preservation and discord the destruction of states  though then the poet has made use of two parts in his poems each of which might have served for a fable as we have observed yet this multiplication cannot be called a vicious and irregular polymythia contrary to the necessary unity and simplicity of the fable but it gives the fable another qualification altogether necessary and regular namely its perfection and finishing stroke  sect v of the action of the epic poem the action of a poem is the subject which the poet undertakes proposes and builds upon so that the moral and the instructions which are the end of the epic poem are not the matter of it those the poets leave in their allegorical and figurative obscurity they only give notice at the exordium that they sing some action the revenge of achilles the return of ulysses etc  since then the action is the matter of a fable it is evident that whatever incidents are essential to the fable or constitute a part of it are necessary also to the action and are parts of the epic matter none of which ought to be omitted such for instance are the contention of agamemnon and achilles the slaughter hector makes in the grecian army the re union of the greek princes and lastly the resettlement and victory which was the consequence of that reunion  there are four qualifications in the epic action the first is its unity the second its integrity the third its importance the fourth its duration  the unity of the epic action as well as the unity of the fable does not consist either in the unity of the hero or in the unity of time three things i suppose are necessary to it the first is to make use of no episode but what arises from the very platform and foundation of the action and is as it were a natural member of the body the second is exactly to unite these episodes and these members with one another and the third is never to finish any episode so as it may seem to be an entire action but to let each episode still appear in its own particular nature as the member of a body and as a part of it self not complete  of the beginning middle and end of the action aristotle not only says that the epic action should be one but adds that it should be entire perfect and complete and for this purpose ought to have a beginning a middle and an end these three parts of a whole are too generally and universally denoted by the words beginning middle and end we may interpret them more precisely and say that the causes and designs of an action are the beginning that the effects of these causes and the difficulties that are met with in the execution of these designs are the middle and that the unravelling and resolution of these difficulties are the end  the action of the iliad homers design in the iliad is to relate the anger and revenge of achilles the beginning of this action is the change of achilles from a calm to a passionate temper the middle is the effects of his passion and all the illustrious deaths it is the cause of the end of this same action is the return of achilles to his calmness of temper again all was quiet in the grecian camp when agamemnon their general provokes apollo against them whom he was willing to appease afterward at the cost and prejudice of achilles who had no part in his fault this then is an exact beginning it supposes nothing before and requires after it the effects of this anger achilles revenges himself and that is an exact middle it supposes before it the anger of achilles this revenge is the effect of it then this middle requires after it the effects of this revenge which is the satisfaction of achilles for the revenge had not been complete unless achilles had been satisfied by this means the poet makes his hero after he was glutted by the mischief he had done to agamemnon by the death of hector and the honor he did his friend by insulting over his murderer he makes him i say to be moved by the tears and misfortunes of king priam we see him as calm at the end of the poem during the funeral of hector as he was at the beginning of the poem whilst the plague raged among the grecians this end is just since the calmness of temper achilles re enjoyed is only an effect of the revenge which ought to have preceded and after this no body expects any more of his anger thus has homer been very exact in the beginning middle and end of the action he made choice of for the subject of his iliad  the action of the odyssey his design in the odyssey was to describe the return of ulysses from the siege of troy and his arrival at ithaca he opens this poem with the complaints of minerva against neptune who opposed the return of this hero and against calypso who detained him in an island from ithaca is this a beginning no doubtless the reader would know why neptune is displeased with ulysses and how this prince came to be with calypso he would know how he came from troy thither the poet answers his demands out of the mouth of ulysses himself who relates these things and begins the action by the recital of his travels from the city of troy it signifies little whether the beginning of the action be the beginning of the poem the beginning of this action is that which happens to ulysses when upon his leaving troy he bends his course for ithaca the middle comprehends all the misfortunes he endured and all the disorders of his own government the end is the reinstating of this hero in the peaceable possession of his kingdom where he was acknowledged by his son his wife his father and several others the poet was sensible he should have ended ill had he gone no farther than the death of these princes who were the rivals and enemies of ulysses because the reader might have looked for some revenge which the subjects of these princes might have taken on him who had killed their sovereigns but this danger over and the people vanquished and quieted there was nothing more to be expected the poem and the action have all their parts and no more  but the order of the odyssey differs from that of the iliad in that the poem does not begin with the beginning of the action  of the causes and beginning of the action the causes of the action are also what the poet is obliged to give an account of there are three sorts of causes the humors the interests and the designs of men and these different causes of an action are likewise often the causes of one another every man taking up those interests in which his humor ingages him and forming those designs to which his humor and interest incline him of all these the poet ought to inform his readers and render them conspicuous in his principal personages  homer has ingeniously begun his odyssey with the transactions at ithaca during the absence of ulysses if he had begun with the travels of his hero he would scarce have spoken of any one else and a man might have read a great deal of the poem without conceiving the least idea of telemachus penelope or her suitors who had so great a share in the action but in the beginning he has pitched upon besides these personages whom he discovers he represents ulysses in his full length and from the very first opening one sees the interest which the gods take in the action  the skill and care of the same poet may be seen likewise in inducing his personages in the first book of his iliad where he discovers the humors the interests and the designs of agamemnon achilles hector ulysses and several others and even of the deities and in his second he makes a review of the grecian and trojan armies which is full evidence that all we have here said is very necessary  of the middle or intrigue of the action as these causes are the beginning of the action the opposite designs against that of the hero are the middle of it and form that difficulty or intrigue which makes up the greatest part of the poem the solution or unravelling commences when the reader begins to see that difficulty removed and the doubts cleared up homer has divided each of his poems into two parts and has put a particular intrigue and the solution of it into each part  the first part of the iliad is the anger of achilles who is for revenging himself upon agamemnon by the means of hector and the trojans the intrigue comprehends the three days fight which happened in the absence of achilles and it consists on one side in the resistance of agamemnon and the grecians and on the other in the revengeful and inexorable humor of achilles which would not suffer him to be reconciled the loss of the grecians and the despair of agamemnon prepare for a solution by the satisfaction which the incensed hero received from it the death of patroclus joined to the offers of agamemnon which of it self had proved ineffectual remove this difficulty and make the untravelling of the first part  this death is likewise the beginning of the second part since it puts achilles upon the design of revenging himself on hector but the design of hector is opposite to that of achilles this trojan is valiant and resolved to stand on his own defense this valor and resolution of hector are on his part the cause of the intrigue all the endeavors achilles used to meet with hector and be the death of him and the contrary endeavors of the trojan to keep out of his reach and defend himself are the intrigue which comprehends the battle of the last day the unravelling begins at the death of hector and besides that it contains the insulting of achilles over his body the honors he paid to patroclus and the entreaties of king priam the regrets of this king and the other trojans in the sorrowful obsequies they paid to hectors body end the unravelling they justify the satisfaction of achilles and demonstrate his tranquillity  the first part of the odyssey is the return of ulysses into ithaca neptune opposes it by raising tempests and this makes the intrigue the unravelling is the arrival of ulysses upon his own island where neptune could offer him no farther injury the second part is the reinstating this hero in his own government the princes that are his rivals oppose him and this is a fresh intrigue the solution of it begins at their deaths and is completed as soon as the ithacans were appeased  these two parts in the odyssey have not one common intrigue the anger of achilles forms both the intrigues in the iliad and it is so far the matter of this epopea that the very beginning and end of this poem depend on the beginning and end of this anger but let the desire achilles had to revenge himself and the desire ulysses had to return to his own country be never so near allied yet we cannot place them under one and the same notion for that desire of ulysses is not a passion that begins and ends in the poem with the action it is a natural habit nor does the poet propose it for his subject as he does the anger of achilles  we have already observed what is meant by the intrigue and the unravelling thereof let us now say something of the manner of forming both these two should arise naturally out of the very essence and subject of the poem and are to be deduced from thence their conduct is so exact and natural that it seems as if their action had presented them with whatever they inserted without putting themselves to the trouble of a farther inquiry  what is more usual and natural to warriors than anger heat passion and impatience of bearing the least affront or disrespect this is what forms the intrigue of the iliad and every thing we read there is nothing else but the effect of this humor and these passions  what more natural and usual obstacle to those who take voyages than the sea the winds and the storms homer makes this the intrigue of the first part of the odyssey and for the second he makes use of almost the infallible effect of the long absence of a master whose return is quite despaired of viz the insolence of his servants and neighbors the danger of his son and wife and the sequestration of his estate besides an absence of almost twenty years and the insupportable fatigues joined to the age of which ulysses then was might induce him to believe that he should not be owned by those who thought him dead and whose interest it was to have him really so therefore if he had presently declared who he was and had called himself ulysses they would easily have destroyed him as an impostor before he had an opportunity to make himself known  there could be nothing more natural nor more necessary than this ingenious disguise to which the advantages his enemies had taken of his absence had reduced him and to which his long misfortunes had enured him this allowed him an opportunity without hazarding any thing of taking the best measures he could against those persons who could not so much as mistrust any harm from him this way was afforded him by the very nature of his action to execute his designs and overcome the obstacles it cast before him and it is this contest between the prudence and the dissimulation of a single man on one hand and the ungovernable insolence of so many rivals on the other which constitutes the intrigue of the second part of the odyssey  of the end or unravelling of the action if the plot or intrigue must be natural and such as springs from the very subject as has been already urged then the winding up of the plot by a more sure claim must have this qualification and be a probable consequence of all that went before as this is what the readers regard more than the rest so should the poet be more exact in it this is the end of the poem and the last impression that is to be stamped upon them  we shall find this in the odyssey ulysses by a tempest is cast upon the island of the phaeacians to whom he discovers himself and desires they would favor his return to his own country which was not very far distant one cannot see any reason why the king of this island should refuse such a reasonable request to a hero whom he seemed to have in great esteem the phaeacians indeed had heard him tell the story of his adventures and in this fabulous recital consisted all the advantage they could derive from his presence for the art of war which they admired in him his undauntedness under dangers his indefatigable patience and other virtues were such as these islanders were not used to all their talent lay in singing and dancing and whatsoever was charming in a quiet life and here we see how dexterously homer prepares the incidents he makes use of these people could do no less for the account with which ulysses had so much entertained them than afford him a ship and a safe convoy which was of little expense or trouble to them  when he arrived his long absence and the travels which had disfigured him made him altogether unknown and the danger he would have incurred had he discovered himself too soon forced him to a disguise lastly this disguise gave him an opportunity of surprising those young suitors who for several years together had been accustomed to nothing but to sleep well and fare daintily  it was from these examples that aristotle drew this rule that whatever concludes the poem should so spring from the very constitution of the fable as if it were a necessary or at least a probable consequence  sect vi the time of the action the time of the epic action is not fixed like that of the dramatic poem it is much longer for an uninterrupted duration is much more necessary in an action which one sees and is present at than in one which we only read or hear repeated besides tragedy is fuller of passion and consequently of such a violence as cannot admit of so long a duration  the iliad containing an action of anger and violence the poet allows it but a short time about forty days the design of the odyssey required another conduct the character of the hero is prudence and longsuffering therefore the time of its duration is much longer above eight years  the passions of the epic poem the passions of tragedy are different from those of the epic poem in the former terror and pity have the chief place the passion that seems most peculiar to epic poetry is admiration  besides this admiration which in general distinguishes the epic poem from the dramatic each epic poem has likewise some peculiar passion which distinguishes it in particular from other epic poems and constitutes a kind of singular and individual difference between these poems of the same species these singular passions correspond to the character of the hero anger and terror reign throughout the iliad because achilles is angry and the most terrible of all men the aeneid has all soft and tender passions because that is the character of aeneas the prudence wisdom and constancy of ulysses do not allow him either of these extremes therefore the poet does not permit one of them to be predominant in the odyssey he confines himself to admiration only which he carries to an higher pitch than in the iliad and it is upon this account that he introduces a great many more machines in the odyssey into the body of the action than are to be seen in the actions of the other two poems  the manners the manners of the epic poem ought to be poetically good but it is not necessary they be always morally so they are poetically good when one may discover the virtue or vice the good or ill inclinations of every one who speaks or acts they are poetically bad when persons are made to speak or act out of character or inconsistently or unequally the manners of aeneas and of mezentius are equally good considered poetically because they equally demonstrate the piety of the one and the impiety of the other  character of the hero it is requisite to make the same distinction between a hero in morality and a hero in poetry as between moral and poetical goodness achilles had as much right to the latter as aeneas aristotle says that the hero of a poem should be neither good nor bad neither advanced above the rest of mankind by his virtues or sunk beneath em by his vices that he may be the properer and fuller example to others both what to imitate and what to decline  the other qualifications of the manners are that they be suitable to the causes which either raise or discover them in the persons that they have an exact resemblance to what history or fable have delivered of those persons to whom they are ascribed and that there be an equality in them so that no man is made to act or speak out of his character  unity of the character but this equality is not sufficient for the unity of the character it is further necessary that the same spirit appear in all sort of encounters thus aeneas acting with great piety and mildness in the first part of the aeneid which requires no other character and afterward appearing illustrious in heroic valor in the wars of the second part but there without any appearance either of a hard or a soft disposition would doubtless be far from offending against the equality of the manners but yet there would be no simplicity or unity in the character so that besides the qualities that claim their particular place upon different occasions there must be one appearing throughout which commands over all the rest and without this we may affirm it is no character  one may indeed make a hero as valiant as achilles as pious as aeneas and as prudent as ulysses but it is a mere chimaera to imagine a hero that has the valor of achilles the piety of aeneas and the prudence of ulysses at one and the same time this vision might happen to an author who would suit the character of a hero to whatever each part of the action might naturally require without regarding the essence of the fable or the unity of the character in the same person upon all sorts of occasions this hero would be the mildest bestnaturd prince in the world and also the most choleric hardhearted and implacable creature imaginable he would be extremely tender like aeneas extremely violent like achilles and yet have the indifference of ulysses that is incapable of the two extremes would it not be in vain for the poet to call this person by the same name throughout  let us reflect on the effects it would produce in several poems whose authors were of opinion that the chief character of a hero is that of an accomplished man they would be all alike all valiant in battle prudent in council pious in the acts of religion courteous civil magnificent and lastly endued with all the prodigious virtues any poet could invent all this would be independent from the action and the subject of the poem and upon seeing each hero separated from the rest of the work we should not easily guess to what action and to what poem the hero belonged so that we should see that none of those would have a character since the character is that which makes a person discernable and which distinguishes him from all others  this commanding quality in achilles is his anger in ulysses the art of dissimulation in aeneas meekness each of these may be styled by way of eminence the character in these heroes  but these characters cannot be alone it is absolutely necessary that some other should give them a luster and embellish them as far as they are capable either by hiding the defects that are in each by some noble and shining qualities as the poet has done the anger of achilles by shading it with an extraordinary valor or by making them entirely of the nature of a true and solid virtue as is to be observed in the two others the dissimulation of ulysses is a part of his prudence and the meekness of aeneas is wholly employed in submitting his will to the gods for the making up this union our poets have joined together such qualities as are by nature the most compatible valor with anger meekness with piety and prudence with dissimulation this last union was necessary for the goodness of ulysses for without that his dissimulation might have degenerated into wickedness and doubledealing  sect vii of the machinery we come now to the machines of the epic poem the chief passion which it aims to excite being admiration nothing is so conducive to that as the mavelous and the importance and dignity of the action is by nothing so greatly elevated as by the care and interposition of heaven  these machines are of three sorts some are theological and were invented to explain the nature of god others are physical and represent things of nature the last are moral and are the images of virtues and vices  homer and the ancients have given to their deities the manners passions and vices of men their poems are wholly allegorical and in this view it is easier to defend homer than to blame him we cannot accuse him for making mention of many gods for his bestowing passions upon them or even introducing them fighting against men the scripture uses the like figures and expressions  if it be allowable to speak thus of the gods in theology much more in the fictions of natural philosophy where if a poet describes the deities he must give them such manners speeches and actions as are conformable to the nature of the things they represent under those divinities the case is the same in moral deities minerva is wise because she represents prudence venus is both good or bad because the passion of love is capable of these contrary qualities  since among the gods of a poem some are good some bad and some indifferently either and since of our passions we make so many allegorical deities one may attribute to the gods all that is done in the poem whether good or evil but these deities do not act constantly in one and the same manner  sometimes they act invisibly and by mere inspiration which has nothing in it extraordinary or miraculous being no more than what we say every day that some god has assisted us or some demon has instigated us  at other times they appear visibly and manifest themselves to men in a manner altogether miraculous and praeternatural  the third way has something of both the others it is in truth a miracle but is not commonly so accounted this includes dreams oracles etc  all these ways must be probable for so necessary as the mavelous is to the epic action as nothing is so conducive to admiration yet we can on the other hand admire nothing that we think impossible though the probability of these machines be of a very large extent since it is founded upon divine power it is not without limitations there are numerous instances of allowable and probable machines in the epic poems where the gods are no less actors than the men but the less credible sort such as metamorphoses etc are far more rare  this suggests a reflection on the method of rendering those machines probable which in their own nature are hardly so those which require only divine probability should be so disengaged from the action that one might substract them from it without destroying the action but those which are essential and necessary should be grounded upon human probability and not on the sole power of god thus the episodes of circe the sirens polyphemus etc are necessary to the action of the odyssey and yet not humanly probable yet homer has artificially reduced them to human probability by the simplicity and ignorance of the phaeacians before whom he causes those recitals to be made  the next question is where and on what occasions machines may be used it is certain homer and virgil make use of them every where and scarce suffer any action to be performed without them petronius makes this a precept per ambages deorumque ministeria etc the gods are mentioned in the very proposition of their works the invocation is addressed to them and the whole narration is full of them the gods are the causes of the action they form the intrigue and bring about the solution the precept of aristotle and horace that the unravelling of the plot should not proceed from a miracle or the appearance of a god has place only in dramatic poetry not in the epic for it is plain that both in the solution of the iliad and odyssey the gods are concerned in the former the deities meet to appease the anger of achilles iris and mercury are sent to that purpose and minerva eminently assists achilles in the decisive combat with hector in the odyssey the same goddess fights close by ulysses against the suitors and concludes that peace betwixt him and the ithacensians which compleats the poem  we may therefore determine that a machine is not an invention to extricate the poet out of any difficulty which embarrasses him but that the presence of a divinity and some action surprising and extraordinary are inserted into almost all the parts of his work in order to render it more majestic and more admirable but this mixture ought to be so made that the machines might be retrenched without taking any thing from the action at the same time it gives the readers a lesson of piety and virtue and teaches them that the most brave and the most wise can do nothing and attain nothing great and glorious without the assistance of heaven thus the machinery crowns the whole work and renders it at once mavelous probable and moral  the first book of the odyssey the argument minervas descent to ithaca the poem opens within forty eight days of the arrival of ulysses in his dominions he had now remained seven years in the island of calypso when the gods assembled in council proposed the method of his departure from thence and his return to his native country for this purpose it is concluded to send mercury to calypso and pallas immediately descends to ithaca she holds a conference with telemachus in the shape of mentes king of the taphians in which she advises him to take a journey in quest of his father ulysses to pylos and sparta where nestor and menelaus yet reigned then after having visibly displayed her divinity disappears the suitors of penelope make great entertainments and riot in her palace till night phemius sings to them the return of the grecians

pensive the rules the goddess gave he weighed stretched on the downy fleece no rest he knows and in his raptured soul the vision glows   observations on the first book observations on the first book we shall proceed in the same method through the course of these annotations upon the odyssey as in those upon the iliad considering homer chiefly as a poet endeavoring to make his beauties understood and not to praise without a reason given it is equally an extreme on the one hand to think homer has no human defects and on the other to dwell so much upon those defects as to depreciate his beauties the greater part of critics form a general character from the observation of particular errors taken in their own oblique or imperfect views which is as unjust as to make a judgment of the beauty of a mans body from the shadow it happens to cast in such or such a position to convince the reader of this intended impartiality we readily allow the odyssey to be inferior to the iliad in many respects it has not that sublimity of spirit or that enthusiasm of poetry but then it must be allowed if it be less noble it is more instructive the other abounds with more heroism this with more morality the iliad gives us a draught of gods and heroes of discord of contentions and scenes of slaughter the odyssey sets before us a scene more amiable the landschapes of nature the pleasures of private life the duties of every station the hospitality of ancient times a less busy but more agreeable portrait the iliad concludes with the ruin the odyssey with the happiness of a nation horace was of the same opinion as is evident from the epistle to lollius seditione dolis scelere libidine and ira iliacos intra muros peccatur and extra rursus quid virtus and quid sapientia possit utile proposuit nobis exemplar ulyssem   i verse   the man for wisdom etc homer opens his poem with the utmost simplicity and modesty he continually grows upon the reader non fumum ex fulgore sed ex fumo dare lucem cogitat ut speciosa dehinc miracula promat cicero lays this down as a rule for the orator principia verecunda non elatis intensa verbis and horace for the poet nec sic incipies etc he proposes the beginning of the odyssey as a pattern for all future poems and has translated them in his art of poetry dic mihi musa virum captae post tempora trojae qui mores hominum multorum vidit and urbes may i be forgiven the arrogance if i should offer a criticism upon this translation the sufferings of ulysses are the subject of the whole odyssey and yet horace has omitted the mention of those sufferings  there is another word also which seems essential that is  this is likewise omitted for the sufferings of ulysses and the wisdom by which he extricated himself from them enter into the very design of the poem but indeed in another place he has plainly had regard to all these circumstances qui domitor trojae multorum providus urbes et mores hominum inspexit latumque per aequor dum sibi dum sociis reditum parat aspera multa pertulit  epist ad loll i must also refute a criticism of rapin who will have it that the word  includes a character of craft and low cunning unworthy of a brave spirit but eustathius admirably vindicates the poet in this respect he shows us that  no where in homer signifies  or morals and that it implies a man who could accommodate himself to every condition of life one who in the worst estate had still a reserve to free himself from it it therefore says he signifies a man that through experience has learned wisdom i have likewise the authority of horace for this sense in the above cited passage qui domitor trojae multorum providus urbes i take providus in this place to signify not only a man who noted the manners of various nations with care but also one who in calamity could foresee methods to extricate himself from it and surely nothing can be more unjust than what rapin objects against ulysses in employing his wisdom only in his own preservation while all his companions were lost homer himself sufficiently refutes this objection and directly tells us that he employed his wisdom in the care of their safety but that they through their folly defeated his wisdom the words of homer says eustathius show that a wise man neglects not his friends in adversity but says rapin what could oblige homer to begin with so dishonorable an action and place the greatest weakness of his hero in the very frontispiece of his poem and invoke his muse to sing the man who with difficulty saved himself and suffered his companions to be destroyed there had been some weight in this objection if ulysses had saved his own with the loss of their lives but i cannot see any dishonor in his preserving himself by wisdom when they destroyed themselves by folly it was chiefly by storms that they perished it can be no imputation to his character not to be able to restrain the effects of a tempest he did all that a wise man could do he gave them such admonitions upon every emergency that if they had pursued them they had been preserved as well as ulysses  ii verse i for wisdoms various arts renowned bossus observation in relation to this epithet  given to ulysses is worth transcribing the fable of the odyssey says he is wholly for the conduct and policy of a state therefore the quality it requires is wisdom but this virtue is of too large an extent for the simplicity which a just and precise character requires it is therefore requisite it should be limited the great art of kings is the mystery of dissimulation it is well known that lewis the eleventh for the instruction of his son reduced all the latin language to these words only viz qui nescit dissimulare nescit regnare twas likewise by this practice that saul began his reign when he was first elected and as yet full of the spirit of god the first thing we read of him in holy writ is ille vero dissimulabat se audire reg lib   that he made as if he did not hear the words which seditious people spoke against him  this then is the character which the greek poet gives his ulysses in the proposition of his poem he calls him  to denote this prudent dissimulation which disguised him so many ways and put him upon taking so many shapes  without mentioning any thing of circe who detained him with her a whole year and who was famous for the transformations she made of all sorts of persons the reader finds him at first with calypso the daughter of wise atlas who bore up the vast pillars that reached from earth to heaven and whose knowledge penetrated into the depths of the unfathomable ocean that is to say who was ignorant of nothing in heaven earth or sea and as the first product and principal part of so high so solid and so profound a knowledge was to know how to conceal ones self this wise man called his daughter by a name that signified a  secret the poet makes his hero whom he designed for a politician to stay seven whole years with this nymph she taught him so well that afterward he lost no opportunity of putting her lessons in practice for he does nothing without a disguise at his parting from ogygia he is cast upon the isle of phaeaca as kind as his reception was yet he stays till the night before he went off ere he would discover himself from thence he goes to ithaca the first adventure that happened to him there was with minerva the most prudent among the deities as ulysses was the most prudent among men she says so expressly in that very passage nor did they fail to disguise themselves minerva takes upon her the shape of a shepherd and ulysses tells her he was obliged to fly from crete because he had murdered the son of king idomeneus the goddess discovers her self first and commends him particularly because these artifices were so easy and natural to him that they seemed to be born with him afterward the hero under the form of a beggar deceives first of all eumeus then his son and last of all his wife and every body else till he found an opportunity of punishing his enemies to whom he discovered not himself till he killed them namely on the last night after his discovering himself in the palace he goes the next day to deceive his father appearing at first under a borrowed name before he would give him joy of his return thus he takes upon him all manner of shapes and dissembles to the very last but the poet joins to this character a valor and a constancy which render him invincible in the most daring and desperate adventures  iii verse   who when his arms had wrought the destined fall of sacred troy  whence is it that ulysses is said to have overthrown troy and not achilles who was of more remarkable courage than ulysses eustathius tells us that the destruction of troy ought to be ascribed chiefly to ulysses as he not only took away the palladium but was the inventor of the stratagem of the wooden horse by which that city was conquered virgil in his second book of the aeneis gives a noble description of its destruction by which we find that ulysses was not only the contriver of its ruin but bore a great share in the actions of the night in which that city was overturned  iv verse   vain toils their impious folly etc by this single trait homer marks an essential difference between the iliad and the odyssey namely that in the former poem the people perished by the folly of their kings quicquid delirunt reges plectuntur achivi in this the people perish by their own folly while their prince omits nothing to procure their felicity a plain reason why the odyssey is more calculated for the people than the iliad dacier  v verse    oh snatch some portion of these acts from fate it may be asked why the poet invokes the muse to recount only part of the sufferings of ulysses and why those words to us also are inserted to the first it may be answered that an heroic poem dwells chiefly upon incidents of importance and passes over every thing that does not contribute to raise our idea of the hero or to the main design of the poem to the other eustathius answers several ways either says he the word  is to be taken as an expletive as it is in a thousand places in homer or it means that this is a subject so considerable that it will be a theme to many poets or that being a true history it had spread over many nations of the world and that homer himself received the story of the poem from egypt and then the meaning will be sing oh muse to the greeks as well as to other nations the sufferings of ulysses i should prefer the first as being the most natural the rest seem forced and consequently improper for the opening of a poem where the utmost plainness is necessary especially if we consider that ulysses was a grecian and it is not probable that the grecians should be the least acquainted with the story or the latest to celebrate the actions of a grecian  vi verse    now at their native realms the greeks arrived it is necessary for the better understanding of the poem to fix the period of time from which it takes its beginning homer as eustathius observes does not begin with the wanderings of ulysses he steps at once into the latter end of his actions and leaves the preceding story to be told by way of narration thus in his iliad he dates his poem from the anger of achilles which happened almost at the conclusion of the trojan war from hence horace drew his observation in his art poet semper ad eventum festinat and in medias res non secus ac notas auditorem rapit there are but forty eight days from the departure of ulysses from calypso to his discovery in ithaca he had been one year with circe and seven with calypso when the gods dispatched mercury to that goddess from which point of time we are to date the odyssey  this observation gives a reason why the poet invokes the muse to recount the wanderings of this hero in part only for ulysses as appears from the beginning of the ninth book after he left the shores of troy was driven to ismarus of the ciconians an historian must have begun from the fall of troy and related his wanderings with truth and order for history is chiefly for instruction but a poet takes another method and disposes every circumstance arbitrarily he chooses or rejects as suits best with his principal design and in such a manner as to give at once delight and instruction  vii verse    calypso in her cave constrained his stay to the remark before cited of bossu upon the abode of ulysses with calypso may be added this of the abbe fraguier that his residing seven years in the caves of calypso the goddess of secrecy may only be meant that he remained so long hid from the knowledge and enquiry of all men or that whatever befell him in all that time was lost to history or made no part in the poem  viii verse    all but the ruthless monarch of the main it may be asked why neptune is thus enraged against ulysses homer himself tells us it was because that hero had put out the eye of his son cyclops but if we take neptune by way of allegory for the ocean the passage implies that the sufferings of ulysses were chiefly by sea and therefore poetry which adds a grandeur to the meanest circumstance introduces the god of it as his greatest enemy eustathius  ix verse  0 in aethiopia etc strabo in his first book delivers his opinion that the ancient grecians included all those people who lived upon the southern ocean from east to west in the general name of aethiopians and that it was not confined to those only who lay south of egypt ptolomy says that under the zodiac from east to west inhabit the aethiopians black of color and elsewhere the same geographer divides aethiopia into the eastern and the western these eastern and western aethiopians were separated by the arabian or egyptian gulf which though never mentioned by homer as aristarchus remarked yet it is not probable says strabo that he should be ignorant of it it being but a thousand stadia distant from the mediterranean when he knew the egyptian thebes which was four times as far off strab plin spondan  i will not repeat what was observed upon the gods being gone to the aethiopians in the first book of the iliad it is sufficient in general to observe that the aethiopians were a people very religious toward the gods and that they held a pompous feast twelve days annually to their honor and in particular that the poet very judiciously makes use of this solemnity to remove neptune out of the way who was the enemy of ulysses that he may with the greater security bring off his hero from calypsos island eustathius  x verse    aegysthus it is difficult to find a reason why in the original jupiter should give such an honorable appellation to aegysthus as  unblameable who had dishonored the bed of agamemnon and taken his life away especially in that very instant when he condemns the fact with so great solemnity eustathius says that homer an enemy to censure and invective introduces that god as having respect only to his good qualities and commending him for his general character and adds that it had been an indecency in the poet to have given countenance to that base custom by the authority of jupiter dacier is not satisfied with this reason and tells us that homer gives aegysthus this title to vindicate jupiter from the imputation of his crimes he gives us to understand that heaven is not the cause of mans failings that he is by creation able to act virtuously and that it is through his own misconduct that he deviates into evil and therefore the meaning is this  jupiter calling to mind aegysthus that aegysthus whom he had created wise and virtuous and made capable to sustain that character and this agrees admirably with the beginning of the speech of jupiter who there vindicates his own divinity  but if this should seem too refined it may be sufficient to take the word in that good sense which aegysthus might have deserved for many good qualities thus achilles is called the swift of foot even while he stands or sleeps the first being his general character it may be further confirmed by a passage something resembling it in the holy scriptures the egyptian midwives were guilty of a lie to pharaoh and yet god pardons it and blesses them he blesses them not because they lied but because they preserved the children of the israelites  xi verse    jupiter s speech the solemnity and sententiousness of this speech is taken notice of by eustathius and surely poetry must be highly valuable when it delivers such excellent instructions it contained the whole of religion amongst the ancients and made philosophy more agreeable this passage is an instance of it a passage worthy of a christian it shows us that the supreme being is sovereignly good that he rewards the just and punishes the unjust and that the folly of man and not the decree of heaven is the cause of human calamity  xii verse    hermes i sent etc it would be endless to observe every moral passage in the odyssey the whole of it being but one lesson of morality but surely it must be a pleasure to the reader to learn what notions the ancients had of a deity from the oldest book extant except the book of moses  jupiter here declares that he never fails to warn mankind from evil and that he had sent by mercury for this purpose to aegysthus it may be asked what is this mercury whom jupiter sends it is the light of nature which heaven implants in the breast of every man and which as cicero says is not only more ancient than the world but coeval with the master of the world himself he writes to this effect there was from the beginning such a thing as reason a direct emanation from nature it self which prompted to good and averted from evil a reason which did not then become a law when it was first reduced to writing but was so even from the moment it existed and it existed from ever of an equal date with the divine intelligence it is the true and primordial law proper to command and to forbid it is the reason of the great jupiter  that reason of the supreme being is here called mercury that reason flowing from god which is constantly dictating to the most corrupted hearts this is good or this is evil hence arose an ancient proverb recorded by simplicius reason is a mercury to all men epictetus lib   arrian says apollo knew that laius would not obey his oracle apollo nevertheless did not neglect to prophecy to laius those evils that threatened him the goodness of the divinity never fails to advertise mankind that source of truth is ever open and free but men are ever incredulous disobedient and rebellious dacier  xiii verse    minerva s speech it may be asked what relation ulysses has to aegysthus that the mention of the one should immediately give occasion for the remembrance of the other and it may appear unnatural in the poet to give rise to his poem by so unexpected a transition from aegysthus to ulysses eustathius vindicates homer by showing that it is not only beautiful but natural to take rise from what offers it self to our immediate observation what can be more natural when jupiter is relating how he punishes the wicked than for wisdom or minerva to suggest that the good ought to be rewarded there is no forced introduction no artful preparation but the whole arises from the occasion which is a great beauty eustathius  xiv verse    amidst an isle etc there was according to true history such an island of calypso of which strabo writes that solon gives an account of the island atlantis bordering upon egypt and that he went thither to make enquiry and learned that an island was once there but by time was vanished eustathius  xv verse    atlas her sire to whose farpiercing eye the wonders of the deep expanded lie the eternal columns which on earth he rears end in the starry vault and prop the spheres atlas is here said to understand all the depths of the sea but the epithet  applied to him has two different significations it implies either one whose thoughts are full of terrible and dismal things or one who has infinite knowledge and unbounded views and it is doubtful which of them homer means to reconcile both may we not think our author had heard something of the ancient tradition which makes atlas the same person with enoch and represents him as a great astronomer who prophesied of the universal deluge and exhorted mankind to repentance therefore he named his son methuselah to show that after his death the waters should overspread the face of the earth his continual lamentations on this occasion caused him to be called the weeper for the world is always an enemy to melancholy predictions thus homer upon the credit of this tradition might very well call atlas one whose thoughts ran upon dismal things or one whose views and cares were vastly extended  i insist no otherwise upon this but as a conjecture yet it is further strengthened by what follows in the next lines that atlas sustains those columns which being fixed upon the earth support the heavens this is generally interpreted of his great skill in astronomy and geography but may not the reason be more particular since atlas or enoch had prophesied of the deluge and since that prediction was looked upon as the effect of his skill in astronomy might it not be said he knew the abysses of the sea and sustained the pillars of heaven to express that he knew how the fountains of the deep and the waters above the heavens should unite to drown the earth  as to the image of the pillars of heaven it is frequent in the sacred books and used to express the height of vast mountains  pindar calls aetna the  and there might probably be something more particular that furnished homer with this idea i mean the pillars of hercules wellknown in his time and neighboring to the mountain he describes dacier  see the description of this mountain in the  th book of virgil where the same image is preserved without any hint of allegory as indeed it is no more than a poetical manner of expressing the great height and extensive prospect of the mountain  xvi verse    to see the smoke from his loved palace rise there is an agreeable tenderness in this image and nothing can better paint the ardent desire a man naturally has to review his native country after a long absence this is still stronger than that which cicero extols in several places of his works that ulysses preferred the sight of ithaca to the immortality proffered him by calypso he here desires to purchase at the price of his life the pleasure not of returning to his country but even of seeing at a distance the very smoke of it dacier  there are some things dispersed in this speech of pallas which i shall lay together as that minerva makes it an aggravation to the calamity of ulysses to be detained by a goddess that loves him that he is enclosed in an island and she adds round which the seas flow as if that was not common to all islands but these expressions are used to show the impossibility of the escape of ulysses without the interposition of jupiter  in the conclusion she observes that ulysses never neglected to sacrifice before troy this is said to show the great piety of ulysses who not only paid his sacrifices in ithaca where he abounded in riches but amongst strangers in an enemys country where there might be a scarcity of offerings eustathius  xvii verse    daughter what words etc this verse is frequently repeated both in the iliad and the odyssey it has here a particular energy jupiter reproves minerva for supposing he could ever be unmindful of an hero so pious as ulysses it is spoken with vehemence an instance says eustathius that it is not only equitable but an attribute of divinity for rulers to remember those who serve them faithfully  xviii verse    tavenge his giantson it is artful in the poet to tell the reader the occasion of the sufferings of ulysses in the opening of the poem it is a justice due to his character to show that his misfortunes are not the consequence of his crimes but the effect of neptunes anger  it is observable that homer does not stop to explain how ulysses put out the eye of the cyclops he hastens forward into the middle of his poem and leaves that for the future narration of ulysses  xix verse   0 mean time telemachus  demands my care etc rapin has raised several objections against this piece of conduct in homer he tells us that the action of the odyssey is imperfect that it begins with the voyages of telemachus and ends with those of ulysses that the four first books are all concerning telemachus that his voyage bears no proportion to that of ulysses that it contributes nothing to his return which is brought about by jupiter and the assistance of the phaeacians that this gave occasion to beni in his academical discourses to assert that the fable of the odyssey is double that the four first books of it are neither episode nor part of an action nor have any connection with the rest of the work  i am of opinion that these objections are made with too great severity the destruction of the suitors is the chief hinge upon which the poem turns as it contributes chiefly to the reestablishment of ulysses in his country and regality and whatever contributes to this end contributes to the principal action and is of a piece with the rest of the poem and that this voyage does so is evident in that it gives a defeat to the suitors and controuls their insolence it preserves ulyssess throne and bed inviolate in that it gives telemachus courage to resist their attempts it sets his character in a fair point of light who is the second personage of the poem and is to have a great share in the future actions of it  eustathius judiciously observes that homer here prepares the way for the defeat of the suitors the chief design of his poem and lays the groundwork of probability on which he intends to build his poem and reconcile it to the rules of credibility  if it be asked for what end this voyage of telemachus is made the answer is to enquire after ulysses so that whatever episodes are interwoven ulysses is still in view and whatever telemachus acts is undertaken solely upon his account and consequently whatever is acted contributes to the principal design the restoration of ulysses so that the fable is entire and the action not double  it is to be remembered also that the sufferings of ulysses are the subject of the poem his personal calamities are not only intended but his domestic misfortunes and by this conduct homer shows us the extent of his misfortunes his queen is attempted his throne threatened and his wealth consumed in riot ulysses suffers in telemachus and in every circumstance of life is unhappy  xx verse     to distant sparta and the spacious waste of sandy pyle rapin is very severe upon this conduct when telemachus says he is to search for his father in the courts of greece he cannot make the least progress without minerva it is she who inspires his thoughts and assists in the execution could not honor duty or nature have moved his heart toward an absent father the machine adds he has not the least appearance of probability inasmuch as the goddess conducts him to every place except only where ulysses resides of which she ought by no means to be ignorant upon the account of her divinity  but surely nothing can be be more natural than for a son in order to gain intelligence of an absent father to enquire in those places and of those persons where and from whom he is most likely to have information such is the conduct of telemachus and poetry which delights in the wonderful because this conduct agrees with wisdom ascribes it to minerva the goddess of it no doubt but minerva knew where ulysses resided but men must act as men such an immediate interposition as rapin requires had stopped at once the fountain of the poets invention if what a poet invents be natural it is justifiable and he may give the rein to his imagination if he restrain it from running into extravagance and wildness  xxi verse     it is mine to form his green unpracticed years etc in this the poet draws the outlines of what he is to fill up in the four subsequent books and nothing can give us a greater idea of his unbounded invention than his building upon so plain a foundation such a noble superstructure he entertains us with variety of episodes historical relations and manners of those ancient times it must be confessed that the characters in the odyssey and the number of the chief actors are but few and yet the poet never tires he varies and diversifies the story so happily that he is continually opening new scenes to engage our attention he resembles his own proteus he is capable of all shapes yet in all shapes the same deity  xxii verse     mentes the monarch of the taphian land we are told by tradition that homer was so sensible of friendship that to do honor to his particular friends he immortalized their names in his poems in the iliad he has shown his gratitude to tychius and in the odyssey to mentes phemius and mentor this mentes was a famous merchant of the isle of leucade who received homer at smyrna and made him his companion in all his voyages it is to this mentes we owe the two poems of homer for the poet in all probability had never wrote them without those lights and informations he received and the discoveries he was enabled to make by those travels homer is not contented to give his name to the king of the taphians but feigns also that the goddess of wisdom chose to appear in his shape preferably to that of all the kings who were nearer neighbors to ithaca eustathius thinks there might have been a real king of taphos of this name who was a friend to ulysses this may possibly be but i would choose to adhere rather to the old tradition as it does honor to friendship dacier  xxiii verse     enormous riot and misrule this is the first appearance of the suitors and the poet has drawn their pictures in such colors as are agreeable to their characters through the whole poem they are as horace expresses it  fruges consumere nati sponsi penelopes nebulones  the poet gives a fine contrast between them and telemachus he entertains himself with his own thoughts weighs the sum of things and beholds with a virtuous sorrow the disorders of the suitors he appears like ulysses among his transformed companions in the tenth book a wife man among brutes  xxiv verse     at chess they vie to captivate the queen divining of their loves  there are great disputes what this game was at which the suitors played athenaeus relates it from apian the grammarian who had it from cteson a native of ithaca that the sport was in this manner the number of the suitors being  0  they equally divided their men or balls that is to say    on each side these were placed on the board opposite to each other between the two sides was a vacant space in the midst of which was the main mark or queen the point which all were to aim at they took their turns by lot he who took or displaced that mark got his own in its place and if by a second man he again took it without touching any of the others he won the game and it passed as an omen of obtaining his mistress this principal mark or queen was called by whatever name the gamesters pleased and the suitors gave it the name of penelope  it is said this game was invented by palamedes during the siege of troy  sophocles in palam eustath spondan dacier  xxv verse     grieved that a visitant so long should wait the reader will lose much of the pleasure of this poem if he reads it without the reflection that he peruses one of the most ancient books in the world it sets before him persons places and actions that existed three thousand years ago here we have an instance of the humanity of those early ages telemachus pays a reverence to this stranger only because he is a stranger he attends him in person and welcomes him with all the openness of ancient hospitality  xxvi verse     etc the feast described there is nothing that has drawn more ridicule upon homer than the frequent descriptions of his entertainments it has been judged that he was more than ordinarily delighted with them since he omits no opportunity to describe them nay his temperance has not been unsuspected according to that verse of horace laudibus arguitur vini vinosus homerus but we must not condemn without stronger evidence a man may commend a sumptuous entertainment or good wines without being either a drunkard or a glutton but since there are so many entertainments described in the poem it may not be improper to give this some explanation  they wash before the feast perhaps says eustathius because they always at the feast made libations to the gods the ewer was of gold the vessel from whence the water was poured of silver and the cups out of which they drank were of gold  a damsel attends mentes but heralds wait upon the suitors eustathius observes a decency in this conduct the suitors were lewd debauchees and consequently a woman of modesty would have been an improper attendant upon such a company beautiful youths attended the company in quality of cupbearers  a matron who has charge of the household  brings in the bread and the cold meats for so eustathius interprets  an officer whose employ it was to portion out the victuals brings in the meats that furnished out the rest of the entertainment and after the feast a bard diverts them with vocal and instrumental music  dacier is in great pain about the cold victuals she is afraid lest the reader should think them the leavings of a former day and tells us they might possibly be in the nature of our cold tongues jambons etc but i think such fears to be groundless we must have reference to the customs of those early ages and if it was customary for cold meats to be served up neither is it necessary to suppose them the leavings of the former entertainment it can be no disgrace to the hospitality of telemachus  xxvii verse     to phemius was consigned the chorded lyre in ancient times princes entertained in their families certain learned and wise men who were both poets and philosophers and not only made it their business to amuse and delight but to promote wisdom and morality ulysses at his departure for troy left one of these with penelope and it was usual to consign in this manner the care of their wives and families to the poets of those days as appears from a signal passage in the third book verse of the original     etc to this man homer gives the name of phemius to celebrate one of his friends who was so called and who had been his praeceptor says eustathius i must add one remark that though he places his master here in no very good company yet he guards his character from any imputation by telling us that he attended the suitors by compulsion this is not only a great instance of his gratitude but also of his tenderness and delicacy  xxviii verse     all who deserved his choice   it is evident from this and many places in the iliad that hospitality was hereditary an happiness and honor peculiar to these heroic ages and surely nothing can set the character of ulysses in a more agreeable point of light than what telemachus here delivers of it he was the friend of all mankind eustathius observes that  has a middle signification that it implies that ulysses behaved benevolently to all men or that all men behaved benevolently to ulysses either sense makes ulysses a very amiable person he must be a friend to all men to whom all men are friends  xxix verse     i steer my voyage to the brutian strand in the country of the brutians in the lower part of italy was a town called temese that homer here meant this city and not one of the same name in cyprus appears not only because this was famous for works of brass but because as strabo observes ithaca lay in the direct way from taphos to this city of the brutii whereas it was considerably out of the way to pass by ithaca to that of cyprus the same author says that the rooms for preparing of brass were remaining in his time though then out of use ovid met    hippotadaeque domos regis temesesque metalla and statius sylv  se totis temese dedit hausta metallis bochart is of opinion that the name of temese was given to this town by the phenicians from the brass it produced temes in their language signifying fusion of metals an art to which the phenicians much applied themselves eustat dacier  xxx verse     laertes s retirement this most beautiful passage of laertes has not escaped the censure of the critics they say acts an unmanly part he forgets that he is a king and reduces himself unworthily into the condition of a servant eustathius gives two reasons for his retirement which answer those objections the first is that he could not endure to see the outrage and insolence of the suitors the second that his grief for ulysses makes him abandon society and prefer his vineyard to his court this is undoubtedly the picture of human nature under affliction for sorrow loves solitude thus it is as dacier well observes that menedemus in terence laments his lost son menedemus is the picture of laertes nor does it make any difference that the one is a king the other a person of private station kings are but enobled humanity and are liable as other men to as great if not greater sensibility  the word   creeping about his vineyard has also given offense as it carries an idea of meanness with it but eustathius observes that it excellently expresses the melancholy of laertes and denotes no meanness of spirit the same word is applied to the great achilles in the iliad when he laments at the obsequies of patroclus and horace no doubt had it in his view  tacitum sylvas interreptare salubreis  xxxi verse     among a savage race etc it is the observation of eustathius that what minerva here delivers bears resemblance to the oracles in which part is false part true that ulysses is detained in an island is a truth that he is detained by barbarians a falsehood this is done by the goddess that she may be thought to be really a man as she appears to be she speaks with the dubiousness of a man not the certainty of a goddess she raises his expectation by showing she has an insight into futurity and to engage his belief she discovers in part the truth to telemachus neither was it necessary or convenient for telemachus to know the whole truth for if he had known that ulysses inhabited a desert detained by a goddess he must of consequence have known of his return for he that could certify the one could certify the other and so had never gone in search of him and it would hence have happened that homer had been deprived of giving us those graces of poetry which arise from the voyage of telemachus eustathius  xxxii verse     to prove a genuine birth etc there is an appearance of something very shocking in this speech of telemachus it literally runs thus my mother assures me that i am the son of ulysses but i know it not it seems to reflect upon his mothers chastity as if he had a doubt of his own legitimacy this seeming simplicity in telemachus says eustathius is the effect of a troubled spirit it is grief that makes him doubt if he can be the son of the great the generous ulysses it is no reflection upon penelope and consequently no fault in telemachus it is an undoubted truth that the mother only knows the legitimacy of the child thus euripides  that is the mother knows the child the father only believes it  thus also menander   that is no man knows assuredly who begot him we only guess it and believe it  aristotle in his rhetoric is also of this opinion  what i have here said is translated literally from eustathius and if it edifies the reader i am content but the meaning of the passage is this mentes asks telemachus if he be the son of ulysses he replies  so my mother assures me but nothing sure so wretched as i am could proceed from that great man  but however this may be reconciled to truth i believe few ladies would take it as a compliment if their sons should tell them there was some room to doubt of their legitimacy there may be abundance of truth in it and yet very little decency  xxxiii verse  0  now snatched by harpies etc the meaning of this expression is that ulysses has not had the rites of sepulture this among the ancients was esteemed the greatest of calamities as it hindered the shades of the deceased from entering into the state of the happy  xxxiv verse     to tempt the spouseless queen  resort the nobles it is necessary to reconcile the conduct of the suitors to probability since it has so great a share in the process of the odyssey it may seem incredible that penelope who is a queen in whom the supreme power is lodged should not dismiss such unwelcome intruders especially since many of them were her own subjects besides it seems an extraordinary way of courtship in them to ruin the person to whom they make their addresses  to solve this objection we must consider the nature of the grecian governments the chief men of the land had great authority though the government was monarchical it was not despotic laertes was retired and disabled with age telemachus was yet in his minority and the fear of any violence either against her own person or against her son might deter penelope from using any endeavors to remove men of such insolence and such power dacier  xxxv verse     to taint with deadly drugs the barbed dart it is necessary to explain this passage it seems at first view as if ulysses had requested what a good man could not grant ilus says mentes denied the poison because he feared the anger of the gods and the poison it self is called by homer  as if it were designed against mankind eustathius defends ulysses variously he intended says he to employ it against beasts only that infested his country or in hunting he assigns another reason and says that the poet is preparing the way to give an air of probability to the destruction of the suitors he poisons his arrows that every wound may be mortal on this account the poison may be called  for it is certain in the wars of troy poisoned arrows were not in use for many persons who were wounded recovered so that of necessity they must be reserved for domestic occasions from what has been said we may collect the reason why anchialus granted the poison to ulysses and ilus denied it anchialus was the friend of ulysses and knew that he would not employ it to any ill purpose but ilus who was a stranger to him was afraid lest he should abuse it eustathius  xxxvi verse   0 dismissed with honor let her hence repair i will lay before the reader literally what eustathius observes upon these words there is a soloecism says he in these verses or words that cannot be reduced to the rules of construction it should be  not  how then comes the accusative case to be used instead of the nominative mentes adds he may be supposed to have intended to have said  send thy mother away but considering in the midst of the sentence that such advice was not suitable to be given to telemachus he checks himself and suppresses  and no other word immediately occurring that required an accusative case he falls into a soloecism  but perhaps this is more ingenious than true though mentes was in haste when he spoke it homer was not when he composed it might not an error creep into the original by the negligence of a transcriber who might write  for  this is the more probable because the one stands in the verse in every respect as well as the other  what eustathius adds is very absurd he says that telemachus must observe both the interpretations either send thy mother away or let thy mother retire so that the advice was double send thy mother away if thou do not love her but if thou art unwilling to grieve her let her recess be voluntary  xxxvii verse     omend voice  of jove there is a difficulty in this passage in any case of enquiry any words that were heard by accident were called by the latins omens by homer the voice of jupiter and he styles them so because it is through his providence that those words come to our knowledge  signifies fame or rumor and the ancients referred all voices or sounds to jupiter and stilled him  so that the voice of jove implies any words that we hear by chance from whence we can draw any thing that gives light to our concerns or enquiries dacier eustathius  xxxviii verse     have thou not heard etc it may seem that this example of orestes does not come fully up to the purpose intended there is a wide difference in the circumstances orestes slew an adulterer and a single person with an adulteress the designs of telemachus are not against one but many enemies neither are they adulterers nor have they slain the father of telemachus as is the case of orestes nor is penelope an adulteress the intent therefore of the goddess is only to show what a glorious act it is to defend our parents orestes says mentes is every where celebrated for honoring his father and thou shall obtain equal honor by defending thy mother  the sense that  here bears is remarkable it signifies not only a person who kills his own father but who kills the father of any other person eustathius  xxxix verse      with eaglespeed she cut the sky instant invisible  i pass over the several interpretations that have been given to the word  some say it implies she flew up the chimney etc in reality it signifies a species of an eagle but it may also signify the same as  invisible either of the latter senses are natural or both together like an eagle she disappeared eustathius  xl verse   0 hushed in attention to the warbled song there may be two reasons why this is inserted either the suitors were pleased with the sweetness of the song or the subject of it they sat attentive to hear the death of ulysses in the process of his story this gives us a reason why immediately penelope descended to stop the song she feared lest he might touch upon the story of ulysses and say that he died in his return this would have reduced her to the utmost necessity and she could not have deferred to marry phemius would have certainly found credit for poets were believed to be inspired by the gods they were looked upon as prophets and to have something of divinity in them as appears from demodocus in the  th book of the odyssey besides there was a further necessity to put a stop to the song if phemius had declared him to be dead penelope could not have avoided marriage if alive the suitors might have desisted or armed themselves against ulysses and then their deaths one of the principal incidents of the poem could not have followed neither could telemachus have gone in search of his father if he had foreknown his death or sudden return it is therefore artful in the poet to cut the song short he reserves the story of ulysses for future narration and brings all this about by a very probable method by the interposition of penelope who requests that some other story may be chosen a story that she can hear without sorrow  it is very customary for women to be present at the entertainments of men as appears from the conduct of helen arete nausicaa and penelope in diverse parts of the odyssey she is here introduced with the greatest decency she enters not the room but stands with tears at the threshold and even at that distance appears with her face shaded by a veil eustathius  xli verse     often jove s aetherial rays etc telemachus here reproves his mother for commanding phemius to desist or not to make ulysses the subject of his song by saying that it was not in the poets own power to choose his subject which was frequently dictated and inspired by the gods this is a particular instance of the opinion the ancients held as to the immediate inspiration of their poets the words in the original evidently bear this sense if the subject displease you it is not the poet but jupiter is to blame who inspires men of invention as he himself pleases and mad dacier strangely mistakes this passage in rendering it it is not the poet but jupiter who is the cause of our misfortunes for it is he who dispenses to wretched mortals good or evil as he pleases at the same time she acknowledges the word  which she here renders laborious or wretched to signify persons of wit in the beginning of lib   and persons of skill and ability in their art in lib     xlii verse     your widowed hours apart with female toil etc these verses are taken literally from the  th book of the iliad except that  is inserted instead of  eustathius explains the passage thus women are not forbid entirely to speak for women are talking animals  they have the faculty of talking and indeed are rational creatures but they must not give too much liberty to that unruly member in the company of men sophocles advises well  o woman silence is the ornament of thy sex madam dacier though she plunders almost every thing has spared this observation  xliii verse     the speech of antinous antinous and eurymachus are ithacensians and are called the chief of the suitors it is therefore necessary to distinguish their characters antinous is violent and determined against ulysses eurymachus more gentle and subtle antinous derides eurymachus flatters  this speech of antinous is a concealed raillery he tells telemachus that jove inspires his soul with wisdom but means that his education has been such that he had learned nothing from man he wishes out of a seemingly kind concern for him that he may never reign in ithaca because the weight of a crown is a burden and concludes with mentioning his hereditary title to it to insinuate that is his by descent only and not by merit  telemachus in his answer wisely dissembles the affront of antinous he takes it in the better sense and seems to differ only in opinion about the regality think you says he that to be a king is to be miserable to be a king in my judgment is to enjoy affluence and honor he asserts his claim to the succession of his father yet seems to decline it to lay the suspicions of the suitors asleep that they may not prevent the measures he takes to obtain it eustathius  the speech of eurymachus confirms the former observation that this suitor is of a more soft and moderate behavior than antinous he clothes ill designs with a seeming humanity and appears a friend while he carries on the part of an enemy telemachus had said that if it was the will of jupiter he would ascend the throne of ithaca eurymachus answers that this was as the gods should determine an insinuation that they regarded not his claim from his father telemachus said he would maintain himself in the possession of his present inheritance eurymachus wishes that no one may arrive to dispossess him the latent meaning of which is we of your own country are sufficient for that design if these observations of eustathius be true eurymachus was not a less enemy than antinous but a better dissembler  xliv verse   0 the sage euryclea euryclea was a very aged person she was bought by laertes to nurse ulysses and in her old age attends telemachus she cost laertes twenty oxen that is a certain quantity of money  which would buy twenty oxen or perhaps the form of an ox was stamped upon the metal and from thence had its appellation  the simplicity of these heroic times is remarkable an old woman is the only attendant upon the son of a king she lights him to his apartment takes care of his clothes and hangs them up at the side of his bed greatness then consisted not in show but in the mind this conduct proceeded not from the meanness of poverty but from the simplicity of manners eustathius  having now gone through the first book i shall only observe to the reader that the whole of it does not take up the compass of an entire day when minerva appears to telemachus the suitors were preparing to sit down to the banquet at noon and the business of the first book concludes with the day it is true that the gods hold a debate before the descent of minerva and some small time must be allowed for that transaction it is remarkable that there is not one simile in this book except we allow those three words to be one  the same observation is true of the first book of the iliad see the notes on that place    the second book of the odyssey the argument the council of ithaca telemachus in the assembly of the lords of ithaca complains of the injustice done him by the suitors and insists upon their departure from his palace appealing to the princes and exciting the people to declare against them the suitors endeavor to justify their stay at least till he shall send the queen to the court of icarius her father which he refuses there appears a prodigy of two eagles in the sky which an augur expounds to the ruin of the suitors telemachus then demands a vessel to carry him to pylos and sparta there to enquire of his fathers fortunes pallas in the shape of mentor an ancient friend of ulysses helps him to a ship assists him in preparing necessaries for the voyage and embarks with him that night which concludes the second day from the opening of the poem  the scene continues in the palace of ulysses in ithaca  wk pfourdrinier sc  the second book of the odyssey now redning from the dawn the morning ray glowed in the front of heaven and gave the day the youthful hero with returning light rose anxious from thinquietudes of night a royal robe he wore with graceful pride a twoedged faulchion

life impair and grief destroy what time a while would spare thus he the matron with uplifted eyes attests the allseeing sovereign of the skies then studious she prepares the choicest flour the strength of wheat and wines an ample store while to the rival train the prince returns the martial goddess with impatience burns like thee telemachus in voice and size with speed divine from street to street she flies she bids the mariners prepared to stand when night descends embodyed on the strand then to noemon swift she runs she flies and asks a bark the chief a bark supplies and now declining with his sloping wheels down sunk the sun behind the western hills the goddess should the vessel from the shores and stowed within its womb the naval stores full in the openings of the spacious main it rides and now descends the sailor train next to the court impatient of delay with rapid step the goddess urged her way there every eye with flumbrous chains she bound and dashed the flowing goblet to the ground drowzy they rose with heavy fumes oppressed reeled from the palace and retired to rest then thus in mentors reverend form arrayed spoke to telemachus the martial maid lo on the seas prepared the vessel stands the impatient mariner thy speed demands swift as she spoke with rapid pace she leads the footsteps of the deity he treads swift to the shore they move along the strand the ready vessel rides the sailors ready stand he bids them bring their stores the attending train load the tall bark and launch into the main the prince and goddess to the stern ascend to the strong stroke at once the rowers bend full from the west she bids fresh breezes blow the sable billows foam and roar below the chief his orders gives thobedient band with due observance wait the chiefs command with speed the mast they rear with speed unbind the spacious sheet and stretch it to the wind high over the roaring waves the spreading sails bow the tall mast and swell before the gales the crooked keel the parting surge divides and to the stern retreating roll the tides and now they ship their oars and crown with wine the holy goblet to the powers divine imploring all the gods that reign above but chief the blueeyd progeny of jove thus all the night they stem the liquid way and end their voyage with the morning ray wk pfsc    observations on the second book observations on the second book i this book opens with the first appearance of telemachus upon the stage of action and bossu observes the great judgment of the poet in beginning with the transactions of ithaca in the absence of ulysses by this method he sets the conduct of telemachus penelope and the suitors in a strong point of light they all have a large share in the story of the poem and consequently ought to have distinguishing characters it is as necessary in epic poetry as it is on the theater to let us immediately into the character of every person whom the poet introduces this adds perspicuity to the story and we immediately grow acquainted with each personage and interest our selves in the good or ill fortune that attends them through the whole relation  telemachus is now about twenty years of age in the eleventh book the poet tells us he was an infant in the arms of his mother when ulysses sailed to troy that hero was absent near twenty years and from hence we may gather the exact age of telemachus he is every where described as a person of piety to the gods of duty to his parents and as a lover of his country he is prudent temperate and valiant and the poet well sets off the importance of this young hero by giving him the goddess of war and wisdom for his constant attendant  ii verse     in his hand a ponderous javelin shined the poet describes telemachus as if he were marching against an enemy or going to a council of war rather than to an assembly of peers in his own country two reasons are assigned for this conduct either this was the common usage of princes in those times or telemachus might look upon the suitors as enemies and consequently go to council in arms as against enemies eustathius  iii verse    two dogs a faithful guard attend behind this passage has not escaped the raillery of the critics they look upon it as a mean description of a hero and a prince to give him a brace of dogs only for his guards or attendants but such was the simplicity of ancient princes that except in war they had rarely any attendants or equipage and we may be confident homer copies after the custom of the time unless we can be so absurd as to suppose he would feign low circumstances unnecessarily through a want of judgment  virgil judged otherwise and thought this circumstance worthy of his imitation quin etiam gemini custodes limine ab alto procedunt gressumque canes comitantur herilem   achiles is described in the iliad with the same attendants  nine large dogs domestic at his board b     poetry observes dacier is like painting which draws the greatest beauties from the simplest customs and even in history we receive a sensible pleasure from the least circumstance that denotes the customs of ancient times it may be added that the poet as well as the painter is obliged to follow the customs of the age of which he writes or paints a modern dress would ill become achilles or ulysses such a conduct would be condemned as an absurdity in painting and ought to be so in poetry  iv verse    yet still his antiphus he loves he mourns homer says eustathius inserts these particularities concerning the family of aegyptius to give an air of truth to his story it does not appear that aegyptius knew the certainty of the death of antiphus for it is the poet who relates it and not the father whence as dacier observes should he learn it he only laments him according to the prevailing opinion that all the companions of ulysses were lost with ulysses  v verse    since great ulysses etc we are here told that there never had been any council convened in ithaca since the departure of ulysses the general design and moral of the odyssey is to inform us of the mischievous effects which the absence of a king and father of a family produces we deprive as bossu observes the poem of its very soul and spoil the fable if we retrench from it the disorders which the suitors create in the absence of ulysses both in his family and dominions nothing can give us a greater image of those disorders than what is here related what must a kingdom suffer in twenty years without a ruler without a council to make laws or punish enormities such is the condition of ithaca laertes is superannuated penelope oppressed by the violence of the suitors and telemachus to this time in his minority  it is very artful in the poet to open the assembly by aegyptius telemachus was the person who convened it and being the greatest personage present it might be expected that he should open the design of it but to give telemachus courage who was young and inexperiencd aegyptius first rises and by praising the person who had summoned them of whom he seems ignorant gives telemachus to understand he has friends among the assembly this he could no other way so safely have done considering the power of the suitors by this means telemachus is encouraged to speak boldly and arraign the disorders of the suitors with the utmost freedom  vi verse    your father and your king telemachus here sets the character of ulysses as a king in the most agreeable point of light he ruled his people with the same mildness as a father rules his children this must needs have a very happy effect upon the audience not only as it shows ulysses to have been a good governor but as it recalls the memory of the happiness they received from that mild government and obliquely condemns them of ingratitude who had forgot it by this method also the poet interests us deeply in the sufferings of ulysses we cannot see a good man and good king in distress without the most tender emotions  vii verse    yet more  our house etc what telemachus here says has given offense to the critics they think it indecent for a son to say that he bears with more regret the disorder of his family than the loss of his father yet this objection will vanish if we weigh penelope telemachus and his whole posterity against the single person of ulysses  but what chiefly takes away this objection is that telemachus was still in hopes of his fathers return for  does not imply necessarily his death but absence and then both with justice and decency telemachus may say that he grieves more for the destruction of his family than for the absence of ulysses  viii verse    scarce all my herds their luxury suffice this passage is ridiculed by the critics they set it in a wrong light and then grow very pleasant upon it telemachus makes a sad outcry because the suitors eat his sheep his beeves and fatted goats and at last falls into tears the truth is the riches of kings and princes in those early ages consisted chiefly in flocks and cattle thus aeneas and paris are described as tending their flocks etc and abraham in the scriptures as abounding in this kind of wealth  these critics would form a different idea of the state and condition of telemachus if they considered that he had been capable to maintain no fewer than an hundred and eight persons in a manner very expensive for many years for so many with their attendants were the suitors as appears from the   th book and at the same time he kept up the dignity of his own court and lived with great hospitality  but it is a sufficient answer to the objections against this passage to observe that it is not the expense but manner of it that telemachus laments this he expressly declares by the word  and surely a sober man may complain against luxury without being arraigned of meanness and against profusion without being condemned for parsimony  ix verse    themis who gives to councils or denies success eustathius observes that there was a custom to carry the statue of themis to the assemblies in former ages and carry it back again when those assemblies were dissolved and thus themis may be said to form and dissolve an assembly dacier dislikes this assertion as having no foundation in antiquity she thinks that the assertion of telemachus is general that he intimates it is justice alone that establishes the councils of mankind and that injustice confounds and brings the wicked designs of men to confusion  i have followed this interpretation not only as it suits best with the usual morality of homer but also as jupiter is mentioned with themis and no such custom is pretended concerning his statue he is expressly styled by the ancients  in sicily there was an altar of  or of jupiter who presides over councils eustathius from herodotus  x verse    be you the spoilers and our wealth consume to understand this passage we must remember as eustathius remarks that telemachus is pleading his cause before the ithacensians them he constitutes the judges of his cause he therefore prevents an answer which they might make viz we are not the men that are guilty of these outrages telemachus rejoins it were better for me to suffer from your hands for by your quiescence you make my affairs desperate an intimation that they should rise in his defense  xi verse    the big round tear hung trembling in his eye this passage is not one of those where the poet can be blamed for causing a hero to weep if we consider the youth of telemachus together with the tenderness agreeable to that time of life the subjects that demand his concern the apprehension of the loss of a father and the desolate state of his mother and kingdom all these make his readiness to burst into tears an argument not of any want of spirit in him but of true sense and goodness of nature and is a great propriety which shows the right judgment of the poet  xii verse    oh insolence of youth etc we find antinous always setting himself in the strongest opposition to telemachus and therefore he is the first that falls by the spear of ulysses the poet observes justice and as antinous is the first in guilt he is the first in punishment what antinous says in this speech concerning the treachery of the female servant of penelope prepares the way for the punishment ulysses inflicts on some of the maids in the conclusion of the poem this is an act of poetical justice and it is as necessary in epic as in tragic poetry to reward the just and punish the guilty eustathius  xiii verse    elusive of the bridal day she gives fond hopes to all and all with hopes deceives it will be necessary to vindicate the character of penelope the heroine of the poem from the aspersions of antinous it must be confessed that she has a very hard game to play she neither dares consent nor deny if she consents she injures ulysses whom she still expects to return if she denies she endangers the throne and the life of telemachus from the violence of the suitors so that no other method is left but to elude their addresses  i must not conceal what eustathius has mentioned from some authors as lycophron etc who say that penelope was  in plain english an harlot and he quotes herodotus as affirming that she had a son named pan by hermes but the bishop declares it is all a scandal and every body must conclude the same from her conduct as described in homer  to vindicate her in this place we must consider who it is that speaks antinous an unsuccessful lover and what he blames as a crime is really her glory he blames her because she does not comply with their desires and it had been an act of guilt to have complied he himself sufficiently vindicates her in the conclusion of his speech where he extols her above all the race of womankind so that the seeming inconsistence of penelope must be imputed to the necessity of her affairs she is artful but not criminal  the original says she deceived the suitors by her messages a plain intimation that she used no extraordinary familiarities with her admirers and through the whole course of the poem she seldom appears in their assemblies  xiv verse  0  cease till to great laertes i bequeath a task of grief his ornaments of death it was an ancient custom to dedicate the finest pieces of weaving and embroidery to honor the funerals of the dead and these were usually wrought by the nearest relations in their lifetime thus in the   d iliad andromache laments that the body of hector must be exposed to the air without those ornaments    and the mother of euryalus in virgil to her son   nec te tua funera matter produxi pressive oculos aut vulnera lavi vest tegens tibi quam noctes festina diesque urgebam and tela curas solabar aniles xv verse   0 she shines with fatal excellence to thee eustathius observes that antinous in the opening of his speech throws the fault upon penelope to engage the favor of the multitude but being conscious that he had said things which penelope would resent he extols her in the conclusion of it he ascribes an obstinacy of virtue to her and by this double conduct endeavors to make both penelope and the multitude his friends  xvi verse     telemachus s reply telemachus every where speaks with an openness and bravery of spirit this speech is a testimony of it as well as his former he answers chiefly to the dismission of penelope says it would be an offense against heaven and earth and concludes with a vehemence of expression and tells antinous that such a word  shall never fall from his tongue  the critics have found fault with one part of the speech as betraying a spirit of avarice and meanness in telemachus how to icarius in the bridal hour shall i by waste undone refund the dower they think it unworthy of telemachus to make the dower of penelope an argument against her dismission and consequently ascribe his detention of her not to duty but to covetousness to take away this objection they point the verses in a different manner and place a stop after  and then the sense runs thus i cannot consent to dismiss her who bore me and nursed me in my infancy while her husband is absent or perhaps dead besides hard would be the punishment i should suffer if i should voluntarily send away penelope to icarius  dacier dislikes this solution and appeals to the customs of those ages to justify her opinion if a son forced away his mother from his house he was obliged to restore her dower and all she brought in marriage to her husband but if she retired voluntarily to engage in a second marriage the dower remained with the son as lawful heir this opinion of dacier may be confirmed from demosthenes in his orations  afterward upon the decease of her husband leaving his family and receiving back her portion etc the same author adds that the reason why the suitors are so urgent to send away penelope is that she may choose to marry some one of them rather than return to icarius so that telemachus only takes hold of their argument for her dismission in order to detain her they addressed penelope more for the sake of her riches than her beauty for she must be about forty years old and he tells them that if he sends her away against her consent he must restore those riches which they covet more than the person of penelope this i confess is very refined and perhaps it may be sufficient to take off the objection of covetousness in telemachus to understand no more than what the words at the first view seem to imply viz an abhorrence of their riots described by telemachus to have risen to such a degree as to have almost ruined his kingdom and made their demands impossible i see nothing unnatural or mean in this interpretation especially if we remember that the prodigious disorders of his family enter into the essence of the poem the greater the disorders are the greater are the sufferings of ulysses  xvii verse     how from my father should i vengeance dread there is an ambiguity in the word father it may either signify icarius or ulysses as eustathius observes but i think the context determines the person to be ulysses for telemachus believes him to be yet living and consequently might fear his vengeance if he offered any indignity to penelope  xviii verse     and while in wrath to vengeful fiends she cries how from their hell would vengeful fiends arise in the ninth iliad we are told that the father of phaenix imprecated the furies against his son my sire with curses loads my hated head and cries  ye furies barren be his bed infernal jove the vengeful fiends below and ruthless proserpine confirmed his vow in the same book the furies hear the curses of althea upon her son she beat the ground and called the powers beneath on her own son to wreak her brothers death hell heard her curses from the realms profound and the fell fiends who walk the nightly round these passages show the opinion the ancients had of the honor due from children to parents to be such that they believed there were furies particularly commissioned to punish those who failed in that respect and to fulfill the imprecations made against em by their offended parents there is a greatness in this idea and it must have had an effect upon the obedience of the youth we see telemachus is full of the sense of it dacier  xix verse     etc the prodigy of the two eagles this prodigy is ushered in very magnificently and the verses are lofty and sonorous the eagles are ulysses and telemachus by jove s command they fly from a mountains height this denotes that the two heroes are inspired by jupiter and come from the country to the destruction of the suitors the eagles fly with wing to wing conjoined this shows that they act in concert and unity of councils at first they float upon the wind this implies the calmness and secresy of the approach of those heroes at last they clang their wings and hovering beat the skies this shows the violence of the assault with ardent eyes the rival train they threat this as the poet himself interprets it denotes the approaching fate of the suitors then failing over the domes and towers they fly full toward the east this signifies that the suitors alone are not doomed to destruction but that the men of ithaca are involved in danger as halitherses interprets it nor to the great alone is death decreed we and our guilty ithaca must bleed   see here the natural explication of this prodigy which is very ingenious eustathius verbatim  xx verse  0  i see i cried his woes  i see his friends overwhelmed etc in three lines observes eustathius the poet gives us the whole odyssey in miniature and it is wonderful to think that so plain a subject should produce such variety in the process of it aristotle observes the simplicity of homers platform which is no more than this a prince is absent from his country neptune destroys his companions in his absence his family is disordered by many princes that address his wife and plot against the life of his only son but at last after many storms he returns punishes the suitors and reestablishes his affairs this is all that is essential to the poem the rest of it is made up of episodes and yet with what miracles of poetry  speciosa miracula as horace styles them has he furnished out his poem  xxi verse  0  the speech of eurymachus it has been observed that homer is the father of oratory as well as poetry and it must be confessed that there is not any one branch of it that is not to be found in his poetry the invective persuasive ironical etc may all be gathered from it nothing can be better adapted to the purpose than this speech of eurymachus he is to decry the credit of the predictions of halitherses he derides he threats and describes him as a venal prophet he is speaking to the multitude and endeavors to bring halitherses into contempt and in order to it he uses him contemptuously  xxii verse      all the greeks have heard my wrongs it is necessary for the reader to carry in his mind that this assembly consists not only of the peers but of the people of ithaca for to the people telemachus here appeals  it is evident that the place of the assembly was at least open to the air in the upper parts for otherways how should the eagles be visible to the suitors and so very plainly as to be discovered to threat them with their eyes there was no doubt a place set apart for council usually in the market for telemachus is said to seat himself in his fathers throne in the beginning of this book but ulysses had been absent twenty years and therefore it is evident that his throne had stood in the same place for the space of twenty years it is past contradiction that in athens and other cities of greece there were  public halls for the consultation of affairs  xxiii verse     mentor arose ulysses faithful friend the name of mentor is another instance of the gratitude of our poets temper it being the same which belonged to a friend of his by whom he was entertained in ithaca during a defluxion on his eyes which seized him in his voyages and at whose house he is said to have laid the plan of this poem this character of mentor is well sustained by his speech and by the assistance he gratefully gives to young telemachus on all occasions  xxiv verse     guard thou my sire and his behests obey the original says only  obey the old man eustathius rightly determines that the expression means laertes the poet loses no opportunity of giving ulysses an excellent character this is as necessary as continually to repeat the disorders of the suitors  servetur ad imum qualis ab incoepto processerit and sibi constet this conduct contributes admirably to the design of the poem and when the poet in the unravelling of his fable comes to reward and punish the chief actors we acknowledge his justice in the death of the suitors and reestablishment of ulysses  xxv verse     while the bowl circles and the banquet warms the original is not without obscurity it says  or in the time of the banquet eustathius interprets it  the wine as it were fighting on their side and this agrees with what follows  the design of this speech is to deter the people of ithaca from rising in the cause of ulysses mentor speaks justly leocritus insolently mentor sets before them the worth of ulysses leocritus the power of the suitors mentor speaks like a brave man leocritus observes eustathius like a coward who wanting true courage flies to the assistance of wine to raise a false one  perhaps it may be objected that there is not a sufficient distinction in the characters of the several suitors they are all described as insolent voluptuaries but though they agree in this general character yet there is something distinguishing in the particular persons thus antinous derides eurymachus covers villainy with mildness antinous is ever the foremost in outrage eurymachus generally his second a greater distinction is neither necessary nor possible to be represented what the poet is to describe is the insolence of the suitors and the disorders they create in his family and kingdom he is obliged to dwell upon these circumstances because they are essential to his design and consequently that general resemblance of their characters is not a fault in the poet  xxvi verse     then with a rushing sound etc the assembly which was convened by telemachus is broke up in a riotous manner by leocritus who had no right to dissolve it this agrees with the lawless state of the country in the absence of its king and shows says eustathius that the suitors had usurped the chief authority  there is a fine contraste between the behavior of telemachus and that of the suitors they return to repeat their disorders and debauches telemachus retires to supplicate the goddess of wisdom to assist him in his enterprises thus the poet raises the character of telemachus he has showed him to be a youth of a brave spirit a good speaker and here represents him as a person of piety  xxvii verse  0  the speech of minerva this speech of minerva is suited to encourage a young man to imitate the virtue of his father and not to suffer himself to be overcome by any appearance of difficulties she sets his father before his eyes and tells him there was never any danger which he durst not encounter if he should suffer himself to be discouraged he would prove himself an unworthy son of a brave father dacier eustathius  xxviii verse     antinous s speech this speech must be understood ironically  is used as before and has relation to the preceding harangues of telemachus to the people and his intended voyage by way of derision antinous bids him not trouble his brave spirit in contriving any more orations or in any bold attempt to find out ulysses or to act the orator or heros part  the critics have almost generally condemned these pieces of gayety and raillery as unworthy of heroic poetry if ever they are proper they must be so in the mouths of these suitors persons of no serious or noble characters mirth wine and feasting is their constant employment and consequently if they fall into absurdities they act suitably to their characters milton the best and greatest imitator of homer has followed him unworthily in this respect i mean has debased even this low raillery into greater lowness by playing upon words and syllables but in this place the raillery is not without its effect by showing the utmost contempt of telemachus and surely it is the lowest degree of calamity to be at once oppressed and despised  xxix verse     to pyle or sparta to demand supplies it is observable says eustathius that the poet had in his choice several expedients to bring about the destruction of the suitors but he rejects them and chooses the most difficult method out of reverence to truth being unwilling to falsify the histories of sparta and pylos this has a double effect it furnishes the poet with a series of noble incidents and also gives an air of probability to the story of ulysses and telemachus  xxx verse     the royal palace to the queen convey the suitors allot the palace to penelope it being says eustathius the only thing that they cannot consume and adds that the expression of the suitors concerning the labor they should undergo in dividing the substance of ulysses shows the wealth and abundance of that hero dacier has found out an allusion between  in the first speech and  in the second they differing only in one letter she calls this a beauty which she laments she cannot preserve in her translation she is the only commentator that ever was quicksighted enough to make the discovery the words have no relation they stand at a sufficient distance and i believe homer would have thought such trifling unworthy of his poetry so that all the honor which accrues from that observation must be ascribed in this case as in many others to the commentator and not the author  xxxi verse     where lay the treasures of the ithacian race such passages as these have ever furnished critics with matter of raillery they think such household cares unworthy of a king and that this conduct suits better with vulgar persons of less fortune i confess such descriptions now would be ridiculous in a poet because unsuitable to our manners but if we look upon such passages as pictures and exact representations of the old world the reader will find a sensible pleasure in them  it is a true observation that the iliad is chiefly suitable to the condition of kings and heroes and consequently filled with circumstances in which the greatest part of mankind can have no concern or interest the odyssey is of more general use the story of it is a series of calamities which concern every man as every man may feel them we can bring the sufferings of ulysses in some degree home to our selves and make his condition our own but what private person can ever be in the circumstances of agamemnon or achilles what i would infer from this is that the reader ought not to take offense at any such descriptions which are only mean as they differ from the fashions of the latter ages in the iliad achilles when he acts in the common offices of life and not as an hero is liable to the same objection but if the manners of the ancient ages be considered we shall be reconciled to the actions of the ancient heroes and consequently to homer  xxxii verse      oh thou whose guardian care nursed the most wretched king euryclea was not properly the nurse of telemachus but of ulysses so that she is called so not in a strict sense but as one concerned in his education from his infancy and as a general appellation of honor telemachus here reserves the best wines for ulysses a lesson observes eustathius that even in the smallest matters we ought to pay a deference to our parents these occasional and seeminglytrivial circumstances are not without their use if not as poetical ornaments yet as moral instructions  xxxiii verse     till twice six times descends the lamp of day it may be demanded how it was probable if possible that the departure of telemachus could be concealed twelve days from the knowledge of so fond a mother as penelope it must be allowed that this would not be possible except in a time of such great disorder as the suitors created penelope confined herself almost continually within her own apartment and very seldom appeared publicly so that there is no improbability in this relation dacier  it may be added that though telemachus enjoined secrecy for twelve days yet he intended a very speedy return and we find that he actually returned in a much shorter space than twelve days so that the strictness of the injunction proceeds solely from filial love and was only cautionary against accidents that might detain him longer  eustathius makes a criticism upon the words  and  the former is used negatively the latter affirmatively namely the former in swearing not to perform a thing the latter to perform it  xxxiv verse     she bids the mariners etc it is probable that this passage of minerva preparing the mariners etc is thus to be understood the men of ithaca retaining in memory the speech of telemachus and believing that what he then said and now requests was agreeable to justice and having as it were his image graven upon their hearts voluntarily resolve to lend him assistance so that minerva is to be taken allegorically to imply that it was every persons own reason that induced him to assist telemachus eustathius  xxxv verse     noemon  the bark supplies it may be asked why this particularity is necessary and may it not be thought that such a little circumstance is insignificant the answer is that a great deal depends upon this particularity no less than the discovery of the voyage of telemachus to the suitors and consequently whatever the suitors act in order to intercept him takes its rise from this little incident the fountain is indeed small but a large stream of poetry flows from it  xxxvi verse     there every eye with flumbrous chains she bound the words in the original are  and  which are not to be taken for being asleep but drowzy this is evident from the usage of  in the conclusion of the first book of the iliad where the signification has been mistaken by most translators they make jupiter there to be asleep though two lines afterward in the second book homer expressly says the immortals slumberd on their thrones above all but the everwaking eyes of jove it may be asked how minerva can be said to occasion this drowziness in the suitors and make them retire sooner than usual eustathius replies that the person who furnished the wine supplied it in greater quantities than ordinary through which wine they contracted a drowziness in this sense minerva or wisdom may be said to assist the designs of telemachus  xxxvii verse   0 she bids fresh breezes blow this also is an allegory and implies that the sailors had the experience and art to guide the ship before the winds but poetry that delights to raise every circumstance exalts it into the mavelous and ascribes it to the goddess of wisdom eustathius  xxxviii verse     with speed the mast they rear etc it is observable that homer never passes by an opportunity of describing the sea or a ship under sail and in many other places as well as in this he dwells largely upon it i take the reason to be not only because it furnished him with variety of poetical images but because he himself having made frequent voyages had a full idea of it and consequently was delighted with it this is evident from his conduct in the iliad were variety of allusions and similitudes are drawn from the sea and are not the smallest ornaments of his poetry  xxxix verse   0  and crown with wine the holy goblet to the powers divine this custom of libations was frequent upon all solemn occasions before meat before sleep voyages journies and in all religious rites sacrifices etc they were always made with wine pure and unmixed whence  is a word frequent in ancient authors sometimes they used mixed wine in sacrifices but eustathius says that this mixture was of wine with wine and not of wine with water hence came the distinction of  and  the unlawful and lawful libation wine unmixed was lawful the mixed unlawful homer in this place uses  or goblets crowned with wine that is filled till the wine stood above the brim of the goblet they esteemed it an irreverence to the gods not to fill the cups full for then only they esteemed the libation whole and perfect  and then only worthy of the gods  this book takes up the space of one day and one night it opens with the morning the speeches in the council with the preparations for the voyage of telemachus are the subject of the day and the voyage is finished by the next morning by this last circumstance we may learn that ithaca was distant from pylos but one nights voyage nay something less there being some time spent after the setting of the sun in carrying the provisions from the palace to the vessel  the book consists chiefly in the speeches of telemachus and his friends against those of the suitors it shows the great judgment of the poet in choosing this method hence we see the causes preceding the effects and know from what spring every action flowed we are never at a loss for a reason for every incident the speeches are as it were the groundwork upon which he builds all that relates to the adventures of telemachus  in the iliad after the dissolution of the council in the first book and the dissension between agamemnon and achilles we immediately see upon what hinge the fable turns so in the odyssey after the poet has laid before us the warm debates between the suitors and telemachus we immediately expect them to act as enemies the war is declared and we become judges as well as spectators of the scenes of action thus homer adds the perspicuity of history to the ornaments of poetry    the third book of the odyssey the argument the interview of telemachus and nestor telemachus guided by pallas in the shape of mentor arrives in the morning at pylos where nestor and his sons are sacrificing on the seashore to neptune telemachus declares the occasion of his coming and nestor relates what past in their return from troy how their fleets were separated and he never since heard of ulysses they discourse concerning the death of agamemnon the revenge of orestes and the injuries of the suitors nestor advises him to go to sparta and enquire further of menelaus the sacrifice ending with the night minerva vanishes from them in the form of an eagle telemachus is lodged in the palace the next morning they sacrifice a bullock to minerva and telemachus proceeds on his journey to sparta attended by pisistratus  the scene lies on the seashore of pylos  wk pfsc  the third book of the odyssey the sacred sun above the waters raised through heavens eternal brazen portals blazed and wide over earth diffused his chearing ray to gods and men to give the golden day now on the coast of pyle the vessel falls before old neleus venerable walls there suppliant to the monarch of the flood at nine green theaters the pylians stood each held five hundred a deputed train at each

thy friend she spoke and led the way with swiftest speed as swift the youth pursued the way she led and joined the band before the sacred fire where sat encompast with his sons the sire the youth of pylos some on pointed wood transfixed the fragments some prepared the food in friendly throngs they gather to embrace their unknown guests and at the banquet place pisistratus was first to grasp their hands and spread soft hydes upon the yellow sands along the shore the illustrious pair he led where nestor sat with youthful thrasymed to each a portion of the feast he bore and held the golden goblet foaming over then first approaching to the elder guest the latent goddess in these words addressed whoever thou art whom fortune brings to keep these rites of neptune monarch of the deep thee first it fits oh stranger to prepare the due libation and the solemn prayer then give thy friend to shed the sacred wine though much thy younger and his years like mine he too i deem implores the powers divine

back to thy native islands might thou sail and leave halfheard the melancholy tale nine painful years on that detested shore what stratagems we formed what toils we bore still laboring on till scarce at last we found great jove propitious and our conquest crowned far over the rest thy mighty father shined in wit in prudence and in force of mind art thou the son of that illustrious sire with joy i grasp thee and with love admire so like your voices and your words so wise who finds thee younger must consult his eyes thy sire and i were one nor varied aught in public sentence or in private thought alike to council or the assembly came with equal souls and sentiments the same but when by wisdom won proud ilion burned and in their ships the conquering greeks returned twas gods high will the victors to divide and turn the event confounding human pride some he destroyed some scattered as the dust not all were prudent and not all were just then discord sent by pallas from above stern daughter of the great avenger jove the brotherkings inspired with fell debate who called to council all the achaian state but called untimely not the sacred rite observed nor heedful of the setting light nor herald sworn the session to proclaim sour with debauch a reeling tribe they came to these the cause of meeting they explain and menelaus moves to cross the main not so the king of men he willed to stay the sacred rites and hecatombs to pay and calm minervas wrath oh blind to fate the gods not lightly change their love or hate with irefull taunts each other they oppose till in loud tumult all the greeks arose now different counsels every breast divide each burns with rancour to the adverse side the unquiet night strange projects entertained so jove that urged us to our fate ordained we with the rising morn our ships unmoord and brought our captives and our stores aboard but half the people with respect obeyed the king of men and at his bidding stayed now on the wings of winds our course we keep for god had smoothed the waters of the deep for tenedos we spread our eager oars there land and pay due victims to the powers to bless our safe return we join in prayer but angry jove dispersed our vows in air and raised new discord then so heaven decreed ulysses first and nestor disagreed wise as he was by various counsels swayed he there though late to please the monarch stayed but i determined stem the foamy floods warned of the coming fury of the gods with us tydides feared and urged his haste and menelaus came but came the last he joined our vessels in the lesbian bay while yet we doubted of our watery way if to the right to urge the pilots toil the safer road beside the psyrian isle or the strait course to rocky chios plow and anchor under mimas shaggy brow we sought direction of the power divine the god propitious gave the guiding sign through the mid seas he bids our navy steer and in eubea shun the woes we fear the whistling winds already waked

separate from all i safely landed here their fates or fortunes never reached my ear yet what i learned attend as here i sat and asked each voyager each heros fate curious to know and willing to relate safe reached the mirmydons their native land beneath achilles warlike sons command those whom the heir of great apollos art brave philoctetes taught to wing the dart and those whom idomen from ilions plain had led securely crossed the dreadful main how agamemnon touched his argive coast and how his life by fraud and force he lost and how the murderer paid his forfeit breath what lands so distant from that scene of death but trembling heard the fame and heard admire how well the son appeased his slaughtered sire even to the unhappy that unjustly bleed heaven gives posterity tavenge the deed so fell aegysthus and may thou my friend on whom the virtues of thy sire descend make future times thy equal act adore and be what brave orestes was before the prudent youth replied oh thou the grace and lasting glory of the grecian race just was the vengeance and to latest days shall long posterity resound the praise some god this arm with equal prowess bless and the proud suitors shall its force confess injurious men who while my soul is sore of fresh affronts are meditating more but heaven denies this honor to my hand nor shall my father repossess the land the fathers fortune never to return and the sad sons to suffer and to mourn thus he and nestor took the word my son is it then true as distant rumors run that crowds of rivals for thy mothers charms thy palace fill with insults and alarms say is the fault through tame submission thine or leagued against thee do thy people join moved by some oracle or voice divine and yet who knows but ripening lies in fate an hour of vengeance for the afflicted state when great ulysses shall suppress these harms ulysses singly or all greece in arms but if athena wars triumphant maid the happy son will as the father aid whose fame and safety was her constant care in every danger and in every war never on man did heavenly favor shine with rays so strong distinguished and divine as those with which minerva marked thy sire so might she love thee so thy soul inspire soon should their hopes in humble dust be laid and long oblivion of the bridal bed ah no such hope the prince with sighs replies can touch my breast that blessing heaven denies even by celestial favor were it given fortune or fate would cross the will of heaven what words are these and what imprudence thine thus interposed the martial maid divine forgetful youth but know the power above with ease can save each object of his love wide as his will extends his boundless grace nor lost in time nor circumscribed by place happier his lot who many sorrows past longlabring gains his natal shore at last than who too speedy hastes to end his life by some stern ruffian or adultrous wife death only is the lot which none can miss and all is possible to heaven but this the best the dearest favorite of the sky must taste that cup for man is born to die thus checked replied ulysses prudent heir mentor no more  the mournful thought forbear for he no more must draw his countrys breath already snatched by fate and the black doom of death pass we to other subjects and engage on themes remote the venerable sage who thrice has seen the perishable kind of men decay and through three ages shined like gods majestic and like gods in mind for much he knows and just conclusions draws from various precedents and various laws o son of neleus awful nestor tell how he the mighty agamemnon fell by what strange fraud aegysthus wrought relate by force he could not such a heros fate lived menelaus not in greece or where was then the martial brothers pious care condemned perhaps some foreign shore to tread or sure aegysthus had not dared the deed to whom the full of days illustrious youth attend though partly thou have guest the truth for had the martial menelaus found the ruffian breathing yet on argive ground nor earth had hid his carcass from the skies nor grecian virgins shrieked his obsequies but fowls obscene dismembered his remains and dogs had torn him on the naked plains while us the works of bloody mars employed the wanton youth inglorious peace enjoyed he stretched at ease in argos calm recess whose stately steeds luxuriant pastures bless with flatterys insinuating art soothed the frail queen and poisoned all her heart at first with worthy shame and decent pride the royal dame his lawless suit denied for virtues image yet possessed her mind taught by a master of the tuneful kind atrides parting for the trojan war consigned the youthful consort to his care true to his charge the bard preserved her long in honors limits such the power of song but when the gods these objects of their hate dragged to destruction by the links of fate the bard they banished from his native soil and left all helpless in a desert isle there he the sweetest of the sacred train sung dying to the rocks but sung in vain then virtue was no more her guard away she fell to lust a voluntary prey even to the temple stalked the adultrous spouse with impious thanks and mockery of vows with images with garments and with gold and odorous fumes from loaded altars rolled mean time from flaming troy we cut the way with menelaus through the curling sea but when to suniums sacred point we came crowned with the temple of the athenian dame atrides pilot phrontes there expired  phrontes of all the sons of men admired to steer the bounding bark with steady toil when the storm thickens and the billows boil while yet he exercised the steermans art apollo touched him with his gentle dart even with the rudder in his hand he fell to pay whose honors to the shades of hell we checked our haste by pious office bound and laid our old companion in the ground and now the rites discharged our course we keep far on the gloomy bosom of the deep soon as malaeas misty tops arise sudden the thundrer blackens all the skies and the winds whistle and the surges roll mountains on mountains and obscure the pole the tempest scatters and divides our fleet part the storm urges on the coast of creet where winding round the rich cydonian plain the streams of jardan issue to the main there stands a rock high eminent and steep whose shaggy brow oerhangs the shady deep and views gortyna on the western side on this rough auster drove the impetuous tide with broken force the billows rolled away and heaved the fleet into the neighboring bay thus saved from death they gained the phaestan shores with shattered vessels and disabled oars but five tall barks the winds and waters tossed far from their fellows on the egyptian coast there wandered menelaus through foreign shores amassing gold and gathering naval stores while cursed aegysthus the detested deed by fraud fulfilled and his great brother bled sevn years the traitor rich mycenae swayed and his stern rule the groaning land obeyed the eighth from athens to his realm restored orestes brandished the revenging sword slew the dire pair and gave to funeral flame the vile assassin and adultrous dame that day ere yet the bloody triumphs cease returned atrides to the coast of greece and safe to argos port his navy brought with gifts of price and ponderous treasure fraught hence warned my son beware nor idly stand too long a stranger to thy native land lest heedless absence wear thy wealth away while lawless feasters in thy palace sway perhaps may seize thy realm and share the spoil and thou return with disappointed toil from thy vain journey to a rifled isle however my friend indulge one labor more and seek atrides on the spartan shore he wandering long a wider circle made and manylanguagd nations has surveyed and measured tracts unknown to other ships amid the monstrous wonders of the deeps a length of ocean and unbounded sky which scarce the seafowl in a year oerfly go then to sparta take the watery way thy ship and sailors but for orders stay or if by land thou choose thy course to bend my steeds my chariots and my sons attend thee to atrides they shall safe convey guides of thy road companions of thy way urge him with truth to frame his free replies and sure he will for menelas is wise thus while he speaks the ruddy sun descends and twylight gray her evening shade extends then thus the blueeyd maid o full of days wise are thy words and just are all thy ways now immolate the tongues and mix the wine sacred to neptune and the powers divine the lamp of day is quenched beneath the deep and soft approach the balmy hours of sleep nor fits it to prolong the heavenly feast timeless indecent but retire to rest so spoke joves daughter the celestial maid the sober train attended and obeyed the sacred heralds on their hands around poured the full urns the youths the goblets crowned from bowl to bowl the holy bevrage flows while to the final sacrifice they rose the tongues they cast upon the fragrant flame and pour above the consecrated stream and now their thirst by copious draughts allayed the youthful hero and the athenian maid propose departure from the finished rite and in their hollow bark to pass the night but this the hospitable sage denied forbid it jove and all the gods he cried thus from my walls the muchloved son to send of such a hero and of such a friend me as some needy peasant would ye leave whom heaven denies the blessing to relieve me would ye leave who boast imperial sway when beds of royal state invite your stay no  long as life this mortal shall inspire or as my children imitate their sire here shall the wandering stranger find his home and hospitable rites adorn the dome well have thou spoke the blueeyd maid replies beloved old man benevolent as wise be the kind dictates of thy heart obeyed and let thy words telemachus persuade he to thy palace shall thy steps pursue i to the ship to give the orders due prescribe directions and confirm the crew for i alone sustain their naval cares who boast experience from these silver hairs all youths the rest whom to this journey move like years like tempers and their princes love there in the vessel shall i pass the night and soon as morning paints the fields of light i go to challenge from the caucons bold a debt contracted in the days of old but this thy guest received with friendly care let thy strong coursers swift to sparta bear prepare thy chariot at the dawn of day and be thy son companion of his way then turning with the word minerva flies and soars an eagle through the liquid skies vision divine the thronged spectators gaze in holy wonder fixed and still amaze but chief the reverend sage admired he took the hand of young telemachus and spoke oh happy youth and favored of the skies distinguished care of guardian deities whose early years for future worth engage no vulgar manhood no ignoble age for lo none other of the court above than she the daughter of almighty jove pallas herself the wartriumphant maid confessed is thine as once thy fathers aid so guide me goddess so propitious shine on me my consort and my royal line a yearling bullock to thy name shall smoke untamed unconscious of the galling yoke with ample forehead and yet tender horns whose budding honors ductile gold adorns submissive thus the hoary sire preferred his holy vow the favoring goddess heard then slowly rising over the sandy space precedes the father followed by his race a long procession timely marching home in comely order to the regal dome there when arrived on thrones around him placed his sons and grandsons the wide circle graced to these the hospitable sage in sign of social welcome mixed the racy wine late from the mellowing cask restored to light by ten long years refined and rosybright to pallas high the foaming bowl he crowned and sprinkled large libation on the ground each drinks a full oblivion of his cares and to the gifts of balmy sleep repairs deep in a rich alcove the prince was laid and slept beneath the pompous colonnade fast by his side pisistratus lay spread in age his equal on a splendid bed but in an inner court securely closed the reverend nestor with his queen reposed when now aurora daughter of the dawn with rosy luster purpled over the lawn the old man early rose walked forth and sat on polished stone before his palace gate with unguents smooth the lucid marble shone where ancient neleus sat a rustic throne but he descending to the infernal shade sage nestor filled it and the scepter swayed his sons around him mild obeisance pay and duteous take the orders of the day first echephron and stratius quit their bed then perseus aretus and thrasymed the last pisistratus arose from rest they came and near him placed the strangerguest to these the senior thus declared his will my sons the dictates of your sire fulfill to pallas first of gods prepare the feast who graced our rites a more than mortal guest let one dispatchful bid some swain to lead a wellfed bullock from the grassy mead one seek the harbor where the vessels moor and bring thy friends telemachus ashore leave only two the gally to attend another to laerceus must we send artist divine whose skilful hands infold the victims horn with circumfusile gold the rest may here the pious duty share and bid the handmaids for the feast prepare the seats to range the fragrant wood to bring and limpid waters from the living spring he said and busy each his care bestowed already at the gates the bullock lowed already came the ithacensian crew the dextrous smith the tools already drew his ponderous hammer and his anvil sound and the strong tongs to turn the metal round nor was minerva absent from the rite she viewed her honors and enjoyed the sight with revrent hand the king presents the gold which round thintorted horns the gilder rolled so wrought as pallas might with pride behold young aretus from forth his bridal bower brought the full laver over their hands to pour and canisters of consecrated flour stratius and echephron the victim led the axe was held by warlike thrasymed in act to strike before him perseus stood the vase extending to receive the blood the king himself initiates to the power scatters with quivering hand the sacred flour and the stream sprinkles from the curling brows the hair collected in the fire he throws soon as due vows on every part were paid and sacred wheat upon the victim laid strong thrasymed discharged the speeding blow full on his neck and cut the nerves in two down sunk

and entrails dressed thassistants part transfix and broil the rest while these officious tend the rites divine the last fair branch of the nestorean line sweet polycaste took the pleasing toil to bathe the prince and pour the fragrant oil over his fair limbs a flowery vest he threw and issued like a god to mortal view his former feat beside the king he found his peoples father with his peers around all placed at ease the holy banquet join and in the dazzling goblet laughs the wine the rage of thirst and hunger now suppressed the monarch turns him to his royal guest and for the promised journey bids prepare the smoothhaird horses and the rapid car observant of his word the word scarce spoke the sons obey and join them to the yoke then bread and wine a ready handmaid brings and presents such as suit the state of kings the glittering seat telemachus ascends his faithful guide pisistratus attends with hasty hand the ruling reins he drew he lashed the coursers and the coursers flew beneath the bounding yoke alike they held their equal pace and smoked along the held the towers of pylos sink its views decay fields after fields fly back till close of day then sunk the sun and darkened all the way to pherae now diocleus stately seat of alpheus race the weary youths retreat his house affords the hospitable rite and pleased they sleep the blessing of the night but when aurora daughter of the dawn with rosy luster purpled over the lawn again they mount their journey to renew and from the sounding portico they flew along the waving fields their way they hold the fields receding as the chariot rolled then slowly sunk the ruddy globe of light and over the shaded landscape rushed the night wk pfsc    observations on the third book observations on the third book i the scene is now removed from ithaca to pylos and with it a new vein of poetry is opened instead of the riots of the suitors we are entertained with the wisdom and piety of nestor this and the following book are a kind of supplement to the iliad the nature of epic poetry requires that something should be left to the imagination of the reader nor is the picture to be entirely drawn at full length homer therefore to satisfy our curiosity gives an account of the fortunes of those great men who made so noble a figure at the siege of troy this conduct also shows his art variety gives life and delight and it is much more necessary in epic than in comic or tragic poetry sometimes to shift the scenes to diversify and embellish the story but as on the stage the poet ought not to step at once from one part of the world to a too remote country for this destroys credibility and the auditor cannot fancy himself this minute here and the next a thousand miles distant so in epic poetry every removal must be within the degrees of probability we have here a very easy transition the poet carries his hero no further than he really might sail in the compass of time he allots for his voyage if he had still dwelt upon the disorders of the suitors without interruption he must grow tiresome but he artfully breaks the thread of their history with beautiful incidents and episodes and reserves the further recital of their disorders for the end of his poem by this method we sit down with fresh appetite to the entertainment and rise at last not cloyed but satisfied  ii verse   through heavens eternal brazen portals   the original calls heaven  or brazen the reason of it arises either from the palaces of the gods being built of brass by vulcan or rather the word implies no more than the stability of heaven which for the same reason is in other places called  or framed of iron eustathius  iii verse   at nine green theaters it may be asked why the poet is so very particular as to mention that the pylians were divided into nine assemblies and may it not seem a circumstance of no importance eustathius answers from the ancients that there were nine cities subject to the power of nestor five in pylos the rest in boeotia the poet therefore allots one bank or theater to every city which consisted of  00 men the whole number amounting to   00 these cities furnished the like complement of men to nestor for the war at troy he sailed in ninety vessels and allowing fifty men to each vessel they amount to that number hence it appears that this was a national sacrifice every city furnished nine bulls and by consequence the whole nation were partakers of it  iv verse ibid the sacrifice of the pylians this was a very solemn sacrifice of the pylians how comes it then to pass that homer passes it over in one line eustathius answers that the occasion disallows a longer description and homer knows when to speak and when to be silent he chooses to carry on the adventures of telemachus rather than amuse himself in descriptions that contribute nothing to the story he finds a time of more leisure in the latter part of this book and there he describes it at length  they taste the entrails that is every person eat a small portion of the sacrifice and by this method every person became partaker of it  there is nothing in homer that shows where this sacrifice was offered whether in a temple or in the open air but eustathius tells us from strabo that it was in the temple of samian neptune   v verse    urge him with truth to frame his fair replies and sure he will for wisdom never lies this sentiment is truly noble and as nobly expressed the simplicity of the diction corresponds with that of the thought homer in many places testifies the utmost abhorrence of a lie this verse is twice repeated in the present book as well as in some others and nothing can be stronger in the same view than that of achilles in the  th iliad who dares think one thing and another tell my heart detests him as the gates of hell   vi verse    born with good omens and with heaven thy friend there is some obscurity in the greek expression and the ancient critics have made it more obscure by their false interpretations they imagine that the poet only meant to say that telemachus was the legitimate son of penelope and ulysses eustathius  dacier very justly condemns this explication as unworthy of homer and gives us a more plain and natural interpretation viz you were not born in despite of the gods that is you are well made and of a good presence you have good inclinations and in a word your birth is happy she explains  after the same manner you were not educated in despite of the gods that is the gods have blessed your education this explication seems to be just and answers perfectly the design of minerva which was to give a decent assurance to telemachus you are a person says the goddess of a good presence and happy education why then should you be ashamed to appear before nestor  vii verse    and spread soft hydes upon the yellow sands it is with pleasure that i read such passages in an author of so great antiquity as are pictures of the simplicity of those heroic ages it is the remark of eustathius that pisistratus the son of a king does not seat these strangers upon purple tapestry or any other costly furniture but upon the skins of beasts that had nothing to recommend them but their softness being spread upon the sand of the seashores  this whole passage pleases me extremely there is a spirit of true devotion morality and good sense in it and the decency of behavior between nestor and telemachus is described very happily nestor shows great benevolence to telemachus telemachus great reverence to nestor the modesty of the one and the humanity of the other are worthy of our observation we see the same picture of nestor in the odyssey that was drawn of him in the iliads with this only difference that there he was a counselor of war here he is painted in softer colors ruling his people in peace and diffusing a spirit of piety through his whole territories  he had now survived the war of troy almost ten years and the gods reward the old age of this wise and religious prince with peace and happiness  viii verse    last deign telemachus and me to bless   since minerva here mentions the name of telemachus in her prayer how comes it to pass that nestor is at a loss to know telemachus minerva sat close by nestor he must therefore be supposed to hear the prayer and yet in the following lines he enquires who these strangers are we can scarce imagine nestor ignorant that the son of ulysses was named telemachus there being so strict a friendship between nestor and ulysses perhaps therefore minerva prayed in secret mentally or perhaps nestor might not take notice of what was not addressed immediately to him and consequently make enquiry about it for the greater certainty  ix verse    relate if business or the thirst of gain etc if we form our images of persons and actions in ancient times from the images of persons and actions in modern ages we shall fall into great mistakes thus in the present passage if we annex the same idea of piracy as it was practiced three thousand years past to piracy as it is practiced in our ages what can be a greater affront than this enquiry of nestor but says eustathius piracy was formerly not only accounted lawful but honorable i doubt not but thucydides had this passage in view when he says that the ancient poets introduce men enquiring of those who frequent the sea if they be pirates as a thing no way ignominious thucydides tells us in the same place that all those who lived on the seacoast or in the islands maintained themselves by frequent inrodes upon unfortifyd towns and if such piracies were nobly performed they were accounted glorious herodotus also writes that many of the ancients especially about thrace thought it ignominious to live by laboring the ground but to live by piracy and plunder was esteemed a life of honor eustathius  xi verse     the speech of nestor eustathius observes the modesty of nestor telemachus had ascribed the fall of troy in a great measure to nestor but nestor speaks not in particular of himself but is content with his share of glory in common with other warriors he speaks in the plural number and joins all the greeks as in the war so in the glory of it nestor speaks of the sufferings of the greeks by sea as well as by land during the siege of troy to understand this it is necessary to remember that the greeks made many expeditions against other places during the war both by sea and land as appears from many passages in the iliads particularly from what achilles says in the ninth book  xi verse     there ajax great achilles there the brave i have observed that the poet inserts into the odyssey several incidents that happened after the fall of troy and by that method agreeably diversifies his poetry and satisfies the curiosity of the reader eustathius remarks here that he gives a title of honor to all the heroes he mentions but only to achilles achilles had been the occasion of the sufferings and death of many of the greeks by his anger and obstinacy in refusing to obey agamemnon therefore while nestor is lamenting the calamities of the greeks he passes over achilles without any honorable mention who had so greatly added to their sufferings but i think this remark chimerical one may as well say achilles needed no epithet to distinguish him  it is with pleasure i see the old man dwell upon the praise of antilochus the father enlarges upon the fame of the son he gives him four epithets of glory and while ajax is only praised as a warrior antilochus is great and good excellent in the standing fight or swift to pursue an enemy longinus has observed upon the beauty of this passage  xii verse     far over the rest thy mighty father shined nestor speaks of ulysses as an inseparable friend and it shows an excellent disposition in them both to be rivals and yet without envy but the art of nestor is remarkable he first gives the character to ulysses of being superior in wisdom to all the greeks and yet at last he finds a way secretly to set himself on a level with him if not above him we ever says he thought the same thoughts and were ever of the same sentiments which though it may imply that they were of equal wisdom yet there is room left for it to signify that ulysses always assented to the wisdom of nestor eustathius  xiii verse     the council or the assembly there is a remarkable difference between  and  the former denotes a select number of men assembled in council the latter a public assembly where all the people were present eustathius  xiv verse     sent by pallas   nestor in modesty conceals the reason of the anger of the goddess out of respect to ajax the locrian who was then dead the crime of ajax was the violation of cassandra even in the temple of minerva before her image but why should the goddess be angry at others for the crime of ajax this is because they omitted to punish the offender if ajax was criminal in offending others are criminal for not punishing the offense eustathius  the crime of ajax is mentioned in virgil aen   pallasne exurere classem argivum atque ipsos potuit submergere ponto unius ob noxam and furias ajacis oilei etc could angry pallas with revengeful spleen the grecian navy burn and drown the men she for the fault of one offending foe the bolts of jove himself presumed to throw dryden   virgil borrowed the description of the punishment of ajax from the  th of the odyssey  xv verse     etc who called to council  but called untimely etc it may seem at first view that the poet affirms the night to be an improper season to convene a council this is not his meaning in the iliad there are several councils by night nay  is used proverbially to express the bestconcerted councils what therefore nestor here condemns is the calling not a select but public assembly of the soldiers in the night when they are in no danger of an enemy and when they are apt to fly into insolence through wine and the joy of victory the night is then undoubtedly an ill chosen season because the license of the soldier cannot be so well restrained by night as by day eustathius  xvi verse     oh blind to fate it may be asked why nestor condemns so solemnly this hero calling him  when he describes him in so pious an action this is not because the gods are implacable for as homer himself writes  but because he vainly imagined that they would so soon be appeased without any justice done upon the offender  are the words of eustathius  xvii verse     wise as he was by various counsels swayed he there though late to please the monarch stayed it is with great address that nestor relates the return of ulysses to agamemnon he ascribes it not directly to ulysses but to his associates in the voyage he mollifies it in complaisance to telemachus but nestor according to dacier conceals the true reason of his return it was not to please agamemnon but out of fear of the goddess minerva whose statue he had taken by force from troy to appease that goddess he returns to join in sacrifice with agamemnon eustathius  xviii verse  00 warned of the coming fury of the gods it may be asked how nestor attained this knowledge of the evils which the gods were preparing eustathius ascribes it to his great wisdom which gave him an insight into futurity dacier with more reason tells us that nestor knew that minerva had been offended and might consequently apprehend a punishment was to be inflicted for the offense  xix verse     but i to pylos etc eustathius observes from the ancients that the poet with great judgment suspends and breaks off this relation of nestor by this method he has an opportunity to carry telemachus to other countries and insert into his poem the story of menelaus and helen this method likewise gives an air of probability to what he writes the poet seems afraid to deceive and when he sends telemachus to other parts for better intelligence he seems to consult truth and exactness  xx verse     achilles warlike son the son of achilles was named neoptolemus by others pyrrhus his story is this when he had reached thessaly with the myrmidons of achilles by the advice of thetis he set fire to his vessels and being warned by helenus from the oracles to fix his habitation where he found a house whose foundations were iron whose walls were wood and whose roof was wool he took his journey on foot and coming to a certain lake of epirus he found some persons fixing their spears with the points downwards into the earth and covering the tops of them with their cloaks and after this manner making their tents he looked upon the oracle as fulfilled and dwelt there afterward having a son by andromache the wife of hector he named him molossus from whom the region took the name of molossia from this country are the molossi canes mentioned by virgil eustathius  xxi verse     so fell aegysthus and may thou my friend etc nestor introduces the mention of aegysthus very artfully it is to raise an emulation in telemachus to revenge ulysses as orestes had agamemnon it has the intended effect and we find that telemachus dwells upon his story with a virtuous envy yet at the same time with great modesty eustathius gives us a different reading in   or   both the expressions are used in homer the preference is therefore submitted to the reader  xxii verse     moved by some oracle or voice divine the words in the original are following the voice of some god that is some oracle homer does not confine the expression either to a good or bad sense but the context plainly shows that they must be understood in a bad sense namely to imply that the people had recourse to pretended oracles to justify their rebellion this is evident from what follows where nestor encourages telemachus to expect that ulysses may punish them for their crimes   if there had been no crime there ought to be no punishment  xxiii verse     ulysses singly or all greece in arms the poet shows his great judgment in preparing the reader for the destruction of the suitors that great catastrophe is managed by few hands and it might seem incredible that so few could destroy so many the poet therefore to give an air of truth to his action frequently inculcates the assistance of pallas which must at least show that such a great exploit is not impossible to be executed by stratagems and valor it is by art not strength that ulysses conquers  all greece in arms this is spoken in a general sense and comprehends not only the subjects of ulysses or even the pylians and spartans but implies that all the greeks would rise in the cause of ulysses what the suitors had spoken scoffingly in the preceding book viz that telemachus was sailing to pyle or sparta for supplies appears in this not to be impracticable so that it was choice and not necessity that determined the poet to make use of no such easy expedients for the destruction of the suitors eustathius  it may be added that the very nature of epic poetry and of the odyssey in particular requires such a conduct in the iliad achilles is the chief agent and performs almost all the great actions aeneas is painted after the same manner by virgil the one kills hector the other turnus both which are the decisive actions it was equally necessary to exalt the character of ulysses by bringing him into difficulties from which he is personally to extricate himself this the poet sufficiently brings about by refusing all the easy methods for his reestablishment because the more difficult ways are most conducive to the honor of his hero thus as achilles and aeneas kill hector and turnus with their own hands so the suitors fall chiefly by the hand of ulysses it is necessary for the hero of the poem to execute the decisive action for by this method the poet compleats his character his own greatness surmounts all difficulties and he goes off the stage with the utmost advantage by leaving a noble character upon the mind of the spectators  xxiv verse     fortune or fate would cross the will of heaven it may be asked how an expression so near blasphemy as eustathius observes could escape a person of such piety as telemachus it is true the poet makes minerva herself correct it but yet the objection remains viz how could telemachus speak it i think since the poet himself condemns it we may give it up as an indecency in telemachus it is natural for men in despair and that was the condition of telemachus to use a vehemence of expression and this might transport telemachus beyond the bounds of prudence the only possible way that occurs to me to take off the impiety is to have recourse to destiny it was the opinion of the ancients that the gods could not alter destiny and then telemachus may mean no more than that it was decreed by the destinies that ulysses shall return no more so the gods themselves could not restore him  thus in the   th of the metamorphosis venus in vain applies to the gods to preserve julius caesar  superosque movet qui rumpere quanquam ferrea non possunt veterum decreta sororum etc and a little lower jupiter says to venus  sola insuperabile fatum nata movere paras   xxv verse     happier his lot who etc nothing can be better imagined to encourage telemachus than what the poet here delivers she sets agamemnon in opposition to ulysses agamemnon made a speedy voyage to his country and there fell by treachery ulysses has long been absent but yet is happier than agamemnon the gods perhaps reserve him for better fortunes at least nothing can be concluded from his long absence and this is sufficient to teach telemachus not to despair eustathius  xxvi verse     and all is possible to heaven but this what minerva here says justifies the remark i made that what telemachus seemed to have spoken rashly may be softened if not vindicated by having recourse to destiny it is evident from this passage that destiny was superior to the power of the gods otherwise minerva speaks as blasphemously as telemachus for what difference is there between saying that the gods cannot preserve even these they love from death and saying that the gods could not save ulysses why therefore may not the words of telemachus be thought to have respect to destiny  i am of opinion that the poet had something further in view by putting these words into the mouth of minerva the words of telemachus if taken grossly might appear shocking to so pious a person as nestor and make an ill impression upon him to the disadvantage of telemachus minerva therefore artfully explains it and softens the horror of it by reconciling it to the theology of those ages  xxvii verse  0  pass we to other subjects   telemachus here puts several questions as it were in a breath to nestor and plutarch observes upon this passage that he who enquires any thing of an old man though the old man himself has no concern in the story wins his heart at once and incites a person who is upon all occasions very willing to discourse he introduces this as an instance of the art telemachus uses in adapting himself by his questions to the temper of the person with whom he converses he puts together continues he several questions upon several subjects which is more judicious than to confine his answer to a single interrogatory and by that method deprive nestor of one of the most pleasant enjoyments of old age i mean the pleasure of talking plutarch symposiac  xxviii verse  0  who thrice has seen the perishable kind of men decay   the poet here tells us that nestor was now in his fourth generation ovid took the word  to signify an hundred years but then nestor must have been above  00 years old others with more probability understand it to signify a generation or such a portion of time in which any race of men flourish together which is computed to be about thirty years i refer the reader to the note upon the    d verse in the first book of the iliad for the particular age of nestor according to that computation he must now be about ninety five years of age  xxix verse  0  how he the mighty agamemnon fell telemachus does not ask this question out of curiosity but with great judgment he knows there were designs against his life as well as there had been against agamemnon he therefore asks it that he may learn how to defeat them chiefly to instruct himself how best to assist his father upon his return by aiding him in escaping the snares of the suitors dacier  xxx verse     taught by a master of the tuneful kind homer through the whole odyssey speaks much in honor of the art which he himself loved and in which he so eminently excelled from these and other passages we may learn the state of poetry in those ages poets says eustathius were ranked in the class of philosophers and the ancients made use of them as praeceptors in music and morality strabo quotes this very passage as an instance of the excellence of poetry in forming the soul to worthy actions aegysthus could not debauch clytemnestra till he banished the poet who was her guide and instructor  various are the conjectures of the ancients about the name of the bard here celebrated some says eustathius tell us it was chariades some demodocus some glaucus etc but i pass them over because they are conjectures  there were many degrees of these  some were  others  but such bards as are here mentioned were of an higher station and retained as instructors by kings and princes  i cannot omit one remark of eustathius he tells us that some persons write that these  had their names from hence  exactly resembling the modern italian singers madam dacier is not to be forgiven for passing over a remark of such importance if this be true it makes a great difference between the ancient and modern poets and is the only advantage i know we have over them  xxxi verse     then virtue was no more her guard away she fell  etc there is a fine moral couched in the story of the bard and clytemnestra it admirably paints the advantage we draw from wise companions for the improvement of our virtues clytemnestra was chaste because her instructor was wise his wisdom was an insuperable guard to her modesty it was long before she yielded virtue and honor had a long contest but she no sooner yielded to adultery but she assisted in the murder of her husband from whence we may draw another moral that one vice betrays us into another and when once the fences of honor are thrown down we become a prey to every passion dacier  xxxii verse     even to the temple stalked the adultrous spouse here is a surprising mixture of religion and impiety aegysthus upon the accomplishment of so great a crime as adultery returns thanks to the gods by oblations as if they had assisted him in the execution of it nestor dwells upon it at large to show that aegysthus greatly aggravated his guilt by such a piece of impious devotion dacier  xxxiii verse     apollo touched him with his gentle dart homer calls the darts of apollo  or gentle to signify that those who dye thus suddenly dye without pain eustathius  dacier complains that some critics think homer worthy of blame for enlarging upon so mean a person as a pilot and giving us his genealogy it is a sufficient answer to observe that arts were in high esteem in those times and men that were eminent in them were in great honor neither were arts then confined as in these ages to mean personages no less a person than ulysses builds a vessel in the sequel of the odyssey so that this is a false piece of delicacy if homer be culpable so is virgil he gives the genealogy of palinurus as well as homer of phrontis virgils description is censured as too long homer concludes his in seven lines and lastly virgils episode has been judged by the critics to be an unnecessary ornament and to contribute nothing to the poem homer relates the death of phrontis to introduce the dispersion of the fleet of menelaus the fleet might well be scattered when it wanted so excellent a pilot  xxxiv verse     part the storm urges on the coast of crete homer does not amuse us by relating what became of these companions of menelaus he omits this judiciously and follows the thread of his story menelaus is the person whom the poet has in view he therefore passes over the story of his companions to carry on the fable of the poem by leading us directly to menelaus  xxxv verse      on the egyptian coast in the original it is the wind and water carried them to aegyptus homer by aegyptus means the river nile and then it is always used in the masculine gender the region about it took its name from the river aegyptus this is always used in the feminine gender but the country had not received that name in the days of homer eustathius  what dacier adds to this observation may assist in determining the dispute concerning the priority of homer and hesiod hesiod makes mention of the river nilus if therefore it be true that aegyptus had not been called by the name of nilus in the times of homer it is a demonstration that hesiod was posterior to homer otherwise he could not have been acquainted with any other name but that of aegyptus  xxxvi verse   0 from athens to his realm  there is a different reading in this place instead of  some write  for orestes was educated by strophius king of phocis and father of pylades the ancients reconcile the difference by saying that orestes might be sent from phocis to athens for his education and returning thence to his own country might revenge the death of his father agamemnon so that although he was first bred up in phocis he was afterward a sojourner in athens eustathius  xxxvii verse     a length of ocean and unbounded sky which scarce the seafowl in a year oerfly it must be confessed that nestor greatly exaggerates this description homer himself tells us that a ship may sail in five days from crete to egypt wherefore then this hyperbole of nestor it might perhaps be to deter telemachus from a design of sailing to crete and he through his inexperience might believe the description it may be added that what nestor speaks concerning the flight of birds may be only said to show the great distance of that sea nay by a favorable interpretation it may be reconciled to truth the meaning then must be this should a person observe that sea a whole year he would not see one bird flying over it both because of the vastness and dreadfulness of it and perhaps the whole of this might arise from the observation that this sea is not frequented by birds this is wholly and almost literally taken from eustathius and if we add to this the ignorance of the sea and seaaffairs in those ages we shall the less wonder to hear so wise a man as nestor describing it with so much terror navigation is now greatly improved and the moderns sail further in a month than the ancients could in a year their whole art consisting chiefly in coasting along the shores and consequently they made but little way  xxxviii verse     now immolate the tongues  various are the reasons which eustathius reports concerning this oblation of the tongues at the conclusion of the sacrifice it was to purge themselves from any evil words they might have uttered or because the tongue was reckoned the best part of the sacrifice and so reserved for the completion of it or they offered the tongue to the gods as witnesses to what they had spoken i omit the rest as superfluous they had a custom of offering the tongues to mercury because they believed him the giver of eloquence dacier expatiates upon this custom the people says she might fear lest through wine and the joy of the festival they might have uttered some words unbecoming the sanctity of the occasion by this sacrifice of the tongues they signified that they purged away whatever they had spoken amiss during the festival and asked in particular pardon of mercury who presided over discourse to the end they might not carry home any uncleanness which might stop the blessings expected from the sacrifice  xxxix verse     nor fits it to prolong the heavenly feast timeless indecent etc   eustathius shows the difference between  festivals and  or sacrifices in the former it was customary to spend the whole night in wine and rejoicing in the latter this was reckoned an unlawful custom through the fear of falling into any indecencies through wine he likewise gives another reason of this injunction by telling us that it was the custom to offer sacrifices to the celestial powers in the time of the day and even to finish them about the setting of the sun and that those who dealt in incantations performed their sacrifices to the infernal powers by night and finished them before sunrising either of these reasons sufficiently explains the words of the goddess and the former carries in it an excellent moral that particular care should be taken in our acts of devotion not to turn religion into impiety  xl verse   0 when beds of royal state invite your stay this passage gives us a full insight into the manners of these hospitable ages they not only kept a treasury for bowls or vases of gold or silver to give as  or gifts of hospitality but also a wardrobe of various habits and rich furniture to lodge and bestow upon strangers eustathius relates that tellias of agrigentum was a person of so great hospitality that five hundred horsemen coming to his house in the winter season he entertained them and gave every man a cloak and a tunic this laudable custom prevailed and still prevails in the eastern countries it was the practice of abraham of old and is at this day of the turks as we may learn from their caravansaries erected for the reception of travelers and yet dacier observes that a french critic has showed so ill a taste as to ridicule this passage  telemachus says that author being entertained by nestor intimates his intention of returning to lodge on shipboard with his companions but nestor detains him by asking if he thought he had not quilts or coverlets to give him a nights lodging upon this telemachus goes to bed in a resounding gallery and nestor in a bed which his wife made ready for him the noblest things are most liable to burlesque by perverting their meaning as some pictures by varying the position represent a man or a monster he is very severe upon the resounding gallery which in truth means no more than very lofty or elevated and by consequence very noble and magnificent  xli verse     i go to challenge from the caucons the poet makes a double use of these words of the goddess she gives an air of probability to her excuse why she should not be pressed to stay and at the same time homer avoids the absurdity of introducing that goddess at sparta where menelaus and helen are celebrating the nuptials of their son and daughter minerva is a virgin deity and consequently an enemy to all nuptial ceremonies eustathius  but it may be necessary to observe who these caucons are we find in the tenth book the caucons mentioned as auxiliaries to troy there dolon says the carians caucons the pelasgian host and leleges encamp along the coast are these caucons the same with those here mentioned eustathius informs us that there was a people of triphyly between elis and pylos named caucons but strabo says that the whole race is now extinct and that these here mentioned are of dymaea and take their name from the river caucon whereas those in the iliads are paphlagonians they were a wandering nation and consequently might be the same people originally and retain the same name in different countries  xlii verse     but chief the reverend sage admired   it may be asked why nestor is in such a surprise at the discovery of the goddess it is evident from the iliad that he had been no stranger to such intercourses of the deities nay in this very book nestor tells us that ulysses enjoyed almost the constant presence of minerva insomuch that sophocles the great imitator of homer relates that he knew the goddess by her voice without seeing her eustathius answers that the wonder of nestor arose not from the discovery of that deity but that she should accompany so young a person as telemachus after her departure the old man stood amazed and looked upon that hero as some very extraordinary person whom in such early years the goddess of war and wisdom had vouchsafed to attend this interpretation agrees perfectly with what nestor speaks to telemachus  xliii verse     distinguished care of guardian deities i will take this opportunity to obviate an objection that may be made against all interposition of the gods in assisting the heroes of the odyssey it has been thought by some critics a disparagement to them to stand in continual need of such supernatural succor if two persons were engaged in combat and a third person should immediately step in to the assistance of one of the parties and kill the adversary would it not reflect upon the valor of his friend who was so weak as to want such assistance why for instance should jupiter help aeneas to kill turnus was not he brave enough to fight and strong enough to conquer his enemy by his own prowess and would not turnus have killed aeneas with the same assistance it is therefore a disparagement to the actors thus continually to supply the defects of a hero by the power of a deity  but this is a false way of arguing and from hence it might be inferred that the love and favor of a deity serves only to make those whom he assists and those who depend upon such assistance appear weak impotent cowardly and unworthy to be conquerors can any doubt arise whether the love and favor of a god be a disparagement or honor to those whom he favors according to these critics we should find the character of a perfect hero in an impious mezentius who acknowledges no god but his own arm and his own sword it is true the objection would be just if the hero himself performed nothing of the action or if when he were almost conquered by the superior valor of his enemy he owed his life and victory to gods and miracles but the hero always behaves himself in all his actions as if he were to gain success without the assistance of the deity and the presence of the gods is so ordered that we may retrench every thing that is miraculous without making any alteration in the action or character of the human personages thus in the instance of aeneas and turnus though jupiter favors aeneas yet aeneas is painted in stronger colors of fortitude he appears superior as a man unassisted and able to conquer turnus and consequently the favor of jupiter makes no alteration in the action or character of aeneas  there is likewise a wide difference between the assistance of a man and of a god the actions of men belong only to the performers of those actions but when a deity assists us by inspiring us with strength and courage the actions we perform are really our own and the more he favors us the more glory he gives us so that the assistance of man eclipses but the assistance of a god exalts our glory thus for instance when achilles is pursuing hector he charges the greeks to keep off from hector their assistance might lessen his glory but when pallas offers her assistance he immediately embraces it as an honor and boasts of it as such to hector i have been large upon this objection because the reader ought to carry it in his memory through the whole poem and apply it to every action in which any share is ascribed to any deity see bossu more at large concerning this objection  xliv verse     and sat on polished stone before his palace gate we have here an ancient custom recorded by the poet a king places himself before the gate of his palace upon a seat of marble worn smooth by long use says eustathius or perhaps smoothed exquisitely by the hand of the workman what i would chiefly observe is that they placed themselves thus in public for the dispatch of justice we read in the scripture of judges sitting in the gate and that this procedure of nestor was for that purpose is probable from the expression he sat in the seat where neleus  or consiliarius used to sit which seems to express his wisdom in the discharge of justice nestor is also described as bearing his scepter in his hand which was never used but upon some act of regality in the dispatch of justice or other solemn occasions perhaps says dacier these seats or thrones might be consecrated with oil to draw a reverence to the seats of justice as by an act of religion but i rather judge adds she that no more is meant than to express the shining of these thrones they being undoubtedly made of marble  xlv verse     pisistratus would i indulge my fancy in a conjecture i might suppose that the famous tyrant pisistratus was descended or borrowed his name from this son of nestor herodotus informs us as eustathius observes that all the pisistrati were originally pylians if this be true we have a very strong evidence that homer is not all fiction but that he celebrates the great men of those ages with reality and only embellishes the true story with the ornaments of poetry  xlvi verse   0 laerceus  artist divine etc the author of the parallel quotes this passage to prove that homer was ignorant of the mechanic arts we have here says he a gilder with his anvil and hammer but what occasion has he for an anvil and hammer in the art of a gilder boileau has excellently vindicated homer from this objection in his reflections upon longinus this gilder was a goldbeater nestor we see furnished the gold and he beat it into leaves so that he had occasion to make use of his anvil and hammer the anvil was portable because the work was not laborious our modern travelers assure us that it is at this day the practice in the eastern regions as in persia etc for the artists in metals to carry about with them the whole implements of trade to the house of the persons where they find employment it is therefore a full vindication of homer to observe that the gold this artist used in gilding was nothing but gold beat into fine leaves  xlvii verse     nor was minerva absent   it may be asked in what sense minerva can be said to come to the sacrifice eustathius answers that the ancients finding the inclinations of men to be bent incontinently upon pleasures to oblige them to use them moderately distinguished times ordained sacrifices and representing the gods in the forms of men brought them to use those pleasures with discretion they taught them that the gods came down to their libations and sacrifices to induce them to govern their conversation with reverence and modesty thus jupiter and the other gods in the iliads and neptune in the odyssey are said to feast with the aethiopians  if i might be pardoned a conjecture i would suppose that minerva may in another sense be said to come to the sacrifice i mean by her image or statue and what may seem to confirm this opinion is what diodorus relates in his third book concerning the abovementioned aethiopians they carried about the statues of jupiter and the other gods twelve days during which time the gods were said to be gone to the aethiopians and if the gods may be said to come to the aethiopians by their statues why may not the same be said of minerva from the introduction of her statue among the pylians so that the appearance of the goddess may possibly mean the appearance of her statue  xlviii verse   0 stratius and echephron etc nestor here makes use only of the ministry of his sons the reason of it is because it was reckoned honorable to serve in the performance of sacrifice this being in some sense an attending upon the gods or because it was the practice of those ages for great persons to do those offices with their own hands which in the latter have been performed by servants  eustathius reports a saying of antigonus who observing his son behaving himself imperiously to his subjects know thou not says he that royalty it self is but illustrious servitude an intimation that he himself was but a servant of the public and therefore should use his servants with moderation  but the true reason of nestors assisting in the sacrifice is because kings anciently had the inspection of religion and priesthood was joined to royalty according to that of virgil rex anius rex idem hominum phoebique sacerdos  xlix verse     maids wives and matrons mix a shrilling sound i have kept the meaning of the word in the original which signifies prayers made with loud cries  says hesychius is  the voice of women which they make at sacrifices in their prayers but there is still something in it more to the present purpose the scholiast upon aeschylns remarks that this word is not used properly but when applied to the prayers offered to minerva for minerva is the only goddess to whom prayers are made with loud cries she being the goddess of war to other deities they offer prayer with thanksgiving   thus also in the  th book of the iliads verse  0   they fill the dome with supplicating cries   and in the present passage in the odyssey    etc dacier  l verse     sweet polycaste took the pleasing toil to bathe the prince etc it is very necessary to say something about this practice of women bathing and anointing men it frequently occurs through the whole odyssey and is so contrary to the usage of the moderns as to give offense to modesty neither is this done by women of inferior quality but we have here a young princess bathing anointing and clothing the naked telemachus eustathius indeed tells us it was undoubtedly by her fathers command but if it was a piece of immodesty it does not solve the objection whoever commanded it i confess it would be immodest in these ages of the world and the only excuse that occurs to me is to say that custom established it it is in manners in some degree as in dress if a fashion never so indecent prevails yet no person is ridiculous because it is fashionable so in manners if a practice prevails universally though not reconcilable to real modesty yet no person can be said to be immodest who comes into it because it is agreeable to the custom of the times and countries  verse   0 etc the conclusion of the book i shall lay together what i have further to observe on the conclusion of this book it is remarkable that the poet does not amuse himself in describing the present he received from nestor or the provisions for the journey or even the journey it self at large he dispatches the whole in a few lines very judiciously he carries his hero directly to menelaus who is to furnish many incidents that contribute to the design of the poem and passes over other matters as unnecessary  we have here likewise a piece of poetical geography and learn that it is exactly two days journey from pyle to lacedaemon  this book takes up three days the first is spent in the enquiries telemachus makes of nestor concerning ulysses the two last in the morning sacrifice at pylos and in the journey of telemachus to lacedaemon so that five days have now passed since the opening of the poem i have said nothing about the sacrifice though it be the most exact description of the sacrifices as practiced by the ancients perhaps extant in any author i refer to the observations upon the first book of the iliad  i would here remark that the three first books are written with the utmost simplicity there has been no room for such exalted strokes of poetry as are to be found in the iliad or in the future parts of the odyssey but this is not owing to the decay of genius in homer as some critics have affirmed who look upon the odyssey as bearing marks of his declining years but to the nature of the subject the characters of achilles and ulysses are both very great but very different the iliad consists of battles and a continual commotion the odyssey in patience and wisdom and consequently the style of the two poems must be as different as the characters of the two heroes a noble fountain of poetry opens in the next book and flows with an uninterrupted course almost through the whole odyssey    the fourth book of the odyssey the argument telemachus with pisistratus arriving at sparta is hospitably received by menelaus to whom he relates the cause of his coming and learns from him many particulars of what befell the greeks since the destruction of troy he dwells more at large upon the prophecies of proteus to him in his return from which he acquaints telemachus that ulysses is detained in the island of calypso  in the meantime the suitors consult to destroy telemachus in his voyage home penelope is apprizd of this but comforted in a dream by pallas in the shape of her sister ipthima    wk pfsc  the fourth book of the odyssey and now proud sparta with their wheels resounds sparta whose walls a range of hills surrounds at the fair dome their rapid labor ends where

that safe recess they gain with happy speed and in close ambush wait the murderous deed wk pfsc    observations on the fourth book observations on the fourth book i aristotle in his poetics reports that certain ancient critics reproached homer for an indecency in making telemachus take his abode with menelaus and not with his own grandfather icarius this monsieur dacier sufficiently answers by showing that icarius had settled himself in acarnania and not in lacedaemon  ii verse    invoking hymen s power athenaeus has been very severe upon this passage as eustathius observes and dacier from eustathius  aristarchus says athenaeus misguides us the words  led him into an error whereas the marriage is completed the wedded couples gone away from menelaus and he and helen are alone at lacedaemon the five verses continues he the fifteenth to the twentieth inclusively are taken from the   th book of the iliads and inserted very improperly in this place by aristarchus athenaeus gives several reasons for his opinion as that music and dancing were very contrary to the severe manners of the lacedaemonians besides the dance was a cretan dance how then could it be practiced among the spartans the poet mentions neither the name of the bard nor one word of the subject of the songs neither can the words  be applied at all to the dancers but to the musicians and lastly it is not to be imagined that telemachus and pisistratus should be so unpolite as not to be at all affected with the music had there been any and yet break out into such wonder at the sight of the beauty of the palace of menelaus aristarchus adds he thought the description of the wedding of the son and daughter of a king was too meanly and concisely described and therefore made this addition  but it is easy to refute athenaeus and vindicate aristarchus athenaeus understood  and  in the wrong sense they are of the imperfect he was sending or about to send and not had sent etc if the marriage had been absolutely finished why should minerva absent her self from menelaus when the celebration of the nuptials is the only reason of the absence of that goddess and as for music and dancing being contrary to the severe manners of the lacedaemonians this is all conjecture menelaus lived more than three hundred years before lycurgus and because such diversions were forbid in sparta in the days of lycurgus must it follow that they were not used in those of menelaus and should it be granted that music and dancing were not used in his times might he not relax a little from the severity of his times upon such an occasion of joy as the marriage of a son and daughter i am sure these diversions are not more contrary to the severity of the spartans than the magnificence of the palace of menelaus was to their simplicity but he does not name the bard or the subject of his songs but is this a reason why the verses are spurious we should rather admire the judgment of the poet who having so fair an opportunity to describe these nuptials yet rejects the temptation dismisses the whole in a few lines and follows where his subject leads him the objection about the dance being cretan is not more valid menelaus as we learn from the preceding book had been in crete and might bring it thence to lacedaemon and as for the criticism upon  it is but a fallacy casaubon has shown beyond contradiction that  is applied indifferently to all those who give example to others and consequently may be applied to dancers as well as musicians it may be further added that although it should be allowed that the word  is only properly applied to music yet in this place the word would not be improperly applied to dancers for the dancers without usurping upon the province of the singer might  or choose those songs to which they desired to dance as is the usage at this day  diodorus is of opinion that the whole twelve lines after the second to the fifteenth are not genuine but what has been said of athenaeus may be applied to diodorus  iii verse    menelaus blames eteoneus this is the first appearance of menelaus and surely nothing can more reconcile him to the favor of the spectators than those amiable colors in which the poet paints him there is an overflow of humanity and gratitude in his expressions like that of dido in virgil non ignara mali miseris succurrere disco they contain a fine piece of morality and teach that those men are more tenderhearted and humane who have felt the reverse of fortune than those who have only lived in a condition of prosperity  iv verse    softwhispring thus to nestor s son this may be thought a circumstance of no importance and very trivial in telemachus but it shows his address and decency he whispers to avoid the appearance of a flatterer or to conceal his own inexperience in showing too much surprise at the magnificence of the palace of menelaus eustathius  v verse    the monarch took the word etc the ancients says eustathius observe the prudence of menelaus in his reply to telemachus and the prudence of telemachus in his behavior to menelaus menelaus denies not his riches and magnificence but to take off the envy which they might attract he throws the calamities he has undergone into the contrary scale and balances his felicity with his misfortunes and telemachus coming into the palace at the time of an entertainment chooses to satisfy his curiosity rather than his appetite plutarch i confess condemns telemachus of inexperience who when he saw the palace of nestor furnished only with things useful to life as beds tables etc is seized with no admiration but the superfluities of menelaus his ivory amber and gold etc carry him into transports whereas a socrates or a diogenes would have exclaimed what heaps of vanities have i beheld it is true such a judgment might become philosophers but who as dacier observes can think the character of a socrates or a diogenes suitable to young telemachus what is decent in a prince and a young man would ill become the gravity and wisdom of a philosopher  vi verse  00 through regions fattend with the flows of nile next aethiopia etc the words are in the original  others read them  from their veracity in oracles for which they were very famous and indeed the word  is not necessary it being used in the very same sentence though it must be confessed such repetitions are frequent in homer there is also a different reading of the word  some have it  or blacks others  but the common reading is thought the best the erembri are the arabian troglodytes strabo informs us that in former ages the bounds of the aethiopians lay near to thebes in egypt so that menelaus traveling to thebes might with ease visit the aethiopians others have without any foundation imagined that he passed the streights of gibraltar and sailed to the indies sidon is the capital of the phaenicians eustathius  vii verse  0   where each revolving year the teeming ewes etc these sheep as described by homer may be thought the creation of the poet and not the production of nature but herodotus says eustathius writes that in scythia the oxen have no horns through the extremity of the cold he quotes this very verse rightly intimating adds herodotus that in hot regions the horns of cattle shoot very speedily aristotle directly asserts that in libya the young ones of horned cattle have horns immediately after they are brought into the world so that aristotle and herodotus vindicate homer the poet adds that the sheep breed three times in the year these words may have a different interpretation and imply that they breed in three seasons of the year and not only in the spring as in other countries or that the sheep have at once three lambs but the first is the better interpretation athenaeus upon this passage writes that there are things in other countries no less strange than what homer relates of these sheep of libya thus in lusitania a country of spain now portugal there is a wonderful fruitfulness in all cattle by reason of the excellent temper of the air the fruits there never rot and the roses violets and asparagus never fail above three months in the year eustathius  viii verse     the best of brothers   a traitress wife menelaus neither mentions agamemnon clytemnestra nor aegysthus by name a just indignation and resentment is the occasion of his suppressing the names of clytemnestra and aegysthus through the whole iliad menelaus is described as a very affectionate brother and the love he bears agamemnon is the reason why he passes by his name in silence we see that he dispatches the whole in one verse and a half nestor had told the story pretty largely in the preceding book and as he was a person less nearly concerned might speak of it with more ease and better temper than menelaus the poet avoids a needless repetition and a repetition too of a story universally known to all the greeks the death of agamemnon is distributed into four places in the odyssey nestor menelaus proteus and the shade of agamemnon in the   th book all relate it and every one very properly proteus as a prophet more fully than nestor or menelaus and agamemnon more fully than them all as being best acquainted with it eustathius  ix verse     my wars the copious theme etc in the original menelaus says i have destroyed a house etc there is an ambiguity in the expression as eustathius observes for it may either signify the house of priam or his own in argos if it be understood of his own then the meaning is i have indeed great wealth but have purchased it with the loss of my people i could be content with the third part of it if i could restore those to life who have perished before troy if it be understood of the kingdom of priam the regret he shows will still appear the greater he is enumerating his domestic happiness and his foreign conquest of troy but he throws the destruction of so many brave men who fell before it in the contrary scale and it so far outweighs both his wealth and his glory that they both are joyless to him either of these interpretations show an excellent temper of humanity in menelaus who thinks the effusion of blood too dear a price for glory at the same time the poet gives an admirable picture of human nature which is restless in the pursuit of what it miscalls happiness and when in possession of it neglects it but the disquiet of menelaus arises not from inconstancy of temper but wisdom it shows that all happiness is unsatisfactory  x verse     but oh ulysses  etc it is with admirable address that the poet falls into his subject it is art but yet it seems to be nature this conduct has a double effect it takes away all suspicion of flattery for menelaus is ignorant that the person with whom he discourses is telemachus this gives him a manifest evidence of the love he bears to ulysses the young man could not but be pleased with the praise of his father and with the sincerity of it it is also observable that menelaus builds his friendship for ulysses upon a noble foundation i mean the sufferings which ulysses underwent for his friend menelaus ascribes not their affection to any familiarity or intercourse of entertainments but to a more sincere cause to the hazards which brave men undertake for a friend in short the friendship of menelaus and ulysses is the friendship of heroes eustathius  xi verse      bright helen graced the room menelaus conjectured that the person he had entertained was the son of ulysses from the tears he shed at the name of his father and from the resemblance there was between ulysses and telemachus it might therefore have been expected that menelaus should immediately have acknowledged telemachus and not delayed a full discovery one moment out of regard to his absent friend but menelaus defers it upon a twofold account to give some time to telemachus to indulge his sorrow for his father and recover himself from it and also to avoid the repetition of a discovery upon the appearance of helen who would be curious to know the condition of the strangers  it may be necessary to say something concerning helen that fatal beauty that engaged greece and asia in arms she is drawn in the same colors in the odyssey as in the iliad it is a vicious character but the colors are so admirably softened by the art of the poet that we pardon her infidelity menelaus is an uncommon instance of conjugal affection he forgives a wife who had been false to him and receives her into a full degree of favor but perhaps the reader might have been shocked at it and prejudiced against helen as a person that ought to be forgot or have her name only mentioned to disgrace it the poet therefore to reconcile her to his reader brings her in as a penitent condemning her own infidelity in very strong expressions she shows true modesty when she calls herself impudent and by this conduct we are inclined like menelaus to forgive her  xii verse     etc adraste alcippe helen s maids it has been observed that helen has not the same attendants in the odessey as she had in the iliad they perhaps might be trojans and consequently be left in their own country or rather it was an act of prudence in menelaus not to suffer those servants about her who had been her attendants and confidents in her infidelity eustathius  xiii verse      the grace and air of young telemachus it may seem strange that helen should at first view recollect the features of ulysses in telemachus and that menelaus who was better acquainted with him and his constant friend should not make the same observation but athenaeus to reconcile this to probability says that women are curious and skilful observers of the likeness of children to parents for one particular reason that they may upon finding any dissimilitude have the pleasure of hinting at the unchastity of others  xiv verse     for his abode a capital prepared the poet puts these words in the mouth of menelaus to express the sincerity of his friendship to ulysses he intended him all advantage and no detriment we must therefore conclude that ulysses was still to retain his sovereignty over ithaca and only remove to argos to live with so sincere a friend as menelaus eustathius  xv verse      a gust of grief began to rise etc it has been observed through the iliad and may be observed through the whole odyssey that it was not a disgrace to the greatest heroes to shed tears and indeed i cannot see why it should be an honor to any man to be able to divest himself of humane nature so far as to appear insensible upon the most affecting occasions no man is born a stoic it is art not nature tears are only a shame when the cause from whence they flow is mean or vicious here menelaus laments a friend telemachus a father pisistratus a brother but from what cause arise the tears of helen it is to be remembered that helen is drawn in the softest colors in the odyssey the character of the adultress is lost in that of the penitent the name of ulysses throws her into tears because she is the occasion of all the sufferings of that brave man the poet makes her the first in sorrow as she is the cause of all their tears  xvi verse     let not your roof with echoing grief resound now for the feast the friendly howl is crowned it may be asked why sorrow for the dead should be more unseasonable in the evening than the morning eustathius answers lest others should look upon our evening tears as the effect of wine and not of love to the dead intempestiores venit inter pocula fletus nee lacrymas dulci fas est miscere falerno i fancy there may be a more rational account given of this expression the time of feasting was ever looked upon as a time of joy and thanksgiving to the gods it bore a religious veneration among the ancients and consequently to shed tears when they should express their gratitude to the gods with joy was esteemed a profanation  xvii verse  0  bright helen mixed a mirthinspiring bowl etc the conjectures about this cordial of helen have been almost infinite some take nepenthes allegorically to signify history music or philosophy plutarch in the first of the symposiacs affirms it to be discourse well suiting the present passions and conditions of the hearers macrobius is of the same opinion delinimentum illud quod helena vino miscuit non herba fuit non ex india succus sed narrandi opportunitas quae hospitem maeroris oblitum flexit ad gaudium what gave a foundation to this fiction of homer as dacier observes might be this diodorus writes that in egypt and chiefly at heliopolis the same with thebes where menelaus sojourned as has been already observed there lived women who boasted of certain potions which not only made the unfortunate forget all their calamities but drove away the most violent sallies of grief or anger eusebius directly affirms that even in his time the women of diospolis were able to calm the rage of grief or anger by certain potions now whether this be truth or fiction it fully vindicates homer since a poet may make use of a prevailing though false opinion  milton mentions this nepenthes in his excellent masque of comus  behold this cordial julep here that flames and dances in his crystal bounds not that nepenthes which the wife of the one in egypt gave to jove born helena is of such power as this to stir up joy to life so friendly or so cool to thirst but that there may be something more than fiction in this is very probable since the egyptians were so notoriously skilled in physic and particularly since this very thon or thonis or thoon is reported by the ancients to have been the inventor of physic among the egyptians the description of this nepenthes agrees admirably with what we know of the qualities and effects of opium  it is further said of thon that he was king of canopus and entertained menelaus hospitably before he had seen helen but afterward falling in love with her and offering violence he was slain by menelaus from his name the egyptians gave the name of thoth to the first month of their year and also to a city the name of thonis aelian writes that menelaus when he traveled to the aethiopians committed helen to the protection of thonis that she fell in love with him that polydamna growing jealous confined her to the island pharos but gave her an herb to preserve her from the poison of serpents there frequent which from helen was called helenium strabo writes that at canopus on the mouth of nile there stands a city named thonies from king thonis who received helen and menelaus herodotus relates that thonis was governor of canopus that he represented the injury which paris had done to menelaus to proteus who reigned in memphis eustathius  this last remark from herodotus is sufficient to show that homer is not so fictitious as is generally imagined that there really was a king named proteus that the poet builds his fables upon truth and that it was truth that originally determined homer to introduce proteus into his poetry but i intend to explain this more largely in the story of proteus  xviii verse     my self  will tell ulysses bold exploit   what is here related shows the necessity of the introduction of helen and the use the poet makes of it she is not brought in merely as a muta persona to fill up the number of persons but she relates several incidents in which she her self was concerned and which she could only know and consequently not only diversisies but carries on the design of the story eustathius  xix verse     seamd over with wounds etc the poet here shows his judgment in passing over many instances of the sufferings of ulysses and relating this piece of conduct not mentioned by any other author the art of ulysses in extricating himself from difficulties is laid down as the groundwork of the poem he is  and this is an excellent example of it this further shows the necessity of the appearance of helen no other person being acquainted with the story if this stratagem be not a reality yet it bears the resemblance of it and megabysus the persian as eustathius observes practiced it as we learn from history we may reasonably conjecture that ulysses was committed to helen in hopes that he would discover the affairs of the army more freely to her than any other person for what could be more agreeable to a greek than to be committed to the care of a greek as ulysses was to helen by the same conduct the poet raises the character of helen by making her show her repentance by an act of generosity to her countryman the original says she gave an oath to ulysses not to discover him before he was in safety in the grecian army now this does not imply that she ever discovered to the trojans that ulysses had entered troy the contrary opinion is most probable for it cannot be imagined but all troy must have been incensed greatly against her had they known that she had concealed one of their mortal enemies and dismissed him in safety it was sufficient for ulysses to take her oath that she would not discover him till he was in security he left her future conduct to her own discretion it is probable that she furnished ulysses with a sword for in his return he slew many trojans he came to troy observes eustathius in rags and like a slave and to have concealed a sword would have endangered his life upon a discovery of it and given strong suspicions of an impostor  xx verse     exploring then the secrets of the state the word  is here used in a large sense it takes in all the observations ulysses made during his continuance in troy it takes in the designs and counsels of the enemy his measuring the gates the height of the walls the easiest plan for an assault or ambush the taking away the palladium or whatever else a wise man may be supposed to observe or act in execution of such a stratagem eustathius  xxi verse     for then with dire remorse etc the conclusion of this speech is very artful helen ascribes her seduction to venus and mentions nothing of paris instead of naming troy she conceals it and only says she was carried thither leaving troy to the imagination of menelaus she suffers not herself to mention names so odious now to herself and ever to menelaus as paris and troy she compliments menelaus very handsomely and says that he wanted no accomplishment either in mind or body it being the nature of man not to resent the injuries of a wife so much upon the account of her being corrupted but of the preference she gives to another person he looks upon such a preference as the most affecting part of the injury eustathius  xxii verse     menelaus s answer the judgment of the poet in continuing the story concerning ulysses is not observed by any commentator ulysses is the chief hero of the poem every thing should have a reference to him otherwise the narration stands still without any advance toward the conclusion of it the poet therefore to keep ulysses in our minds dwells upon his sufferings and adventures he supplies his not appearing in the present scene of action by setting his character before us and continually forcing his prudence patience and valor upon our observation he uses the same art and judgment with relation to achilles in the iliads the hero of the poem is absent from the chief scenes of action during much of the time which that poem comprises but he is continually brought into the mind of the reader by recounting his exploits and glory  xxiii verse     some demon anxious for the trojan doom it is the observation of eustathius that these words are very artfully introduced to vindicate helen they imply that what she acted was by compulsion and to evidence this more clearly deiphobus is given her for an attendant as a spy upon her actions that she might not conceal any thing that should happen but act her part well by endeavoring to deceive the greeks in favor of troy it is the demon not helen that is in fault this continues eustathius answers many objections that lie against helen for if she was a real penitent as she her self affirms how comes she to endeavor to deceive the greeks by the disguise of her voice into more misery than had yet arisen from a ten years war or indeed is it credible that any person could modulate her voice so artfully as to resemble so many voices and how could the greeks enclosed in the wooden horse believe that their wives who were in greece could be arrived in so short a space as they had been concealed there from the various regions of greece and meet together in troy would the wives of these heroes come into an enemys country when the whole army except these latent heroes were retired from it this is ridiculous and impossible i must confess there is great weight in these objections but eustathius answers all by the interposition of the demon and by an idle tradition that helen had the name of echo from the faculty of mimicking sounds and that this gift was bestowed upon her by venus when she married menelaus that she might be able to detect him if he should prove false to her bed by imitating the voice of the suspected person but menelaus had more occasion for this faculty than helen as for the excuse of the demon it equally excuses all crimes for instance was helen false to menelaus the demon occasioned it does she act an imposture to destroy all her grecian friends and even menelaus the demon compells her to it the demon compells her to go with deiphobus to surround the horse thrice to sound the sides of it to endeavor to surprise the latent greeks by an imition of the voices of their wives and in short to act like a person that was very sincere in mischief  dacier takes another course and gives up helen but remarks the great address of menelaus helen had said she long desired nothing so much as to return to lacedaemon and her heart had long been wholly turned to menelaus menelaus is not at all convinced of this pretended sincerity but it would have been too gross after he had taken her again to his bed to convict her of falsehood he therefore contents himself barely to reply that some demon an enemy to the greeks had forced her to a conduct disagreeable to her sincerity this continues dacier is an artful but severe irony  as for the objection concerning the impossibility of the greeks believing their wives could be in troy she answers that the authors of this objection have not sufficiently considered human nature the voice of a beloved person might of a sudden and by surprise draw from any person a word involuntary before he has time to make reflection this undoubtedly is true where circumstances make an imposture probable but here is an impossibility it is utterly impossible to believe the wives of these heroes could be in troy besides menelaus himself tells us that even he had fallen into the snare but ulysses prevented it this adds to the incredibility of the story for if this faculty of mimickry was given upon his marriage with helen it was nothing new to him he must be supposed to be acquainted with it and consequently be the less liable to surprise nay it is not impossible but the experiment might have been made upon him before helen fled away with paris  in short i think this passage wants a further vindication the circumstances are low if not incredible virgil the great imitator of homer has given us a very different and more noble description of the destruction of troy he has not thought fit to imitate him in this description  if we allow helen to act by compulsion to have feared the trojans and that deiphobus was sent as a spy upon her actions yet this is no vindication of her conduct she still acts a mean part and through fear becomes an accomplice in endeavoring to betray and ruin the greeks  i shall just add that after the death of paris helen married deiphobus that the story of the wooden horse is probably founded upon the taking of troy by an engine called a horse as the like engine was called a ram by the romans  xxiv verse     heavens would a soft inglorious dastard train menelaus is fired with indignation at the injuries offered his friend by the suitors he breaks out into an exclamation and in a just contempt vouchsafes not to mention them he thinks he fully distinguishes whom he intends by calling them  those cowards the comparison which he introduces is very just they are the fawns ulysses is the lion  this is the first simile that homer has inserted in the odyssey but i cannot think it proceeded from a barrenness of invention or throphlegm in the declension of his years as some have imagined the nature of the poem requires a difference of style from the iliad the iliad rushes along like a torrent the odyssey flows gently on like a deep stream with a smooth tranquillity achilles is all fire ulysses all wisdom  the simile in homer is really beautiful but in hobbs ridiculous as when a stag and hind entering the den of the absent lion lulls his whelps with tales of hills and dales the lion comes again and tears them into pieces with his nails can any thing be more foreign to the sense of homer or worse translated he construes  by telling stories of hills and dales to the lions whelps instead of juga investigat but such mistakes are so frequent in hobbs that one would almost suspect his learning in greek he has disgraced the best poet and a very great historian homer and thucydides  xxv verse     as when contending on the lesbian shore the poet here gives an account of one of ulyssess adventures philomelides was king of lesbos and eustathius observes that there was a tradition that ulysses and diomedes slew him and turned a stately monument he had raised for himself into a public place for the reception of strangers  xxvi verse      the pharian isle this description of pharos has given great trouble to the critics and geographers it is generally concluded that the distance of pharos is about seven stadia from alexandria ammianus marcellinus mentions this very passage thus lib    insula pharos ubi protea cum phocarum gregibus diversatum homerus fabulatur inflatius a civitatis littore mill passibus disparata or about a mile distant from the shores how then comes homer to affirm it to be distant a full days sail dacier answers that homer might have heard that the nile continually bringing down much earthy substance had enlarged the continent and knowing it not to be so distant in his time took the liberty of a poet and described it as still more distant in the days of menelaus but dacier never sees a mistake in homer had his poetry been worse if he had described the real distance of pharos it is allowable in a poet to disguise the truth to adorn his story but what ornament has he given his poetry by this enlargement bochart has fully proved that there is no accession to the continent from any substance that the nile brings down with it the violent agitation of the seas prohibit it from lodging and forming it self into solidity eratosthenes is of opinion that homer was ignorant of the mouths of nile but strabo answers that his silence about them is not an argument of his ignorance for neither has he ever mentioned where he was born but strabo does not enter fully into the meaning of eratosthenes eratosthenes does not mean that homer was ignorant of the mouths of nile from his silence but because he places pharos at the distance of a whole days sail from the continent the only way to unite this inconsistence is to suppose that the poet intended to specify the pelusiac mouth of nile from which pharos stands about a days sail but this is submitted to the critics  i cannot tell whether one should venture to make use of the word nile in the translation it is doubtless an anachronism that name being unknown in the times of homer and menelaus when the nile was called aegyptus homer in this very book   yet on the other hand this name of aegyptus is so little known that a common reader would scarce distinguish the river from the country and indeed universal custom has obtained for using the latin name instead of the grecian in many other instances which are equally anachronisms witness all the names of the gods and goddesses throughout homer jupiter for zeus juno for ere neptune for posidaon etc  xxvii verse     bait the barbd steel and from the fishy flood menelaus says hunger was so violent among his companions that they were compelled to eat fish plutarch in his symposiacs observes that among the egyptians syrians and greeks to abstain from fish was esteemed a piece of sanctity that though the greeks were encamped upon the hellespont there is not the least intimation that they eat fish or any seaprovision and that the companions of ulysses in the   th book of the odyssey never fought for fish till all their other provisions were consumed and that the same necessity compelled them to eat the herds of the sun which induced them to taste fish no fish is ever offered in sacrifice the pythagoreans in particular command fish not to be eaten more strictly than any other animal fish afford no excuse at all for their destruction they live as it were in another world disturb not our air consume not our fruits or injure the waters and therefore the pythagoreans who were unwilling to offer violence to any animals fed very little or not at all on fishes i thought it necessary to insert this from plutarch because it is an observation that explains other passages in the sequel of the odyssey  xxviii verse     proteus a name tremendous over the main eustathius enumerates various opinions concerning proteus some understand proteus allegorically to signify the first matter which undergoes all changes others make him an emblem of true friendship which ought not to be settled till it has been tried in all shapes others make proteus a picture of a flatterer who takes up all shapes and suits himself to all forms in compliance to the temper of the person whom he courts the greeks observes diodorus imagined all these metamorphoses of proteus to have been borrowed from the practices of the egyptian kings who were accustomed to wear the figures of lions bulls or dragons in their diadems as emblems of royalty and sometimes that of trees etc not so much for ornament as terror others took proteus to be an enchanter and eustathius recounts several that were eminent in this art as cratisthenes the phliasian which dacier renders by mistake callisthenes the physician who when he pleased could appear all on fire and assume other appearances to the astonishment of the spectators such also was xenophon scymnus of tarentum philippides of syracuse heraclitus of mitylene and nymphodorus all practisers of magical arts and eustathius recites that the phocae were made use of in their incantations some write that proteus was an egyptian tumbler who could throw himself into variety of figures and postures others a stage player others that he was a great general skilled in all the arts and stratagems of war dacier looks upon him to have been an enchanter or  it is certain from herodotus that there was in the times of menelaus a king named proteus who reigned in memphis that egypt was always remarkable for those who excelled in magical arts thus jannes and jambres changed at least in appearance a rod into a serpent and water into blood it is not therefore improbable but that menelaus hearing of him while he was in egypt went to consult him as an enchanter which kind of men always pretended to foreknow events this perhaps was the real foundation of the whole story concerning proteus the rest is the fiction and embellishment of the poet who ascribes to his proteus whatever the credulity of men usually ascribes to enchanters  xxix verse     but when his native shape resumed etc this is founded upon the practice of enchanters who never give their answers till they have astonished the imagination of those who consult them with their juggling delusions dacier  xxx verse     and shouting seize the god   proteus has through the whole story been described as a god who knew all things it may then be asked how comes it that he did not foreknow the violence that was designed against his own person and is it not a contradiction that he who knew menelaus without information should not know that he lay in ambush to seize him the only answer that occurs to me is that these enchanters never pretend to have an inherent foreknowledge of events but learn things by magical arts and by recourse to the secrets of their profession so that proteus having no suspicion had not consulted his art and consequently might be surprised by menelaus so far is agreeable to the pretensions of such deluders the poet indeed has drawn him in colors stronger than life but poetry adds or detracts at pleasure and is allowed frequently to step out of the way to bring a foreign ornament into the story  xxxi verse     to jove  just hecatombs  etc homer continually inculcates morality and piety to the gods he gives in this place a great instance of the necessity of it menelaus cannot succeed in any of his actions till he pays due honors to the gods the neglect of sacrifice is the occasion of all his calamity and the performance of it opens a way to all his future prosperity  xxxii verse      nile who from the secret source of jove s high seat descends   homer it must be confessed gives the epithet  generally to all rivers if he had used it here peculiarly there might have been room to have imagined that he had been acquainted with the true cause of the inundations of this famous river the word  implies it for it is now generally agreed that these prodigious inundations proceed from the vast rains and the melting of the snows on the mountains of the moon in aethiopia about the autumnal aequinox when those rains begin to fall the river by degrees increases and as they abate it decreases the word  is therefore peculiarly proper when applied to the nile for though all rivers depend upon the waters that fall from the air or  yet the nile more especially for when the rain ceases the nile consists only of seven empty channels  xxxiii verse     and to the abyss the boaster bore it is in the original he died having drunk the salt water this verse has been omitted in many editions of homer and the ancients says eustathius blame aristarchus for not marking it as a verse that ought to be rejected the simplicity of it consists in the sense more than in the terms and it is unworthy of proteus to treat the death of ajax with pleasantry as he seems to do by adding having drunk salt water but why may not proteus be supposed to be serious and the terms  to imply no more than that he was drowned in waves of the ocean i know only one reason that can give any color to the objection viz it is being possibly become a vulgar expression and used commonly in a ludicrous sense then indeed it is to be avoided in poetry but it does not follow because perhaps it might be used in this manner in the days of these critics that therefore it was so used in the days of homer what was poetical in the time of the poet might be grown vulgar in the time of the critics  xxxiv verse     so whilst he feeds luxurious in the stall etc dacier translates  by taureau a bull and misunderstands eustathius who directly says that in the  d iliad the poet compares agamemnon to a bull in this place to an ox  the one was undoubtedly designed to describe the courage and majestic port of a warrior the other to give us an image of a prince falling in full peace and plenty   xxxv verse     or in eternal shade if cold he lies proteus in the beginning of his relation had said that one person was alive and remained enclosed by the ocean how then comes menelaus here to say give me an account of that other person who is alive or dead perhaps the sorrow which menelaus conceived for his friend ulysses might make him fear the worst and proteus adding enclosed by the ocean might give a suspicion that he was dead the words being capable of ambiguity however this be it sets the friendship of menelaus in a strong light where friendship is sincere a state of uncertainty is a state of fears we dread even possibilities and give them an imaginary certainty upon this one of the finest compliments that a poet ever made to a patron turns that of horace to mecaenas in the first of the epodes  it may not perhaps be disagreeable to the reader to observe that virgil has borrowed this story of proteus from homer and translated it almost literally rapine says that homers description is more ingenious and fuller of invention but virgils more judicious i wish that critic had given his reasons for his opinion i believe in general the plan of the iliad and odyssey is allowed by the best of critics to be more perfect than that of the aeneis homer with respect to the unity of time has the advantage very manifestly rapine confesses it and aristotle proposes him as an example to all epic authors where then is the superiority of judgment is it that there are more fabulous i mean incredible stories in homer than virgil as that of the cyclops the ships of alcinous etc virgil has imitated most of these bold fables and the story of the ships of alcinous is not more incredible than the transformation of the ships of aeneas but this is too large a subject to be discussed in the compass of these annotations in particular passages i freely allow the preference to virgil as in the descent of aeneas into hell etc but in this story of proteus i cannot see any superiority of judgment virgil is little more than a translator to show the particulars would be too tedious i refer it to the reader to compare the two authors and shall only instance in one passage      etc cum clamore ruit magno manicisque jacentem occupat ille suae contra non immemor artis omnia transformat sese in miracula rerum ignemque horribilemque feram fluviumque liquentem etc   homer has a manifest advantage in the occasion of the story the loss of a few bees seems to be a cause too trivial for an undertaking so great as the surprise of a deity whereas the whole happiness of menelaus depends upon this consultation of proteus this is a far more important cause and consequently in this respect something more is due to homer than the sole honor of an inventor  xxxvi verse     elysium shall be thine the blissful plains of utmost earth etc   this is the only place in which the elysian field is mentioned in homer the conjectures of the ancients are very various about it plato in his phaed places it in coelo stellato or the region of the stars but since homer fixes it  or as milton expresses it at the earths green end i will pass over the conjectures of others especially since the  by which others express elysium confines it to this world  strabo says eustathius places it not far from maurusia that lies near the streights it is supposed by bochart as dacier observes that the fable is of phaenician extraction that alizuth in hebrew signifies joy or exultation which word the greeks adapting to their way of pronunciation called elysius if this be true i should come into an opinion that has much prevailed that the greeks had heard of paradise from the hebrews and that the hebrews describing paradise as a place of alizuth or joy gave occasion to all the fables of the grecian elysium  xxxvii verse  0  three sprightly coursers how comes it to pass that menelaus proffers three horses to telemachus this was a complete set among the ancients they used one polehorse and two leaders eustathius  xxxviii verse     that gift our barren rocks will render vain this passage where telemachus refuses the horses has been much observed and turned to a moral sense viz as a lesson to men to desire nothing but what is suitable to their conditions horace has introduced it into his epistles haud male telemachus proles patientis ulyssei non est aptus equis ithacae locus ut neque planis porrectus spatiis nec multae prodigus herbae atride magis apta tibi tua dona relinquam this is the reason why ulysses as eustathius observes upon the  0th of the iliads leaves the horses of rhesus to the disposal of diomedes so that the same spirit of wisdom reigned in telemachus that was so remarkable in ulysses this is the reason why menelaus smiled it was not at the frankness or simplicity of telemachus but it was a smile of joy to see the young prince inherit his fathers wisdom  it is the remark of eustathius that telemachus is far from exalting the nature of his country he confesses it to be barren and more barren than the neighboring islands yet that natural and laudable affection which all worthy persons have for their country makes him prefer it to places of a more happy situation this appears to me a replication to what menelaus had before offered concerning the transplantation of ulysses to sparta this is contained in  and then the meaning is it is true ithaca is a barren region yet more desirable than this country of lacedaemon this  it is the more probable from the offer of horses which menelaus had then made and is also another reason for the smile of menelaus  eustathius remarks that menelaus though he has expressed the greatest friendship for ulysses yet makes no offer to restore the fortunes of his friend by any military assistance though he had a most fair opportunity given him to repay the past kindness of ulysses to his wife penelope and his son telemachus and how comes telemachus not to ask it either of nestor or menelaus he answers that this depended upon the uncertainty they were yet under concerning the life of ulysses but the truer reason in my opinion is that the nature of epic poetry requires a contrary conduct the hero of the poem is to be the chief agent and the reestablishment of his fortunes must be owing to his own wisdom and valor i have enlarged upon this already so that there is no occasion in this place to insist upon it  xxxix verse     for ambushd close etc we have here another use which the poet makes of the voyage of telemachus eustathius remarks that these incidents not only diversify but enliven the poem but it may be asked why the poet makes not use of so fair an opportunity to insert a gallant action of telemachus and draw him not as eluding but defeating his adversaries the answer is easy that the suitors sailed completely armed and telemachus unprovided of any weapons and therefore homer consults credibility and forbears to paint his young hero in the colors of a knight in romance who upon all disadvantages engages and defeats his opposers but then to what purpose is this ambush of the suitors and what part of the design of the poem is carried on by it the very chief aim of it to show the sufferings of ulysses he is unfortunate in all relations of life as a king as an husband and here very eminently as a father these sufferings are laid down in the proposition of the odyssey as essential to the poem and consequently this ambush laid by the suitors against the life of telemachus is an essential ornament  xl verse  0  the speech of penelope longinus in particular commends this speech as a true picture of a person that feels various emotions of soul and is born by every gust of passion from sentiment to sentiment with sudden and unexpected transitions there is some obscurity in the greek this arises from the warmth with which she speaks she has not leisure to explain her self fully a circumstance natural to a person in anger  penelope gives a very beautiful picture of ulysses the best of princes are allowed to have their favorites and give a greater share of affection than ordinary to particular persons but ulysses was a father to all his people alike and loved them all as his children a father though he bears a more tender affection to one child than to another yet shows them all an equal treatment thus also a good king is not swayed by inclination but justice toward all his subjects dacier  one circumstance is very remarkable and gives us a full view of a person in anger at the very sight of medon penelope flies out into passion she gives him not time to speak one syllable but speaks her self as if all the suitors were present and reproaches them in the person of medon though medon is just to her and ulysses but anger is an undistinguishing passion what she says of ingratitude recalls to my memory what is to be found in laertius aristotle being asked what thing upon earth soonest grew old replied an obligation  respondit   xli verse     ride the wild waves   were this passage to be rendered literally it would run thus climb the swift ships which are horses to men on the seas eustathius observes the allusion is very just and that the only doubt is whether it be brought in opportunely by penelope it may be doubted if the mind could find leisure to introduce such allusions dacier answers that penelope speaks thus through indignation the grief that she conceives at the hardiness of men in finding out a way to pass the seas as well as land furnished her with these figures very naturally for figures are agreeable to passion  xlii verse     and isles remote enlarge his old domain dacier offers a criticism upon these last words of euryclea it cannot be imagined that these fertile fields can be spoken of ithaca plutarchs description of it is entirely contradictory to this  ithaca says he is rough and mountainous fit only to breed goats upon cultivation it scarce yields any fruits and these so worthless as scarce to recompense the labor of gathering homer therefore by this expression intended the other dominions of ulysses such as cephalenia etc  but i question not that the whole dominions of ulysses are included ithaca as well as cephalenia for though ithaca was mountainous yet the valleys were fruitful according to the description of it in the   th of the odyssey the rugged soil allows no level space for flying chariots or the rapid race yet not ungrateful to the peasants pain suffices fullness to the swelling grain the loaded trees their various fruits produce and clustring grapes afford a generous juice etc as for her remark upon  it is of no validity the word stands in opposition to  and implies no more than here or at a distance in general  xliii verse  0   the suitors heard and deemed the mirthful voice a signal of her hymenaeal choice it may be asked whence this conjecture of the suitors arises penelope is described as weeping grievously and fainting away and yet immediately the suitors conclude she is preparing for the nuptials eustathius answers that undoubtedly the suitors understood the queen had purified her self with water and supplicated the goddess minerva though the poet omits the relation of such little particularities but whence is it that the poet gives a greater share of wisdom to euryclea than to penelope penelope commands a servant to fly with the news of the absence of telemachus to laertes which could not at all advantage telemachus and only grieve laertes euryclea immediately diverts her from that vain intention advises her to have recourse to heaven and not add misery to the already miserable laertes this is wisdom in euryclea but it must be confessed that the other is nature in penelope euryclea is calm penelope in a passion and homer would have been a very bad painter of human nature if he had drawn penelope thus heated with passion in the mild temper of euryclea grief and resentment give penelope no time to deliberate whereas euryclea is less concerned and consequently capable of thinking with more tranquillity  xliv verse  0   with rebuke severe antinous cried antinous speaks thus in return to what had been before said by one of the suitors concerning telemachus viz the queen little imagines that her sons death approaches he fears lest penelope should know their intentions and hinder their measures by raising the subjects of ithaca that still retained their fidelity dacier  xlv verse  0   so when the woodmans toil etc the poet to show the majesty and high spirit of penelope compares her to a lioness he manages the allusion very artfully he describes the lioness not as exerting any dreadful act of violence for such a comparison is only proper to be applied to a hero but enclosed by her enemies which at once shows both her danger and nobleness of spirit under it it is in the greek  which may signify either a circle of toils or nets or a circle of enemies the former is perhaps preferable as corresponding best with the condition of penelope who was surrounded with the secret ambushes and snares of the suitors eustathius  xlvi verse  0   minerva lifelike on imbodyd air impressed the form etc we have here an imaginary being introduced by the poet the whole is managed with great judgment it is short because it has not a direct and immediate relation to the progress of the poem and because such imaginary entercourses have ever been looked upon as sudden in appearance and as sudden in vanishing away the use the poet makes of it is to relieve penelope from the extremity of despair that she may act her part in the future scenes with courage and constancy we see it is minerva who sends this phantom to penelope to comfort her now this is an allegory to express that as soon as the violence of sorrow was over the mind of penelope returned to some degree of tranquillity minerva is no more than the result of her own reflection and wisdom which banished from her breast those melancholy apprehensions the manner likewise of its introduction is not less judicious the mind is apt to dwell upon those objects in sleep which make a deep impression when awake this is the foundation of the poets fiction it is no more than a dream which he here describes but he clothes it with a body gives it a momentary existence and by this method exalts a low circumstance into dignity and poetry  xlvii verse  0   and with consummate woe etc in the original penelope says plainly she is more concerned for her son than her husband i shall translate daciers observation upon this passage we ought not to reproach penelope for this seemingly shocking declaration in preferring a son to an husband her sentiment is natural and just she had all the reason in the world to believe that ulysses was dead so that all her hopes all her affection was entirely placed upon telemachus his loss therefore must unavoidably touch her with the highest degree of sensibility if he is lost she can have recourse to no second comfort but why may we not allow the reason which penelope her self gives for this superiority of sorrow for telemachus  telemachus says she is unexperienced in the world and unable to contend with difficulties whereas ulysses knew how to extricate himself upon all emergencies this is a sufficient reason why she should fear more for telemachus than ulysses her affection might be greater for ulysses than telemachus yet her fears might be stronger for the son than the husband ulysses being capable to surmount dangers by experience telemachus being new to all difficulties  xlviii verse  0   enquire not of his doom etc it may be asked what is the reason of this conduct and why should the phantom refuse to relate any thing concerning the condition of ulysses eustathius answers that if the phantom had related the full truth of the story the poem had been at an end the very constitution of it requires that ulysses should arrive unknown to all but chiefly to his wife as will appear in the prosecution of the story the question is very natural for an affectionate wife to make concerning an absent husband but this being an improper place for the discovery the poet defers the solution of it till the unravelling of the whole in the conclusion of the poem  the action of this book takes up the space of two nights and one day so that from the opening of the poem to the introduction of ulysses are six days completed  but how long a time telemachus afterward stayed with menelaus is a question which has employed some modern french critics one of which maintains that he stayed no longer than these two nights at lacedaemon but it is evident from the sequel of the odyssey that telemachus arrived again at ithaca two days after ulysses but ulysses was twenty nine days in passing from ogygia to ithaca and consequently during that whole time telemachus must have been absent from ithaca the ground of that criticks mistake was from the silence of homer as to the exact time of his stay which was of no importance being distinguished by no action and only in an episodical part the same thing led me into the like error in the   d note on the second book where it is said that telemachus returned to ithaca in less than twelve days  the end of the first volume
