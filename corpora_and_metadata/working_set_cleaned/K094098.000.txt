and affection alike incline me to inscribe to you the following undertaking we are mutual and peculiar sufferers by the event of the campaign in      you were witnesses and judges of my actions but i owed you an account of the principles which directed them  another motive for this address is to avail myself of a proper public opportunity to repeat to you what i have omitted no occasion of expressing in parliament in correspondence and in conversation  the fullest approbation of your services my errors may have been numberless your conduct has been uniform  faithful gallant and indefatigable debarred of the power of doing you justice before the king these testimonies are the only means to which my esteem and gratitude can resort  after vindicating myself as a commanding officer from any inattention to your interest or fame i next throw myself upon your judgment for my conduct as a friend  you will find by this publication and some others which though not addressed to you will probably engage your curiosity that i have been accused of shrinking from the common captivity  i have been supported under that aspersion by the consciousness i did not deserve it and the confidence that you to whom chiefly upon that charge i was responsible would not adopt it after the fortunes we have run together it is not surely unworthy of belief that i should rather have desired than avoided to partake the closing scene uniting with a due sense of personal attachments the preservation of my military fortune and a retreat from the distractions of my country the defense of your honor and my own at one time and resistance to an affront the part of my treatment which i call an affront upon this and other occasions is the refusal of my service in this country even at the head of my own regiment or as a volunteer in the time of exigency and when other officers precisely in my own situation were employed my complaint of this partiality has never been officially answered it has only been evaded by anonymous writers who have laid it down as a position that i meant to allude to the example of lord harrington with which it certainly has nothing to do and then have taken a merit in refuting me the particular example to which i appeal is that of lieutenant colonel kingston of the   th regiment appointed to that regiment employed in it for the defense of plymouth and actually now embarking with it for foreign service under the same terms of the convention and the same terms of parole to the congress verbatim with myself other objections and of a nature that could not be afterward supported were tried against the duke of rutlands recommendation of this excellent officer but the objection of parole though fully known to be precisely the same with that which was so peremptorily urged against my pretensions was never mentioned which my nature could not bear at another alone detained me here  in regard to my political transactions i have stated them and i wish them to be considered by my friends apart from my miltary conduct i bear very high respect to some eminent and illtreated characters in our profession who in deference to the tranquillity of government have silently resigned the stations which they could no longer hold with security to their honor or benefit to the state but the option is not left to those who having a voice in parliament are obliged to act as citizens as well as soldiers the number of officers altogether of the army and navy who with known love to their country and professional spirit equally conspicuous have voluntarily withdrawn themselves from employment within these two years exceeds all precedent i do not place my name in the list with the same pretensions but it is not arrogant to emulate where we cannot compare and i am desirous of following the high examples before me in no point more than in that of avoiding to disturb the zeal of those who are now employed the officers who have held it their duty to take part in opposition have acted openly and directly in their place in parliament but they may defy malice to show an instance wherein they have not encouraged ardour in their profession they contemplate with one and the same sentiment the great supply of honorable men to occupy their places  you gentlemen stand high in that description your trials have made you of sterling value and perhaps it will be better discerned by men in power when no longer viewed through the unfavourable medium of my friendship if my exhortations retain their former weight let me be permitted earnestly to apply them upon this occasion the examples of generals or admirals who decline employment respect only similar cases your honor is secure look not at professional disappointments but point all your views to the true glory of your king and country and trust for the reward  o socii neque enim ignari sumus ante malorum o passi graviora dabit deus his quoque finem this passage will bring to the remembrance of some among you a hard hour when we before quoted it together and not without some cheer of mind  may the end of your enduring be near and with every other wish and sentiment that can denote esteem i have the honor to be  gentlemen your most faithful and most obedient humble servant j burgoyne hertfordstreet jan      0 introduction when it becomes necessary for men who have acted critical parts in public stations to make an appeal to the world in their own justification there are many prudential considerations which might lead them to commit the care of it to friends or which is in many respects the same thing to defend themselves under an assumed character the charge of vanity usually made on egotism is thus eluded a fuller scope may be given to selflove and particular resentment even the lower vexations which attend an author are to a great degree avoided the ill nature of criticism is seldom awakened by anonymous writings and the venal pens of party lose half their gall when the object of it is not personally and directly in question  but there are situations in which not only general assent seems to justify a man in speaking of himself but in which also no little consideration ought to be admitted to the mind such will be the case if i am not deceived when the interests of the public are blended with those of the individual and when his very errors may serve as instruction to others misfortunes which awaken sensibility will be a further and a persuasive call upon the attention of the public and it will amount to a claim upon their justice if he can show that he has been injuriously treated  upon maturely weighing these and several other circumstances after i had been denied a professional examination of my conduct and disappointed of a parliamentary one i determined to lay before the public a state of the expedition from canada in      in my own name and my first design was to do it under the title and with the latitude of memoirs as a mode by which i could best open the principles of my actions and introduce with most propriety collateral characters incidents and discussions as they might occasionally tend to illustrate the main subject  however in the last session of parliament the enquiry which had not been agreed to the year before took place i had pressed it and i entered into it under all the disadvantages which attend a struggle with power and the prejudice that power can raise against the persons it means to destroy the utmost that power could do was done the paliament was prorogued pending the proceedings but though by this contrivance a final and formal adjudication by that august assembly was avoided their minutes stand a sacred record of truth and justice and the most satisfactory reliance to which my wishes could aspire in offering my actions to the judgment of my country at large  from that time therefore i resolved to publish instead of memoirs the proceedings precisely as they passed in parliament and to continue my defense by such observations and comments upon the evidence as i should have had a right and was prepared to make had the proceedings in the house continued the order in which the committee in the house of commons proceeded was to hear sir william howes narrative respecting his conduct whilst in command in america and such evidence as he thought proper to bring in support of it they next heard my narrative and evidence respecting the conduct of the expedition from canada lord george germain then opened a defense on his part and summoned witnesses to support it according to the arrangement made by the committee sir william how and myself were afterward to be heard in reply but the proceedings were ended by the prorogation of parliament before the examination of lord georges second witness mr galloway was closed and there were sixteen or eighteen more upon his list the order in which the following papers are placed is   st the prefatory speech  d the narrative  d minutes of the verbal evidence  th review of the evidence with remarks and explanations etc  th an appendix containing the written evidence   possibly in this latter part some color of my original design may remain the scenes i have been engaged in are uncommon and it is a natural desire to place them in a full light the interests concerned make that desire more urgent and i dare believe they will be best guarded by being most explained  the speech of lieutenant general burgoyne prefatory to his narrative mr montagu before i enter upon the narrative which the precedent of your late proceedings authorizes me to lay before you i think it a duty to the committee to promise that i shall trouble them with little other matter than such as may be necessary to elucidate the transactions of the campaign      in that quarter where i commanded  i shall keep in mind that to explain the causes of the disaster at saratoga is the principal point to which all my evidence ought to lead but at the same time i shall take confidence in the justice and benevolence of my hearers that where arguments in exculpation of the commander can aptly be combined with a faithful representation of facts they will not be deemed foreign to the main object under their consideration  upon these ideas though some introductory explanations are requisite i shall suppress the inclination i at first conceived of stating my conduct from the time when conjointly with my honorable friend who took the lead in this enquiry sir william how i was called to the unsolicited and unwelcome service in america nor will i enumerate the complicated circumstances of private misfortune and ill health under which i pursued it prudence as well as other propriety is i confess consulted in this suppression for were it seen that an officer had blended with the respect due to authority warm though disinterested personal attachments that under a persuasion of the honor and integrity of the kings servants he had united to his zeal for the public cause an interest in their private credit and ambition would it not be conceived that his guilt must have been atrocious beyond all excuse or palliation to induce the very men to whom his endeavors and his faculties such as they were had been thus devoted not only completely to desert him but to preclude him as far as in them lay from every means of defense and if possible to ruin him in the opinion of the king the army and the country  an earnest desire to save as much as possible the time of the committee would also dissuade me from recurring to any points previous to my instructions which have been discussed upon former occasions but i find that great stress is still laid to my prejudice upon a paper which found its way to the house during my absence i mean the private letter to the noble lord secretary for the american department dated  st january      see appendix no i   the noble lord has frequently stated that letter to have slipped inadvertently into the parcel destined for the house and i give credit in that particular to his assertion because whatever other impressions he might have found it his interest to make respecting me he certainly would not have thought that the imputation on me which that letter tended to fix a proper one for him to put forward it is a notorious fact or i would not mention it that it has been held a reflection upon my character by the part of the public with whom the noble lord is unpopular that i addressed him as a patron and friend  this is an imputation to which i must plead guilty for at the time i wrote that letter i certainly did hold that noble lord as my friend and i had acted to deserve he should be so the next ill tendency of that paper was as the noble lord well knows to impress the public with an opinion that i was endeavoring to supplant sir guy carleton in the command of the northern army  an action abhorrent to the honor of an officer and the liberality of a gentleman and of which thank god i can prove the falsehood by irrefragable evidence upon your table and in a very small compass i need only refer to the dispatches to sir guy carleton by his aid decamp dated   d august      see appendix no ii four months before i came home to show that it was at that time determined that sir guy carleton should remain in canada and that determination was made as i have been informed not only upon the political reasoning which appears in that dispatch but also upon great law opinions that he could not under the commission he then held under the great seal pass the frontiers of his province sir this confutation was urged by me last year and were collateral proof necessary to my justification upon this subject i could bring to your bar a tribe of gentlemen who had imbibed impressions not very favorable to the military proceedings of sir guy carleton in the campaign of      i could show that i seized numberless indeed i seized every possible occasion to vindicate the judgment the assiduity the activity of that highly respectable officer careless how ill i paid my court earnest to meet every attack against his fame  i beg leave also to call the attention of the committee very particularly to one other paper the date of which is previous to my departure from england it is entitled thoughts for conducting the war from the side of canada by lieutenant general burgoyne no iii sir it will be in the recollection of the committee whether when the conduct of the war was under consideration last year in my absence it was not understood that the plan of the northern expedition was formed upon that paper as produced upon your table if so i must ask the noble lord why he suffered that error to prevail the noble lord knew and it was peculiarly his duty to declare it that the two proposals the first of turning the expedition eventually toward connecticut and the second of embarking the army in the river st lawrence in order to effect a junction with sir william how by sea in case the attempt by land appeared impracticable or too hazardous were erased while the paper was in his lordships hands  from that paper as it appeared without erasures naturally arose the conclusion that the plan i had to execute was completely my own upon that paper were founded as naturally the doubts which have been entertained upon the peremptory tenor of my instructions i must again ask the noble lord upon what principle of justice he suffered those impressions to exist in this house why in a debate in which he took a part did he conceal that the circumstances in reality were totally different from those upon which gentlemen reasoned that the discretion reserved in the paper before the house was taken away and consequently that my orders were rendered absolute in the strictest sense by his own alterations  let any gentleman who has supposed i had an implied latitude for my conduct now compare this circumstance with the wording of the letter to sir guy carleton dated march         with a copy of which i was furnished and extracts from which were afterward the only orders i had to act upon see appendix no iv   i shall take no particular notice of what is called the saving clause in the latter part of the orders except to give the flattest contradiction to the supposition that i dictated it  a supposition that i know is not yet abandoned by the men who first suggested it i have spoke to it very fully upon a former occasion the debate upon mr vyners motion may         the speech was published and i do not wish when it can be avoided to enforce or reiterate the charges of duplicity and treachery which must ensue if that clause could be supposed to have reference to any conduct previous to my arrival at albany the circumstance of forbidding me the latitude in the two particulars i had proposed in my plan and many other circumstances clearly indicating the decided intentions and expectations of the ministers rendered the sense of the whole order taken together clear and distinct and showed that the clause which is pretended to have left me a discretion as to my main object had no sort of relation to that object that clause evidently related not to my forcing my way or not forcing it to albany the place of my destination but to such collateral and eventual operations as might be advisable in the course of my march it related to the making impression upon the rebels and bringing them to obedience in such manner as exigencies might require and in my judgment might seem most proper previous to receiving orders from sir william how of my junction with whom i was never to lose view  notwithstanding there has been so much discussion in debate and print upon the interpretation of absolute orders the committee i am confident will absolve me though at the expense of a few moments more i should continue a subject upon which the merit or blame of the future proceedings in great measure rests  i do not admit the position that there can be no case in which an officer acting at a distance is bound at every hazard to pursue orders that appear absolute and decisive it is easy to conceive circumstances which might justify a state in hazarding an army for the sake of facilitating great and decisive objects gentlemen conversant in military history will recollect many examples of this principle upon a former occasion i stated a supposed case the case alluded to was put in a former debate as follows suppose the british army that invaded britany in      had gained a complete victory over the duke daiguillon to have marched rapidly toward paris abandoning the communication with the fleet exposing the army possibly to great want of provision and to the impracticability of retreat would certainly have been a measure consummately desperate and unjustifiable if tried upon military system yet will any man say that if that measure must evidently have produced such alarm and confusion in the heart of france as to have compelled the recall of her whole force from germany or such part of it as would have given uncontrouled scope to the armies under the king of prussia and prince ferdinand that the minister of england would not have been judicious though at the palpable risk of the army as far as capture was concerned in ordering the general to proceed by the most vigorous exertions and to force his way to paris and i now entreat leave to add a real example of peremptory orders which happened in the course of my own service i have ever retained the impression that the circumstance i am going to relate made upon my mind at the time and to those few who may still think that in any part of my conduct i rashly risked my peace my interest or my fame to forward the wishes of others this prepossession may in some measure account for and excuse my imprudence  in the campaign of      in portugal the count la lip a name which if it finds a due historian will stand among the first in military fame was placed at the head of about  000 british troops and a portuguese army the greater part of which was little better than nominal to defend an extensive frontier against the whole force of spain and a large body of the veteran troops of france the salvation of portugal depended solely on the capacity of that great man which united the deepest political reasoning with exquisite military address  i had the honor to be entrusted with the defense of the most important pass upon the tagus and my orders were peremptory to maintain it against any numbers and to the last man  a select corpse of the enemy greatly superior to mine were encamped within sight on the other side the river and our advanced posts were within half musket shot  in this situation i received intelligence from count la lip of a design of the enemy to pass the tagus in force about six miles above me and to take possession of the open country in my rear with a large corpse of cavalry by which means all communication supply or safe retreat would be cut off  together with this intelligence the counts letter expressed that every delay to the enemy in getting possession of the pass i guarded was so material to his other plans and operations that it justified a deviation from systematic rules that therefore after taking timely precautions to secure the retreat of my cavalry i must abide the consequence with the infantry that at the last extremity i must abandon my cannon camp etc and with such provision as the men could carry upon their backs throw myself into the mountains upon my left and endeavor by small and dispersed parties to gain a rendezvous at the northern part of the province i must observe that when these peremptory orders were given the commander was at a distance that made all timely communication of circumstances as impossible as if the atlantic had been between us and i cannot close the example without mentioning the concluding part of count la lippes letter he participated he said in the feelings with which an officer would be struck for his reputation in suffering himself to be cut and reduced to sacrifice his camp his baggage and twenty pieces of cannon but be at ease continued that great and generous man  i will take the measure entirely upon myself persevere as i have directed and be confident of my defense and protection this was a saving clause of a nature very different from those it is the practice in the present day to pen and if any man doubts the quotation i can bring positive evidence to the truth of it verbatim  thus much sir i thought it incumbent upon me to state in argument against the position that has been insisted upon that no orders can be worded so peremptorily at a distance as not to admit of an implied latitude in case of unforeseen and insurmountable difficulties but to prevent all future cavil upon this subject i request the committee to recollect what i have again and again repeated that i by no means put my defense in passing the hudsons river solely upon this reasoning on the contrary supposing for the arguments sake i should concede which i never have done nor mean to do to the noble lord and to every other gentleman all they can desire to assume upon implied latitude in given cases i should equally prove that no such case did exist as would have justified me upon their own principle in departing from the letter of the orders under which i acted  having thus cleared my way to the time of my leaving england to take upon me the command of the northern expedition i shall now lay before the committee a narrative of its progress in as concise and simple terms as the nature of the subject will allow endeavoring to imitate the perspicuity of the honorable gentleman who took the lead in this business and not without hope of my endeavors producing the same effect and that in the opinion of the house my language as has been expressed of his will be deemed the language of truth  narrative narrative it is my intention for the more ready comprehension of the whole subject to divide it into three periods the first from my appointment to the command to the end of my pursuit of the enemy from ticonderoga the second from that time to the passage of the hudsons river and the third to the signing the convention  i left london on the   th of march and upon my departure from plymouth finding the albion man of war ready to sail for new york i wrote to sir w how by that conveyance upon the subject of my expedition and the nature of my orders i arrived at quebec the  th of may sir guy carleton immediately put under my command the troops destined for the expedition and committed to my management the preparatory arrangements from thence i wrote a second letter to sir william how wherein i repeated that i was entrusted with the command of the army destined to march from canada and that my orders were to force a junction with his excellency  i expressed also my wishes that a latitude had been left me for a diversion toward connecticut but that such an idea being out of question by my orders being precise to force the junction it was only mentioned to introduce the idea still resting upon my mind viz to give the change to the enemy if i could and by every feint in my power to establish a suspicion that i still pointed toward connecticut  but i repeated that under the present precision of my orders i should really have no view but that of joining him nor think myself justified by any temptation to delay the most expeditious means i could find to effect that purpose  i proceeded to montreal on the   th and as my letters lately laid before the house from that place see appendix no v and from quebec will show the state of things i should not rest a moment upon this period were it not to add one more public testimony to those i am not conscious of having omitted upon any occasion of the assiduous and cordial manner in which the different services were forwarded by sir guy carleton i should think it as dishonorable to seek as i know it would be impossible to find excuse for any fault of mine in any failure on the part of sir guy carleton or of any persons who acted under him in any matter respecting the expedition had that officer been acting for himself or for his brother he could not have shown more indefatigable zeal than he did to comply with and expedite my requisitions and desires  certain parts of the expected force nevertheless fell short the canadian troops stated in the plan at  000 consisted only of three companies intended to be of  00 men each but in reality not amounting to more than   0 upon the whole nor could they be augmented the corvees which are detachments of provincials without arms to repair roads convey provisions or any other temporary employments for the kings service could not be obtained in sufficient number nor kept to their employments although sir guy carleton used every possible exertion and encouragement for the purpose drivers for the provision carts and other carriages could not be fully supplied by the contractor though no expense was spared a circumstance which occasioned much inconvenience afterward  to these unavoidable disappointments were added the difficulties occasioned by bad weather which rendered the roads almost impracticable at the carrying places and consequently the passage of the batteaux artillery and baggage exceedingly dilatory we had besides a great deal of contrary wind notwithstanding all impediments the army assembled between the   th and  0th of june at cumberland point upon lake champlain  on the   st i held a conference with the iroquois algonchins abenekies and outawas indians in all about four hundred  this conference appears in your papers see appendix no vi  i thought at the time that the cordiality of the indians over the whole continent might be depended upon and their first operations tended to persuade me into a belief of their utility the priest to whom they seemed devoted and the british officers employed to conduct them and to whose control they engaged to submit gained advantages and spread terror without barbarity the first party sent out made several of the enemy prisoners in the heat of action and treated them with european humanity  during the movement of the different corpse to this general rendezvous i wrote a third letter to sir william how the chief purport of it was to give him intelligence of my situation at the time and of my expectation of being before ticonderoga between the  0th and   th instant that i did not apprehend the effective strength of the army would amount to above   00 men that i meant to apply to sir guy carleton to send a garrison to ticonderoga when it should be reduced but that i was apprehensive he would not think himself authorized by the kings orders to comply that whenever therefore i might be able to effect the junction sir william would not expect me to bring near the original number i repeated my perseverance in the idea of giving jealousy on the side of connecticut and at the same time my assurances that i should make no maneuver that could procrastinate the great object of a junction  i state these different letters to sir william how merely to show that my conception of the precision of my orders was not upon afterthought and taken up as an excuse when i found the expedition had failed but a fixed decided sentiment coeval with my knowledge of my command  for a further proof of the same fact i beg leave to state an extract from my orders to the army at crown point june  0th the words were these  the army embarks tomorrow to approach the enemy the services required of this particular expedition are critical and conspicuous during our progress occasions may occur in which nor difficulty nor labor nor life are to be regarded this army must not retreat were it necessary i could bring abundant collateral proof to the same effect and show that the idea of forcing a way to albany by vigorous exertions against any opposition we might meet was general and fixed through the whole army  my proceedings from the time of assembling the army as before described to the date of my public dispatch from skenesborough comprehending the maneuvers which forced the enemy from ticondenoga and the actions at skenesborough huberton and fort anne are related at full in that dispatch see appendix no vii   it is the less necessary to give the committee further trouble upon this subject because i believe no enemy can be found to arraign my conduct in those days of success or if there were one he could not deprive me of the consolation that i had his majestys full approbation and applause of which it is known to many i had a very honorable and distinguished proof  all therefore that is necessary before i quit this first period of the campaign is to give a precise state of the effective strength of the army at the time it assembled  on the  st july the day we encamped before ticonderoga the troops consisted of british rank and file      german ditto  0      0 regulars exclusive of artillerymen canadians and provincials about   0 indians about  00   0  in regard to the artillery i think this the proper place to rectify the misrepresentations that have prevailed respecting the quantity employed it has been stated as far beyond the necessary proportion for the number of troops an encumbrance to their movements and one cause of what has been called the slow progress of the expedition  in order to justify this charge a view of the whole mass has been presented to the public without any explanation of its distinct allotments and many have been led to believe that the whole was attached to the army throughout the campaign and fell into the enemys hands at last  the intention of this representation is obvious the allegation is false  the facts as i shall prove them to the committee are as follow the whole original train furnished by sir guy carleton consisted of sixteen heavy twentyfour pounders ten heavy twelvepounders eight medium twelvepounders two light twentyfour pounders one light twelvepounder twentysix light six pounders seventeen light threepounders six eightinch howitzers six five and a half inch howitzers two thirteeninch mortars two teninch mortars six eightinch mortars twelve five and a halfinch mortars and twentyfour four and two fifthinch mortars of these two heavy twentyfour pounders were sent on board a ship for the defense of lake champlain and the other fourteen were sent back to st johns of the heavy twelvepounders six were left at ticonderoga four ditto in the royal george four medium twelvepounders at fort george one light twelvepounder at ticonderoga two light sixpounders at fort george four light sixpounders at st johns four light threepounders at ticonderoga five light threepounders at st johns two eightinch howitzers at fort george two ditto at st johns two five and a half inch howitzers at fort george two thirteeninch mortars in the royal george two teninch mortars in ditto four eightinch mortars in ditto four five and a half inch mortars at ticonderoga four royal mortars in the royal george twelve cohorns at ticonderoga and eight cohorns in the royal george  the fieldtrain therefore that proceeded with the army consisted of four medium twelvepounders two light twentyfour pounders eighteen light sixpounders six light threepounders two eightinch howitzers four five and a halfinch howitzers two eightinch mortars and four royals  the carrying the twentyfour pounders though they were but two has been spoken of as an error and it is necessary therefore to inform the committee that they were of a construction lighter by  00 weight than medium twelves and to all intents and purposes field artillery  this artillery was distributed as follows frasers corpse estimated at three battalions ten pieces viz four light sixpounders four light threepounders constructed for being occasionally carried on horseback two royal howitzers german reserve under colonel breyman estimated at two battalions two light sixpounders two light threepounders and served by the hesse hanau artillery men the line of british four battalions germans five battalions total nine battalions   three brigades of artillery of four sixpounders each viz one brigade for each wing and one for the center  from hence it appears that to fourteen battalions there were allotted twentysix pieces of light artillery the customary allotment is two pieces per battalion consequently the proportion of artillery was less than upon common services  the forming artillery into brigades in preference to detaching two guns to each battalion has been constantly practiced in most services during last war under the ablest men and it is productive of many advantages as the brigades by that means either singly or united fall under the command of a proportionable number of officers the service is carried on with greater regularity and the effect of the fire becomes much more formidable than when scattered along the front of the line  this mode of service was recommended by major general phillips and adopted without hesitation by me my own judgment being confirmed by an officer of his great skill and experience  the park artillery consisted of ten pieces viz   light twentyfour pounders   medium twelvepounders   eightinch howitzers   royal howitzers   i understood this proportion of field artillery to be the same as that proposed by sir guy carleton had he commanded it was the proportion recommended by general phillips and i formed my opinion conformably to the sentiments of those respectable officers upon the following reasons viz that artillery was extremely formidable to raw troops that in a country of posts it was essentially necessary against the best troops that it was yet more applicable to the enemy we were to combat because the mode of defense they invariably adopted and at which they were beyond all other nations expert was that of entrenchment covered with strong abbatis against which the cannon of the nature of the heaviest above described and howitzers might often be effectual when to dislodge them by any other means might be attended with continued and important losses  in these general ideas of the use of artillery against the rebel forces i have the happiness to observe from the papers before you the concurrence of sir william how who states similar ideas very fully in one of his requisitions to the secretary of state but further reasons for not diminishing the proportion of guns of superior calibre to sixpounders in this train were first their use against blockhouses a species of fortification peculiar to america secondly a probability that gunboats might be requisite for the security of the water transport on some parts of the hudsons river but principally the intention of fortifying a camp at albany in case i should reach that place should meet with a sufficiency of provision there as i was led to expect and should find it expedient to pass the winter there without communication with new york  with respect to the quantity of ammunition attached to this artillery it is to be observed that the number of rounds accompanying the light pieces and which were carried in small carts were not more than sufficient for a days action light sixpounders     rounds each light threepounders  00 rounds royal howitzers  0 rounds  the different reserves of ammunition were chiefly conveyed by water in scows and batteaux it certainly would not have been advisable after a communication with canada was at an end to depend upon precarious supplies from the southward and therefore it became necessary as far as the service would allow to carry forward such stores as there was every appearance of an absolute want of during the course of an active campaign  had the enemy established themselves in force upon the islands at the mouth of the mohawk river or on other ground equally advantageous to have disputed the passage of that or of the hudsons river or had they even waited an assault in their works at stillwater it is probable that recourse must have been had to artillery of the heavier nature in the latter case especially they must have been used in order to derive any advantage from our seizing a post upon their left flank i have since known that they had iron twelve and ninepounders mounted upon those works which were in other respects very formidable the british artillerymen rank and file were     recruits under command of lieutenant nutt of the   d regiment attached to the service of the artillery   0 hessian artillerymen rank and file         add these numbers to the former state of the army and it will be found that the regular strength when at the greatest consisted of       i come now to the second period of the campaign comprehending the transactions from the time the pursuit of the enemy from ticonderoga ceased and the corpse of brigadiergeneral fraser and the  th regiment rejoined the army after the respective actions of huberton and fort anne to the time when the army passed the hudsons river to attack the enemy near stillwater  it had proved impossible immediately to follow the quick retreat of the enemy farther from the nature of the country and the necessity of waiting a fresh supply of provisions but it appeared evident to me that could a rapid progress toward albany be effected during their dispersion and panic it would be decisive on the success of the expedition  question has been made by those who began at this period to arraign my military conduct whether it would not have been more expedient for the purpose of rapidity to have fallen back to ticonderoga in order to take the convenient route by lake george than to have persevered in the laborious and difficult course by land to fort edward my motives for preferring the latter were these i considered not only the general impressions which a retrograde motion is apt to make upon the minds both of enemies and friends but also that the natural conduct of the enemy in that case would be to remain at fort george as their retreat could not then be cut off in order to oblige me to open trenches and consequently to delay me and in the mean time they would have destroyed the road from fort george to fort edward on the other hand by persisting to penetrate by the short cut from fort anne of which i was then master to fort edward though it was attended with great labor and many alert situations the troops were improved in the very essential point of wood service i effectually dislodged the enemy from fort george without a blow and seeing me master of one communication they did not think it worth while to destroy the other  the great number of boats also which must necessarily have been employed for the transport of the troops over lake george were by this course spared for the transport of the provision artillery and ammunition  the success answered this reasoning in every point for by the vigilance of geneneral phillips to whom i had committed the important part of forwarding all the necessaries from ticonderoga a great embarkation arrived at fort george on july   th i took possession of the country near fort edward on the same day and independently of other advantages i found myself much more forward in point of time than i could possibly have been by the other route  another material motive which could not be known by strangers who have reasoned upon this movement was that during the time that my army was employed in clearing woodcreek and cutting roads and the corpse under major general phillips working to pass the transports over lake george i was enabled to detach a large corpse to my left under major general reidesel and thereby assist my purpose of giving jealousy to connecticut and keeping in check the whole country called the hampshire grants  it was at this time major general reidesel conceived the purpose of mounting his regiment of dragoons in the country he traversed during his detached command he found the people frightened and submissive he was industrious and expert in procuring intelligence in parts of the country more remote than bennington and entertained no doubt of success were an expedition formed under the command of lieutenant colonel baum  on the arrival of the army at fort edward the great object of attention was the transports from fort george the distance was about sixteen miles the roads wanting great repair the weather unfavourable the cattle and carriages scarce part of the latter inconvenience was occasioned by the number of both that were necessarily detained at ticonderoga for the purpose of dragging the boats and the provisions over the carrying places between lake champlain and lake george another part of the inconvenience was caused by the unavoidable delays in bringing the different divisions of horses as they were collected in canada through the desert for such most of the country is between st johns and ticonderoga  it was soon found that in the situation of the transport service at that time the army could barely be victualled from day to day and that there was no prospect of establishing a magazine in due time for pursuing present advantages the idea of the expedition to bennington originated upon this difficulty combined with the intelligence reported by general reidesel and with all i had otherwise received  i knew that bennington was the great deposit of corn flour and store cattle that it was guarded only by militia and every days account tended to confirm the persuasion of the loyalty of one description of the inhabitants and the panic of the other those who knew the country best were the most sanguine in this persuasion  had my intelligence been worse founded i should not have hesitated to try this expedition with such troops and under such instructions as i gave to the commanding officer for so great a purpose as that of a supply sufficient to enable the army to follow at the heels of a broken and disconcerted enemy the german troops employed were of the best i had of that nation the number of british was small but it was the select light corpse of the army composed of chosen men from all the regiments and commanded by captain fraser one of the most distinguished officers in his line of service that ever i met with the instructions recommended the utmost caution respecting posts and security of retreat attention against exposing the solid part of the detachment to affront or committing it in any instance without a moral certainty of success i touch with tenderness and with great reluctance points that relate to the dead my defense compels me to say my cautions were not observed nor the reinforcement advanced with the alacrity i had a right to expect the men who commanded in both instances were brave and experienced officers i have ever imputed their failure partly to delusion in respect to the enemy and partly to surprise and consequent confusion in the troops  for further explanation of my motives and the circumstances attending the conduct of the expedition i beg leave to refer the committee to the letter laid before the house last year and more particularly to the private letter laid before the house lately see appendix no viii   the same letter will show the only resource that remained for proceeding toward albany after the disappointment of this expedition viz to press forward a necessary supply of provision and other indispensible articles from fort george i shall bring proof to your bar to this point and i trust i shall show beyond a doubt that no possible exertion was omitted it is not uncommon for gentlemen unacquainted with the peculiarities of the country to which i am alluding to calculate the transport of magazines by measuring the distance upon a map and then applying the resources of carriage as practiced in other countries i request permission to show their mistake the first stage from fort george to fort edward is by land the distance and the roads were described before at fort edward the hudsons river becomes navigable for a certain extent and it is the constant practice in all transports to resume the water carriage were it not new impediments would arise from hills worse roads and such an increased distance as would prevent the cattle returning to fort george the same day about six miles below fort edward lie the falls of fort miller where there is another carryingplace which though of no considerable length makes it necessary to unload the boats to place the contents in carts and to replace them in fresh boats at the place the river again admits of navigation the boats unloaded return to fort edward against a rapid stream  upon this short state of facts gentlemen will judge of our embarrassments in the first place it was necessary to bring forward to fort edward fourscore or a hundred boats as mere carriagevessels for the provisions each boat made a hard days work for six or more horses including the return of the horses at the next carryingplace as above described it was necessary to place a considerable relay of horses to draw over first a portion of carriage boats and afterward the provision as it arrived i have not mentioned the great number of other boats necessary to be brought forward to form bridges to carry baggage and ammunition and the number of carriages framed to transport the boats themselves at the ensuing carryingplaces as we should proceed to albany this will be shown in detail at the bar if the committee choose to hear it and i pledge myself it will appear that the diligence in this service was extreme that it was performed in the most expeditious manner possible regard being had to our resources and that no delay was occasioned by the artillery because the horses appropriated to it were supernumerary to those for which we had carts and the artillery not already with the army at last was all brought up by its own horses in two days  on the   th of september the store of provision amounting to about thirty days consumption was completed i have stated in my letter to the secretary of state my reasons against proceeding with less quantity and it is now time to enter upon the consideration of that object which is held by some to be conclusive upon the executive part of the campaign the passage of the hudsons river  two errors respecting this passage though of opposite and incompatible natures are supposed to have contributed to the ill success that ensued the one the error of delay the other that of precipitation in defense against the first i refer to my effort at bennington to procure supplies and to the impediments i have just now stated after that effort failed against the latter i refer to the reasons laid down in my private letter to the secretary of state dated  0th of august see appendix no ix the state of things at this important crisis and my reasoning upon it are expressed still more at large in my dispatch from albany i will now only touch them shortly on the one hand my communications were at an end my retreat was insecure the enemy was collected in force they were strongly posted colonel st ledger was retiring from fort stanwix these were difficulties but none of them insurmountable on the other hand i had dislodged the enemy repeatedly when before in force and more strongly posted my army was conscious of having the superiority and eager to advance i expected cooperation no letters from sir william how removed that expectation that to sir guy carleton had never weighed upon my mind because it was dated early in april and consequently long before the secretary of states instructions which i must have supposed to relate to cooperation could be received the letter of   th july no x mentioned that generals return to my assistance should washington turn his force toward me indicated as i thought an expectation of my arrival at albany and informed me that sir henry clinton was left at new york and would act as occurrences might direct i did not know sir henry clintons force i did know that considerable reinforcement might be then expected at new york from england after all should cooperation from below fail the whole force of colonel st ledger and sir william johnson was to be expected from above in time to facilitate a retreat though not in time to assist my advance under these different suggestions and those that are more copiously stated in the dispatch to which i have referred i read again my orders i believe for an hundredth time and i was decided  and i am still convinced that no proof that could have been brought from appearances intelligence or reasoning could have justified me to my country have saved me from the condemnation of my profession or produced pardon within my own breast had i not advanced and tried a battle with the enemy  i will conclude this subject with again asserting upon my honor what i hope to support by evidence though it is impossible to bring positive proof to a negative that neither general fraser nor general phillips ever offered as has been reported nor can be supposed to have conceived any objection against the passage of the hudsons river  this resolution being taken i trust the manner of approaching the enemy when explained by witnesses will not be disgraceful to me as a soldier the action which ensued on the   th of september verified my opinion of the valor of my army and i must in truth acknowledge a very respectable share of that quality in the army of the enemy to the general description given in my dispatch it will be fit to add by evidence the peculiar merits of the troops in that action the honor of three british regiments in continual and close fire for four hours all of them suffering considerable loss and one remaining with less than sixty men and four or five officers ought not to lose its due applause because it is said their opponents were irregulars and militia  a victory was at last obtained but the close of day unavoidably prevented any immediate advantages on the day following it was known from prisoners and deserters that the enemy were in a post strongly fortified but from the thickness of the wood it was impossible to catch a view of any part of their position all that could be done therefore was to take up ground as near them as the nature of the country would admit with regard to military arrangement it appears from the dispatch already alluded to that the army remained in this position till the  th of october when the second action ensued employed in fortifying their camp and watching the enemy whose numbers it was now known had been greatly superior to ours in the action  it may here be asked why as soon as it became palpable that no use could be made of the victory i did not retreat  it will be shown that on the second day after the action i received intelligence from sir henry clinton of his intention to attack the highlands about that time and i was hourly in expectation i thought a justly founded one of that measure operating to dislodge mr gates entirely or to oblige him to detach a large portion of his force either of these cases would probably have opened my way to albany in these circumstances could the preference upon these alternatives admit of a moments reflection to wait so fair a prospect of effecting at last the great purpose of the campaign or to put a victorious army under all the disadvantages of a beaten one by a difficult and disgraceful retreat relinquishing the long expected cooperation in the very hour of its promise and leaving sir henry clintons army and probably sir william howes exposed with so much of the season of the campaign to run to the whole force of mr gates after he should have seen me on the other side of hudsons river  some of the same considerations and other concomitant circumstances will in part serve to account for my not attacking the enemy during this interval for in this situation as in former ones my conduct has been arraigned upon opposite principles  the committee will observe that after receiving intelligence of sir henry clintons design different messengers were dispatched by different routes to inform that officer of my situation and of the time i thought i could continue in it to have hazarded a repulse under so reasonable an expectation of a powerful diversion would in my opinion have been very unjustifiable but when i add that from the backwardness or defection of the few indians that remained the numbers of riflemen and other irregulars employed on the enemys outposts and the strength and darkness of the surrounding woods it had not yet been practicable to gain any competent knowledge of their position i trust every man will go with me in the sentiment that all these circumstances considered an attack would have been consummate rashness  another very powerful reason that operated on the side of delay was the state of my sick and wounded numbers of the latter were recovering fast many excellent officers in particular and the more i delayed the stronger i grew the time also entitled me to expect lieutenant colonel st legers corpse would be arrived at ticonderoga and secret means had been long concerted to enable him to make an effort to join me with probability of success  upon mature consideration of these and other circumstances attending this period come to my knowledge since i am clearly of opinion that had the reinforcements from england arrived in time to have enabled sir henry clinton to have effected the stroke he afterward so gallantly made in the highlands any time between the two actions i should have made my way  the dispatch alluded to proceeds to state the reason that induced me to make the movement on the  th october i shall only add to obviate a supposed error in not advancing my whole line that the part remaining in my camp operated as effectually to keep the enemys right wing in check from supporting their left as if it had moved with this additional advantage that it prevented the danger of their advancing by the plain near the river and falling upon my rear  i have reason to believe my disappointment on that day proceeded from an uncommon circumstance in the conduct of the enemy mr gates as i have been informed had determined to receive the attack in his lines mr arnold who commanded on the left forseeing the danger of being turned advanced without consultation with his general and gave instead of receiving battle the stroke might have been fatal on his part had he failed but confident i am upon minute examination of the ground since that had the other idea been pursued i should in a few hours have gained a position that in spite of the enemys numbers would have put them in my power  disagreeable as is the necessity i must here again in justice to my own army recur to the vigor and obstinacy with which they were fought by the enemy a more determined perseverance than they showed in the attack upon the lines though they were finally repulsed by the corpse under lord balcarras i believe is not in any officers experience it will be the business of evidence to prove that in the part where colonel breyman was killed and the enemy penetrated the mischief could not be repaired nor under it the camp be longer tenable  the transactions of the ensuing night the day of the eighth and the whole progress of the retreat to saratoga will be laid before the committee minutely in the course of my evidence as well as every circumstance from the time the army arrived there to the signing the convention i have only to premise that i trust i shall be able to prove to the satisfaction of the committee that even in this situation i had the chance of a favorable event the enemy had intended to attack by the plain of saratoga on the morning of the   th a considerable column had actually passed the fish kill for that purpose during the fog which at that season was regular till sometime after sun rise the intention was prevented taking place by intelligence one of their generals received from a deserter that i had a line formed behind the brushwood to support the post of artillery which was their immediate object of attack the general instantly retreated his column and prevented a general action which my position compared with the proposed one of the enemy gave me reason to hope would have been to my advantage  i have likewise a satisfactory confidence that i shall demonstrate that the intelligence i stated to the councils of war respecting the strength of the enemy did not fall short in any part and in some parts much exceeded my own belief particularly on the only possible routes of my retreat and that those posts were not taken up during my stay at saratoga as has been reported but some of them previous to the action of the  th and the rest immediately after it  i shall close the whole of this by delivering at your table from the hands of my secretary an authenticated return of the force of general gates signed by himself and the truth of it will be supported from ocular testimony by every officer of the british army many of them are now in england and after what has been insinuated not to say charged in this house it becomes the duty of the accusers not only to examine closely the officers i have called but to produce any other witnesses that in their thoughts may be qualified to speak to the good or bad order of the rebel troops when they marched by in their presence and to their behavior when opposed to our troops in action  i cannot close this long trespass upon the patience of the committee without expressing one humble hope that in forming a judgment upon the whole or any distinct part of these transactions they will be considered as they must have appeared at the time for i believe where war is concerned few men in command would stand acquitted if any afterknowledge of facts and circumstances were brought in argument against decisions of the moment and apparent exigencies of the occasion  i submit all i have said some of it i fear not sufficiently prepared or arranged with true respect to the committee i shall not mention all the disadvantages under which i have pressed this business upon their attention i have cause to regret the absence of a most confidential friend in major general phillips zealous advocates i trust in major general reidesel and brigadier hamilton much of my vindication is in the grave with general fraser much with colonel ackland your late member i trust my zeal in promoting this enquiry as i have done will be one mark of the sense i bear of the general character of this house that however men may be biassed by political attachments upon common occasions when the honor of an individual is committed to their hands they will alone be guided by truth and justice and the next inference i should wish to be drawn from my earnestness for a public appeal is this that however others may impute errors to my conduct i am myself conscious of the rectitude of my intentions  evidence jovis  0o die maij      committee to consider of the several papers which were presented to the house by mr de gray upon the   th day of march last pursuant to their address to his majesty mr f montagu in the chair  sir guy carleton was called in and examined by general burgoyne as follows   q do you recollect having received a letter from the secretary of state mentioning the reasons that made it expedient for you to remain in the province of quebec  a yes very well    q what was the date of it  a i think the   th of august       i am sure it was in august    q was not the date of that letter long before the return of general burgoyne from canada to great britain  a yes    q during the winter preceding the campaign of      was not the artillery prepared at montreal for field service upon the supposition that you was to command the army beyond the frontiers of the province  a it was    q was the proportion allotted to general burgoyne for field service more than was intended had you so commanded  a i dont precisely recollect that  it does not strike me there was any great difference    q was the quantity of artillery decided on in concert with major general phillips and on his recommendation  a the artillery i had prepared for the campaign on a supposition i was to go myself was in concert with general phillips that department as well as others was put under the command of general burgoyne on his arrival and i suppose he followed the same method so far as regarded the artillery    q did general burgoyne apply to you for troops from canada to garrison ticonderoga when he advanced  a he did    q what was the purport of your answer  a that i did not think myself justified to grant it by my orders  my answer will appear more precisely by a copy of my answer to general burgoyne    q do you recollect that general burgoyne informed you of the motives on which he proceeded from skenesborough to fort edward by land in preference to the route by ticonderoga and lake george  a i do   0 q did you concur in his sentiments  a i remember my answer was an answer of approbation     q do you know of any circumstance of general burgoynes military conduct while under your command that you disapproved  a i had no reason to disapprove of any part of his conduct while under my command  withdrew  again called in and examined by other members of the committee    q whether when you proposed to take that train of artillery with you that you have mentioned it was with a view to the reduction of the forts at ticonderoga or whether you proposed to have taken with you the same train of artillery in case you had marched forward in the country toward albany  a it was with an intention to reduce the forts and lines at ticonderoga the train of artillery was calculated for that service     by genesis burgoyne q whether you know what proportion of artillery was carried forward by the army under general burgoynes command after the reduction of ticonderoga  a i dont recollect     q would you not in case you had reduced ticonderoga and marched forwards toward albany have carried with you a train of field artillery  a i probably should have taken artillery with me     q had you foreseen a necessity of fortifying a camp at albany would you not have carried some guns of the calibre of twelve pounders and light twentyfours  a it is really a very difficult matter off hand to run into all the minute operations of a campaign every measure of that sort must have been a matter of consideration and deliberation and there are a thousand circumstances that might have determined me upon the spot  i dont wish to conceal from this house any thing that i would have done  but i hope they will consider that every gentleman may have different ideas of the state and situation of the army as expressed by the question asked and the least inaccuracy of expression on my part may convey ideas very different from what i could wish  in general so considerable a corpse as that was very seldom moves without artillery but the precise number must depend on a variety of circumstances which the discretion and judgment of the officer who commands must determine     q were not the orders you received from government positive for general burgoyne to march to albany  a the orders have been published i understand  every gentleman in this house must be a judge of those orders whether they were positive or not     q did you not receive a letter dated the  th of april from sir william how informing you that he could not send any force to assist the operations of general burgoynes army  a i received a letter from sir william how relative to his operations a copy of which was sent to general burgoyne  i think it was not just in those terms but a copy of the letter is on the table     q whether on that information you considered that you had any discretionary power to detain general burgoyne after that information  a certainly not     q whether in case of any difficulty that general burgoyne might meet with on his march there was any latitude given to him general burgoyne to retreat  a i said before that the orders were before the house who are competent to judge on that point   0 q did you yourself understand those orders to general burgoyne to be positive  a that is giving an opinion upon what perhaps may be a question in the house whereas i have already said the house are as competent to judge as i am     q is the committee to understand from that answer that you have any objection of giving your opinion on that question  a i have an objection to give an opinion on almost all points     q did you give it in orders to general burgoyne in case he met with any difficulties during his march in canada under your command not to proceed  a i should have taken care that general burgoyne met with no difficulties in his march in canada nor do i well see how he could     q where do the boundaries of the province of canada end  a between the illinois and point an fer     q is the fortress of ticonderoga in canada  a no     q did your commission as commander in chief of the troops in the northern division extend beyond the boundaries of canada to ticonderoga  a that commission as commander in chief i understood did extend so far but by the orders already alluded to or by those which general burgoyne brought out in the spring      i understood that my command was restrained to the limits of the province and that general burgoyne was entirely from under my command as soon as he passed the limits of the province     q did you apply to the secretary of state for a reinforcement of  000 men as necessary for the campaign of       a i recollect when general burgoyne was coming home in the fall of      as i was perfectly satisfied with his conduct in the preceding campaign i talked over with him in confidence what i thought necessary for the following campaign among other things i desired him to make a memorandum to demand  000 men as a reinforcement for the ensuing campaign or at least for four battalions i think i have seen those memorandums were accurately stated and laid before the house     q what part of that  000 men which you thought necessary for the campaign of      was actually sent out to canada in that year  a i do not accurately remember how many  i think a very small part  you may have a very precise account from the returns     q of that small part sent in      did not a certain proportion arrive very late in the year  a yes a part arrived late     q after you had received your orders from the secretary of state did you apprehend that general burgoyne as long as he was within the province of canada was positively under your command  a yes i did as long as he was in the province of canada i looked on him to be positively under my command but the load of the expedition being on his shoulders i thought it proper that he in all things should direct and therefore i gave out immediate orders that not only the troops he was to command out of the province but all the departments necessary for the assisting his expedition should comply immediately and without delay with every requisition and order he should give the reason of my doing so was that no time might be lost i only required that they should report to me what orders they had received from general burgoyne i believe those orders are also on the table   0 q will you explain to the committee what you mean by the words load of the expedition lying on general burgoynes shoulders  a i had no particular meaning they are words i should have used on any expedition of importance     q if general burgoyne had met with very considerable difficulties to impede his progress within the province of canada would you have thought yourself justifiable in giving any orders to general burgoyne different from those transmitted to general burgoyne through you from the secretary of state  a had there been any difficulties in canada i would not have given him up the command     q having given up the command to general burgoyne and having ordered all the troops to obey him only reporting their proceedings to you would you after that have thought yourself justifiable to change the order to general burgoyne upon his meeting with great difficulties on the frontiers of the neighboring provinces  a i really did not mean to evade the question in the least it did not appear to me possible that there could be any difficulties i dont mean to say there could not from the nature of the country be difficulties in the march that might occasion delay but by the nature of the question i understood difficulties from the enemy in that case i should not have thought myself justifiable in giving up the command     q if you had heard that on the frontiers and within the province of canada there was the greatest reason to think that the resistance of general burgoynes army was so great as to make it in your opinion exceedingly difficult for that general to force his way to albany would you think yourself justifiable in giving different orders to general burgoyne from those given by the secretary of state or would you have thought the secretary of states orders for general burgoynes army so peremptory that it would not be proper for you to interfere  a if i understood the question as it now stands it is what i would have done had the province been invaded or close on the point of being invaded and the enemy entering the province     q the question does not mean an invading army but a resistance from the enemy to the progress of general burgoynes army in the case stated in the last question  a in that case that an enemy should be found within the limits of my command i should have ordered all the troops destined for the defense of the province to have immediately joined those destined for general burgoyne and have reassumed the command of all until those obstructions had been removed within the limits of my authority     q suppose no enemy within the province of canada but posted in such a manner upon the line of communication with albany as to make it exceeding difficult for general burgoyne to obey the orders given to him would you think yourself justifiable in giving different orders to general burgoyne from those given by the secretary of state or would you have thought the secretary of states orders for general burgoynes army so peremptory that it would not be proper for you to interfere  a i could not change general burgoynes orders one tittle that was my opinion he received his orders from the same power that gave me my authority when once he passed the limits of my command i neither could give him orders nor would he be justified in obeying them     q do you mean the latter part of that answer as an answer to a question which supposes general burgoyne within the limits of the province of canada  a no while he was within the limits of the province of canada i would have given general burgoyne orders in all cases of difficulty and danger there being no such case when general burgoyne arrived in canada in      nor a possibility of an event of that sort i put the troops and all things under his command which concerned his expedition that he might arrange and combine their motions according to his own plan of operation for the campaign that no time might be lost by any unnecessary applications to me which the strict forms of my command might otherwise require  withdrew  again called in    q should you if you had been in general burgoynes situation and acting under the orders which you know he received have thought yourself bound to pursue them implicitly or at liberty to deviate from them  a i should certainly have thought myself bound to have obeyed them to the utmost of my power but to say as a military man that in all cases possible i must have gone on is a very nice thing to say indeed it must have thrown me and i suppose every officer into a most unpleasant and anxious situation to have debated within himself whether he was or was not to go on every man must decide for himself what i would have done i really dont know the particular situation and a mans own particular feelings must determine the point if i might be indulged i would beg leave to say that i did not mean to evade any question i meant to answer directly yet questions may be put to me of so delicate a nature and perhaps no man in the world is in a more delicate situation with respect to the present case in question and the business of this committee than i am when such questions are put to me i shall pray the indulgence of the committee to be excused answering them but i will not evade them as i now understand the meaning of the right honorable member in the former questions to be whether i should have taken upon me to supersede the kings orders supposing i knew of any unsurmountable difficulties in the way as that i had information of  0000 men at ticonderoga before general burgoyne left the province of canada i should have told general burgoyne my information but it was general burgoyne who was to carry the orders into execution and not me and therefore it was upon his own judgment he was to determine i should have given him my opinion but i think i had no right to give him orders under those circumstances     q who was it that made the arrangement and distribution of the troops that were to be left for the defense of canada independent of those under the command of general burgoyne  a the orders that are before the house are very full and i thought very clear the committee will see in those orders the troops that were destined for general burgoynes expedition and the troops that were to remain for the defense of the province     q who made that distribution  a it came to me from the secretary of state   0 q did not the orders from the secretary of state go to the detail of the smallest posts within the province  a the letter is before the committee     question repeated  a i should beg for the letter to be read i dont wish to avoid any question but i wish to be accurate     q was the distribution of the troops prescribed to you by the secretary of state or left to your discretion  a in mentioning the number of troops which were to remain in that province it was there said that those troops would be sufficient for garrisoning such and such places particularizing them     q did you ever know an instance in your military life of a minister making a distribution of troops for the defense of a province without taking the opinion or leaving a great deal to the discretion of the governor of that province that governor being an acting military officer of very high rank  a i never had the honor to correspond with a secretary of state till i was appointed to the command of that province     q whether you was consulted upon the practicability of penetrating from the frontiers of canada to albany by force with the strength allotted to general burgoyne for that purpose  a no i was not     q are you acquainted with the passage from new york to canada by the hudsons river  a i have gone that way     q have you observed it with a view to military operations  a no i never made the tour having any military operations in view     q are you acquainted with the forces which sir william how had under his immediate command at and about new york on the   th of july       a i am not     q supposing sir william how had   000 effective men besides a sufficient force lodged in new york staten island and long island to defend them against general washingtons army supposing general washingtons army in the jersies near quibble town and that sir william how had received accounts of general burgoynes success at ticonderoga and was acquainted with the orders under which general burgoyne acted is it your opinion that the best movement sir william how could have made for the purposes of forwarding the execution of the orders under which general burgoyne acted would have been to have sailed with his army from new york to chesapeak bay  a had i had the honor to have commanded on that side i do not know what i should have done myself     q after you received the letter from sir william how informing you of his intended expedition to the southward whether you did expect that sir william howes army could cooperate on the hudsons river with the northern army that season  a i dont know   0 q whether you thought after the receipt of that letter that it was probable there would be a cooperation from the southern army  a i took it for granted that sir william how knew what he was about and would do what he thought best for the public service i really was so little informed of all the particular circumstances of his situation and of the provinces under his command that i could form no judgment of the propriety or impropriety of his conduct or of the effects of his measures     q did your information lead you to believe that the inhabitants between saratoga and albany were so well affected to his majesty and great britain as that there would be much advantage derived from their assistance to the kings army in the prosecution of general burgoynes expedition  a i had frequent accounts from that part of the country that there were numbers ready to take arms and join the kings troops if they should penetrate so far     q do you mean by penetrating so far to albany or to the length the army got  a the whole extent of the inhabited country according to the information brought to me     q had you no information that a formidable militia might be raised in that country to oppose his majestys arms  a yes i had such information     q did you think that the force which general burgoyne carried with him from ticonderoga toward albany was sufficient to oppose such force  a i really must beg leave to be excused answering that question     q if you had been consulted respecting general burgoynes expedition knowing the nature of that country and the force general burgoyne had would you or not have advised such an enterprise  a if i had had the honor to command in that campaign as i had in the former i dont precisely know what i should have done myself     q did you give any advice for employing the savages  a i dont recollect that i said any thing about them  withdrew  jovis   o die maii      earl of balcarras called in and examined by general burgoyne   q in what station did your lordship serve in the campaigns in america in      and       a i commanded the british light infantry    q was the british light infantry continually attached to the corpse under the command of brigadier general fraser  a yes    q had you occasion to observe that general burgoyne and general fraser lived together in friendship and confidence  a yes i had    q had you reason to believe that general fraser was consulted by genaral burgoyne in all material operations  a i had reason to believe that general fraser was consulted in many material operations    q does your lordship know or believe that the proportion of artillery attached to general frasers corpse through the whole campaign was according to his requisitions and desires  a i understood from general fraser that the proportion of artillery allotted to him was agreeable to his own requisitions    q do you recollect the number of killed and wounded in general frasers corpse at the affair of huberton  a i dont recollect exactly i think it was about   0    q what was your opinion of the behavior of the enemy on that day  a circumstanced as the enemy was as an army very hard pressed in their retreat they certainly behaved with great gallantry    q was it practicable the nature of the country the fatigue of the kings troops the care of the wounded and other circumstances considered to have pursued the enemy farther after that action  a it was not    q do you recollect on what day general frasers corpse rejoined the army at skenesborough  a on the  th of july i think that it was on that day   0 q on what day was the action at huberton  a on the  th of july     q do you recollect the difficulties of removing the wounded from huberton to the hospital at ticonderoga  a from the distance and badness of the roads the difficulties attending the removing of the hospital must have been very great     q was it practicable unless the wounded had been left exposed to the enemy to have rejoined the army sooner  a it was not     q does your lordship recollect how the army was employed between that time and the march to fort edward  a the british were employed in opening the country and making roads to fort anne the germans under general reidesel were detached about fourteen miles to the left     q do you recollect the post the enemy abandoned upon the ascent from the low country to the pitch pine plains in the march from fort anne to fort edward  a i do recollect such a place     q had the enemy maintained their ground on that post do you apprehend that a considerable portion of artillery would have been necessary to dislodge them  a artillery would certainly have been of great use to dislodge the enemy     q did you ever see an instance during your service in america that the rebels continued twentyfour hours on the same place without entrenching and was it not also their general practice to add abbaties to their entrenchments  a the rebels were always indefatigable in securing themselves by entrenchments and in general they added an abbatis to those entrenchments     q do you remember the position the enemy abandoned at schuylers island  a i do remember to have passed such an post once     q does you lordship think that position could have been forced without a numerous artillery or heavy loss  a i do not think it could     q from the nature of that country do you think that post could have been turned  a not without greatly risquing the boats and portable magazines   0 q is it possible at any time in that country and with a small army to quit the navigable rivers without leaving the boats and portable magazines exposed  a i imagine it is not     q did you live in habits of intimacy and communication with general fraser  a i did     q was general fraser of a warmth and openness of temper that generally made him communicative of his sentiments when they differed from the sentiments of those with whom he acted  a general frasers temper was warm open and communicative but reserved in matters of confidence     q did you ever hear general fraser express disapprobation of the measure of passing hudsons river  a i never did     q was not a bridge constructed of rafts and some boats thrown over that river a little before the time of the attack on bennington  a there was     q did not general frasers corpse pass the river by that bridge and take post on the heights of saratoga  a it did     q do you remember that bridge being carried away by the torrents and bad weather whereby the communication was cut off between that corpse and the main body of the army  a i do     q was general frasers corpse recalled after that action and obliged to repass the river in boats and scowls  a it was     q do you remember general fraser expressing his sorrow for being obliged to return back over the hudsons river  a i remember general fraser mentioning it with regret     q had the rear guard of general frasers corpse been attacked during that passage over the river would not a powerful fire of artillery from the opposite shore have been of great use if not the only means of protecting them  a if the enemy had attacked general fraser they would have found him in a very bad posture it was impossible to take a better and as they could not be supported by the line the only means of safety must have been to get under cover of the fire of our artillery   0 q was there not an expectation and impatience of the troops in general to pass hudsons river and advance on the enemy  a there was     q was there not a general confidence and alacrity on the occasion  a there was     q from these circumstances and your other knowledge of the army do you not believe that to have made no further attempt on the enemy would have caused disappointment and dejection in the troops and reflections on the general  a the troops were in the highest spirits and wished to be led on     q does your lordship recollect the march up to the enemy on the morning of the   th of september  a i do     q was the combination of the march such as that notwithstanding the passage of the ravines and the thickness of the woods the column of general frasers march and that of the british line led by general burgoyne were in a situation to support each other and speedily to form in line of battle at the time the enemy began the attack  a after the columns had passed the ravines they arrived at their respective posts with great precision in point of time and every fortunate circumstance attended the forming of the line     q how long did that action last  a the british were attacked partially about one oclock the action was general at three and ended at seven oclock     q from the nature of the country was it possible to discern the enemys position or movements to form any judgment what attacks were in force and what were feints  a i think not     q did we remain masters of the field of battle  a we did     q had the field of battle been well disputed by the enemy  a the enemy behaved with great obstinacy and courage     q was it too dark to pursue with effect at the time the action ended  a it was   0 q did the kings troops take up ground nearer to the enemy the morning after the action  a it was rather nearer to the enemy     q how near were the outposts of general frasers corpse to the outposts of the enemy from that time to the action of the  th of october  a i should imagine within half a mile     q from the nature of the country and the situation of the enemys outposts was it possible to reconnoitre their position  a from the nature of the country the difficulties attending reconnoitering must have been very great     q were not the riflemen and other irregulars employed by the enemy at outposts and on scouts an overmatch for the indian or provincial troops that were with the army at that time  a they were     q was not general frasers corpse continually at work during the interval abovementioned in securing their own posts and opening the front to oppose the enemy  a they were     q after general fraser received his wound on the  th of october on whom did the command of his corpse devolve  a on me     q was you in a situation on that day to observe the general disposition of the army made by general burgoyne previous to the action  a i remember two redoubts having been erected on the left to cover the boats and provisions to enable general burgoyne to make a detachment from his army     q was you in a situation to observe the disposition made immediately before the attack by the enemy  a i only recollect the situation of the two battalions of the advanced corpse     q after the retreat to the lines were the lines attacked and with what degree of vigor  a the lines were attacked and with as much fury as the fire of small arms can admit     q does your lordship remember that part of the lines where you commanded being visited by general burgoyne during the attack  a i dont recollect to have seen general burgoyne   0 q was the cannon of great use in the repulse of the enemy in your post  a of very great use     q do you think that post would have been tenable next morning the enemy having possession of colonel briemens post  a i do not think it would     q would the possession of the post by the enemy together with the possession of colonel briemens posts have laid open the flank and rear of the camp of the line  a it would     q was the retreat in the night and the new disposition of the whole army made in good order and without loss  a it was     q did the army remain under arms and in momentary expectation of battle the whole of the day of the  th  a it did     q do you remember the confusion and difficulties attending the line of baggage in the retreat in the night of the  th  a i do     q was not the retreat nevertheless made in good order by the troops and without loss  a it was     q does your lordship remember the weather the state of the roads the state of the cattle and the difficulty of passing the fish kiln in the retreat to saratoga in the day and night of the  th  a it rained incessantly consequently the roads were bad the cattle were nearly starved for want of forage and the bridge over the fish kill had been destroyed by the enemy the troops were obliged to ford the river     q had there been no enemy to oppose us or no bridges or roads to repair would it have been possible from the state of the fatigue of the troops to have continued the march farther immediately after the arrival at saratoga  a the troops were greatly fatigued and the artillery had been left on the other side of the fish kill     q why were they left on the other side of the fish kill  a the bridge had been destroyed by the enemy it was exceeding dark and i do not know whether the ford was passable for the artillery without being first examined   0 q do you remember the enemy opening a battery on the opposite side of hudsons river and the circumstances attending the opening that battery  a the corpse i commanded was at that time posted and they fired on us at that time but i do not know from what direction     q does your lordship remember the shot from that battery going over the table when you and several officers were at dinner  a i did not dine with general burgoyne that day  i recollect hearing a cannon shot had discomposed the company at the generals table     q consequently must not that battery have commanded the ford over the hudsons river  a i believe i said i did not recollect from what direction the shot came but they had a battery which commanded that ford     q do you recollect on what day you was called with other commanders of corpse to the first council of war  a on the   th of october     q was there a spot in the whole position to be found for holding that council which was not exposed to cannon or rifleshot  a we were not so fortunate as to find one     q do you recollect that general burgoyne after stating to the council the difficulties of the situation declare that nothing should induce him to propose terms to the enemy without the general concurrence of the generals and field officers of the army and that he was ready to take the lead in any measure that they should think for the honor of the british arms or words to that effect  a i remember words to that effect     q was the concurrence unanimous for treating on honorable terms  a i hope i shall stand justified with the members of that council when i have the honor to declare to this house that our situation appeared to them so decided as not to admit of one dissenting voice     q when colonel kingston brought back the first proposition wherein it was specified by major general gates that the army should lay down their arms in their entrenchments and surrender prisoners of war does your lordship remember that general burgoyne when he read them to the council declared he would not set his hand to those conditions or words to that effect  a i think the words of the proposal from general gates were that the british army should be ordered by word of command from their adjutant general to lay down their arms in the entrenchments it was rejected with disdain by general burgone and the council concurred in his indignation     q were the counter proposals penned by general burgoyne unanimously approved  a they were     q when those proposals had been agreed to by general gates but copies not signed by either party do you remember general burgoyne informing the council of intelligence he had received from a spy in the night and submitting to their consideration whether it was consistent with public faith and if so expedient to suspend the execution of the treaty and trust to events  a i do remember it   0 q does your lordship recollect what was the result of that consideration  a the determination of the council on the question being put was that the public faith was bona fide plighted     q though that was the opinion of the majority was there not a difference of opinion in the council  a there was     q where the opinions of the several commanding officers asked respecting the condition of their respective corpse and what might be expected from them severally in desperate cases  a it was     q was there not on that question also difference of opinion  a there was     q after the convention took place did your lordship see the army of general gates pass in review before general burgoyne and general phillips  a i did     q from the manner and silence of their march the order observed in keeping their divisions and an apparent attention to their officers did that army appear disciplined  a they marched in good order and were silent and seemed to pay attention to their officers these are essential points of discipline but i saw nothing farther of it     q from the general behavior of the rebel troops in the different actions in which you was present in the course of the campaign did you think them disciplined and respectable troops  a when i answered the last question i spoke to the maneuver i saw upon the spot at all times when i was opposed to the rebels they fought with great courage and obstinacy     q judging by your eye and the time the rebel army was marching in review did you form any judgment of their number  a it requires great experience to make a computation of numbers by seeing them pass as far as i could judge on the occasion they seemed to me to amount to thirteen or fourteen thousand rank and file under arms     q has your lordship reason to know or believe that the troops that passed in review were exclusive of those corpse that had been posted on the other side of the hudsons river  a they were exclusive of those corpse    examined by other members of the committee and by general burgoyne occasionally    q what was the general opinion of the army of general burgoynes behavior in action and in difficulty  a it appeared to me that general burgoyne always possessed himself in every situation of danger and difficulty and i may venture to say it appeared so to the army   0 q had general burgoyne the confidence of the army  a he had     q after the arrival of the troops at cambridge were the officers and soldiers of the army satisfied with the generals efforts to contribute to their comfort and redress their grievances  a they were     q was the army satisfied with the generals behavior at the court martial held on colonel henley  a he carried on that prosecution in person and as such they were satisfied with him     q did your lordship ever hear any officer or soldier of that army express any dissatisfaction at the generals returning to england  a i did not     q does your lordship think that the officers of that army wish to have their respective merits stated to their sovereign by the general in person who had the honor of commanding them  a it was the wish of that army that general burgoyne should go to europe to justify not only his own conduct but the conduct of the army he commanded     q does your lordship apprehend that the return of general burgoyne to that army under personal disgrace and without any distribution of preferment among the distinguished officers of that army would be any sort of consolation to the troops under captivity  a general burgoyne at all times shared the dangers and afflictions of that army in common with every soldier as such they looked on him as their friend and certainly would have received him in person or any accounts of him with every mark of affection     q your lordship having said that if the rebels had maintained their post at the ascent from the low countries to the pitch pine plains in the march from fort anne to fort edward artillery would have been of great use to dislodge them will your lordship say what kind of artillery of what calibre would have been necessary for that purpose  a any of the artillery officers now under the order of the house can give a much more satisfactory answer to that question than i possibly can     q did you see that post  a i think i said i did see it     q with what kind of work was that post fortified  a i spoke of it merely from its situation     q were there then any works or none  a i dont recollect there were any works   0 q if the army after taking ticonderoga had been embarked and proceeded directly to south bay would there have been any occasion to have attacked the post at pitch pine plains at all  a the army did proceed by south bay excepting a detachment of general frasers corpse and some germans to support him and the army assembled at skenesborough on the  th or  0th of july     q was it necessary to go to the post at pitch pine plains in order to go to south bay  a they had no sort of connection with each other     q might not the army have proceeded to fort edward and omitted the attack of that pass supposing it had been meant to be defended  a there were two routes to fort edward general burgoyne might still go the same route without any necessity of attacking that post as there might have been many different ways of dislodging the enemy from that post without attacking it     q in how many instances do you remember the rebels defending their entrenchments after they had made them  a we never got a view of any of their entrenchments but such as they had voluntarily abandoned     q is it then to be understood that they never defended any entrenchments  a they never did     q did you ever hear general fraser express his approbation of the passing of the hudsons river  a i never did     q did you ever hear general fraser express his approbation of the bennington expedition  a that detachment was made and the business concluded before i ever heard of the project or execution     q have you occasion to know when the first detachment was sent out under colonel baume where they were ordered to rejoin general burgoyne after they had performed the service they were sent on  a i dont know     q whether in your lordships opinion after the loss the rebels had sustained over night in the action of the   th of september if they had been attacked briskly at break of day the next day there was a probability that they could have stood their ground  a i have not hesitated to give an opinion upon supposed matters which must have been attended with evident and demonstrable consequences but i beg the indulgence of the house in declining to give any opinion upon any question relative to speculation or judgment had any general officer of that army under general burgoyne been present in this country i should have confined myself merely to the maneuvers of the corpse i commanded as there is no general officer here i wish to give this house every information consistent with my rank in the army     q had you any information that might indicate to you that the rebels were prepared to decamp after the action of the   th of september  a i was ignorant of any such intelligence being received   00 q had you any information of their baggage being packed up  a i have already answered that i had no information at all about it   0  q in the action of the  th of october on which side did the rebels force our lines and make a lodgement  a the lines to the right were stormed and carried   0  q were the lines attacked to the left  a to the left of that post they were but not to the left of the army   0  q did not the possession of fort edward and the country thereabouts cut off the retreat of any garrison that might have been in fort george  a it undoubtedly did   0  q had the army proceeded to fort george by ticonderoga and lake george might not the enemy have remained at fort george till the trenches were opened and have still had their retreat secure  a that is a matter of opinion upon speculation   0  q do you not think that the british army being well provided with artillery was a probable reason for their not defending entrenchments  a the reason they did not defend their entrenchments was that they always marched out of them and attacked us   0  q does your lordship think it would have been advisable in point of prudence or just to brave troops who had suffered severe loss to attack an enemy the morning after that loss posted within entrenchments which it was impossible to reconnoitre  a that attempt was tried on the  th of october and did not succeed   0  q were not the enemy reinforced between the   th of september and the  th of october  a i think it is likely they were   0  q were they likely to be in better spirits to repel an attack the day after they had been repulsed with great loss or when they had been reinforced and seen an army lie three weeks inactive in their camp  a i do not judge of the spirit of the enemy but when i was opposed to them myself   0  q on the first day of the action when the enemy was repulsed on the   th of september had not our army suffered very considerably  a they suffered very considerable loss    0 q was not the army recruited and in better order on the  th of october than they were on the  0th of september  a numbers of the men who had been wounded and disabled in the action of the   th joined their corpse on the  th of october      q was the behavior of the enemy opposed to your lordship in the actions you have seen such as to make them contemptible in the eye of a soldier  a i have already mentioned that they fought at all times with courage and obstinacy      q whether the behavior of the enemy was such as to make advantages obtained by them over his majestys troops more humiliating and disgraceful to the british arms than the same advantages obtained by an equal number of any other troops  a i myself felt more humiliation until i considered that those advantages proceeded from the nature of the country and not from the want of zeal or bravery in the british troops      q whether the enemys troops were such bad troops as to make it more disgraceful to have an advantage obtained by them over the kings troops than by the like number of any other enemy over a like number of his majestys troops in the same circumstances of country  a the advantages gained by the rebels over the british troops proceeded from their local situation and not from the want of courage in the british troops we were taught by experience that neither their attacks nor resistance was to be despised      q did you ever serve against any other troops  a i commenced my service in america      q whether the army under general burgoyne in general expected cooperation in their efforts to go to albany from the army under the command of sir william how  a general burgoyne gave it out in general orders that he had every reason to believe that powerful armies were acting in cooperation with the army he had the honor to command      q do you know at what time that order was given out  a the adjutant generals books will show it i think it was about the  d of october      q does your lordship believe that if the army under general how had cooperated up the north river with the army under general burgoyne that the army under general burgoyne would have been obliged to have made the convention it did  a that is a matter of judgment the army looked forward to that cooperation which they were led to understand by the orders general burgoyne had given out with pleasure      q what was the general opinion of the officers of the army in which you served on that subject of cooperation  a i do not think my rank in the army entitles me to give my opinion on that subject i shall still less presume to give that of others  withdrew  then he was called in again and several parts of the examination particularly that which immediately follows the place where it is said that his lordship was examined by other members of the committee were read and then the last question which was put to his lordship immediately before he withdrew was repeated with this addition to the best of your recollection and information     a i have already declined answering that question    0 q when did you first know that there was to be no cooperation from general howes army and that sir william how had carried his army to chesapeak bay  a i did not know that we were to expect no cooperation until after the convention was signed      q when did you first hear that sir william how was gone to the southward  a it was reported so in the army about the beginning of the campaign before we crossed the river      q when was that report first confirmed so as to make it a matter of belief  a i never knew it was confirmed at all      q whether you yourself was not surprised or disappointed or both when you first understood that there was not to be any cooperation from sir william how but that sir william howes army was gone to chesapeak bay  withdrew  again called in     q whether you yourself was surprised or disappointed or both when you first heard that sir william howes army was gone to chesapeak bay  a i neither knew the object of the campaign nor its expectations and therefore cannot speak to any maneuver of which i could not know the tendency      q did the army in general express themselves pleased at the news of sir william howes being gone to chesapeak bay  a the answer to the last question as it relates to me in particular relates to them in general      q whether your lordship as a matter of fact in the consideration you had in the army on the news of sir william howes being gone to chesapeak bay heard those you conversed with express themselves pleased or talk of that expedition to chesapeak as a powerful cooperation with general burgoyne  a i think that question is fully answered in the two preceding ones      q whether you did not think general howes fighting general washingtons grand army at the battle of brandywine was a very capital cooperation with the army under general burgoyne  a i was not at brandywine      q whether you was not surprised when you returned home to this country to learn that the secretary of state for the american department had information from general how of his intentions of going to the southward before general burgoyne departed from this country and never communicated that information to general burgoyne before his departure for canada  a i have the honor to stand before this house as a military man and not as a politician and cannot answer any question but those relative to my own profession      q what was your lordships opinion of the spirit of your own corpse  a the opinion i gave in the council of war relative to the spirit of the corpse i commanded was that they were willing and zealous to undertake any enterprise that general burgoyne would please to employ them upon    0 q when advice was received that sir henry clinton was coming up the north river did you apprehend the treaty of convention had gone so far that it could not be broken  a my opinion was with respect to that question that all military negotiations were fair and justifiable to make delays and to gain time i therefore thought and declared my sentiments that general burgoyne was at full liberty to break off that treaty in the stage it then was and i could not conceive that the public faith was engaged until the treaty was actually signed and exchanged      by general burgoyne q whether the opinion of general burgoyne of general phillips of brigadier hamilton and several other officers did not coincide with your opinion in all the matters comprised in the last question  a as general burgoyne seems desirous that i should answer that question i declare his sentiments were the same with those i have now delivered i hope that the other members of that council will soon be in a situation to stand forward and to declare the opinion they gave on that and every other question      by general burgoyne q when the question relative to the point of public faith was decided by the majority of the council was not the concurrence for signing the convention unanimous  a it was      q what day was it first known that sir henry clinton had taken the highlands and was coming up the north river  a in the night of the   th of october  withdrew  captain money called in and examined by general burgoyne   q was not you deputy quarter master general of the army under general burgoyne in       a i was    q after lieutenant colonel carleton returned to canada was you the superior officer in that department  a i was    q as such did you make it your business from the beginning of the campaign to get a knowledge of the country  a whenever there was any occasion to obtain the knowledge of any particular part of the country a party was always sent with me for that purpose but the woods were so thick that it was impossible to go without a party    q was you well acquainted with the country between skenesborough and fort edward  a i was    q how long was the army employed in making the roads practicable between skenesborough and fort edward  a about six or seven days in making the road between skenesborough and fort anne and between fort anne and fort edward i do not believe the army was delayed an hour on that account there was a very good road made by the rebels the year before between fort anne and fort edward in which road the rebels had cut down some few trees which took the provincials in our army some few hours to clear    q does not the possession of the country in the neighborhood of fort edward necessarily prevent the retreat of a garrison that might be in fort george  a it prevents the getting off any artillery or stores but a garrison might get through the woods in case we were in the possession of the ground in the neighborhood of fort edward    q did not the garrison of fort george evacuate the fort upon the approach of the kings troops toward fort edward  a i heard they did i was not near enough to see    q had the army taken their route by south bay ticonderoga and lake george how many bateaux do you imagine it would have taken to carry the troops solely over lake george exclusive of provisions and stores  a i think between three and four hundred which bateaux must have been carried up out of lake champlain to lake george    q what time would it have taken as you imagine to have drawn those bateaux over the land between lake champlain and lake george with the horses then at ticonderoga  a i suppose a fortnight  four hundred bateaux   0 q though there were no troops passed over lake george how long did it take before the first transport of provisions arrived at fort george  a i cannot recollect precisely     q considering the length of time it took to transport the provisions without the troops over lake george was not the army forwarder in their way to albany in point of time by the route they took than they could have been by the route of ticonderoga and lake george  a i have already said that it would take a fortnight to transport the  00 bateaux from lake champlain to lake george it therefore would have delayed the army a fortnight longer than they were delayed to have returned from skenesborough by ticonderoga and gone across lake george     q was you commissary of horse as well as deputy quarter master general  a it was     q what is the nature of that department  a it was to take charge of all the horses furnished by contract for general burgoynes army by any letter of instructions from general burgoyne i am directed to give proper orders and directions to the drivers furnished by that contract for the purpose of transporting provisions and stores brought to fort george for the use of the army     q did you report from time to time to major general phillips and take orders from him as well as from general burgoyne  a yes     q were not the orders from both the generals invariable precise and pressing for using all possible diligence in forwarding the transport of provisions  a they were there was one order which i will read as it will fullv answer that question it is dated august the   th duercamp and is in these words it having been a practice for officers to order to be taken from the provision train in the service of the king for this army the carts and horses for the carrying baggage and other purposes to avoid for the future the danger and inconveniences to the service it is in the most positive manner ordered that no cart or horse are to be used but for the public transport of the army nor is any officer accidentally coming to any particular post to interfere with the provision train in any other manner than to give it every aid and assistance which he is on all occasions to do       q was not the transport of merchandise and even sutlers stores as well as of officers baggage positively forbid till the transport of provision should be over  a there was such an order and a seizure made of two barrels of madeira and two barrels of rum which were ordered to the hospital     q do you recollect general burgoynes expressing at several times particular anxiety on the subject of expediting the transport of provisions  a i do remember once to have heard general burgoyne express his concern at our not being able to bring forward a greater quantity of provision to enable him to proceed with the army  i do recollect to have heard him say with very great earnestness to general phillips and colonel carleton that one months provision at that particular time it was about the latter end of august would be worth  00000l to great britain     q do you think that the commissary of the wagons and other carriages was authorized to buy or hire oxteams wherever they could be had and that all draught cattle taken were appropriated to the transport  a he received such directions     q how many carts and oxteams could be mustered at any one time  a i think only   0 carts could at any one time be mustered the number of oxcarts i really forget but i believe between  0 and  0   0 q about how many days provision for the troops and all other persons fed from the kings stores could that number of carriages convey  a there never was any trial made but if i may presume to judge from the proportion brought forward over and above the daily consumption of the army should suppose all those carriages would not carry more than four days provisions at most i am speaking at random as no trial was made     q did it not sometimes happen from accidents of weather and roads and the tired state of the cattle that not more than one days provision could be brought forward in a day  a it did     q how many hours did it take one hour with another to draw a bateau from fort george to fort edward  a in general about six     q was not the unloading the carts at fort edward and embarking the contents in bateaux unloading the bateaux at the upper falls of fort miller and a second time unloading them at the lower falls dilatory as it was a more expeditious method than it would have been to have carried the provisions the whole way in carts  a i do apprehend it was not possible in the feeble state i found the horses furnished by contract to have brought forward the daily consumption of provisions for that army down to fort miller in the month of august in the latter end of that month at which time i was appointed a commissary general of horse i made on the first of september a general muster and found  0 horses unserviceable from fatigue and hard labor     q was the transport of provisions at any time impeded by the bringing forward the artillery from fort george  a the artillery had a separate contract for horses with which they brought forward their own stores i dont recollect that any part of the provision train were ever employed in bringing forward artillery or artillery stores     q was it possible with the means we had to collect a months store of provisions sooner than it was collected  a i believe not without the utter ruin of the horses furnished by contract for the purpose of transporting stores     q was you present in the action of the   th of september  a i was     q did the enemy dispute the field that day with obstinacy  a they did and the fire was much heavier than ever i saw it any where unless at the affair of fort anne     q do you know how long the regiments of the british line were under that fire  a the three british regiments the  0th   st and   d were engaged from three oclock in the afternoon till seven in the evening and whilst i was a prisoner i heard the rebel quartermaster general say they had nine different regiments in the field opposed to the three british i have named     q do you know the loss the three british regiments sustained  a i cannot say   0 q do you remember the strength of the   d regiment when they came out of the action  a i cannot speak to the particular strength of the regiment when they came out of action but i heard that they were not  00 rank and file     q how many officers were left in that regiment at the end of the action  a i cannot answer that question     q from the general state of the three british regiments do you think that they would have been in a proper condition to have attacked the enemy the next morning  a certainly not nor to go on any service whatever     q about what time of the day did the enemy finally give way  a they gave way very often finally about seven in the evening     q was it practicable at that time of the evening and in that kind of country to have pursued  a i should think not     q was you not often employed between the day of that action and the action of the  th of october to reconnoitre  a i was     q was you able to obtain a view of the enemys position  a i obtained a view of the position of the right of the rebel entrenchments     q what was the nature of their position to the right with regard to entrenchments  a they were posted on a hill that came very near the river on the top of the hill was a strong breastwork at the foot an abbatis     q did it appear to you that that wing of the enemy was attackable  a it is a question that is scarcely in my line of service to answer but as there are no general officers nor older officers than myself who served under general burgoyne i hope no military man will think me presuming to give my opinion on that subject i do think that we could not have attacked the right wing of the rebel entrenchments without risking the loss of the whole army and with little probability of success     q could you obtain a view of the left wing of the enemy  a i never saw the left wing of the enemys entrenchments till i was taken prisoner and conducted through their works   0 q on the  th of october was you in a situation to see the enemy advancing to the attack of your left  a yes     q did they advance under a well served fire of grapeshot from our artillery  a i was in a situation that gave me an opportunity of seeing the directions of the rebels columns and i was very much astonished to hear the shot from the enemy fly so thick after our cannonade had lasted a quarter of an hour     q when the british grenadiers were forced last from their post what ensued  a i did not see the british grenadiers forced back i saw them on their march as i apprehended taking a different position at that time several of them broke their ranks but on some aid du camps calling to them for shame to continue their rank they marched away to their station in good order a battalion of brunswickers that were on the left of the artillery quitted their ground as soon as the firing began and to the best of my recollection i did not see they left a man behind them on the ground i would add that after some difficulty that battalion was brought to make a stand in the rear of the artillery but in no order     q was not that battalion brought to that stand by the activity and exhortation of major general reidesel  a i did not see general reidesel endeavor to stop the battalion but i saw an aid du camp of his and a brigade major with their drawn swords keeping them up i did see general reidesel immediately afterward on the right of the artillery with the battalion perfectly formed and in good order     q do you imagine that the giving way of the battalion you first described was the cause that the artillery on that spot was taken and yourself and major williams being made prisoners  a i believe it contributed in some measure toward the loss of the action on that day but before sir francis clarke died of his wounds he told me that he received his wound in bringing orders for the artillery and the whole of the detachment to return to camp and to the circumstance of sir francis clarkes being wounded i do attribute the loss of the artillery if not the loss of the whole army     q had you an opportunity after you was prisoner to see the left of the enemys entrenchments  a i had     q was the ground within cannon shot of the left open and commanding it  a all the ground i saw was cleared and entrenched     q was there not ground within cannon shot that would have commanded that entrenchment on the left  a there was     q had we gained possession of that ground and been able to erect batteries of our heaviest guns would not the whole line of the enemy have been enfiladed  a the ground alluded to was entrenched and commanded the whole of the rebel camp and lines if the army had got possession of that ground i do not believe the rebels would have staid one hour in their camp     q did you ever hear in conversation with the rebel officers that general arnold foreseeing that inconvenience had marched out of his lines and attacked without orders from general gates  a i did hear that general arnold had marched out on the  th of october without orders from general gates i did also hear that he advised the going out to meet general burgoyne on his march and engaging him before he approached their lines and the reason he gave was this if general burgoyne should ever come near enough their lines to be able to make use of his artillery that he would certainly possess himself of their camp that their troops in that case would never stand any where but if on the other hand the rebels should be defeated in the woods the troops would after that have confidence in their works for which reason arnold advised risking an action in the woods before general burgoyne came near enough to fee their works    examined by other members of the committee and by general burgoyne occasionally  0 q did not your situation as deputy quarter master general lead you to mix very much with the different officers of the army  a it did     q what do you apprehend to have been the general opinion of the officers of general burgoynes conduct as well in action as in the many trying occasions which have been stated by you at the bar  a they entertained a very high opinion of general burgoynes conduct     q had general burgoyne the full confidence of the army under his command to the last moment  a he certainly had     q what was the armys opinion of the rebels after their retreat from ticonderoga  a the army in general did not think after they had evacuated ticonderoga that they would make a stand any where     q what was the reason given in your army for the expedition to bennington  a i believe i cannot answer that question better than by reading an abstract of the generals orders the day after that action  august    duer camp it was endeavored among other objects by the expedition which marched to the left to provide such a supply of cattle as would have enabled the army to proceed without waiting the arrival of the magazines that attempt having failed of success through the chances of war the troops must necessarily halt some days for bringing forward the transports     q why did the army remain from the   th of august to the   th of september before they crossed the hudsons river to engage the rebels as stillwater  q to bring forward a sufficient quantity of provisions and artillery to enable the general to give up his communication     q what was the opinion of the army on their crossing the hudsons river  a they did think it was their indispensible duty to proceed forward and fight the rebels which we heard were then at stillwater     q did you ever forage to the right of general frasers camp before the  th of august  a we never foraged to the right of the camp at freemans farm at any one time on the  th of october while the troops were in the field general fraser ordered all the batmen and drivers belonging to his brigade to come and forage in the rear of the troops     q do you know what was general frasers opinion on your foraging to the right  a i do know that general fraser mentioned to me on the  th of october that there was forage on the right of his camp but at that time the ground on which that forage was to be met with was in possession of the rebels advanced post     q do you think your army would have been lost if even the expedition from new york had taken place a few days sooner  a if the troops had arrived at new york soon enough to have enabled sir henry clinton to have made his expedition up the north river a week sooner i do conceive that our army would not have been lost   0 q what was the opinion of the rebels on sir william howes going to the southward  a i was not acquainted enough with the rebel leaders to hear their opinion on that question i do not think that the peasants of the country were judges of the propriety of sir william howes conduct     q what was the opinion of the officers of general burgoynes army after it was lost relative to the crossing hudsons river  a they did think that the alternative of retreating with their army to canada or proceeding to stillwater under the necessity of giving up his communication to be an unfortunate situation but i never heard any officers say that they thought general burgoyne had done wrong many said that if they had retreated without risking an action at the time sir henry clinton was coming up the north river the army would never have forgiven him nor would he ever have forgiven himself     q was you at new york after the loss of general burgoynes army  a yes     q what was the opinion or the language of the military at that place relative to sir william howes expedition to pensylvania  a whatever opinion was formed of sir william howes expedition to pensylvania or is formed previous to this enquiry such an opinion must have been illfounded as sir william howes reasons were not known nor his instructions communicated to the public     q from your last answer is the committee to understand that the opinions that were formed respecting sir william howes expedition to philadelphia before this enquiry were not in favor of that expedition  question objected to  withdrew  again called in    q you have said that the army thought it their indispensible duty to pass over hudsons river  why did they think that that measure was particularly their indispensible duty  a if the hudsons river had not been there the army would have thought it their indispensible duty to have gone and risked an action before they returned to canada if i recollect right i said that if the army had returned to canada without fighting that the army would never have forgiven the general nor the general have forgiven himself     q do you know the nature of the country between the place where we passed the hudsons river and albany on the east side of the river  a yes i do     q could the army have taken that route in order to pass the river opposite or near to albany  a the army could not have taken that route as part of the way was a swamp and on the right of the rebel entrenchments was a mountain very rugged and not passable nearer than two miles from the river     q was it not a necessary consequence then that the boats must have been abandoned if the army had taken that route  a i think i have said the army could not take that route if the army had marched on the east of the hudsons river they could not have marched near enough to have covered their provision bateaux from the rebel force on the west side of the river     q did the army under general burgoyne on their approach to albany expect a cooperation of the army under sir william how upon the north river  a they did and this is the order of general burgoyne given october the  d at freemans farm  there is reason to be assured that other powerful armies are actually in cooperation with these troops and although the present supply of provision is ample it is highly desirable to prepare for any continuance in the field that the kings service may require without the delay of bringing forward further stores for those purposes the ration of bread or flour is for the present fixed at one pound   0 q are you acquainted with the north river from new york to albany  a i am not     q how many days march from fort edward to albany if no interruption from an enemy  a i cannot answer that question unless i am to suppose that a bridge was ready formed for the troops to pass over on some part of hudsons river between batten kill and fort edward or that there were vessels ready to transport the troops over hudsons river     q is the distance so great between fort edward and albany that the army could not carry provisions with them to support them during the march  a certainly albany is not at so great a distance from fort edward but that a corpse of troops might certainly carry provisions sufficient for the march to albany     q was it not understood that if you had arrived at albany that the army would find plenty of provisions there  a it was generally believed and i believe it myself firmly that if the army had got to albany we should have found a number of loyal subjects that would have joined and done every thing in their power to have established the army at that place     q must not the army to march from fort edward to albany have necessarily carried a number of boats to form a bridge to pass the river  a there was no passing the river well without a bridge of boats and there were not scouls enough on that river to make a bridge     q would not the necessary delay arising from carrying forward those boats and throwing a bridge fit to pass an army have consumed more time than it was possible for that army to subsist with such provision as they could carry with them  a i should think it would     q you will give the committee what information you can respecting a road from fort edward to albany on the left side of the river  a i have answered that fully     q whether by taking a pretty large circuit the army would have reached albany and avoided the swamps you mentioned  a certainly not on the east side of the river because the enemy being on the opposite shore would certainly have opposed general burgoynes army crossing the hudsons river at albany the river being three times the width it is at saratoga  withdrew  martis  o die junii      mr f montagu in the chair  earl of harrington called in and examined by general burgoyne   q in what capacity did your lordship serve in america in the campaign       a i was captain in the   th regiment of foot and went on the expedition with general burgoyne with the command of the grenadier company i was afterward appointed supernumerary aid du camp to the general    q while acting as captain of the grenadier company was you at the action of huberton  a i was    q what was the behavior of the enemy on that day  a they behaved in the beginning of the action with a great deal of spirit but on the british troops rushing on them with their bayonets they gave way in great confusion    q from the nature of the country was it practicable to pursue the enemy further than they were pursued on that occasion  a certainly not  i think we ran some risque even in pursuing them so far    q at what time of the campaign was it that general burgoyne requested your lordship to act as his aid du camp  a i think about the   th of july    q was you present a few days after that time at a council held with the indians of the remote nations then just arrived under the conduct of major campbell and mr st luc    a yes  q was you present at a former council of the indians held at lake champlain    a yes  q what was the tenor of general burgoynes speeches and injunctions at both those councils respecting the restraint of barbarities  a he absolutely forbid their scalping except their dead prisoners which they insisted on doing and he held out rewards to them for bringing in prisoners and enjoined them to treat them well    q do you remember being with general burgoyne soon after the last council upon a visit to an out post near fort anne  a i perfectly recollect it   0 q had general burgoyne a considerable escort of indians with him  a he had     q did part of that escort on a scout from that post fall in with and take a part of the enemy who were laid in ambush for the purpose of killing or taking the general and those who were with him  a they did     q what were the sentiments of the captain taken on that occasion respecting his treatment from the indians  a he said he was treated with much humanity and i perfectly remember that prisoners brought in on many other occasions by the indians declared that they had been used with the same degree of humanity     q does your lordship remember general burgoynes receiving at fort anne the news of the murder of miss mrea  a i do     q did general burgoyne repair immediately to the indian camp and call them to council assisted by brigadier general fraser  a he did     q what passed at that council  a general burgoyne threatened the culprit with death insisted that he should be delivered up and there were many gentlemen of the army and i own i was one of the number who feared that he would put that threat in execution motives of policy i believe alone prevented him from it and if he had not pardoned the man which he did i believe the total defection of the indians would have ensued and the consequences on their return through canada might have been dreadful not to speak of the weight they would have thrown into the opposite scale had they gone over to the enemy which i rather imagine would have been the case     q do you remember general burgoynes restraining the indian parties from going out without a british officer or proper conductor who were to be responsible for their behavior  a i do     q do you remember mr st lucs reporting discontents amongst the indians soon after our arrival at fort edward  a i do     q how long was that after enforcing the restraints above mentioned  a i cannot exactly say i should imagine about three weeks or a month     q does your lordship recollect general burgoynes telling mr st luc that he had rather lose every indian than connive at their enormities or using language to that effect  a i do   0 q does your lordship remember what passed in council with the indians at fort edward  a to the best of my recollection much the same exhortation to act with humanity and much the same rewards were offered for saving their prisoners     q do you recollect the circumstance of the indians desiring to return home at that time  a i do perfectly well     q do you remember that many quitted the army without leave  a i do immediately after the council and the next morning     q was it not the general opinion that the defection of the indians then and afterward was caused by the restraint upon their cruelties and habits of plunder  a it was     q had you reason to believe that the expedition to bennington was much desired by general reidesel and that it was his wish to have it conducted by lieutenant colonel baume  a it was always imagined in the army that it was his wish and that colonel baume was appointed to the command of it in compliment to him     q did you know the corpse of british commanded by captain fraser which made part of that expedition  a they were volunteers from the british regiments and also stood very high in the opinion of the army from their gallant behavior on all occasions     q do you remember general burgoynes visiting the detachment after it was assembled and conferring with colonel baume  a i do     q did colonel baume appear satisfied with the strength of his corpse  a i conversed with colonel baume and with several officers under his command and they appeared perfectly satisfied at least i heard no complaint from them the only anxiety they expressed was lest the destination of that corpse should become known to the enemy     q does your lordship remember general burgoynes receiving in the night a letter from lieutenant colonel baume expressing he found the enemy in greater force than he expected  a i do     q do you remember sir francis clarke general burgoynes aid du camp being sent with orders to colonel breyman to march immediately to support him  a i do   0 q did you communicate the same order to general reidesel at the same time  a i did     q was colonel breyman the nearest corpse for the purpose of that support  a it was     q did brigadier general fraser at all times treat your lordship with great confidence  a i was often with general fraser and he frequently talked without reserve upon matters which he was not particularly bound to conceal there were certain matters of intelligence which it would have been improper for him to mention to any body in this case i cannot boast so much of his confidence as to suppose that he would have opened his mind to me on matters which he would have concealed from the rest of his friends     q have you not frequently been present when general burgoyne and general fraser discussed the object of the campaign and conversed freely on the circumstances of the time  a i have     q did your lordship ever in presence or absence of general burgoyne hear general fraser express a disapprobation of passing the hudsons river  a i never did     q do you know or believe that the idea of forcing our way to albany was prevalent throughout the army  a in every conversation i had with different officers of the army i never remember once to have heard it doubted but that we were to force our way     q did the army pass the hudsons river with alacrity  a it is impossible for any army to have been in higher spirits than they were at that time or more desirous of coming to an engagement with the enemy     q do you not conceive that to have remained posted behind the hudsons river at the time the army passed it and advanced would have cast a damp on the spirits of that army and a reflection on their general  a from the eagerness of the army to advance and the great uneasiness that was discernible through it on every delay i apprehended that it could not have been otherwise and i think that general burgoynes character would not have stood very high either with the army this country or the enemy had he halted at fort edward     q do you recollect the march up to the enemy on the   th of september  a i do     q will you please to describe it  a the army marched in three divisions the german line flanking the artillery and baggage pursued the course of the river through the meadows and formed the left hand division the british line marched parallel to it at some distance through the woods and formed the center division general frasers corpse with the grenadiers and light infantry of the germans were obliged to make a large detour through the woods and formed the right hand division or column beyond this on the right there were as i understand flanking parties of light infantry and provincials   0 q was the country over which the army passed intersected with a deep ravine  a it was one of the deepest i ever saw     q which column was first attacked  a the advanced party consisting of the picquets of the center column being sent forwards under the command of major forbes to explore the way by which that column was to pass fell in with a considerable body of the rebels posted in a house and behind fences which they attacked and after a great deal of fire the detachment nearly drove in the body of rebels but on finding that the woods quite round them were filled with the enemy they were obliged to retire to the main body     q was the march so performed that when general burgoyne formed the line of the british infantry general frasers corpse were ready upon their right to support them  a general fraser on hearing the fire of major forbess party detached two companies to support them which came up just after that engagement was over and on their appearance the enemy finding that our troops were in strength quitted the post they had before occupied and immediately after this the whole line was formed with the utmost regularity i would explain that when i speak of the line i do not include the left hand column which was composed of germans and which did not come into the line or into action till late in the day     q how long did the action last  a from three oclock i think till very near eight     q how long were the  0th   st and   d regiments engaged  a during the greatest part of that time     q was the action well disputed by the enemy  a it was very obstinately     q was your lordship near the person of general burgoyne during that action except when you were employed to carry orders  a yes     q were not different attempts made by the generals orders to charge the enemy with bayonets and did not those attempts fail by the heaviness of the enemys fire and thickness of the woods  a there were many attempts made for that purpose and they all failed except the last when the british troops finally drove them out of the field     q when part of the german troops did get into action that day under general reidesel how did they behave  a i heard their behavior spoke of in the highest terms they marched up to the enemy with great coolness and steadiness and gave them as i was told three vollies by word of command from their officers     q can your lordship speak to the loss sustained by the three british regiments the   d in particular  a the loss was very considerable but i dont recollect the numbers   0 q were those three british regiments in a condition to have attacked the enemy the next morning  a their numbers were so reduced that i apprehend they were not     q from the loss of killed and wounded particularly of officers would it have been desirable to have brought those three regiments into action for the next ten days  a in less than ten days the state of those regiments certainly would not have been much mended i therefore apprehend that if they were not in a condition to be brought into action the next morning their inability would have still continued for those ten days     q had the army made a movement to gain the left of the enemys entrenchments before the redoubts were constructed that commanded the plain near the river would not all the bateaux stores and hospitals have been exposed to attack  a it certainly would have been so     q do you recollect the scarcity of forage on the west side of the river  a i do perfectly     q would not the bridge of boats constructed for the purpose of foraging to the east side have also been exposed before the redoubts above mentioned were raised  a they certainly would had it not been for those redoubts and a work called the tete du pont which was raised for the protection of the bridge     q do you recollect how long it took to raise those redoubts to throw the bridge and raise the tete du pont  a if i recollect right the bridge itself was finished in one night the making and completing the other works took some days     q does your lordship remember general burgoyne mentioning to you in confidence the receipt of a letter from sir henry clinton and his hourly expectation of his attacking the highlands and his opinion that his success there must dislodge the enemy without attacking their entrenchments  a i perfectly recollect the generals mentioning all this to me     q was you near general burgoyne in the action of the  th of october  a i was     q do you recollect what orders you carried  a i do     q what were they  a the first orders i recollect to have carried were to post fifty men under the command of a captain of the  0th regiment to the left of the detachment of the army in order in some measure to join them to the advanced works of general frasers camp and in case of any accident to protect the detachment should they find it necessary to retire thither  the next orders i carried were to major general phillips at the end of the action acquainting him that as that detachment seemed much disordered from the enemy having turned both their flanks that it was necessary to draw it as soon as possible back to the camp which seemed menaced with an attack the care of this general burgoyne committed to general phillips while he himself returned to the camp in order to take proper measures for its defense on our return thither the works of the camp were actually attacked as general burgoyne had foreseen and i was then employed to collect what troops i should meet and to order them to those parts where they were most wanted soon after this the enemy having got round the right of our camp we expected an attack upon our rear and i then was dispatched with orders from general burgoyne to brigadier general hamilton for all the works in the rear of the camp which had been previously constructed to be manned with such soldiers as he could spare from the defense of the front   0 q does your lordship know what orders sir francis clarke was charged with at the time he received his wound  a i met sir francis clarke as i was searching for general phillips and acquainted him with my orders telling him at the same time that as the thickness of the wood might prevent my finding general phillips directly i wished he would assist me in order that no time might be lost in delivering those orders that was the last time i saw sir francis clarke and i believe that soon afterward he received the wound of which he died     q was it dark before general burgoyne had a certainty that col breyman was killed and his post carried by the enemy  a it was so dark that the officer who i believe first brought the intelligence of it seeing a number of men round the fires of that camp took them for germans and was not convinced of his error till he was fired upon by them as they proved to be a party of the enemy who had forced the works     q did general burgoyne use any efforts to rally the germans who were returning from the action and to persuade them to recover colonel breymans post  a he certainly did his utmost endeavors for that purpose which however were ineffectual from the darkness of the night and the entire confusion in which they were     q were any other troops at hand that could have been spared for that purpose  a there certainly were not every regiment was occupied in defense of its own lines which were not certainly overmanned     q in the heat of the action do you recollect seeing general reidesel about the time that the germans on the left of the british artillery were giving way  a i do     q was not general reidesel exerting himself to restore order in his troops  a general reidesel appeared to me to have behaved on that occasion in every way as became a brave and intelligent officer     q was the retreat of the army in the night of the  th made in good order and a new position taken by the time it was daylight  a it certainly was     q was the army under arms the whole day of the  th and in continual expectation of action  a they were and indeed were cannonaded during the greatest part of that day and the advanced corpse in particular who were posted on a hill were under almost a continual fire from the riflemen of the enemy     q do you recollect the circumstance of general frasers funeral on the afternoon of that day  a i do perfectly well the redoubt in which he was buried was very heavily cannonaded during the ceremony and even previous to this they fired at those who attended the corpse on its way thither which i suppose was accidental and proceeded from the enemys seeing a number of people together     q who were the chief persons who attended that funeral  a all the generals of the army their aid du camps and i believe all those who were not attached to any particular post which at that time were very few   0 q was the retreat of the army on the night of the  th and on the day and part of the night of the  th made in good order  a it was made in perfect good order     q what was the weather on the day of the  th  a exceeding wet     q what was the state of the troops in point of fatigue when they arrived at saratoga  a they certainly must have been much fatigued from the length of time they had been under arms and more particularly so from the badness of the roads occasioned by the rains     q when it was daylight the next morning did you see any part of the enemy upon the plain at saratoga on the ground where our artillery was afterward posted  a i dont recollect     q does your lordship recollect seeing a corpse of the enemy on the other side the hudsons river opposite to saratoga  a perfectly well and they seemed in force     q do you remember the circumstance of a battery opening from that corpse  a i do perfectly well the general general phillips and several other gentlemen were at dinner we were all obliged to remove from finding ourselves in the range of that battery     q we being in the range of that battery must it not necessarily have commanded the ford on the hudsons river  a it certainly did command that ford     q do you recollect lieut col sutherland being sent with a detachment of regulars and provincials from saratoga to cover a party of workmen employed to repair bridges and render the road practicable  a i perfectly recollect it     q do you recollect for what reason colonel sutherland and the regulars were recalled  a i understood it was on the apprehension of an action     q does your lordship recollect different scouts bringing reports of the enemys being in possession of the country between saratoga and fort edward on both sides of the river  a i do   0 q do you remember general burgoynes mentioning in confidence to you different ideas of forcing the ford over hudsons river of cutting away by the enemys right and attempting a rapid march to albany or by a night march to gain the fords above fort edward  a i do perfectly remember that he mentioned to me all those ideas     q did you ever hear of an offer made by general phillips to make his way to ticonderoga with a body of troops  a no     q in the intimacy in which you lived with major general phillips myself and the officers in general phillipss family do you not think you should have heard of such an offer had it been made  a i apprehend that i should have heard of it     q did your lordship hear of general phillips offering to attempt an escape through the woods with one or two guides for the purpose of putting himself at the head of the troops at ticonderoga for the future defense of that place  a i heard it mentioned since i came to england in some common conversation but i never heard it hinted at while i was in america     q the day before the council of the generals and field officers was called can your lordship speak of the state of things in general at saratoga  a the state of our army was certainly as bad as possible their numbers were few their provisions short and their position not a good one owing to the nature of the country which rose to the distance of some miles one hill overtopping that which was next to it     q do you know any officer of that army who in that situation thought we had a right to more than honorable terms  a our situation in the apprehension of every one there with whom i conversed did not entitle us to more     q did the army in general look on the terms obtained namely the power of serving their country in other places to be advantageous as well as honorable and more than they had a right to expect  a i believe they certainly did and that few persons in the army expected so good terms as those which were granted    examined by other members of the committee and by general burgoyne occasionally    q did the indians leave the army till after the battle of bennington  a great numbers did and at many different times     q were not some indians on the expedition to bennington  a there were     q was the expedition originally sent out to bennington  a my situation in the army not entitling me to be in the council of war and not being employed on that expedition i was of course not entrusted with the orders that were given to col baume   0 q have you reason to suppose that general reidesel or colonel baume had a particular knowledge of that part of the country so as to make it particularly proper to give colonel baume the command of that expedition  a i believe there was no officer in that army of sufficient rank to have commanded such an expedition who ever had been in that particular part of the country     q the intention of the expedition being as appears by the papers on the table to sound the disposition of the people of that country was that part of the country peopled with germans as many other parts of the country are  a i cannot exactly speak to the description of the people of that country as i was never there myself but there were employed on that expedition numbers of provincials many of whom were of that very country and i apprehend that the common soldiers of a regular army are not the immediate people who are expected to sound the minds of any country to which they are sent     q as your lordship mentioned the alacrity with which the army passed the hudsons river did the army in general think themselves at that time inadequate to the purpose of forcing their way to albany  a the opinions of an army who cannot be acquainted with the intelligence that has been received are often erroneous the army was in high spirits and did not i believe doubt of reaching albany     q did the general then doubt of reaching albany  a i really dont know     q were the rebels entrenchments completed on the   th of september  a i never saw the entrenchments at all     q how was our army employed between the   th of september and the  th of october  a the army itself was employed in strengthening its position     q did it take the army eighteen days to strengthen its position before it made any movement  a i cannot exactly say they were working all the time     q what works were executed in that time  a there were numbers of redoubts erected the tetedupont lines before the camp outworks to the lines in which guards and picquets were placed and batteries     q how many redoubts were erected  a i think in all there must have been five or six     q was the erecting those works full employment for eighteen days  a i am not an engineer or i certainly should endeavor to answer that question   00 q were all those works necessary in your opinion for an army that meant to march forward and attack the enemy  a they were necessary in our particular situation being within half a mile of the enemy to whom we were opposed and being inferior in numbers   0  q does your lordship know whether the enemy thought it necessary to fortify themselves with redoubts  a i dont know what the species of their fortification was but i have been always told that great labor had been employed on their works and what small part i saw of them convinced me of it   0  q had you not information from deserters or friends what the enemy was doing  a my situation in that army did not entitle me to receive that intelligence when any person came to me to inform me that he had been employed in gaining such intelligence my duty was to bring him to the general   0  q was it not a matter of notoriety in the army that the enemy received reinforcement between the   th of september and the  th of october  a the manner of receiving intelligence in an army seldom transpires the army might guess but i believe they knew nothing   0  q was it not understood that the rebels had suffered a much greater loss than the kings troops on the   th of september  a it was   0  q was not the whole or nearly the whole of the rebel army engag ed  a i dont know i apprehend the whole was not engaged   0  q was our army in general in your apprehension in as good a condition on the  0th of september as the rebel army who had suffered much more  a the rebel army was so numerous that their loss was not equally felt with ours   0  q what number had you reason to suppose the rebel army consisted of on the   th of september  a i always understood they were very numerous i never heard their numbers exactly   0  q was not the scarcity of forage foreseen by every body  a those with whom i conversed did not foresee it to the extent in which we experienced it   0  q was it prudent in your lordships opinion to bring or attempt to bring upwards of fourteen hundred horses to attend the army in a country so destitute of forage  a i never heard that the horses in our army were thought too numerous on all occasions a scarcity of them was complained of    0 q do you know how many horses were allowed for the baggage of each regiment  a i dont know      q does your lordship know how many horses were employed about the train of artillery  a i dont recollect but the returns are on the table      q was the heavy artillery brought back from stillwater on the retreat of the army to saratoga  a we had lost some small part of it and the rest was brought to saratoga      q did the bringing back of that artillery delay that retreat or not  a an army with cannon certainly cannot march so rapidly as one without cannon but cannon always creates a delay which armies have been content to put up with      q was it necessary in your opinion in the situation in which the army retreated to make their retreat as expeditious as possible  a the army appeared to me that it did make its retreat as expeditious as possible      q would the leaving of heavy artillery behind in your opinion have made a difference of four miles in the march  a i cannot conceive that it would the enemy were in force behind us not having numbers to contend with them it would have been a very desperate circumstance to have abandoned our cannon in case of an attack      q were the heavy artillery in effect of any use in that retreat  a i dont recollect as it happened that they were of any other use than that of their not being turned against us      q might not those cannon have been spiked and their trunnions have been knocked off to have rendered them useless  a i understand that the spikes in cannon are easily removed and that it is not an easy matter i believe almost an impossibility with any tools that are carried in an army to knock off the trunnions of brass cannon      q might not the retreat have been accelerated by leaving behind a great part of the baggage  a i dont think it would i do not remember that we were stopped on account of any particular impediment      q does your lordship know at what time intelligence was received in general burgoynes army of the failure of colonel st legers expedition  a i think it must have been in the month of august    0 q was not that before the passing of hudsons river  a i dont recollect the exact date of receiving that intelligence      q was it in the month of august  a i cannot tell i heard of it some time after by accident      q was there any heavy artillery with the army properly so called  a there was none of the heavy sort we had medium twelvepounders and two twentyfour pounders which we took from the enemy at quebec which were very much lighter than those twelvepounders      by genesis burgoyne q from the state of the fatigue of the troops when they arrived at saratoga do you apprehend they could have continued their march though there had been no artillery  a the army was certainly very much fatigued i believe they could have got but very little further they certainly were not in a state for a long march      by general burgoyne q if the battle expected at saratoga had been on the plain would not the heaviest artillery we had have been one of our best dependencies  a it certainly would it would have given us a manifest superiority in that particular      by general burgoyne q if the army had not been provided with the number of horses they had by what means would their provisions or bateaux have been transported in places where the river was not navigable  a the transportation of the bateaux and provisions could not certainly have been carried on      by general burgoyne q were there not such places on the hudsons river between fort edward and albany  a there were      by other members q is it not at any rate a principal object with every army and of a retreating one in particular to preserve their artillery if it be possible even at the expense of some labor and delay and for the use they might be of to them afterward as well as on the retreat  a i apprehend the cannon are seldom abandoned but through absolute necessity      q whether in general you can inform the committee whether the army had a confidence in the general  a they certainly had a confidence in the general and i do not believe that they have altered their opinion      q did the army then in general and the officers in particular entertain a favorable opinion of the generals conduct capacity and attachment to them in the various scenes in which he was engaged and more particularly on very trying occasions  a i dont recollect that any officer with whom i have had conversation has ever expressed himself in different terms and i believe there never was an army more deservedly pleased with the conduct of their general    0 q whether the army expressed any dissatisfaction at the generals return home that is whether they thought he came with any purposes not friendly to them or looked on themselves as deserted by him  a i was not with the army when general burgoyne came away but i have conversed with many officers who have come from it and they express no dissatisfaction on that head much less looked on or considered general burgoynes intentions as inimical to them      q what was the state of the american artillery and how was it served  a except on a few occasions i do not remember their having made much use of their cannon i thought on those occasions that they served them slowly but not ill      q whether all circumstances considered at the time of the affair of saratoga the retreat of the army was practicable either with or without artillery  a i thought it was impracticable      q whether after the convention at saratoga you went to albany  a yes      q whether you had any opportunity of observing the nature of the country if it was strong or woody clear or open  a very strong and woody and a great number of hills      q what was the distance  a i dont exactly recollect about thirtytwo miles      q was the situation of albany a strong situation or was it commanded by hills round it  a the situation of albany was in a bottom very much commanded      q if the army had penetrated to albany from whence might they have drawn their subsistence if the country had been against them  a i dont know enough of the country to answer that question      q must they not have drawn their subsistence from new york  a i apprehend so if they were not masters of the mohawk country      q had you any opportunity of observing the extent of clear or cultivated country round albany  a i cannot very justly describe it not having gone out of the town of albany from the time i came into it till i embarked for new york    0 q do you think that circumstanced as the army was after the engagement of the   th of september it would have been more advantageous to have returned than to have stayed and fortified the camp  a as matters have turned out it certainly might but i believe no one thought so at that time  withdrew  major forbes called in and examined by general burgoyne   q was you major of the  th regiment and present with that regiment in the action near fort anne  a i was    q what was the behavior of the enemy on that occasion  a at half past ten in the morning they attacked us in front with a heavy and welldirected fire a large body of them passed the creek on the left fired from a thick wood across the creek on the left flank of the regiment they then began to recross the creek and attack us in the rear we then found it necessary to change our ground to prevent the regiments being surrounded we took post on the top of a high hill to our right as soon as we had taken post the enemy made a very vigorous attack which continued for upwards of two hours and they certainly would have forced us had it not been for some indians that arrived and gave the indian whoop which we answered with three cheers the rebels soon after that gave way    q what command had you on the   th of september  a i commanded the picquets of the british    q was you attacked on the march and with what degree of vigor  a i was attacked with great vigor from behind railed fences and a house by a body of riflemen and light infantry    q was you wounded in that affair  a very early in the day    q do you remember general burgoyne bringing up the british line to support you and forming at the first opening of the wood  a i do    q did general frasers corpse arrive precisely in time to occupy the heights on the right of the british line when the action began  a it did and two companies of light infantry came to my support    q where did general burgoyne post the  th regiment  a as soon as they came out of the wood they filed off to the right and were drawn off at a small distance from the left of general frasers corpse with orders to occupy two houses one company in each and defend them to the last extremity    q had you an opportunity in that situation to observe the stress of the action  a i had while we remained in that position   0 q what was the progress of it  a the twentyfirst and sixtysecond regiments were drawn up on our left and were attacked about three oclock on the same ground where the picquets had been attacked about that time i heard a great deal of firing to my right with the advanced corpse an officer came up to general burgoyne and acquainted him that the enemy were endeavoring to turn the left of the sixtysecond regiment on which he dispatched an aiddecamp with orders to the twentieth regiment to form on the left of the sixtysecond immediately after some companies of the light infantry came to occupy the ground the ninth were drawn up on the ninth were then ordered behind a deep ravine to form a corpsdereserve i saw nothing of the action after that     q what was the strength of the ninth regiment on that day before they sustained any loss  a on the   th of the month the weekly return was given in and to the best of my recollection they were two hundred and fifty and odd rank and file fit for duty     q what was the strength of the other regiments in the british line  a i cannot speak with any certainty as i did not see the returns but on talking with different commanding officers the four british regiments were about one thousand one hundred and the advanced corpse about one thousand two hundred     q where was the twentyfourth regiment  a with the advanced corpse     q where was the fortyseventh regiment  a six companies of the fortyseventh regiment that were with that army were employed as a guard to the bateaux and provisions and two with the advanced corpse     q where were the other two companies of that regiment left  a one at fort george and another on an island in lake george     q of the eleven hundred which composed the line on that day do you know how many were lost and disabled in the action  a i have heard the surgeon of the hospital say that there were more than five hundred of the whole in the hospital but i cannot speak to how many of the line     q can you say how many were killed  a i cannot     q can you say how many officers were killed and wounded  a i cannot immediately     q were the british troops in a condition to have attacked an enemy in intrenchments after the action  a after the action of the   th i went to the hospital to get my wounds dressed and did not join the regiment till the  th of october i cannot therefore give an opinion of my own but i have heard several officers say they did not think it would have been prudent or right from the loss they had sustained the day before   0 q did the regiments begin to be increased in their strength from the recovered men to any considerable degree in less than eight or ten days  a not that i know of i was at the hospital at the time     q being in the hospital had you occasion to know that the regiments were stronger from the receipt of their recovered men on the  th of october than they were at any time between the   th of september and that day  a i know that several men were discharged from the hospitals so far recovered as to enable them to do their duty     q at what time did the troops arrive at saratoga  a about eight oclock at night on the  th     q do you know how long the troops had then been under arms and without repose or regular refreshment  a from the  th in the morning     q had they been in action or in continual expectation of action during that whole time  a i was in the front of the army and i heard a great deal of firing in the rear and we constantly expected and looked for an attack     q did the battery of the enemy on the other side of the river at saratoga command the fort on that river  a it did     q was the ground such on our side as would have enabled our artillery to have silenced that battery  a it did not appear to me that it could     q had the passage of the ford been effected and the army have proceeded toward fort edward on the east side of the river must they not necessarily have passed batten hill  a undoubtedly     q do you remember the ford at battenhill  a yes     q would it have been possible for the army to have passed that ford without artillery to cover them and the enemy posted on the other side  a certainly not i had an opportunity of seeing the twentieth regiment pass that ford without an enemy to oppose them and they took a considerable time owing to the depth of the water the rapidity of the current and the stones being remarkable slippery so that several of them fell into the river   0 q was you present at all the councils of war to which the field officers of the army were called at saratoga  a i was     q do you remember whether general burgoyne stated the difficulties of the time and that he mentioned his readiness to undertake any measure they should think for the honor of the british arms  a i do remember it     q was the council unanimous to treat with the enemy on honorable terms  a they were     q when the first terms proposed by general gates were read to them were they unanimous to reject them  a they were     q after it was decided by a majority of the council that the treaty could not be suspended without breach of faith were not the council then unanimous to sign it on that day  a as the majority of the council had given it as their opinion that the public faith was pledged the council thought that there was no time to be lost and that it ought to be signed immediately    examined by other members of the committee and by general burgoyne occasionally    q do you know or apprehend that the rebel camp was completely entrenched on the   th of september  a i dont know     q had you any reason to believe from information that they completed their entrenchments afterward  a i understood they had  i dont speak from authority     q had you reason to think that the rebels received considerable reinforcements between the   th of september and the  th of october  a i did not hear that they had     q supposing the rebels to have received reinforcements could any accession of strength to our army from the recovery of any number you can suppose of the  00 that were in the hospital be equal to a reinforcement of even  00 men received by the enemy  a i cannot take upon me to say     q from being in the hospital yourself how many of the  00 do you judge joined the army  a i cannot pretend to say   0 q do you judge in your own opinion putting all the circumstances you can together whether the enemy were more likely to be forced on the  0th of september or a day or two after than on the  th of october  a it is impossible for me to judge  i did not know their strength on the   th of september or what reinforcements they received before the  th of october     q did you apprehend the army might have made their retreat good to canada immediately after the action of the   th of september  a that depended entirely on circumstances     q judging from the circumstances you then knew what is your opinion  a i was not more acquainted with the circumstances of the   th of september than with those of the  th of october     q if the army had had three weeks more provisions when they began their retreat would not that have been a material circumstance to them toward making good their retreat  a the army could have defended themselves longer in their entrenchments at saratoga if they had had more provisions     by general burgoyne q had you known immediately after the action of the   th of september that a letter had been received from sir henry clinton mentioning his intention to attack the highlands about that time would you have thought either a retreat or an immediate attack on the enemy advisable  a certainly not     by other members q do you know whether a council of war was called on the  0th of september or immediately after the engagement of the   th of september  a i dont know that there was  q did the army in which you served in its approach to albany expect a cooperation from sir william how on the north river  a we did     q do you believe if the army under sir william how instead of going by sea up the chesapeak to philadelphia had operated upon the north river to effect a junction with general burgoynes army considering also the panic that prevailed after the taking of ticonderoga that the army under general burgoyne would have been made prisoners  a i should think not     q did you expect any great oppostion from the rebel army after the taking ticonderoga  a i did not     q upon what grounds did you so positively expect a cooperation with sir william howes army  a from general burgoynes orders   0 q did you ever see general burgoynes orders  a every day during the campaign     q by what orders of general burgoyne did you expect a cooperation  a early in october general burgoyne gave it out in orders that there were powerful armies of the kings then cooperating with ours     q did not those orders give spirits to general burgoynes army  a situated as our army was every prospect of reinforcement must certainly give us spirits     q did you ever hear of any cooperation before those orders of general burgoynes in october  a it was generally talked of in the army but not by authority     q whether if the operations of sir henry clinton on the north river had taken place in time it would not have been looked on as a very advantageous cooperation with general burgoynes army  a it might have been attended with very good consequences     q what situation in general and particularly with regard to provisions was general burgoynes army in at the time you mentioned those encouraging hopes of cooperation in his orders  a the army was put on short allowance at that time     q whether in military affairs a powerful diversion if well executed is not known often to answer very effectually the purposes of cooperation  a certainly very good effects have accrued from powerful diversions     q if there had been a council of war on the  0th of september or immediately after the engagement of the   th should you have known of it  a i think i must have heard of it     q whether considering the circumstances of sir william howes having carried his army to chesapeak bay you supposed or ever heard it supposed that sir henry clinton would have attempted his operations up the north river sooner than he did or previous to the arrival of his reinforcement from europe  a not knowing sir henry clintons strength or his orders nor the force the enemy had to oppose him it is impossible for me to answer that question     q what effect had it on the spirits of general burgoynes army when they found there was to be no cooperation between that army and the army of sir william how  a we never knew but that there was to be a cooperation  withdrew  captain bloomfield of the artillery called in and examined by general burgoyne   q in what capacity did you serve in the campaign in america in      and       a i was major of brigade of the royal artillery    q was you employed by general phillips on your return to england after the campaign of      to solicit a further supply of artillery for the service of the ensuing campaign  a on my leaving general phillips at st johns in the month of november      i was charged with a letter to sir guy carleton wherein he recommended it to make a demand of a further supply of artillery and stores for the complete equipment of an additional number of gunboats for the service of lake champlain in the ensuing campaign and likewise for the boats themselves to be sent out in framework sir guy carleton on perusing the letter disapproved of the boats being sent out but approved of the demand of the stores and artillery agreeable to general phillipss request and they were accordingly sent out in the beginning of the year         q at what time did you join the army in the campaign of       a i joined the army at ticonderoga on the   d of july    q did you live in the family of general phillips and had you occasion to know his sentiments respecting the artillery department  a i did chiefly live with the general and had frequent occasion to know his sentiments on the subject of the artillery in the course of my duty as brigademajor    q did you know or had you reason to believe that the proportion of artillery employed that campaign was according to the opinion and recommendation of general phillips  a i can have no doubt but that an officer of general phillipss rank and extensive experience must have determined that point    q what was the distribution of the artillery after the enemy evacuated ticonderoga  a the light brigade of artillery proceeded with the army by the way of skenesborough the park brigade and stores were conveyed across lake george in bateaux    q was not a considerable portion of artillery of the heaviest kind either left at st johns sent back from ticonderoga or disposed of in vessels  a it was there were left at ticonderoga six heavy twelvepounders one light twelvepounder four light threepounders four royal mortars and twelve cohorns left on board the royal george two heavy twentyfourpounders two thirteeninch mortars two teninch mortars four eightinch mortars four royal mortars and eight cohorns sent back to st johns in the radau fourteen heavy twentyfourpounders two eightinch howitzers left at fort george four medium twelvepounders two light sixpounders two eightinch howitzers two royal howitzers with colonel st legers expedition to fort stanwix were sent two light sixpounders two light threepounders four cohorns left at st johns four light sixpounders five light threepounders four cohorn mortars that was the distribution of artillery that remained after the army had quitted fort george the quantity of artillery brought forward with the army were four medium twelvepounders two light twentyfourpounders eighteen light sixpounders six light threepounders two eighteeninch howitzers four royal howitzers two eightinch mortars four royal mortars    q was not that park artillery though consisting of some twentyfourpounders and some twelve pounders properly field artillery  a they certainly were and have ever been considered as such on all field services heavy artillery is of a distinct nature and considerably heavier than guns of the same calibre which we had in the army    q have you ever known a less proportion than the brigaded artillery which was attached to the line and to the advanced corpse allotted to the same number of troops  a the proportion of field artillery certainly should vary both in quantity and nature according to the variety of circumstances under which the army is to act the usual allotment of light field pieces are two to each battalion and from a calculation of the number and strength of general burgoynes army i do not conceive that our light field artillery exceeded that proportion   0 q what do you apprehend was the proposed use of artillery in the country in which we were to act  a to dislodge the enemy from such posts as every where present themselves in that part of the country and from which it may be impossible to dislodge them without artillery of a more considerable calibre than light sixpounders     q do you remember the position which the enemy evacuated at schuylers island  a i do perfectly     q had that position been maintained would not artillery of the heaviest nature we had have been particularly serviceable  a provided the post could not have been turned and the enemy had made use of every advantage which the ground gave them i have no doubt but the park artillery would have been absolutely necessary     q had the passage of the hudsons river or of batten kill been disputed would artillery of that nature have been serviceable  a doubtless it would     q had the enemy taken a position at the forks of the mohawk river would artillery of that nature have been serviceable  a from the imperfect manner in which i saw that ground it appeared capable of being made extremely defensible and of course that sort of artillery would have been serviceable     q had the army reached albany and it had been found expedient to fortify a camp there for the winter would artillery of that nature have been necessary  a there can be no doubt of it     q what do you apprehend to be the chief use of howitzers and small mortars in the field  a i apprehend they are of infinite service against all kinds of log work abbaties and against entrenchments the small mortars are particularly useful against redoubts and other works where the enemy are confined within a small space     q are not log works a species of fortification peculiar to that country  a i never saw any elsewhere     q was the carrying forward the artillery from lake george to the place where the army crossed the hudsons river any impediment to the transport of provisions  a the transport of our artillery and stores were constantly made by horses attached to our department and therefore i do not conceive it did in any manner interfere with the transport of provisions  i mean to confine myself in this answer to the transport from fort george to the hudsons river for after crossing the river we had some oxen and horses attached to the service of the artillery which i believe were before employed in bringing forward provisions and bateaux     q what time did it take to bring forward the park artillery from fort george to the bridge of boats over the hudsons river  a the light brigade and the artillery of the park with their proper proportion of stores and ammunition had their horses carriages and drivers constantly attached to them it therefore required no more time to carry those stores than was necessary for the carriages themselves to pass from fort george to the hudsons river but with respect to the reserve which was afterward transported by water in bateaux i believe two days with all our carriages would easily have conveyed them to the hudsons river   0 q do you remember the position of the kings troops from the time of the attack on the   th of september to the attack on the  th of october  a yes     q had the army made a movement to gain the left of the enemys entrenchments without previously constructing redoubts on the heights that commanded the plain would not the bateaux provisions and hospital have been left open to an attack from the enemys right  a they would have been left exposed undoubtedly     q were not the largest guns we had the properest pieces of artillery for those redoubts  a i think it was a service that was exactaly adapted to them     q do you remember the disposition made by general burgoyne on the  th of october  a i do     q at what time was you wounded in that attack  a i believe in about twenty minutes after it commenced     q what circumstance of the action did you observe before you was wounded particularly respecting the artillery and the enemys advancing under the fire of the artillery and what happened to the troops posted immediately on the left of the artillery  a the ground on which the artillery was posted was a clear spot in a great measure surrounded by woods the skirts of which on our left was distant about two hundred yards where the attack first began the two medium twelvepounders were posted on a small eminence nearly in the center of this cleared spot between the german picquets and a detachment of the hesse hanau regiment on the enemys column approaching the fire of the twelvepounders and the four sixes was immediately directed toward the enemys column notwithstanding which they drew up along the skirts of the wood behind trees and after driving in the germans kept a pretty warm fire of musketry on the guns and the troops posted about them soon after this i heard a firing on the right toward a cleared spot separated from us by a wood on which the light infantry were posted on very commanding ground on their retreating as also the twentyfourth regiment who was drawn up in the wood on our right the enemy made their appearance on an eminence on our right and cut off the retreat of the artillery  at this moment i received my wound and therefore can give no farther account of the circumstances of that days action    examined by other members of the committee    q what was the number of horses in general employed for the artillery after the march from ticonderoga  a the whole number of horses detached with the british artillery previous to the passing the hudsons river was about four hundred     q how many would have been necessary for the field pieces attached to the battalions only  a eighteen sixpounders at four horses each six threepounders at three horses each and two royal howitzers at three horses each the remainder were for park artillery ammunition and stores of all kinds to accommodate the army on its march     q was the forage for these horses procured in the country on their march or brought from a distance  a a quantity of oats was brought forward from canada but with respect to other forage they were under the necessity of collecting it in the neighborhood of the encampment     q how many wagons might the bringing on that quantity of oats employ  a i believe the quantity of oats after passing fort edward was so trifling that i dont believe it loaded one wagon   0 q after the army arrived at fort edward did any delay or not arise to its forward progress from bringing on the park artillery waiting for horses and drivers for that purpose or to provide forage  a the park artillery remained at fort edward no longer than was necessary during the time the army remained in that neighborhood i do not know of any delay whatever from the want of horses and drivers had the park artillery moved forwards sooner no end could have been answered by it before the bridge was thrown over the hudsons river     q were there any gunboats sent out to quebec for the campaign       a there were     q were there a sufficient number sent out in your opinion  a it appeared that the naval force was superior to that of the rebels from the event of that engagement and therefore i conclude that for the uses of that campaign there were a sufficient number     q did you apprehend before the event of the action on the lakes that the number was sufficient and went out in time  a we had received very exaggerated accounts of the rebel force on the lakes and therefore uncommon exertions were used to render our force as formidable as possible and probably some time was lost and the campaign in some degree retarded from that circumstance     q would the campaign have been retarded so long if a greater number of gunboats had been sent out  a certainly not     q what number of artificers were sent to canada for the campaign in       a i dont immediately recollect the exact number but i think colonel christie engaged about two hundred i know of no others being sent out     q do you know of more being asked for by the artillery or engineers as necessary for the campaign  a i did hear of some such intention but at this distance of time i cannot particularly answer that question     q whether the number of artificers sent out for that campaign were in any degree sufficient for the purpose of carrying it on  a certainly not we were under the necessity of collecting all the artificers that could be met with in canada for the armament of st johns only most of the bateaux being built by private contract     q were not the operations of that campaign considerably retarded for want of the number of artificers that were asked for and not granted  a had the number of artificers been greater there can be no doubt but the work would have gone on much faster with respect to the artificers being demanded i have already said i do not recollect the number     q were there not horses necessary for conveying the stores and ammunition necessary for the field train and how many  a the best answer to that question will i apprehend be a state of the number of horses actually attached to the several brigades of artillery since the allotment of stores and ammunition were exactly proportioned to the number of pieces which they accompanied  answer interrupted going into the detail  the brigade attached to the advanced corpse of light artillery consisted of eightyfive     0 q how many horses might have been spared if the heavy park of artillery had not attended the army  a it would have made a difference of two hundred and thirtyseven horses     q was the army furnished with carts to have employed those two hundred and thirtyseven horses  a i really cannot answer that question of my own knowledge  withdrew  jovis  o die junii      lieutenant colonel kingston called in and examined by general burgoyne   q in what capacity did you act in the campaign of       a as deputy adjutant general of the province of quebec i acted as adjutant general of the army under general burgoyne and also as secretary to general burgoyne    q did not that double capacity and the confidence with which general burgoyne treated you lead you to the knowledge of the material circumstances attending that campaign  a i looked on myself to be in the entire confidence of the general    q did general burgoyne give any orders for the augmentation of artillery destined for this expedition after his arrival in canada  a there was no such order went through me nor did i hear of any such order being given    q have you reason to believe that the proportion of artillery employed was according to the opinion and recommendation of major general phillips  a i believe general burgoyne had the greatest confidence in general phillipss knowledge and abilities and i believe the proportion of artillery to have been arranged between general phillips and sir guy carleton because i dont know of any directions given by general burgoyne upon that head    q what were the orders given at the opening of the campaign respecting the encumbrances of baggage  the witness refers to the orderly book which he had with him  read the orders  they are the original orders written by myself at the time  reads extracts from orders issued by lieutenant general burgoyne at montreal dated  0th may      the regiments destined for the expedition under general burgoyne are to leave in their respective stores their blanket coats legging and all baggage that can be spared during the summer months the officers are depended on not to encumber the service with more baggage than shall be absolutely necessary for a campaign where the movements may be expected to be sudden and alert the portion of bateaux to each regiment will be regulated on those principles      q were those orders afterward enforced  a orders were issued again to the same purport dated skenesborough house july     reads it is observed that the injunction given before the army took the field relative to the baggage of officers has not been complied with and that the regiments in general are encumbered with much more baggage than they can possibly be supplied with means of conveying when they quit the lake and rivers warning is therefore again given to the officers to convey by the bateaux which will soon return to ticonderoga the baggage that is not indispensibly necessary to them or upon the first sudden movement it must inevitably be left upon the ground such gentlemen as served in america the last war may remember that the officers took up with soldiers tents and often confined their baggage to a knapsack for months together      q have you a letter from general burgoyne to general reidesel on the subject of the encumbrance of baggage  a i have an extract of it taken from the original letter in the letterbook it is as follows extract of a letter from lieut genesis burgoyne to major general reidesel dated head quarters at skenesborough the   th july      je vous supply de fair en sort que lesprit de lordre par rapport a le renvoye des baggages des officiers a ticonderoga aye lieu  les baggages des officiers britanniques sont deja renvoyes et il nen rest a plusieurs quune petite tente et un valise cest reelement pour linterest de lofficier a la fin que je suis si port a cet article   translation i request you to take measures that the spirit of the order respecting the sending back officers baggage to ticonderoga may have due force  the baggage of the british officers is already gone and many of them have only retained a small tent and one cloak bag it is really for the interest of the officers in the end that i am so pressing upon this subject         q when the contract was made for horses and carts at montreal was it the general opinion of the persons of best intelligence consulted that the number was more or less than necessary for the service on which we were going  a in general conversation on that subject i remember to have heard it said that though they were insufficient we might expect to find additional supplies in the country i have extracts of letters here that passed between general burgoyne and general phillips on that subject they are extracted from the original letter copybook see appendix    0 q have you the returns or extracts of the returns of the strength of the army at all the different periods of the campaign  a i have extracts from the returns     q what was the strength of the regular troops at the highest at the opening of the campaign rank and file fit for duty  a the first returns i received on the first of july the british were      fit for duty germans      do      i speak solely of the army under lieut general burgoyne     q what were the numbers of the artillery and the corpse under lieutenant nutt attached to the service of the artillery british artillery     germans  00 recruits under lieut nutt         q were there any other troops in the army that could be called regulars  a there were canadians provincials and indians but i never considered them as regulars because they were not disciplined     q can you state about what was the number of the canadians  a the canadians were     the highest number     q the provincials  a i would be understood to speak to the opening of the campaign the first of july they were low then and increased afterward they were then        q the indians  a between three and four hundred it was very difficult to collect what their number was exactly     q was the army ever so high in numbers provincials and indians excepted as at that period  a i believe it never was on the  d of september additional companies joined the british to the amount of about  00 men but from killed and wounded and the garrison left at ticonderoga the army was at no time equal to its first number     q what was the force left at ticonderoga  a the first garrison consisted of     british rank and file     germans rank and file making   0 in the whole     q do you remember the difficulties which attended moving the wounded to ticonderoga after the action at huberton  a i remember to have heard they were very great different propositions were made for the removing them such as biers and handbarrows which were so very incommodious that i remember to have been told that the wounded would rather be left where they were than move in the then state of their wounds by such conveyances   0 q do you know what were general burgoynes motives for detaching general reidesel with a large corpse of troops to the country in the neighborhood of castleton  a i dont remember to have been present when general reidesel received his orders or instructions but i understood it was to create an alarm toward the connecticut to give encouragement to the loyal inhabitants if any such there were and to protect those that were wounded at huberton or thereabouts     q was the removal of those wounded effected long before general reidesel was recalled from castleton  a i believe not for i am not quite certain that the whole were moved when general reidesel returned to the army at skenesborough a day or two before the first division of the army moved toward fort anne     q have you any papers written by general burgoyne between the time he was at montreal and the time he left skenesborough explanatory of the motives on which he acted  a i have they are extracts from the original letterbook see appendix      q are you acquainted with any facts that will ascertain whether on the armys arriving at fort edward it was forwarder in its progress toward albany in point of time than it would have been had it taken the route by ticonderoga and lake george  a in answer to that question i have to say the army by taking that route was ahead of the transport of provisions which for the greater part went from ticonderoga by the route of lake george      first arrival at fort edward and previous to the roads being mended in what proportion did provisions arrive at our camp  a very little more than for the immediate consumption     q have you the memorandumbooks of sir francis clarke  a yes     q do you know them to be his handwriting  a i am fully convinced of it having seen him enter many of the articles in these books     q has there been any alteration or addition since you had them  a none     q what was the character of sir francis clarke respecting his accuracy  a i never saw an officer more attentive to the duties of his station than sir francis clarke and always found him exceedingly accurate in the remarks he made     q are there any memorandums respecting the arrival of provisions at that time  a there are several   0 q you will read two or three  a reads  fifth august victualling of the army out this day and from difficulties of the roads and transports no provision came in this night  sixth august  at ten oclock this morning not quite enough provisions arrived for the consumption of two days       q was it in general understood from the combined intelligence received by general reidesel while he was detached to castletown and that received by general burgoyne from the provincials in his camp that there were many well affected inhabitants toward bennington who would show themselves on the approach of troops and that there was dejection and submission among the party attached to the congress in that country  a i did hear several reports to that purpose     q have you the original rough draft of the expedition to bennington as presented to general burgoyne from general reidesel with general burgoynes alterations and additions  a i have the original rough draft of the proposals for the expedition to bennington but not being present at the time i cannot say whether those proposals were delivered by general reidesel or not but i know of alterations made in those proposals by general burgoyne from a knowledge of his handwriting    note the witness delivered in to the committee the original rough draft of the instructions with a fair copy see appendix      q whether you have reason to know that all the erasures and alterations in that plan were made before the expedition took place  a i believe they were from the reading of it     q do you remember taking this plan to general phillips the day general burgoyne went to fort george to inspect the transport of provisions  a i do remember it very well it was the rough draft i took     q what were general phillipss sentiments upon it  a i remember general phillips and i had a long conversation on the slowness of the arrival of the transport of provisions and he said he looked on this as a very good idea that he saw no objection and asked me if i knew of any     q do you remember showing the plan to general fraser  a i do very well     q what did he express on the subject  a he desired me to leave it with him till the afternoon for his consideration he came himself to my tent the next morning early he expressed himself to me in a manner that conveyed a disapprobation of the germans being employed in it i think i observed to him that since the honor gained by the advanced corpse at huberton i believed general reidesel was desirous of having the germans employed i mentioned to general fraser my ideas of provisions being obtained by that expedition and the army thereby enabled to get quicker on to albany than waiting for the slow transport from fort george general fraser said something about germans which i dont recollect which brought this remark from me i desired general fraser from the friendship he had for general burgoyne if he saw any real objection to this plan to express himself fully and freely to general burgoyne himself that the scouts of the army and the guides were attached to his the advanced corpse and he might through them perhaps know more of the nature of the country than i did and therefore i pressed him to mention his objections if he had any to general burgoyne i think he said but am not quite certain the germans are not a very active people but it may do i pressed him at parting to go to general burgoyne if he thought it would not do he said no and went off     q were not many of the provincials in the army of the country about bennington and toward the connecticut  a i cannot pretend to say they were from that country but i understood many of them were well acquainted with that country     q do you remember captain sherwood in particular  a i do very well   0 q was he of that country  a i understood he was of that neighborhood     q did you ever hear colonel skeene or any other provincial consulted on an expedition into that country express any apprehension of its success  a i never did sir francis clarke told me he had received favorable accounts from colonel skeene and i believe after part of the expedition had taken place     q are there any memorandums of sir francis clarkes respecting the expedition to bennington  a yes     q is there any that marks the distance between batten kill and bennington  a yes it is his handwriting  reads from the mouth of batten kill east for two miles then strike off south east for about fifteen miles to cambridge and so on about twelve miles to bennington       q have you the original letters written from colonel baume to general burgoyne while he was on the expedition  a they are here  he delivered them in to the committee see the appendix      q is there any memorandum of sir francis clarkes marking the time when colonel breyman was ordered to march to support colonel baume  a reads   th august express arrived from sancoick at five in the morning corpse de reserve ordered to march    th august during the night express arrived from sancoick with an account of the repulse this evening of a detachment of ours on an expedition  sunday   th august the general went up to the twentieth regiment advanced on the road to sancoick and met the corpse de reserve the men of that expedition returning all day       q do you recollect what time of the day it was general burgoyne met colonel breyman on his return on the   th  a i think it was sometime between one and three oclock     q have you the instructions given by general burgoyne to colonel skeene on that expedition  a here is a copy of them see the appendix   q is there any memorandum of sir francis clarkes of any intelligence received from colonel st ledger about this time  a there is of the   th of august  reads this morning received intelligence of an action near fort stanwix       q after the failure of the expedition to bennington can you speak to the efforts made for forwarding provisions  a i know that very great efforts were made both before and after i understood that general burgoyne and general phillips had been both at different times at fort george to forward the provisions and i believe subsequent to the ill news from bennington the quartermastergeneral i mean captain money was sent by general burgoyne to fort edward and i believe to fort george to collect all horses and teams possible and to make every exertion to bring forward the provisions   0 q have you the calculation made by the commissarygeneral of the carriages and horses necessary for different given quantities of provisions  a it is here i believe it is the original see the appendix      q did the march of the artillery from fort george to the bridge of boats over hudsons river interfere with the transport of provisions  a i have had many conversations with general phillips and the quartermastergeneral about the transport of provisions and never remember to have heard from them or any other person that the march of the artillery interfered in any manner with the transport of provisions     q about what time did the additional companies arrive  a the  d of september     q what was the state of the army when we passed the hudsons river  a my return goes to the  st of september british fit for duty under arms      rank and file germans      the  00 additional did not join the army till the  d of september so that this return is exclusive of them     q what was the strength of the artillery and lieutenant nutts corpse at that time  a i believe there was very little variation in either of them from the former return     q have you general burgoynes application to sir guy carleton for a garrison from canada for ticonderoga before he passed the hudsons river  a i have extracts from letters of general burgoyne to sir guy carleton the   th of july      and the   th of july      see the appendix      q was there any considerable alteration in the strength of the army between the return of the  st of september and the action on the   th  a there was a skirmish or two but the loss was not material in that interval     q in the course of the service did you ever know any instance of a day of action where there was not some deductions from the effective strength upon paper for baggage guards batmen care of the sick and other indispensible regimental contingencies  a i apprehend there must always be deductions of that sort     q in the service of our campaign was there not a considerable additional deduction for the care and defense of the bateaux and movable magazines  a it must of course make an additional drain from the army     q was not all we had of the fortyseventh regiment appropriated to that particular service   0 a it generally was i believe always so  q these deductions considered about what number do you compute the british line to have consisted of on the day of the action of the   th  a i believe the four regiments of the line engaged that day amounted to little more than one thousand one hundred men on the spot under arms in the action     q what loss did the british sustain in that action  a killed wounded and prisoners rather more than less than five hundred     q can you speak particularly to the loss of the line  a i believe about seventysix killed rank and file and between two hundred and forty and two hundred and fifty wounded and about twentyeight or thirty missing and prisoners     q do you recollect the strength of the  0th regiment when they made their last charge on the enemy  a i do very well i was by general phillips when the orders were given for that charge he was then in the front of the line the ranks appeared to be very thin the regiment were much fatigued with the length of the action but moved on to the charge with spirit     q do you remember general burgoyne going up to the sixtysecond regiment immediately after the firing ceased and the report that was made to him by the commanding officer of the state of that regiment  a i remember it and the officer reporting the great loss they had sustained in the action i saw them and they appeared to be very considerably reduced in number     q do you remember the officer mentioning that they had not above fifty or sixty men in the regiment  a i cannot speak positively to that but in my own judgment they did not exceed that number     q were not both the fieldofficers wounded  a colonel anstruther and major harnage were both wounded and a great many other officers were killed and wounded and the regiment suffered greatly     q to what degree did the men of the artillery suffer in that action  a i think but am not quite certain that the number that were with four guns amounted to fortyeight i saw captain jones who was a very gallant man and commanded those four guns killed and some other officers wounded and i believe about thirty six of the men were killed and wounded i should in justice to the artillery say that i think it is not in the power of men to keep a better fire both of round and grapeshot than was successively maintained for several hours that day     q from your experience in the service do you conceive it would have occurred to any officer to engage troops if he could possibly avoid it in the situation in which the british line was the day after that action  a the experience of an officer of my inferior rank does not lead to much but i should have been sorry to have given orders to those regiments after the gallant sufferings of that day to have attacked an army reported both from our spies and our prisoners to be very near if not more than four times the number of our whole force add to this the country was a very thick wood and the situation of the rebel camp i believe could not by any means be reconnoitred within that space of time     q  do you remember general burgoyne receiving a letter from sir henry clinton the day but one after that action informing him that he intended about that time an attack on fort montgomery  a i do remember his receiving a letter from sir henry clinton about that time it was the   d of september   0 q do you imagine that any officer knowing of that letter would have entertained thoughts of immediately renewing an attack upon the enemy  a as far as an opinion of an officer of my inferior rank goes i should not have thought of it nor did i hear any officer of any rank express such an idea at that time     q from what you knew of the country did you not believe that a successful attack from sir henry clinton during the time we lay at that camp would either have dislodged general gates entirely or have obliged him to detach considerably from his army  a i remember our scouts giving information that a bridge was laid over the hudsons river very near the enemys camp and it was the opinion of some very confidential men that were employed in that army in that capacity and were much under the direction of general fraser that on the approach of sir henry clintons army the army of mr gates could not stand us but would cross the river and go toward new england whether the idea was right or wrong i cannot tell     q did you ever hear such persons or any others express an idea that the enemy would have taken the same measure on our advancing to attack them without that cooperation  a i dont remember to have heard any such thing     q do you imagine that any officer knowing of sir henry clintons letters would have thought it proper to retreat after the action of the   th of september  a i never heard any officer express an idea of that sort i dont know what officers might be within the knowledge of such a letter but i lived intimately with general phillips general fraser and with mr twiss the engineer whether the letter was in their knowledge or not i dont know but i never heard them express such an idea     q did you ever hear any officer of that army though unacquainted with the letter before or since the time express a disapprobation of the measure of remaining in that camp without either attacking or retreating  a neither then or at any time while i remained in america and of course not since     q from your conversation with the chief engineer and from other circumstances have you reason to know that every possible means were used after the action of the   th to obtain a knowledge of the ground on the enemys left  a i had frequent conversations with the chief engineer on that subject i believe his attention was given to that point almost every day and a knowledge of that ground i understood to be very difficult to be obtained     q was not the right of the enemy deemed impracticable  a i had no opportunity myself of seeing the right of the enemy but i understood from others that the position was too strong to be attacked with any prospect of success     q were there not frequent consultations held between general burgoyne general phillips and general fraser previous to the movement up to the enemy on the  th of october  a i understood there was scarce a day passed without such consultation i believe no day after the action of the   th     q did you conceive that the chief purpose of that movement was to attain a knowledge of the left of the enemys position and if expedient to attack them there  a i understood it was     q did it appear to you that the force left in camp under general hamilton was more than sufficient to keep the enemy in check  a i dont think it was   0 q from the intimacy and confidence in which you lived with general burgoyne and general fraser do you imagine any disagreement of opinion could have subsisted between them without your knowledge  a i think i must have heard of it     q do you know any instance but more especially respecting the periods of passing the hudsons river the action of the   th of september and that of the  th of october wherein general fraser expressed a disapprobation of general burgoynes measures  a i do not but i would beg leave to observe that upon the plan to bennington general fraser had expressed a different opinion with respect to employing the germans at the time of passing the hudsons river and after it was crossed i had a great deal of conversation with general fraser he seemed to express satisfaction in the manner in which the troops had passed     q in the action of the  th of october after the german troops on the left of the artillery had given way did you observe general phillips and general reidesel in person  a i was with general phillips at different times and i saw general reidesel more than once they were both very active and exerted themselves very much to form the broken troops and to make the retreat as regular as the circumstances would permit     q what was the last time you saw sir francis clarke in that action and do you know what orders he was carrying  a it was after the retreat was become very general sir francis clarke asked me if i had given any orders to the artillery to retreat i told him that as there was a major general of the artillery in the field who was confessed by the army to be a very excellent officer i would not take on myself as adjutantgeneral to give orders to any part of the artillery sir francis clarke told me that a disposition had been made for a general retreat and that he was going with orders from general burgoyne to bring off the artillery about the instant we were parting a very heavy fire came upon us from the enemy and i have since had reason to believe that sir francis clarke received his wound at that time     q on the day of the  th do you remember the enemy forming a line in the meadows and making a demonstration of attacking us  a i do remember it very well and that there was a great deal of cannonading from the enemy     q do you remember also a cannonading in the afternoon about the time of general frasers funeral  a i think i shall never forget that circumstance general fraser i understood had desired to be buried privately in one of the redoubts that had been raised for the protection of our magazines and stores as the corpse was passing by general burgoyne general phillips and i believe general reidesel and several other officers out of respect to general frasers memory and to do him honor in the eyes of the army notwithstanding his request attended his funeral into the redoubt the enemy were in this instance i thought very defective in point of humanity they pointed a gun or two at that very redoubt and kept up a brisk cannonade during the whole of the funeral service which was performed with great solemnity and very deliberately by mr brudenel the chaplain i never saw so affecting a sight     q do you remember on the march to saratoga seeing a corpse of the enemy at work on the plain of saratoga  a i do very well a working party and what appeared to be a battalion or more drawn up as a covering party     q was that the corpse that afterward took post on the opposite side of the river  a i believe it was the same corpse i saw afterward passing the ford     q after the arrival of the army at saratoga was lieutenant colonel sutherland detached with a command to cover a party of workmen to repair bridges and roads in order to continue the retreat on the west side of the river  a he was ordered with a party to repair bridges and roads on the west side     q do you remember on what account colonel sutherland and the party were recalled  a i believe it was on information given by our scouts that the enemy were preparing to attack us in great force   0 q have you further reason to know that a geneaal attack on that day was really intended by the enemy  a there was particular caution sent round to all the troops to be prepared for that attack as it was expected it would be attempted under cover of a very thick fog then prevailing after the convention had taken place a general officer in the rebel service acquainted me that such an attack was intended and from information i believe from deserters or from their own scouts that our army was exceedingly well prepared to receive them that they would be very much exposed when they came on the plain to our artillery he not only retreated with his command but sent word to another general officer to retreat also the other general officer was his senior but he had taken that upon him from the fear of the consequences of such an attack of which he sent word to general gates who approved and confirmed his order     q previous to the council of war to which the field officers were called do you remember it being determined in the council of the generals to try a night march abandoning the carriages and baggage and orders being given for the delivery of as much provisions as the men could carry  a i do remember such a determination very well     q what prevented the execution of it  a i understood there were such difficulties in getting out the provisions that the delivery of the necessary provisions could not be accomplished     q had we intelligence the next day from different scouts that the enemy was in possession of the country in force on both sides the hudsons river between us and fort edward  a i understood from some of the scouts that we had been accustomed most to depend on that the enemy were so posted     q have you reason to know that the intelligence general burgoyne stated to the council of war on this subject was true  a i was assured by one of the general officers who conducted us toward boston that troops of theirs were in the position that our scouts had given us information of     q did you learn at the same time at what period those posts were taken up by the enemy whether before or after our arrival at saratoga  a i have extracts of minutes made at that time from the mouth of the general officer i mentioned  reads  when the kings army was returning to saratoga a brigade of fifteen hundred men were posted on the east side of the hudsons river to dispute the ford and two thousand men more were posted between us and fort edward on the same side of the river   fourteen hundred more also were posted opposite to saratoga a little above the other party i mentioned before to prevent our passing the hudsons river fifteen hundred of those i have mentioned were posted on or before the  th of october the others i remember very well now to have heard were posted previous to the  th of october     q have you an extract of the last council of war at which the field officers assisted  a the extract is true excepting the names of the officers and the votes they gave i have the original paper with the names of the officers that composed the council and i believe their opinions  the extract produced see appendix      q did you ever hear of a proposal made by general phillips to make a way from saratoga to ticonderoga with a body of troops  a never with a body of troops but i remember to have heard general phillips make an offer which i thought a very spirited one to risk his life in attempting with one or two of our best guides to find a passage to ticonderoga and do his utmost for the defense of that garrison as an artillery officer should the enemy attack that fortress after the convention should take place     q have you the return of general gatess army signed by himself  a i have but i have forgot to bring the original i have the extract  reads copy from general gatess return from his camp at saratoga   th october      for the original return see the appendix no xvi  brigadiers    colonels    lieutenant colonels    majors    captains     first lieutenants     second lieutenants     ensigns     chaplains   adjutants    quarter masters    paymasters  0 surgeons    mates    sergeants      drummers     present fit for duty       i understand these last are rank and file because the others are mentioned before sick present     sick absent     on command      on furlow   0    i believe that the men on command were explained to me by general gates to have been detached from his army in the rear and upon the flanks of the kings troops previous to the convention     q do you apprehend that that return includes the corpse that were on the other side of the hudsons river immediately opposite to saratoga  a i do recollect the name of one of the general officers who was on the other side of the hudsons river included in mr gatess return and therefore i imagine the men under his command are included also when i say one i do not mean to have understood that the other two general officers the one who was stationed with a party opposite to saratoga and the one who was stationed on the same side of the water between us and fort edward are not also included in general gatess return   00 q do the returns to which you referred of our army state the effective strength at the time of signing the convention  a they do state the rough number collected at that time of men present and under arms   0  state the numbers the british appeared to have been   0  germans       i cannot be answerable for the correctness of those numbers as they were taken in a great hurry   0  q can there possibly be a mistake of many hundreds  a i can state from a monthly return of the first of november fit for duty british  0   rank and file germans       there might be people recovered from their wounds who were discharged from the hospital and had joined the corpse or there might have been a mistake in the return just before the convention in the confusion of the army at that time   0  q do you remember what passed respecting the military chest while the treaty of saratoga was depending  a i do remember that it was strongly recommended to the commanding officers of corpse to take sums of money from the paymaster general on account of subsistence then due to their regiments and i believe a great deal of money was so distributed and regularly accounted for to the paymaster general on the subsequent settlement of the pay of the army   0  q what became of the rest of the money in the military chest  a it was taken by the paymaster general to albany   0  q did any part of it fall into the hands of the enemy  a not a shilling that i ever heard of   0  q was any proportion of it lost embezzled or secreted  a if any such thing had happened i think the paymaster general would have applied to me immediately never having heard then or at any time after of any loss having been sustained i do not believe there was any loss suffered in the retreat or after it   0  q was the secret service account during the campaign kept by you  a it was   0  q could you produce the several articles of that account if called on for it  a i have either a copy of it at home of my own or from the paymaster general   0  q did general burgoyne ever appropriate any part of that expenditure to the extraordinaries of his own expenses or to any other purpose for his own use  a never that i know of    0 q must not you have known it if it had been so  a certainly      q were there not occasions where general burgoyne paid from his own purse expenses that in the opinion of others he might have been justified in placing to the public account  a i remember to have been told by other gentlemen that expenses of that sort general burgoyne had been at ought to have been charged in that manner      q what was the nature of those expenses  a they were presents to people who had distinguished themselves and in acts of charity to women who had lost their husbands and other occasions which it was very proper for a general officer to give and very proper to put into a public account      q had not general burgoyne from his situation all the expenses attending a commander in chief  a he certainly had from being obliged to keep a public table for the entertainment and refreshment of officers and others coming to head quarters on duty or business and i know those expenses to have been very great from the exceeding high price of all the articles of life in that part of the world      q did general burgoyne ever receive more than the appointment of a lieutenant general  a never      q was there not a board of general officers appointed at cambridge to inspect all the accounts of the campaign and did not general burgoyne regulate the payment of the battalions by the report of that board  a there was such a board and the payments were regulated according to the report of that board      q upon the whole of what you know of general burgoynes receipts and expenses do you believe he was in his own purse a gainer or a sufferer in the campaign       a i really believe his appointments were not equal to his expenses in that campaign    examined by other members of the committee and by general burgoyne occasionally     q what were the numbers of the effective british at the opening of the campaign      including officers and noncommissioned officers  a i have not those returns but they were sent to the commander in chief and my extracts are for the rank and file      q can you answer that question with respect to the germans  a my extracts are the same both for the british and the germans      q what was the greatest number of provincials in the army at any time in the campaign  a i believe the only question that has been asked respecting them was at the beginning of the campaign they were then eightythree on the first of september they amounted to about six hundred and eighty which was the greatest number they ever amounted to    0 q what do you mean by provincials  a i understand them to be inhabitants of that country assembled under officers who were to have had different commissions provided they had ever amounted to certain numbers      q do you include canadians under the name of provincials  a i believe in the former part of my evidence the canadians were stated to be one hundred and fortyeight and distinguished from the provincials      q was general burgoynes second order of the twelfth of july relating to the baggage strictly complied with  a i conceive it was the duty of the commanding officers of regiments to enforce an observance and obedience to the general orders      q was it actually enforced in such a manner to the degree you thought it should have been  a i am not quite positive whether there was not another order issued afterward      question repeated  a i never had any report made to me by a commanding officer of any corpse of that order not being complied with      q what was your own ocular observation of the quantity of baggage carried with the army and did it appear to you that that order could have been fairly complied with  a i own i dont recollect not hearing any complaint nor attending to it the quarter master general of the army must naturally know more of the baggage than the adjutant general      q do you know what allowance of wagons was made to a regiment  a i dont recollect any wagons that we had to allow      q was none of the baggage brought down in wheeled carriages  a several officers i believe bought wagons and carts of the country people for their own use but i do not remember any of the kings carts or wagons being appropriated to the carriage of officers baggage it might be but i dont recollect it      q can you say in a general way how many horses might be employed in carrying the baggage of the army including officers horses  a i never had any information upon that subject it did not belong to my department and i had much business on my hands      q how was the regimental baggage carried  a i believe chiefly in bateaux    0 q how was it carried when there was no watercarriage  a i cannot speak to that point having had no information on that subject and when i speak of bateaux i speak generally having had no information on the subject      q can you say in a general way how many women attended the army  a i had really so much to do that i had not much leisure to pay much attention to the ladies and i know very little of their beauty or their numbers      q would not the feeding of two thousand women be a considerable object with respect to the provisions of the army  a i should have been very sorry to have had two thousand women to have experienced that      q how many women were there if not two thousand  a i would wish to give the house every information in my power when n ca n speak with any degree of accuracy or tolerable guess i have seen the commissary of provisions return and i think the number of women returned as victualled from the stores were very very few      q do you think that a corpse of dragoons mounted would have been of great use to the army  a i own i very much wished those few dragoons we had could have been mounted because though in that part of america that i saw they might not have been necessary or useful to have made a charge i think those light dragoons might be always applied to very useful services      q how many had you of those dragoons  a they are included in the strength of the germans and i really do not remember their particular number      q if none or less of the park of artillery had been brought forward would there not have been horses to have mounted those dragoons  a i believe there might have been horses enough taken from the artillery or from the provision train to have mounted those dragoons if it had been thought more expedient to have employed the horses in that manner but they were hired or contracted for for the special purposes of carrying provisions and bringing on the artillery and never meant by the persons who furnished the contract for the dragoon service      q if a smaller quantity of baggage had been carried might not the officers have spared some of their baggage horses for mounting the dragoons  a i never met with an officer who had horses to spare i know sir francis clarke and myself wished to buy horses to carry our own servants cared very little what expense we were at and yet i could not obtain any      q do you know of any corpse or party finding their way back to canada  a i never heard of any corpse finding its way there and i understood from the guides who were with us previous to the conventions taking place that if that was attempted we must break into small parties and go by what is called indian paths      q supposing there was a small party that found its way to canada by indian paths do you think it would have been possible for an army to have done the same  a my idea of that must be founded upon the report of those guides who had served us very faithfully as scouts upon former occasions and who informed me that we must break into very small parties to have any chance of making our way through the woods to canada and i remember that when general phillips offered to attempt to find his way to ticonderoga it was talked of and looked on to be as desperate as gallant    0 q if any party did make its way to canada do you not suppose it must be that party of provincials that ran away while they were employed to repair roads and that were never heard of afterward  a i remember some were reported to have run away who were making roads and it is likely to have been that party      q when you mentioned the highest number of provincials did you mean that they were all armed  a i know that they were not all armed we had not arms for them      q of those that were armed some respectable persons excepted were they much to be depended upon  a a very great part of them were such as i should have placed very little dependence upon      q before the army left canada was there not a strict order that not more than three women a company should be suffered to embark  a i do know there was such an order issued and i never heard any complaint of its having been broke through i dont recollect the date of that order or i would have turned to my book and stated to the house upon the first question relative to the number of women that were employed on our expedition      q is it not the custom in all armies victualled from the kings stores to prohibit the delivery of provisions to any women over and above the number allowed by order  a it was customary in all places where i served in the last war and very strong and peremptory orders were given on that subject to the commissaries in our army      q do you not then believe that all women who followed your army were fed from the ration of the men they followed or found their provision in the country  a i remember upon asking the commissaries how there came to be so few women in the provincial returns i was told it was the custom for them to be supplied out of the mens rations      q were the women conveyed on baggage carts or horses or did they walk afoot  a i never heard of the womens being conveyed on baggage carts or the kings horses      q if the women neither employed the kings horses nor consumed his provisions do you think they were more of impediment or of comfort to the kings troops  a i never understood from my conversation with the commanding officers or others that the women were any impediment      q if after the taking of ticonderoga there was any doubt in the army in which you served of their being able to reach albany  a i dont remember to have heard any doubts expressed upon that subject meaning soon after the taking ticonderoga      q was it generally understood in the army that it was was well supplied with all the necessaries appointments for war and articles proper for forwarding the expedition to albany  a i always understood that the army had been very well supplied with every thing    0 q do you believe if the secretary of state had ordered the army under general how to cooperate with the army under general burgoyne for the north river with a view to have formed the junction of the two armies that the disaster which befell general burgoynes army could have happened  a if a junction could have been formed i should apprehend that mr gatess army might have been dislodged and that the misfortune at saratoga would not have happened this is only matter of opinion      q do you apprehend that if the army under sir william how had operated on the north river with a view to effect a junction that such a junction would have taken place  a i had an opinion while in america that if the expedition which came up the hudsons river under general vaughan could have have been there about the time of our action of the   th of september that mr gates would have found it difficult to have kept his army together if he had not crossed over the hudsons river toward new england but this is mere matter of private opinion      q if you are of opinion that the troops under general vaughan would have had so powerful an effect even so late as september what effect do you think sir william howes army assisted by all the fleet and craft would have had as early as the beginning of july immediately after the impression which took place among the enemy after the defeat at ticonderoga  a i did not know what force there was under the command of general vaughan nor do i even now know but i should think most certainly that a great army upon the hudsons river near albany would have contributed very much to our making our way to albany      q have you ever considered what were the causes of the failure of the expedition under general burgoyne and to what do you impute it  a i looked upon our force not to be equal to the forcing our way to albany without some cooperation      q where then did you expect that cooperation  a i had no where to expect it from but up the hudsons river from new york and the success of colonel st legers expedition would have been of use certainly      q if general washingtons army had not been diverted would it not have impeded or stopped the progress of any army up the hudsons river  a i dont know the strength of general washingtons army nor the nature of the country between albany and new york and therefore i cannot form any judgment of what would have happened      q are you not of opinion that there are very strong passes or posts on that river  a i found them very strong between ticonderoga and albany and from reports of military men of high reputation in the service i have understood there were many very strong posts between new york and albany      q from whence is the account of the strength of mr gatess army taken  a from a return voluntarily given by general gates to me for my own satisfaction when at albany and that return was signed by general gartes      q have you that return  a i gave it to general burgoyne i saw it today he has it      q was it by consent of general gates that the soldiers after the convention retained their cartouchboxes  a they retained their belts and i really dont recollect whether their cartouch boxes were in general retained or not but talking with mr gates when the kings troops marched by with the accoutrements on mr gates asked me we had been old acquaintance formerly whether it was not customary on field days for arms and accoutrements to go together i told him there was nothing said in the convention that i had agreed to with him relating to the accoutrements and that he could have no right to any thing but what was stipulated in that treaty he replied you are perfectly right and turned to some of the officers in their service by and said if we meant to have had them we ought to have inserted them in the convention  withdrew  review of the evidence its several parts compared with the prefatory speech and narrative and additional remarks and explanations the conduct of lord g germain during the enquiry the noble lord who is at issue with me upon this occasion has in a great measure deprived me of the benefit of a reply properly so called because he has produced no defense his lordship certainly has been accused by me in many instances of a very serious nature if he is really willing that his political and my military conduct should be tried by facts alone i certainly have not shown less inclination than his lordship for that test but taxed as i avow he has been by me with proceedings derogatory to the obligations which ought to subsist between man and man i really expected as i believe did the house of commons and the public to have heard from him some justification in those respects instead of that the noble lord in opening the subjects to which he proposed to call evidence touched so slightly upon the branch of the enquiry in which we are parties that a stranger would hardly have thought there subsisted a dispute between us his lordship contradicted nothing that i have alleged respecting his conduct or my own he stated no circumstance of blame against me except he meant as such the enterprise of bennington which he qualified with the epithet fatal and pronounced to be the cause of all the subsequent misfortunes he passed entirely over the transactions at saratoga of forty officers or more belonging to the convention troops then in england one only was proposed to be called on his lordships part viz lieutenant colonel sutherland of the   th regiment upon parole from the congress and acting with a corpse of the fencible men in north britain but upon further reflection his lordship thought proper to dispense with the attendance of this officer and the only witness under order of the house was mr skene no man was better qualified to give an account of the proceedings at bennington and i heartily lament that the public is deprived of his testimony  claim of g burgoyne to close the cause but although i am thus left in possession of the evidence uncontroverted by the noble lord i avail myself of my right of closing the cause for the folfollowing purposes mode of proceeding first to collect from the minutes which in an enquiry of this nature are unavoidably prolix and disarranged the scattered parts and apply them to facts under distinct and separate heads next to examine whether the facts which from the silence of the noble lord i am to assume as admitted by him are in any respect invalidated by the cross examination of the witnesses by other gentlemen and lastly to explain such circumstances and answer such new and collateral objections as have been pointed at in the same cross examination and were omitted or only slightly noticed in my opening because they did not exist or were not deemed possible objects of blame or cavil in pursuing these purposes i shall consider the proofs precisely in the order of the facts to which they are produced  insinuation of having acted unfairly by sir guy carleton overthrown by his own evidence though the first circumstance i took notice of in my opening viz my conduct respecting sir guy carleton was rather an insinuation than an allegation against me i thought it right that it should be the first overthrown by evidence for while it remained in any degree of force it gave a general tinge as it was meant to do to my whole cause i could not but expect even the virtuous prejudices of the human heart to be against me whilst it was possible to be conceived that in absence of the commander in chief to whom i had acted second whose attention i had constantly experienced and with whose confidence i was then honored i had practiced unmanly and adulatory intrigue to supersede him in a favorite object of command  there are few worse modes of betraying a superior officer to be found upon the records of dishonor and whoever reflects upon the degree of odium with which the most palliated acts of that species have been received by mankind will not wonder at or condemn my impatience in applying my first questions to sir guy carleton to that particular object see sir guy carletons evidence qu       clear as my justification stood by the letter formerly referred to no ii i shall be forgiven for obtaining though with some redundancy a full and satisfactory confirmation of my innocence from the verbal testimony of the party whom i was supposed to have injured  it may be proper here to observe that the abovementioned aspersion to which i have so often adverted and at which i have strove in vain for due terms to express my indignation was not the only one cast upon me respecting sir guy carleton when impartial and candid men revolted at the insinuation of my treachery aspersion from the paper no iii my presumption and insolence a lesser but still a calumnious charge was pointed out in that part of the paper no iii that treats of the force to be left in canada and the disposition of it i am pleased with the questions in the cross examination of sir guy carleton marking the prescribed distribution of the troops etc        0          because that enquiry affords me an opportunity of justifying myself in a point which i have not taken notice of before refuted the posts and the troops which i imagined would be necessary to occupy them were specified merely to show that the number of  000 was indispensibly requisite for the defense of the province the whole of that detail concurred with general carletons requisitions for reinforcement and with my reasoning upon those requisitions and when i assert as i now do that i never presumed to suggest the necessity or propriety of forming a detail of posts thus given for information into precise orders for the general upon the spot i am sure the secretary of state will no more contradict that assertion than he has done any other i have made  no iii when in the same paper i confidentially communicated my reasons for preferring certain corpse to others i was actuated by the same principle of offering every opinion that could conduce to make the intended service effectual apology for specifying corpse i thought it a just claim in an arduous undertaking to have my own choice of the troops and i am persuaded sir guy carleton never took ill of me either that claim or a subsequent one in the same paper of being held free from any imputation of delay till i should be clear of the province of quebec with an unfeigned confidence in sir guy carleton i thought it a precaution fully justifiable to secure myself against others in the numerous and complicated departments under him who might be found less equitable than he is  i know i have before complained of the production of these secret communications but after so many precedents as the last session furnished of withholding parts of correspondences from parliament upon the plea that they might affect individuals the noble lords silence upon those complaints gives me a right still to comment upon the sinister purposes that are to be ascribed to the production of that paper at length rather than by extract those purposes were various but it must be confessed one and only one good effect may result from a review of them viz it may serve as a salutary caution to any officer who shall for the future be admitted into consultation with the same minister how he commits himself by an opinion of men and things  remarkable circumstance respecting the construction to be put upon my orders the next point that i entered upon previously to my narrative was the tenor of my orders and i believe it was generally expected that the noble lord would have taken some notice of the fact i alleged that every discretionary latitude which i had proposed was erased while the plan was in his hand as his lordship had so much commented upon the nature of peremptory orders as a general question in my absence it would have been fair in him to have reasoned upon them after that important and decisive circumstance was laid open  the general opinion of the army upon forcing away to albany the general idea of forcing a way to albany which the army at its outset conceived by reasoning upon the apparent principles of the campaign without participation of the letter of the orders is clear from the general tenor of the evidence i wished it is true to have heard more copiously the sentiments of sir guy carleton because he had full participation of the orders from the temper and judgment that always direct his conduct he declined giving an opinion at the bar upon what might become a question in the house but i have since upon request received his permission to publish a letter from him to me dated soon after the convention of saratoga which is in the appendix no x and with this reference i close my review of the prefatory matter which i laid before the committee  review of the first period most of the circumstances stated in my narrative respecting the first period of the campaign were from their nature to be established by written testimony and the papers no vii and viii in the appendix were added to those before produced for that purpose strength of the army but the returns of the troops no xi are moreover authenticated by the proper official authority the adjutant general and the detail of the artillery by the major of brigade in that department  proportion of artillery evidence of capt blomfield from quest   to   from the evidence of the latter is also confirmed all that i advanced respecting the opinion and recommendation of major general philips for the proportion of artillery employed for the moderate quantity of it comparatively with the principles and practice of other services and for the great expected use of artillery in the country where we were to act  the uses of it captain blomfield from question  0 to    evidence of lord balcarras from question    to    lord balcarrass cross examination quest       had these opinions been merely speculative the intelligence of the persons from whom they came would have given them sufficient authority but fortunately they are verified by facts for it appears from a multitude of evidence that the enemy made the true use of local advantages they fortified every pass or proper post the nature of the country and the necessity of keeping the banks of rivers made it impossible to turn those posts had i wanted therefore artillery i could not have proceeded any given ten miles but at a heavy expense of my best troops when it was found that i was provided with that forcible arm the enemy invariably quitted their entrenchments either to retreat or fight upon ground where they supposed artillery could be least effectually employed i am to thank the honorable member whatever his intentions might have been who by his cross examination placed the expediency of carrying the train i did in so clear a view  lord balcarras quest   lord harrington question   the only remaining fact of the first period to which verbal evidence is applicable viz the impossibility of following the enemy further than they were followed in their precipitate retreat from ticonderoga is established by lord balcarras and by lord harrington  review of the second period march from skenesborough to fort edward in entering upon the evidence which respects the first transaction of the second period viz the march from skenesborough to fort edward i cannot help observing how much of the blame imputed to me has been occasioned by misrepresentation from persons whose business it was to decry my actions mistakes in geography and by uncommon mistakes in the geography of the country by those to whom my actions were misrepresented lord balcarras quest  0 by the cross examination of lord balcarras it must be supposed that the persons who suspected i erred in not taking the route by south bay after the success at ticonderoga did not know where south bay was question    they seem equally ignorant of the situation of pitchpine plains by the question immediately following the former one and it must have been a surprise to the enquirers to find that the route which they were inclined to approve was precisely that which the main body of the army took under me in person and with such effect as to come up with the rear of the enemy and drive them from their fortified post at skenesborough with the loss on their part of five armed vessels and all the rest of their watercraft  but it may be said this part of the crossexamination though incomprehensible in point of geography still applied to the question taken notice of in my narrative viz whether it would not have been more expedient to return to ticonderago and take the route by lake george than to proceed as i did by the pitch pine plains to fort edward  sir guy carleton quest    0 i shall not recapitulate the various motives i have before stated in support of that preference having publicly in my favor the opinion of an officer so enlightened in military science and so well acquainted with the country as sir guy carleton see also the map of country and never having heard a difference of opinion in any other officer of a like description to rest much more upon a subject so supported by reasoning and by success might be construed an attempt to divert the attention of my examiners from points less defensible considerable time gained by the army taking the route to fort edward by land captain money quest   to quest    lieut col kingston quest    i therefore shall only add two short remarks the one that the fact of gaining considerable time by allotting the whole service of the watercraft to the transport of provision and stores over lake george instead of employing great part of it for the transport of the troops is incontestably proved by the evidence of captain money and lieutenant colonel kingston the other that to have reached fort edward with the troops sooner than the   th of july the day that the first embarkation of provisions arrived at fort george would not only have been useless but also highly impolitic because the subsistence of the troops at fort edward before the arrival of that embarkation must have been brought by land carriage through much difficult road all the way from fort anne when on the contrary by remaining in the neighborhood of skenesborough till the passage of lake george was effected exclusively of the considerations of covering the removal of the hospital of huberton and alarming the connecticut by the position of general reidesels corpse the army was commodiously supplied by watercarriage  the next circumstance for examination according to the order of the narrative is the transport of the magazines of provisions etc from fort george and it is highly incumbent upon me to show the difficulties of that operation because if they were avoidable it must be acknowledged one of the principal grounds upon which i vindicate the plan of the expedition to bennington will fail me  but i am persuaded every candid examiner will first indulge me in a short pause the charges brought against the lt generals conduct at this part of the campaign it will be recollected that this is the only part of the campaign upon which the noble lord has laid his finger as judging it productive of the subsequent events the crossexamination had already been pressed upon the same ideas such want of knowledge of the nature of transport in that country has been betrayed so much prepossession of unnecessary delays has appeared survey of his difficulties and anxieties such emphasis of question has attended every circumstance of my conduct at this period that i shall stand acquitted of prolixity if i preface the application of the subsequent evidence by a more comprehensive and complete survey of the difficulties and anxieties of my situation than i thought was necessary before  feeding the army the combination of arrangement for feeding the army might in fact be stated to have extended even to ireland for some part of the supply depended upon the victualling fleet which was prepared in that country according to my requisition before i left london and had not reached quebec when the army took the field the tediousness of the navigation from quebec to the mouth of the sorel need not be again described the next embarrassment was to manage the conveyance for that part of the supply which came from montreal and which was much the greatest without interfering with the transport which with equal necessity was to be expedited up the saint lawrence to lake ontario for the service of colonel st legers expedition and the immense stores then necessarily upon the move also for the winter maintenance of the upper country to these might be added a list of chances and inconveniences incident to the carrying places between chamblee and saint johns the uncertaintainty afterward of the passage over lake champlain and lake george the laborious and slow operations of drawing the boats over the isthmus which divides the two lakes these together make a system of embarrassments and disappointments hardly to be conceived by those who have not experienced them  but although the whole of this arrangement the furnishing the upper country excepted was made under my direction i have been content to date my difficulties from the lodgement of the supplies at fort george and i have touched the other parts only to show more perspicuously the unfairness of judging of an american campaign upon european ideas how zealously soever a general in such an undertaking as mine may be served by the chiefs of departments and much praise is due from me upon that score for one hour he can find to contemplate how he shall fight his army he must allot twenty to contrive how to feed it  behavior of the indians the behavior of the indians is a circumstance too material to be passed over in a review of the anxieties in this part of the campaign i had discerned the caprice the superstition the selfinterestedness of the indian character from my first intercourse even with those nations which are supposed to have made the greatest progress toward civilization i mean with those called the domiciliated nations near montreal i had been taught to look upon the remote tribes who joined me at skenesboroug as more warlike but a very little time proved that with equal depravity in general principle their only preeminence consisted in ferocity lord harrington from quest   to    the hopes i had placed in their wild honor and in the control of their conductors which as i stated before at first had been promising were soon at an end and their illhumour and mutinous disposition were manifest soon after my arrival at fort edward the apparent causes of their change of temper were the resentment i had shown upon the murder of miss macrea and the restraints i had laid on their disposition to commit other enormities but i never doubted that their evil passions were fomented and their defection completed by the cabals of the canadian interpreters rapacity selfinterest and presumption are the characteristics of these men with some few exceptions the acquisition of the indian language has usually been a certain fortune to a man with an artful head and a convenient conscience  to check the old practices of peculation in these men sir guy carleton with great judgment had given the superintendency of the indian department to major campbell and captain frazer gentlemen of the highest integrity the british officers employed solely in the military conduct of that department were also selected with equal propriety the interpreters had from the first regarded with a jealous eye a system which took out of their hands the distribution of indian necessaries and presents but when they found the plunder of the country as well as that of the government was controuled the profligate policy of many was employed to promote dissension revolt and desertion  st luc i take this occasion to acquit monsieur st luc of any suspicion of his being concerned in these factions but i believe he discerned them he certainly knew that the indians pined after a renewal of their accustomed horrors and that they were become as impatient of his control as of all other though the pride and interest of authority and the affection he bore to his old associates induced him to cover the real causes under various frivolous pretenses of discontent with which i was daily tormented but to which i constantly attended and though i differed totally with saint luc in opinion upon the efficacy of these allies i invariably took his advice in the management of them even to an indulgence of their most capricious fancies when they did not involve the dishonor of the kings service and the disgrace of humanity lord harringtons qu last referred to the council of the  th of august was held at his pressing instance and in that council to my great astonishment for he had given me no intimation of the design the tribes with which he was most particularly connected and for whom he interpreted declared their intention of returning home and demanded my concurrence and assistance the embarrassment of this event was extreme by acquiescing i voluntary relinquished part of my force that had been obtained with immense charge to government that had created high expectation at home and abroad and that indeed my own army was by no means in condition to dispense with because depending upon the supposed assistance of this much overvalued race for scouts and outposts and all the lesser but necessary services for giving due repose to the camp the british lightinfantry had been trained to higher purposes they were destined to lead in the general and decisive combats i expected in the woods and could not be spared or risked or harrassed without palpable consequences of the most disagreeable kind  on the contrary i was convinced a cordial reconciliation with the indians was only to be effected by a renunciation of all my former prohibitions and an indulgence in blood and rapine i had not a friend in the department in whom i could confide except major campbell captain frazer and the other british officers their ignorance of the languages and the very probity of their characters rendered them of no weight in indian councils an answer nevertheless was to be made upon the moment and the part i took was to give a firm refusal to their proposition and to adhere to the controuls i had before established but with a temperate representation of the ties of faith of generosity and honor to join every other argument consistent with those principles which i could devise to persuade and encourage them to continue their services  this speech appeared to have the desired effect the tribes nearest home affected to separate from the others and only pressed for permission to return in parties to gather in their harvest proposing to relieve each other which was granted some of the remote tribes also seemed to retract their propositions and professed a zeal for the service but the desertion took place the next day by scores loaded with such plunder as they had collected and it continued from day to day till scarce a man that had joined at skenesborough remained this whole transaction i aver was before the plan of bennington was formed lord harringtons qu last referred to and ib qu    it appears so from the evidence produced upon the cross examination by the gentlemen to whom i am obliged upon so many occasions for elucidating different subjects and the precise date could have been further supported by a memorandum of sir francis clerk but i thought that reference superfluous in a matter so notorious  that monsieur st luc anxious for the credit of his favorite troops and invited by the propensity he found in the minister to listen to any whispered intelligence in contradiction to that he received from the general himself that under these temptations that wily partizan should misplace dates and confound causes neither surprises nor offends me with this exposition of fact i leave him in full possession of his petulancy respecting my military talents and am concerned at no effect of his comments or communications in the ministers closet or in the newspapers one of those comments lord george germain thought proper to state in a speech in the house of commons his lordship gave me a character in the words used by mr st luc in a conversation between them  il est brave mals lourd comme un allemand  the letter alluded to was addressed to me from canada after mr st lucs voyage from england i do not know to whom the duplicate was addressed but he certainly was a person of diligence for it appeared in the newspapers the same day i received the original   except as they may have tended to support the general system of deception which has so long and so fatally influenced his majestys advisers the indian principle of war is at once odious and unavailing and if encouraged i will venture to pronounce its consequences will be severely repented by the present age and universally abhorred by posterity  german troops but to proceed to the survey of other difficulties of the time great attention was due to the management of the german troops  the mode of war in which they were engaged was entirely new to them temptations to desert were in themselves great and had been enhanced and circulated among them by emissaries of the enemy with much art and industry jealousy of predilection in the allotment of posts and separate commands ever subsists among troops of different states and a solid preference of judgment in the commander in chief often appears a narrow national partiality  character of m g reidesel i confess i was much assisted in maintaining cordiality in an army thus composed by the frank spirited and honorable character i had to deal with in major general reidesel  a character which was very early impressed upon my mind and which no trials of intricacy danger and distress has since effaced but address was still requisite to second his zeal and to diffuse it through the german ranks and i studied to throw them into situations that might give them confidence in themselves credit with their prince and alacrity in the pursuit of an enterprise which when its difficulties were considered in fact required enthusiasm  other parts of the alliance though not liable to suspicion of treachery like the indians nor of consequence to be so much attended to as the germans nevertheless had their perplexities the canadian troops the canadians were officered by gentlemen of great condition in their country but were not to be depended upon instead of the enterprising and daring spirit which distinguished the character of that people under the french government was substituted a longing after home the effect of disuse of arms and long habits of domestic enjoyments and this disease mal de payz is carried in them to a greater proverbial extreme than in any other people to whom the term is more commonly applied  it was neither easy to keep these people together nor to support the ideas of respect which the enemy entertained of them from the remembrance of the former war the only manner of effecting the latter purpose was to show them occasionally at a distance but rarely to commit them upon parties where they were likely to fall in with the best classes of the rangers opposed to us perhaps there are few better in the world than the corpse of virginia riflemen which acted under colonel morgan  provincial corpse the provincial corpse of which i had two in embryo and several detached parties were yet a heavier tax upon time and patience they were composed of professed loyalists many of whom had taken refuge in canada the preceding winter and others had joined as we advanced the various interests which influenced their actions rendered all arrangement of them impracticable one mans views went to the profit which he was to enjoy when his corpse should be complete anothers to the protection of the district in which he resided a third was wholly intent upon revenge against his personal enemies and all of them were repugnant even to an idea of subordination hence the settlement who should act as a private man and who as an officer or in whose corpse either should be was seldom satisfactorily made among themselves and as surely as it failed succeeded a reference to the commander in chief which could not be put by or delegated to another hand without dissatisfaction increase of confusion and generally a loss of such services as they were really fit for viz searching for cattle ascertaining the practicability of routes clearing roads and guiding detachments or columns upon the march i would not be understood to infer that none of the provincials with me were sincere in their loyalty perhaps many were so a few were of distinguished bravery among which it would be unjust not to particularize mr fistar who fell at bennington and capt sherwood who was forward in every service of danger to the end of the campaign i only maintain that the interests and the passions of the revolted americans concenter in the cause of the congress and those of the loyalists break and subdivide into various pursuits with which the cause of the king has little or nothing to do   other critical embarrassments such were the embarrassments of my mind added to the many necessary avocations of command purely military it will likewise be remembered that lieutenant colonel st ledger was at this time before fort stanwix every hour was pregnant with critical events the candid and unprejudiced reflecting upon such a situation will check the readiness of their censure far be it from me to contend that i did not commit many errors i only hope to have proved that they are not those which have yet been specifically pointed at and whatever blame may be imputable to me in other instances my late examiners are not justly entitled to triumph on any of their discoveries  expedition to bennington and now for the expedition to bennington as it stands upon evidence  the questions upon the cross examination are so explanatory of the hints which fell from the noble lord afterward that one would almost imagine the hints were originally designed to precede faults supposed it will be regular for me therefore to consider them in that manner and from the whole i am to collect that the faults meant to be established are that i employed germans to sound the disposition of a country in which no germans resided that the mounting dragoons was unnecessary that the range given to the expedition was too great that it was not originally designed for bennington that the force was inadequate  fault of employing germans lord harrington quest  0    lieut col kingston q     to     in regard to the first of these charges relative to the employment of germans it would be waste of time to add to the full answer given by lord harrington colonel kingston has answered the question respecting the mounting the dragoons and moreover it will be remembered that the collecting horses was by no means confined to that service they were requisite for carrying the baggage of the army as expressed in the instructions to colonel baume to the amount of   00 this circumstance may have struck some gentlemen as confirming the idea that the baggage attending the army was of enormous bulk i request a suspense of judgment upon this article till i come to the proper place of explanation and i revert to the part of the charge which seems of most importance viz the extent of the march as described in the instructions compared with the strength of the detachment etc see the instructions and all other papers respecting bennington no iv   it can hardly escape observation what strength to my defense upon this point may be derived from advocates who were not expected to appear in my behalf for i take support from the noble lord himself and all who have believed in his late assertions or adhered to his favorite doctrines by pleading that i undertook the expedition to bennington upon report strengthened by the suggestion of persons of long experience and residence in america who had been present on the spot when the rebellion broke out and whose information had been much respected by the administration in england that the friends to the british cause were as five to one and that they wanted only the appearance of a protecting force to show themselves the ground of the undertaking to bennington supported by the doctrine of lord g germain some criticisers upon the adequacy of the force i employed may desert the cause of the noble lord but will he maintain that a recruit of force from the enemys country was a wild expectation when the recruiters provincial colonels governors land proprietors and popular leaders of the party who glory in the designation of tory were upon the spot and personally interested in the levies he must surely stand forth my advocate in this point or entirely forget the reasoning he held to sir william how when without the advantages of such recruiters against the belief of the general himself unprepared to repair the disappointment if disappointment ensued in a measure of so much more magnitude and so much less real encouragement he referred to that expedient of recruiting from the enemy what he had not strength to supply from the national troops in a letter from lord george germain to sir william how dated may         after acknowledging that the force for the campaign would be short of the generals requisitions is the following paragraph  if we may credit the accounts which arrive from all quarters relative to the good inclinations of the inhabitants there is every reason to expect that your success in pensylvania will enable you to raise from among them such a force as may be sufficient for the interior defense of the province and leave the army at liberty to proceed to offensive operations  the whole of the letter from which the above is an extract is curious and may be seen in the parliamentary register no        this i must insist is an unanswerable defense with respect to the noble lord and those who think with him for it is strict and positive coincidence with their opinions past and present  and if i said it will be so with those to come my prophecy would be authorized by the conviction and triumph which mr galways evidence respecting the loyalty of the americans seemed to produce in the parties to whom i allude  but in due respect to other judges it is incumbent upon me to state a more serious defense  as lieutenant colonel kingston cannot prove juridically that the rough draft of the design which ended the affair of bennington was the same which was delivered by general reidesel and i am unwilling upon memory to incur a possibility of mistake even in an immaterial circumstance that respects an absent friend i am content it should be considered as an uncertaintainty and i drop all use that could be drawn from the original composition it will fully answer my purpose to adhere to the bare assertion which i am sure will never be contradicted that major general reidesel originally conceived an expedition for the purpose of mounting his dragoons and supplying the troops in general with baggagehorses that i thought his idea might be extended to much greater use and that the plan was considered amended and enlarged in concert with him lieut col kingstons quest therefore upon the abstract ground and reason of the measure i might urge that it was supported by naked military principle according to the sentiments of a general of great natural talents and long service under the first masters of the age it is proved that the same sentiments were ratified by the full approbation of major general phillips an officer of similar description to whom the plan was communicated and if a single part of the same plan mentioned to be at first disapproved by brigadier general frazer continued to be so after explanation that disapprobation did not appear indeed the utmost that can be drawn from the evidence of lieutenant colonel kingston or any other witness amounts to no more than an implied wish in the brigadier to have conducted the expedition at the head of his distinct corpse it was the fact devoted to glory and prodigal of life earnest for the general success of the campaign and particularly anxious for every plan adopted by the man he loved he grudged a danger or care in other hands than his own it was not envy or disparagement of the german troops but zeal and impatience for employment that influenced his predilection for the british i honored the principle while i restrained it and i reserved his ardour and judgment for a second movement which required those qualities much more than the expedition to bennington did according to any intelligence or appearance of things at the time it will be observed from the evidence that the whole of brigadier frasers corpse was thrown over the river and actually posted at the opening of the plain near saratoga when col baume marched and the design was upon the first news of baumes success to have pushed that corpse to take possession of the heights near stillwater and to have entrenched there till the army and the provision could have joined by which means the whole country on the west side the river to the banks of the mohawk would have been our own  but moreover it is to be observed that major general reidesel was far from being ignorant as has been suggested of the nature of the country or the professions of the inhabitants he was just returned from commanding a detached corpse at a considerable distance from the main army in the very heart of the country from which the enemys force at bennington was afterward supplied he spoke the english language well he was assisted by many natives of the best information  it is evident that the brave but deceived officer who commanded the detachment was induced to deviate from the cautions prescribed in the instructions a plan drawn by an engineer upon the spot is added to the evidence produced to the committee to show more clearly where that deviation happened lord harringtons q    to    it appears also in proof that the measures taken to relieve colonel baume upon the news of his difficulty were the most speedy that could be used and would have been timely had not colonel briemans march been more tardy than could have been supposed possible i take the fact as stated in his own account without impeaching his credit with regard to the obstacles he describes but as a farther vindication of the intelligence and principle upon which the original strength of the detachment was framed and the mere accident which made even error possible i request admission for the proof of a new fact which i did not know it was in my power to bring till after captain money had left the bar of the house of commons and as i was precluded from calling him a second time by the abrupt close of the proceedings i had no other way of laying it before the public than by stating the question in writing and requiring his authority to publish the answer which i obtained and they are as follows  q do you know any circumstance respecting an unexpected reinforcement received by the rebels at bennington near the time of the action  a a few days after i was prisoner in the rebel camp some of their officers told me that it was a providential circumstance that general starks was coming through bennington with   00 militia of the new hampshire grants to join their main army near albany for the guard on the provision at bennington did not amount to more than  00 men and that on his hearing of a detachment of our army being only four or five miles from him he with the guard and what militia could be collected in the neighborhood attacked and defeated the detachment as well as the reinforcement that were on their march to join them the rebel officers also informed me and i have seen accounts that agree with what i then heard that during the action general starks was luckily joined by colonel warner with a considerable body of men i have frequently heard our officers say that were in this action that had colonel baume retreated four miles and recrossed the river he passed the day before and taken post there when he found by information he could not proceed and had wrote for a reinforcement he would have met colonel breiman coming to his assistance and would not have risqued the loss of his corpse which by his instructions were so strongly recommended as not even to risque a considerable loss this sir is as nearly as possible the answer i should have given had the question been asked me in the house of commons  j money  this piece of evidence will serve to show that it was not the success of the rebels at bennington that animated the militia to assemble and march in the cause of the congress and he must be of steady faith indeed in american loyalty who can suppose much of it really existed in the country of the hampshire grants howsoever it had been affected and professed when he reflects not only that general starks and colonel warner were not opposed in collecting their men though my army then in a tide of success were near at hand but also that not a loyalist was found earnest enough to convey me intelligence  it will likewise appear from this piece of evidence when compared with the map of the country and the disposition of the troops that had not the accidental passage of the detachments under starks and warner been exceedingly critical it could not have availed  fortyeight hours sooner they would have joined general gates and he would hardly have detached them or any other part of his force back to bennington even though he had heard of a movement to my left because he must have known that the whole of frasers corpse lay ready to march rapidly upon him from my right  fortyeight hours later the blow would have been struck and the stores consisting of live cattle and flower with abundant carriages to convey it would have been out of reach  another reflection will be apt to arise in speculative minds upon this subject viz on what nice chances depends the reputation of an officer who acts under selfish and ungenerous employers such men not only withold the fair protection that would arise from an explanation of his motives but are the first to join the cry of the uninformed multitude who always judge by events thus every plan receives a coloring in the extreme and is denominated often with equal injustice a fatal error or a brilliant enterprise  crossexamination of lord harrington q    but it still may be said the expedition was not originally designed against bennington i really do not see to what it could tend against me if that supposition were in a great degree admitted that some part of the force was designed to act there will not be disputed by any who read colonel baumes instructions and consult the map the blame or merit of the design altogether must rest upon the motives of expediency and it is of little consequence whether the first and principal direction was against bennington or arlington or any other district as my intelligence might have varied respecting the deposits of corn and cattle of the enemy at the same time i must observe it is begging the question to argue that bennington was not the real original object because bennington was not mentioned in the draft of instructions a man must indeed be void of military and political address to put upon paper a critical design where surprise was in question and every thing depended upon secresy though it were true that i meant only bennington and thought of nothing less than the progress of the expedition in the extent of the order i certainly would not now affirm it because i could not prove it and because it would seem that i searched for remote and obscure justification not relying upon that which was manifest but surely there is nothing new or improbable in the idea that a general should disguise his real intentions at the outset of an expedition even from the officer whom he appointed to execute them provided a communication with that officer was certain and not remote  this review of the affair of bennington though long i trust will not be deemed misplaced and from the different parts of it i think will clearly be established the few following assertions   st that the design upon bennington was justified by the circumstances of the time   d that there was no reason to suppose the force of the enemy there greater than what the detachment was adequate to defeat   d that when the force was discovered to be greater the ill consequences would have been avoided had not colonel baume deviated from his instructions by committing his regular force in the woods instead of fortifying a post in the open country and exploring the woods only with the indians canadians and provincials supported by captain frasers corpse who were complete masters of such business   th that after colonel baume had committed that error it would have been retrieved had colonel briemans reinforcement accomplished their march in the time they ought to have done   th that the strength of the enemy was merely accidental  and as a final observation i will add that when a minister states a common accident of war independent of any general action unattended with any loss that could affect the main strength of the army and little more than the miscarriage of a foraging party to have been fatal to a whole campaign of which he had directed the progress and apportioned the force he makes but an ill compliment to his own judgment  difficulty of forming a magazine after the disappointment at bennington lieut col kingston q    to    the next class of proofs in regular progression applies to the difficulty of bringing forward a magazine of provision after the disappointment of obtaining live stock and flower at bennington it has been shown by the evidence of captain money lieutenant colonel kingston and the authentic memorandums of sir francis clarke that early in the month of august it was no easy task to supply the daily consumption of the army our powers were afterward in some degree increased by the arrival of more contract horses acquisitions of more oxteams from the country and the great vigilance exerted in the departments of the quartermastergeneral and inspector whose assistants had been augmented  a minute investigation of this operation i am sensible will be thought dry and perhaps unnecessary by general readers  they will pass it over  but there are those who have laid much stress upon a waste of time and who take delight in tracing the small parts of a subject with scrupulous exactness with such it is my duty as a person on my defense to enter into detail and i will lay my ground in the question put to captain money in his crossexamination and his answer  q why did the army remain from the   th of august to the   th of september before they crossed the hudsonsriver to engage the rebels at stillwater  a to bring forward a sufficient quantity of provisions and artillery to enable the general to give up his communication  capt money q  0 and for the general account of the efforts used see the same evidence from q    to    with all the powers of conveyance possible to be mustered captain money computes and his computation tallies nearly with the table formed by the commissarygeneral that five days provision viz four for forming the magazine and one for daily consumption was the most that could be conveyed at once  to bring this to an average i will assume only two days for accidents of weather roads fatigue of cattle breaking of carriages and other common disappointments this is much less time than according to the evidence might be allowed and upon this computation it would take ten days to convey the magazine to fort edward only the stage from thence to the encampment and intended depositary must not be computed by distance but by impediments the rapids of the river and the different carryingplaces have been described by the witnesses and it results that this stage was much longer in point of time than the former one it was not possible to keep the transports going at both stages together for the ten days mentioned because there were not boats in the river sufficient for more than the daily supply nor could they have been conveyed there in that time by any possible means for these reasons the boat carriages which were of a construction similar to timber carriages used in england were only twelve in number and each carriage employed six horses or four oxen to draw it and could any other means of draft for boats over land have been contrived or cattle have been supplied from the artillery or any other department all would have been useless because the boats themselves to a greater amount than those above specified were wanting till after the whole of the provision transport between ticonderoga and fort george upon which they were employed was finished and it had barely kept pace so as to supply the land transport between fort george and fort edward  i desire only an allowance of fifteen days for the carriage over the second stage and it will thus take in the whole twentyfive days to form the magazine alone  i claim no additional allowance of time for conveying one hundred boats at least through the difficulties of land and water in the two stages but comprise that labor among the rest of the last fifteen days it must be nevertheless observed that even this number was short of what was wanting and to save time all the artificers were employed in building scouls fourteen of which were finished during the transport to make water craft in the whole sufficient to carry the magazine forward after the communication should be at an end the new caulking the boats though indispensibly necessary to great part of them after passing the lakes loaded and afterward being shaken and damaged by land carriage is another work which i throw into the last fifteen days of the transport or into the subsequent four days which must at the least be allotted for loading the magazine and arranging the order of its proceeding both in respect to navigation and defense this was committed to very expert naval officers and was matter of no trivial concern or easy execution  the whole business according to the above representation and calculation both which are founded upon evidence would have taken twentynine days twentyseven only were employed viz from august the   th to september the   th the exertions in fact outwent the calculation and i challenge the most minute speculatists to try the time and the powers we possessed by every possible distribution of carriages and cattle different from that which was practiced and i will venture to say none will be found less dilatory  it appears clearly in proof that no impediment to this transport was occasioned by the interference of the artillery but it has been implied by some questions in the cross examinations that if the artillery did not interfere with the transport the transport ought to have interfered with the artillery and that by appropriating their horses to the provision train much time might have been saved  it might be a sufficient answer that the artillery for the reasons i have before assigned was not to be dispensed with and consequently the horses were to be preserved but i besides have shown that they could not have been of use to the transport of the boats and to satisfy every scruple and to show how mistaken they are who suppose an advantage was to be obtained by the employment of artillery horses to convey provisions i now offer to their reflection the additional fact that they could have been of no avail because we had neither carts nor packsaddles more than were in use already  lieut col kingston q   to   inclusive and from     to   0 that the baggage of the army was an impediment to the transport is another accusation clearly confuted by the united evidence of lieutenant colonel kingston and captain money in justice to the officers who are supposed to have disobeyed orders in respect to the bulk of it it may be necessary to take some notice and this is the proper place of the error of making that supposition upon the directions given to colonel baume for procuring   00 horses for that specific use  i believe the lowest allowance of bat horses ever made to an army was as follows to a field officer   per battalion   a captain   do    a subaltern   do    a surgeon and mate   do   a chaplain   do   a quartermaster   do   for carrying the companys tents two horses to each company do    total per battalion     n b this calculation was made upon eight companies to a battalion in which two field officers companies are included  the horses for the five british battalions of the line upon calculation amount to   0 general frasers corpse reckoned to be equal to four battalions     five german battalions at  0 horses per battalion that being the difference in proportion to their strength   0 breymans corpse  00 total for the regiments of the regulars     staff two major generals    four brigadiers    british quarter master general and his assistants    german ditto    the hospital  0 total of staff    irregulars canadians indians and provincials  00 artificers  0 total of irregulars   0 recapitulation of the whole distribution          having thus shown that the transport of provision and other stores for about thirty days was effected in the shortest time possible it now becomes necessary to examine question made whether the army might not have proceeded to albany without stores idea of a rapid march the question which has been very much canvassed in print and by the cross examination appears to have made impression upon some gentlemen whether this preparation might not have been dispensed with and the army have reached albany by a rapid march the soldiers carrying upon their backs a sufficiency of provision to support them during the time  it is very natural for men of all descriptions to apply the idea of a rapid march to a distance of fifty miles for it is not more measuring in a straight line from fort edward to albany and it will be proper to consider the principle and practibility of such march with respect to two distinct periods the one before the other after the attempt upon bennington  with respect to the first it will be remembered that in the state the roads then were and with the resources then to be employed no provision beforehand was attainable therefore to have brought the plan of a rapid advance within the compass of a possibility the operation must have begun by marching the whole rapidly backward in order to load the men with their packs of provisions how the troops zealous as they were would have relished a step so uncommon in its nature and productive of so much unexpected fatigue particularly how the germans would have been so persuaded of the necessity as to have undertaken it with good will cannot be ascertained  but these doubts apart it remains to be considered how the troops were to pass two very large rivers the hudson and the mohawk without previous provision for a bridge or watercraft for conveying large bodies at once every concession a sanguine projector can desire shall be made upon this point also the contrivance of rafts bound together by twigs and strips of bark as in fact was practiced at this very period for the passage of frasers corpse over hudsons river shall be admitted equally practicable for the whole army and in argument be it trusted to chance to pass the mohawk in the same way or should it fail let recourse be had to the ford which is known to be practicable except after heavy rains near schenectady about fifteen miles from the mouth of the river  these concessions granted we will suppose the army on the bank of the hudsons river where they afterward passed it  the idea of a rapid march will of course be exempt from all thought of personal encumbrances provision exempted and the soldier will stand represented in the imagination trim and nimble as he is seen at an exercise in an english encampment  indeed it is necessary he should be considered in that form for nothing can be more repugnant to a project of rapidity than the soldiers load were he to carry all the articles belonging to him in a campaign they consist of a knapsack containing his bodily necessaries a blanket a haversack with provisions a carteen a hatchet and a fifth share of the general camp equipage belonging to his tent these articles reckoning the provision to be for four days added to his accountrements arms and sixty rounds of ammunition make a bulk totally incompatible with combat and a weight of about sixty pounds   but it may be said and with truth that troops are usually relieved from a considerable part of this burden and many examples of this relief may be brought from the general custom of service and from many movements of general howes army in particular  nay more it was a frequent practice of the very army in question to march free from knapsacks and camp equipage the wigwam or hut constructed of boughs may be made a very wholesome substitute for a tent and when victual can be cooked beforehand even the camp kettle for an expeditious march may be laid aside all these examples are admitted but they all imply conveniences for the several articles to follow and to be brought up in due time in our case they must have been lost irrecoverably  will it be argued that some medium might have been devised and although it were impossible consistently with the idea of rapidity to carry forward more provision than for bare sustenance during the march yet carts might have been found sufficient to carry the mens knapsacks and camp kettles and other indispensible articles this supposition would betray a great ignorance of the country from saratoga to albany there is only one road practicable for wheel carriage there are many places where by destroying the bridges over deep gullies which discharge themselves into the main river a passage would be rendered impossible not only for a wheel carriage but a horse there are others where the road is bounded by the river on one side and by almost perpendicular ascents covered with wood on the other here the very short work of felling a few trees would stop all passage the expense of time to remove these obstructions or to make new roads would have brought famine all notion therefore of conveying any articles more than could be carried upon mens shoulders must cease the notion of artillery even the smallest pieces must also cease of course not even a little ammunitiontumbril could have found its way  an easy sacrifice to the theorists who have maintained the inutility of artillery but any officer who has seen the ground of this supposed march would point out a dozen passes not to speak of the passage of the mohawk where strengthened with abattis and such other works as the rebels are expert in making in a very few hours five hundred militia would stop for a time ten times their number of the best troops in the world who had not artillery to assist them  having stated these objections to the principle of a rapid march let us now from the knowledge that has been since obtained of circumstances consider what would have been the certain consequences of the attempt  those who are acquainted with the capricious workings of the tempers of men will not wonder at the difficulty of prevailing upon a common soldier in any exigency to husband his provisions in a settled camp the young soldier has very short fare on the fourth day after delivery but upon a march in bad weather and bad roads when the weary foot slips back at every step and a general curse is provoked at the weight that causes the retardment he must be a patient veteran and of much experience in scarcity who is not tempted to throw the whole contents of the haversack into the mire he feels the present encumbrance grievous  want is a day remote  let the general find a supply it is the kings cause and the generals interest  he will never let the soldier be starved  this is common reasoning in the ranks i state it for those who have not seen fatiguing service and may have a judgment to form upon it it need not be applied to the present consideration for had the march taken place at the time it ought to have done upon the principle of the defenders of that scheme the time that frasers corpse first past the river upon the bridge of rafts waste would only have conspired to accomplish in three days a ruin that with the best husbandry would have been inevitable in six for the same fall of rain which it has been shown in evidence actually carried away the bridge a very few days after it was constructed necessarily made the ford of the mohawk for an advance and every ford of the hudsons river for a return impassable it hardly need be noticed that a flood must have made any use of rafts could they have been timely obtained equally impracticable the army therefore would have become victims to famine without a blow or a single effort of the enemy saratoga must have been the anticipated scene of surrender without other conditions than the mercy of sustenance the whole force of mr gates would have been loose to cooperate with mr washington with the finest season of the campaign before them and the general of the northern army without a shadow of professional defense and precluded from the plea usually so persuasive that he fought hard before he failed must have met the censure of his sovereign and a justly offended country with none to support him but the present advocates of a rapid march could his dependence have been sure even upon them would they not rather have adhered to their opposite and original system for strange as it is the same men have supported both and have asserted that it was extreme rashness to cross the hudsons river at all  if what i have said in objection to the principle and practicability of a rapid march to albany previous to the attempt upon bennington has weight very little need be added on the subject afterward because every objection will multiply upon the mind of the most cursory observer i shall only call the attention to a very few essential circumstances the enemy was in force a proof of his being so is that mr gates quitted his position behind the mohawk which was his strongest and advanced to stillwater the force found at bennington upon the march from the hampshire grants to the main army proved the vigor and alacrity of the enemy in that country the circumstances of the action at bennington established a yet more melancholy conviction of the fallacy of any dependence upon supposed friends the noble lord has said that i never despaired of the campaign before the affair of bennington that i had no doubt of gaining albany in as short a time as the army in due condition of supply could accomplish the march i acknowledge the truth of the assertions in their fullest extent all my letters at the time show it i will go further and in one sense apply with the noble lord the epithet fatal to the affair of bennington the knowledge i acquired of the professors of loyalty was fatal and put an end to every expectation from enterprise unsustained by dint of force it would have been excess of frenzy to have trusted for sustenance to the plentiful region of albany had the march thither been practicable in all respects and even unopposed which nobody will think would have been the case the enemy finding the british army unsupplied would only have had to compel the tories to drive the cattle and destroy the corn or the corn mills and the convention of albany instead of saratoga must have followed would the tories have risen why did they not rise round albany and below it at the time they found mr gatess army increasing by separate and distinct parties from remote distances they were better qualified by their situation to catch the favorable moment than i was to advise it why did they not rise in that populous and as supposed well affected district the german flats at the time st ledger was before fort stanwix a critical insurrection from any one point of the compass within distance to create diversion would probably have secured the success of the campaign  col st legers letter no v but to revert to the increase of reasons against a rapid march after the affair of bennington it was then also known that by the false intelligence respecting the strength of fort stanwix the infamous behavior of the indians and the want of the promised cooperation of the loyal inhabitants lieut col st ledger had been obliged to retreat the first plausible motive in favor of hazardous haste the facilitating his descent of the mohawk was thus at an end the prospect of finding the enemy dispersed it has before been shown was over  the impossibility of preserving a communication was also evident was the army to have proceeded to action without hospital stores as well as without victual the general who carries troops into fire without precautions to alleviate the certain consequences takes a sure step to alienate the affections and destroy the ardour of the soldier  he exacts more than human spirit can furnish men need not be habituated to fields of battle to be convinced of this truth let the mind rest for a moment on the objects which will rise within it after the mention of action and then reflect there is not a mattrass for broken bones nor a cordial for agony and faintness they who talk of these rapid marches suppose no opposition or no suffering in consequence of opposition the hundreds of wounded men to be cruelly abandoned if the rest could be prevailed upon to abandon those whose case might the next day be their own make no part of the consideration of these gentlemen of precipitate imaginations but officers who are responsible to god and their country for the armies they conduct cannot so easily overlook such objects and must be patient at least till a few hundred beds and a proper proportion of medicine and chirurgical materials can be brought up for troops that are to fight as well as to march  the consideration of rapid movement has run into much length the stress laid upon it in the crossexamination was the cause i beg leave very shortly to recapitulate the principal points and shall then dismiss it to the public judgment without great apprehension of having it renewed even in speculation  had a proper store of live cattle been obtained by the expedition to bennington and by the bye it will be remembered that had the loyalists of the country been really of the number and description represented that acquisition might have been made without an action all the carriages might have been appropriated solely to the conveyance of flour hospital accommodations entrenching tools and other absolute necessaries and a rapid march to albany might have been hazarded  after the expedition to bennington had failed of that great purpose had a garrison for ticonderoga been attainable from canada and the force then at ticonderoga been brought forward to establish a post of communication and secure a passage of the river by a fortified bridge and redoubts upon the heights which every where command the river on one shore or the other a forced march might still have been justifiable because a retreat was secure but divested of both these resources a rapid movement must inevitably have led to rapid ruin  having gone through all the material points previous to the   th of september and shown i trust by distinct evidence as well as reasoning the expediency of the march from skenesborough to fort edward the principle of the expedition to bennington the cause of its failure the efforts used to bring forwards the provision and necessary stores and the impracticability of proceeding without those stores review of the measure of passing the hudsons river the attention of the reader will now be carried to a review of the measure of passing the hudsons river on that day  i entered pretty fully in my narrative into the principles which then actuated me and i shall not enlarge upon them i have only to request every man who lord balcarrass quest   and      to     0 to    lord harringtons    to    capt money       and    to    brigadier frasers sentiments has been led to doubt whether i was required by duty situation the voice of the army and the voice of reason to advance and fight to follow the consideration of those principles with a revisal of the applicable part of the verbal evidence and i will then venture further to appeal to their judgment whether instead of being required i was not compelled by the state of things to act as i did even independently of the peremptory tenor of my orders which confident in the strength of my case i have purposely omitted upon this occasion to reconsider  in regard to the point so much agitated in this country though with no foundation whatever from any thing that happened in america brigadier frasers sentiments upon this measure of passing the hudsons river it would be trifling with the patience of the reader to recapitulate and point the evidence to a matter which i do not believe there is a man so prejudiced as now to dispute viz that that officer joined in opinion and impatience with the rest of the army but though the falsehoods so grossly and so long imposed upon the public respecting this matter are no more it may not be unworthy curiosity to explore their origin and trace their progress  progress of the falsehoods propagated it is not difficult to discern that the suspicion of difference of opinion in the army upon the measure of passing the hudsons river arose from the paragraph in my public letter from albany to the secretary of state wherein i say that i had called no council upon that subject but had acted upon my own judgment of the peremptory tenor of my orders  that a man chief in authority should take entirely upon himself a measure of doubtful consequence and upon mere principle preclude himself from any future means of shifting or dividing the blame that might ensue appeared incredible at whitehall the greater part of that political school concluded the profession of such candor must be a finesse and that in fact the general had not communicated with his officers because he knew opinions would have been against him  when little minds think they have got a clue of littleness it is wonderful with what zeal and dexterity they pursue and improve it correspondence and intelligence were not wanting disappointed jobbers discarded servants dissatisfied fugitives of every sort spies talebearers and sycophants whom it is to the honor of a general to have his enemies and a disgrace to office to encourage abounded in town and the primary idea once given it was carried forward by very ready assistance and even logical deduction  as thus  the general declares in his dispatch he called no man into council upon the measure of passing the hudsons river therefore his officers differed in opinion upon the expediency of advancing  to differ in opinion upon that expediency they must construe his orders not to be peremptory therefore he stands single in the interpretation he put upon his orders  if his officers saw that he was unadvisedly and desparately leading his army to death they would certainly remonstrate therefore they remonstrated  the remonstrance would naturally be made to him by superior officers therefore the conclusion follows major general phillips and brigadier general fraser actually made a remonstrance against passing the hudsons river  general reidesel who was next in rank to general phillips seems to have been forgotten he was probably overlooked in the eagerness to get at general fraser on whose name the important stress was laid and for two palpable reasons the one that his name stood high in the public estimation and greatly as it deserved so to stand perhaps it acquired upon this intended use more justice from some quarters than it would otherwise have received  the second and more prevalent reason was that brigadier general fraser was dead  thus then stood the assertion when i arrived in england  major general phillips and brigadier general fraser remonstrated against passing the hudsons river which movement was the cause of all the subsequent misfortunes and having traced this falsehood to its maturity it now may be equally curious to follow its decline  after my arrival in england the friendship and general conformity of sentiment between general phillips and me became more known he was alive and might possibly soon return his name was therefore withdrawn from the remonstrance and reserved in case he did not return to give color to a second falsehood that general phillips offered to conduct a part of the army from saratoga to ticonderoga see this falsehood refuted in the evidence of lord balcarras col kingston etc then kept back but since produced as one of the last efforts of malignity in the course of the late enquiry  the first public occasion that offered was seized by me to pledge my honor upon the whole story of disagreement of opinion being false and i dared any man to produce a letter or a sentence from brigadier fraser or any other officer to authorize a suspicion of its being true lieutenant general fraser upon the same occasion in the house of commons voluntarily and generously entered into my justification upon the authority of his correspondence with his late relation and the knowledge of his general sentiments  the falsehood was immediately so far weakened that the word remonstrance was changed into opinion  brigadier frasers opinion was against passing the hudsons river and thus it remained now and then assisted and cherished when it was very languid by a whisper  that there were still letters to be produced till the late enquiry took place and the evidence of lord balcarras lord harrington colonel kingston etc gave the death blow to the last struggling efforts of that calumny the rashness of passing the hudsons river was obliterated every comment upon that fatal step was suddenly dropped as if the river had sunk under ground the charge with the full accompaniment of general frasers disapprobation remonstrance etc etc was shifted the minister was as nimble as his confederates and exclaimed upon the fatality of the expedition to bennington  and here i shall finally rest the support i have been so anxious to derive from that grave which has been ransacked by my adversaries for evidence against me as a soldier i avow a pride in having possessed brigadier frasers esteem as a defendant i am sensible i have dwelt upon it to a fault the comments of an inferior officer no proper test of a superiors conduct the precedent of a chief in command suffering the comments of an inferior to be a test of his actions requires an apology to my profession it lies in the eminence of my friends character his approbation gave a grace to my defense and i was impatient to confute the calumny that would have robbed me of it but to admit that it was necessary for my acquittal would be to countenance and forward the most pernicious and preposterous doctrine that ever was practiced to mislead the public and to betray the service  when a minister or his confederates lean upon private report table talk and half sentences to depreciate an officer they dare not themselves accuse it is a feebleness of vengeance that in its first aspect is contemptible in the extreme but it calls for our indignation when we extend our view to its principle and effects they operate to the very inversion of due patronage and the absolute extinction of every idea upon which command ought to be bestowed or can efficaciously be exercised they tend to encourage officers to be spies and informers to render camps and fleets properly the residence of harmony and honor the seats of suspicion discord faction treachery and mutiny  the diversity and importance of the matter brought to review in the period of the campaign i am now closing has led to greater length than i was aware of but i cannot dismiss it without one reference addressed to such of the examiners of my conduct as have insisted upon the tardiness of the northern army  comparative view of the campaigns in      and      the reference i would plead is to a campaign in the same country memorable for having been conducted by an officer whose example must be acknowledged at this juncture to be of splendid and peculiar authority i mean the campaign of lord amherst in the year       the great points of the war in america that year were to divide the enemys force and at the same time to direct the several operations with such concurrence that though separate and remote they should assist each other the first objects of the army to which i allude were to reduce ticonderoga and crown point and the ultimate and most important one was to effect a junction with mr wolf before quebec  thus far there is great similarity between the plans of the two campaigns except that the points from which the armies marched and to which they were destined were exactly reversed  in the spring      the army then assembled at albany took the field as early as the season would admit but such were the natural impediments of the country that though supported by the unanimous zeal of the inhabitants and furnished with abundant supplies of draft cattle carriages watercraft and every other necessary the several departments well directed and no enemy to oppose the march the general lord amherst was not able to commence the attack of ticonderoga till the  th of july when the enemy abandoned that post and retreated to crown point  the distance from albany to fort george is between sixty and seventy miles the passage over lake george to ticonderoga about forty miles  the general had reason to believe that crown point would be given up at his approach as precipitately as ticonderoga had been he did not however reach it a distance of thirteen miles and watercarriage at will till the   th of august  was it at that time asked by the minister or his adherents what was the army doing not to pursue a flying enemy  not to pursue when the whole country behind was their own and magazines baggage hospitals and every other necessary might follow at leisure and in security when it was foreseen an increase of fleet was to be constructed at crown point to obtain the superiority over the enemy upon lake champlain and consequently that every days delay in becoming master of that post risked the campaign  although these enquiries were not then suggested to the public an answer to them has been given greatly to the honor of the general in a very impartial history of that time the army was employed in repairing the fortifications at ticonderoga and the general took his measures with the same care as if he expected an obstinate defense and attempt to surprise him on his march  the enemy actually did abandon crown point on the approach of the general the   th of august and as soon as in possession of that post he set about fortifying it as he had done ticonderoga the time consumed in that operation and in building new vessels brought it to the middle of october before the general could embark upon the lake a suspense undoubtedly of great anxiety for the great end of the campaign the junction of the two armies upon which the reduction of all canada was thought to depend was unattained  but did the minister or his adherents then cavil at the tardiness of that army  enterprising sanguine and impetuous as was the character of that ministers councils there was not less energy in his protection the nation not a party were his adherents and his word was a fiat of fame he bestowed emphatic praises on his general and a failing campaign became part of that basis from which he has ascended to the high honors he now deservedly possesses  it would be great presumption and it is far from being intended to draw any parallels or inferences from the campaigns of      and      except such as merely apply to consumption of time under similar circumstances in other points the pretensions of the respective generals may be as different as their fortunes or to make a much clearer distinction and a yet stronger contrast as wide asunder as the auspices under which they served those of mr pit and of lord george germain  observations etc respecting the third period a series of hard toil incessant effort stubborn action till disabled in the collateral branches of the army by the total defection of the indians and the desertion or timidity of the canadians and provincials some individuals excepted disappointed in the last hope of any timely cooperation from other armies the regular troops reduced by losses from the best parts to   00 fighting men not  000 of which were british only three days provisions upon short allowance in store invested by an army of   000 men and no apparent means of retreat remaining i called into council all the generals field officers and captains commanding corpse and by their unanimous concurrence and advice i was induced to open a treaty with major general gates etc  appenix no xiv such was the summary of affairs given in my letter from albany to the secretary of state at the time it was written i little expected to have occasion for any other testimony of my actions and it has therefore been supposed that i gave them a coloring more specious than exact this is the stage of my defense in which i am desirous to bring that matter to judgment and i have quoted the above passage expressly to lead the attention of every examiner to the whole of that letter let it now be considered unitedly with my late narrative and both be compared in detail with the evidence  i am bold to stake my cause upon the issue  and resting upon these references my comments upon this period though it is the most important will be shorter than upon either of the former the proofs also are more collected and the matters controverted or started in crossexamination are fewer  the first remark i have to make is that while the managers of the ministers cause have never admitted a doubt of the reality of those movements in the campaign with the propriety of which their ingenuity promised them even a colorable cause of cavil they have had the address when any little skill and conduct were generally acknowledged to call the existence of such movements into question i cannot make this remark more pertinently than at present when the march of the march to the enemy on the   th of sept plan iv army preceding the action of the   th of september is in its due place the object of notice  a pretty combination of columns and deployments composed at albany and very fit for a gazette this sort of language i believe most persons have heard who have conversed with the dependents or runners of office and it will be my excuse for submitting to the judgment of my profession a plan of the movement it will show in some degree the difficulties that the nature of the country opposed to a combined march of columns and at the same time the disadvantage i might say the certain defeat that must have been sustained had the army been only in one column upon the ground where it was attacked or had the combination of the other columns those of general fraser in particular been less exact to the point of time in which it was expedient they should arrive and form  lord balcarras quest       maj forbes quest   to   lord harringtons quest    to    inclusive to prove that this march was not composed at albany i refer to several witnesses but particularly to the earl of harrington his situation as my aiddecamp gave him a general knowledge of a movement that an officer employed in the execution of a single part of it could not have acquired it will be considered by all who know the qualities of my noble friend as very honorable to the dispositions of that day that they are so circumstantially retained in so distinguishing a mind and for my own part i cannot commit them to military judgment under a better trust than the accuracy of his description  i shall not therefore detain the reader an instant longer from a subject so worthy his attention as the evidence respecting the behavior of the troops in the ensuing events of that day  action of   th sept lord harringtons quest    to    inclusive lord balcarras    to    capt money    to  0 maj forbes   to  0 lieut col kingston    to    few actions have been characterized by more obstinacy in attack or defense the british bayonet was repeatedly tried ineffectually eleven hundred british soldiers foiled in these trials bore incessant fire from a succession of fresh troops in superior numbers for above four hours and after a loss of above a third of their numbers and in one of the regiments above two thirds forced the enemy at last of a detachment of a captain and fortyeight artillery men the captain and thirtysix were killed or wounded these facts are marked by a concurrence of evidence that no man will dispute the tribute of praise due to such troops will not be wanting in this generous nation and it will as certainly be accompanied with a just portion of shame to those who have dared to depreciate or fully valor so conspicuous  who have their ears open only to the prejudice of american cowardice and having been always loud upon that courtly topic stifle the glory of their countrymen to maintain a base consistency  it will be observable from the accounts of the killed and wounded that the loss of officers in all the actions of the campaign was proportionably much greater than that of the private men and as this observation applies particularly to the action we are considering it may not be improper to account for it in this place  reason of the disproportion of killed and wounded the enemy had with their army great numbers of marksmen armed with riflebarrel pieces these during an engagement hovered upon the flanks in small detachments and were very expert in securing themselves and in shifting their ground in this action many placed themselves in high trees in the rear of their own line and there was seldom a minutes interval of smoke in any part of our line without officers being taken off by single shot capt green aid de camp to major general phillips was shot through the arm by one of these marksmen as he was delivering me a message i learned after the convention from the commanding officer of the riflemen that the shot was meant for me and as the captain was seen to fall from his horse it was for some hours believed in the enemys army that i was killed my escape was owing to the captain happening to have a laced furniture to his saddle which made him mistaken for the general   it will naturally be supposed that the indians would be of great use against this mode of fighting the example of those that remained after the great desertion proved the contrary for not a man of them was to be brought within the sound of a rifle shot the canadians were formerly very expert in service of this nature but besides the change in their military character which i noticed before their best officer was killed early in the action which event cast a general damp upon the corpse a few of the provincials were serviceable but the best men i had to oppose as marksmen were the german chasseurs though their number was so small as not to be one to twenty of the enemy  proceedings of the army after the action crossexamination of lord balcarras quest    to  00 ditto of lord harrington  0 and  0  lieut col kingston    maj forbes    capt money    lieut col kingston    to    lord harrington    lord balcarras quest  00 the crossexamination upon the proceedings of the army after this action will show the folly there would be in bringing a military cause to a parliamentary enquiry upon the presumption that any parts of it would be left unexamined the very want of practical knowledge in the enquirers renders them more inquisitive and much more tenacious of doubts and surmises than they would otherwise be for instance i do not believe that with an army exhausted by a long and severe action and deprived of an uncommon portion of officers the question of attacking the enemy next morning would have occurred to any man of professional judgment that enemy too in a position of which no further knowledge could be obtained than that it was covered by an intrenchment and abattis and the approach to be made through a thick wood without any avenue cut or a single post fortified to secure a retreat or to cover the magazine which afforded the only possible means of subsistence  equally remote would be the thoughts of military men from attacking a few days after when it appeared i had received a letter from sir henry clinton informing me of a diversion so powerful as an attack upon fort montgomery to be undertaken as at that very time  the questions relating to the enemy having their baggage packed if that circumstance was meant as an indication that they meant to retreat is another proof how little the questioners knew of service it does not appear in evidence how the fact was but no officer will dispute that if the enemy had not only packed their baggage but actually conveyed it to the other side the river they would have acted conformably to the general practice of service when action is expected and to no circumstance of service more than to that when it is resolved to dispute a post to the last extremity  upon the whole of my situation at that time i am so confident that it was the part of an officer to fortify and wait events that i am only further intent to prove that i fortified properly the nature of the ground and my several purposes considered upon this principle i submit the plan annexed plan no v it will also show the nature of the ground between the two armies and serve to explain the difficulties the witnesses express of taking a view of the enemys left but it will be considered that besides these apparent obstacles to a near approach the enemy abounded in militia which supplied outposts and scouts that could by no means be driven in without making the army liable to a general action  as for any other intelligence than what could be obtained by eyesight it was generally contradictory always imperfect the deserters were often suspicious the prisoners very few i never saw any instance of service where it was so difficult to obtain information among people speaking the same language with ourselves and many of them professing the most favorable dispositions scarcely any could be prevailed upon by rewards or principle to risk his person for the purpose of intelligence  in regard to the crossexamination respecting the time necessary for the construction of the redoubts and other works i neither thought it worth while to contest it at the time nor shall i contest it now though nothing would be more easy than to show that there was a great deal of necessary labor which the questions did not lead to and consequently the witnesses could not with propriety enter into the explanation of them but what makes the consumption of time to me immaterial is that i place my justification upon the expediency of waiting the cooperation from sir henry clinton it is in proof that i received a letter from him the day after the action of the   th the original letter is in my possession but could not be produced without discovering a secret mode of conveying intelligence that it might be improper to make public informing me that he meditated an attack upon fort montgomery as at that very time and as i have already said that i should have thought it the part of madness to have risked an attack upon the enemy in the weak state of my army for some time after the late action and under the expectation of so powerful a diversion so should i have deferred it longer even after being recruited from the hospital on account of the same expectation and the further chance of the reinforcement of colonel st legers corpse and perhaps a convoy of provisions from ticonderoga so far am i from conceiving the past delay blameable that i acknowledge the measure of the  th of october was precipitated by some days by the forage being become so scarce that a supply could only be obtained by a movement of the army  alert situation of the army from  0th sept to  th oct if any persons have supposed that what has been called the inactive state of the army at this period was a state of rest they are as much mistaken as they would be if they supposed it in any other circumstance comfortable from the  0th of september to the  th of october the armies were so near that not a night passed without firing and sometimes concerted attacks upon our advanced picquets no foraging party could be made without great detachments to cover it it was the plan of the enemy to harrass the army by constant alarms and their superiority of numbers enabled them to attempt it without fatigue to themselves  by being habituated to fire our soldiers became indifferent to it and were capable of eating or sleeping when it was very near them but i do not believe either officer or soldier ever slept during that interval without his clothes or that any general officer or commander of a regiment passed a single night without being upon his legs occasionally at different hours and constantly an hour before daylight  lord balcarras    etc lord harrington    etc lieut col kingston    etc capt money    to    see also plan v the circumstances in general of the action of the  th of october stand in that arragement in the evidence of the earl of balcarras earl of harrington lieut col kingston and captain money and have been so little controverted by crossexamination that any length of comment upon them is unnecessary i will only observe that the movement of the enemy under general arnold mentioned in my narrative is confirmed as far as circumstantial testimony can confirm it by captain money and if there can be any persons who after considering that circumstance and the positive proof of the subsequent obstinacy in the attack upon the post of lord balcarras and various other actions of that day continue to doubt that the americans possess the quality and faculty of fighting call it by whatever term they please they are of a prejudice that it would be very absurd longer to contend with  but though comments upon this part of the evidence may be spared the remembrance of what i personally underwent cannot so easily be suppressed and i am sure i shall not outgo the indulgence of the candid if in delineating situations so affecting i add feelings to justification the defense of military conduct is an interesting point of professional honor but to vindicate the heart is a duty to god and to society at large  few conjunctures in the campaign i nave been describing few perhaps upon military record can be found so distinguished by exigencies or productive of such critical and anxious calls upon public character and private affection as that which now took place  lord balcarras   in the first place the position of the army was untenable and yet an immediate retreat was impossible not only from the fatigue of the troops but from the necessity of delivering fresh ammunition and provisions  the losses in the action were uncommonly severe sir francis clarke my aiddecamp had originally recommended himself to my attention by his talents and diligence as service and intimacy opened his character more he became endeared to me by every quality that can create esteem i lost in him an useful assistant an amiable companion an attached ftiend the state was deprived by his death of one of the fairest promises of an able general  the fate of colonel ackland taken prisoner and then supposed to be mortally wounded was a second source of anxiety  general fraser was expiring  in the course of the action a shot had passed through my hat and another had torn my waistcoat i should be sorry to be thought at any time insensible to the protecting hand of providence but i ever more particularly considered and i hope not superstitiously a soldiers hairbreadth escapes as incentives to duty a marked renewal of the trust of being for the due purposes of a public station and under that reflection to lose our fortitude by giving way to our affections to be diverted by any possible selfemotion from meeting a present exigency with our best faculties were at once dishonor and impiety  lord balcarras    lord harrington    plan no vi state of things on the  th having therefore put aside for a time my private sensations it has been shown that i effected an entire change in the position of the army before daylight the plan will show the new ground taken up early in the morning of the  th general fraser breathed his last  and with the kindest expressions of his affection his last request was brought me that he might be carried without parade by the soldiers of his corpse to the great redoubt and buried there the whole day of the  th of october was correspondent to this inauspicious beginning the hours were measured by a succession of immediate cares increasing doubts and melancholy objects the enemy were formed in two lines lord harrington    etc every part of their disposition as well as the repeated attacks upon lord balcarrass corpse and the cannonade from the plain kept the troops in momentary expectation of a general action during this suspense wounded officers some upon crutches and others even carried upon handbarrows by their servants were occasionally ascending the hill from the hospital tents to take their share in the action or follow the march of the army the generals were employed in exhorting the troops  genesis frasers funeral about sunset the corpse of general fraser was brought up the hill attended only by the officers who had lived in his family to arrive at the redoubt it passed within view of the greatest part of both armies general phillips general reidesel and myself who were standing together were struck with the humility of the procession they who were ignorant that privacy had been requested might construe it neglect we could neither endure that reflection nor indeed restrain our natural propensity to pay our last attention to his remains the circumstances that ensued cannot be better described than they have been by different witnesses particularly lieutenant colonel kingston    the incessant cannonade during the solemnity the steady attitude and unaltered voice with which the chaplain officiated though frequently covered with dust which the shot threw up on all sides of him the mute but expressive mixture of sensibility and indignation upon every countenance these objects will remain to the last of life upon the minds of every man who was present the growing duskiness added to the scenery and the whole marked a character of that juncture that would make one of the finest subjects for the pencil of a master that the field ever exhibited  to the canvas and to the faithful page of a more important historian gallant friend i consign thy memory there may thy talents thy manly virtues their progress and their period find due distinction and long may they survive  long after the frail record of my pen shall be forgotten  night march of the  th the reflections arising from these scenes gave place to the perplexities of the night a defeated army was to retreat from an enemy flushed with success much superior in front and occupying strong posts in the country behind we were equally liable upon that march to be attacked in front in flank or rear the disposition of march had been concerted as much as circumstances would admit and it was executed by the officers and the troops in general with a precision that experience in critical situations can only teach the baggage which could only move in one column and in a narrow road fell into the confusion which it is impossible for caution to guard against in the dark because a single accident of an overturn or a broken wheel or even the stupidity or drunkenness of a driver may stop and often confuse the motion of the whole line lord harrington  0 and from     to     care was taken that no such accident should break the order of the troops and orders were sent to major general phillips who commanded the rear guard in case he was attacked to pay attention only to the main object of covering the troops or if occasion were of taking a position to give them time to form  continuance of the march on the  th at daybreak the next morning the army had reached very advantageous ground and took a position in which it would have been very desirable to receive the enemy a halt was necessary to refresh the troops and to give time to the bateaux loaded with provisions which had not been able to keep pace with the troops to come abreast a portion of provisions was delivered also from the bateaux not without apprehension that that delivery might be the last for there were parts of the river in which the boats might be attacked from the other side to great advantage notwithstanding the correspondent movement of the army  the above purposes being effected the army proceeded in very severe weather and through exceeding bad roads  besides the continuation of difficulties and general fatigue this day was remarkable for a circumstance of private distress too peculiar and affecting to be omitted the circumstance to which i allude is lady harriet acklands passage through the enemys army to attend her wounded husband then their prisoner  extraordinary occurrence of private distress the progress of this lady with the army could hardly be thought abruptly or superfluously introduced were it only so for the purpose of authenticating a wonderful story  it would exhibit if well delineated an interesting picture of the spirit the enterprise and the distress of romance realized and regulated upon the chaste and sober principles of rational love and connubial duty  lieut col kingston     to     but i beg leave to observe besides that it has direct reference to my subject to show what the luxuries were with which as the world has been taught to believe the army was encumbered what were the accommodations prepared for the two thousand women that are gravely supposed in the cross examination to have followed with the baggage an idea so preposterous as well as false would have been a fitter subject for derision than refutation but that it was maliciously intended not i am confident by the member who asked the questions but by the persons who imposed upon him to effect by prejudice what they despaired of effecting by fact  not content with cavilling at our pretensions of having fought hard they would not allow the army even the claim upon the goodnature of the nation of having fared hard for its service  i shall however consider part of this story as so far unconnected with the immediate business i was upon pursuing the line of evidence upon the retreat to saratoga as to give it in the margin it may well stand by itself and i venture to think that this one example of patience suffering and fortitude will be permitted to pass without censure or obloquy lady harriet ackland had accompanied her husband to canada in the beginning of the year      in the course of that campaign she had traversed a vast space of country in different extremities of season and with difficulties that an european traveller will not easily conceive to attend in a poor hut at chamblee upon his sick bed  in the opening of the campaign of      she was restrained from offering herself to a share of the fatigue and hazard expected before ticonderoga by the positive injunctions of her husband the day after the conquest of that place he was badly wounded and she crossed the lake champlain to join him  as soon as he recovered lady harriet proceeded to follow his fortunes through the campaign and at fort edward or at the next camp she acquired a twowheel tumbril which had been constructed by the artificers of the artillery something similar to the carriage used for the mail upon the great roads of england major ackland commanded the british grenadiers which were attached to general frasers corpse and consequently were always the most advanced post of the army their situations were often so alert that no person slept out of their clothes in one of these situations a tent in which the major and lady harriet were asleep suddenly took fire an orderly sergeant of grenadiers with great hazard of suffocation dragged out the first person he caught hold of it proved to be the major it happened that in the same instant she had unknowing what she did and perhaps not perfectly awake providentially made her escape by creeping under the walls of the back part of the tent the first object she saw upon the recovery of her senses was the major on the other side and in the same instant again in the fire in search of her the sergeant again saved him but not without the major being very severely burned in his face and different parts of the body every thing they had with them in the tent was consumed  this accident happened a little time before the army passed the hudsons river it neither altered the resolution nor the cheerfulness of lady harriet and she continued her progress a partaker of the fatigues of the advanced corpse the next call upon her fortitude was of a different nature and more distressful as of longer suspense on the march of the   th the grenadiers being liable to action at every step she had been directed by the major to follow the route of the artillery and baggage which was not exposed at the time the action began she found herself near a small uninhabited hut where she alighted when it was found the action was becoming general and bloody the surgeons of the hospital took possession of the same place as the most convenient for the first care of the wounded thus was this lady in hearing of one continued fire of cannon and musketry for four hours together with the presumption from the post of her husband at the head of the grenadiers that he was in the most exposed part of the action she had three female companions the baroness of reidesel and the wives of two british officers major harnage and lieutenant reynell but in the event their presence served but little for comfort major harnage was soon brought to the surgeons very badly wounded and a little time after came intelligence that lieutenant reynell was shot dead imagination will want no helps to figure the state of the whole groupe  from the date of that action to the  th of october lady harriet with her usual serenity stood prepared for new trials and it was her lot that their severity increased with their numbers she was again exposed to the hearing of the whole action and at last received the shock of her individual misfortune mixed with the intelligence of the general calamity the troops were defeated and major ackland desperately wounded was a prisoner  the day of the  th was passed by lady harriet and her companions in common anxiety not a tent nor a shed being standing except what belonged to the hospital their refuge was among the wounded and the dying     when the army was upon the point of moving after the halt described i received a message from lady harriet submitting to my decision a proposal and expressing an earnest solicitude to execute it if not interfering with my designs of passing to the camp of the enemy and requesting general gatess permission to attend her husband  though i was ready to believe for i had experienced that patience and fortitude in a supreme degree were to be found as well as every other virtue under the most tender forms i was astonished at this proposal after so long an agitation of the spirits exhausted not only for want of rest but absolutely want of food drenched in rains for twelve hours together that a woman should be capable of such an undertaking as delivering herself to the enemy probably in the night and uncertain of what hands she might first fall into appeared an effort above human nature the assistance i was enabled to give was small indeed i had not even a cup of wine to offer her but i was told she had found from some kind and fortunate hand a little rum and dirty water all i could furnish to her was an open boat and a few lines written upon dirty and wet paper to general gates recommending her to his protection  mr brudenell the chaplain to the artillery the same gentleman who had officiated so signally at general frasers funeral readily undertook to accompany her and with one female servant and the majors valetdechambre who had a ball which he had received in the late action then in his shoulder she rowed down the river to meet the enemy but her distresses were not yet to end the night was advanced before the boat reached the enemys outposts and the sentinel would not let it pass nor even come on shore in vain mr brudenell offered the flag of truce and represented the state of the extraordinary passenger the guard apprehensive of treachery and punctilious to their orders threatened to fire into the boat if it stirred before day light her anxiety and suffering were thus protracted through seven or eight dark and cold hours and her reflections upon that first reception could not give her very encouraging ideas of the treatment she was afterward to expect but it is due to justice at the close of this adventure to say that she was received and accommodated by general gates with all the humanity and respect that her rank her merits and her fortunes deserved  let such as are affected by these circumstances of alarm hardship and danger recollect that the subject of them was a woman of the most tender and delicate frame of the gentlest manners habituated to all the soft elegancies and refined enjoyments that attend high birth and fortune and far advanced in a state in which the tender cares always due to the sex become indispensibly necessary her mind alone was formed for such trials  arrival of the army at saratoga lord harrington    etc lord balcarras    etc i now return to the army which arrived in the night at saratoga in such a state of fatigue that the men for the most part had not strength or inclination to cut wood and make fires but rather sought sleep in their wet clothes upon the wet ground under the continuing rain and it was not till after daylight that the artillery and the last of the troops past the fish kill and took a position upon the heights and in the redoubts formerly constructed  interval between the arrival at saratoga and signing the convention the interval between taking that position and the conclusion of the treaty is the solemn crisis in which i consider myself as peculiarly accountable to my country and if all the circumstances mentioned by me in my own vindication in my letters or my narrative are not established and many of them strengthened by positive proof if every surmise of a surrender on my part while there was a possibility of avoiding it by fight by maneuver or by retreat is not done away if even in the last extremity it does not appear i was ready and forward to prefer death to dishonor if the evidence i have adduced is not clear distinct and direct to these points the public odium piercingly as it affects a sensible breast would be far short of the punishment i deserve  i cannot but consider it as one encouragement under this appeal and it is no small one that though very few parts of my preceding conduct have escaped the scrutiny of crossexamination not a material transaction of this crisis has been controverted or glanced at i beg leave to recapitulate the transactions upon which i rely  lord harrington    to    lieut col kingston    see the plan lieut col kingston       it is proved by the evidence of the earl of harrington and colonel kingston that the enemy was posted on the east side the river to guard the ford  it is further proved by the evidence of lieut col kingston that in concert with the general officers it was determined to try a night march on the east side the river abandoning the baggage and that the attempt was prevented by the impossibility attending the delivery of necessary provision lieut col kingston          the same witness goes on to show that the next day it was evident that had the delivery been possible the attempt would still have failed for we then received intelligence of the enemy being previously in possession in force of the country on both sides the river between us and fort edward it was also in contemplation to force a way back to albany had the enemy in the distribution of their posts weakened their right so as to have made the effort possible see lord harringtons evidence   while the army was lying day and night upon their arms in anxious hope of succor from our friends or as the next desirable expectation an attack from the enemy letter from albany to the secretary of state i cannot omit observing from the same evidence that of colonel kingston lieut col kingston        0 how near the last expectation was being accomplished it would be improper to pronounce positively what would have been the issue but i request the attention of my military readers to the plan of the ground see the plan no vii as an argument of the probability of success the disposition of the enemy being to pass the fishkill in different columns and to make their great effort upon the plain they must have formed under the fire of all our park artillery within reach of grapeshot a cross fire from the artillery and musketry of the entrenched corpse upon the hill and the musketry of the  0th regiment which was at easy distance to be supported by the germans in front added to this would have been the advantage which though always wished for we never had attained of a charge upon an open plain i am persuaded the general judgment will go with me when i lament the accident that prevented the enemys design when so far advanced in it as actually to have passed the river with one column as one of the most adverse strokes of fortune in the whole campaign  lord harrington          the state of things after this disappointment is given by the earl of harrington it was as bad as possible the numbers of the army were few their provisions short their position not a good one owing to the nature of the country lord balcarras from  0 to the end maj forbes    to    lord balcarras    this state is corroborated by the evidence of the earl of balcarras and major forbes with the additional circumstance that there was not a spot to be found in the whole position which was not exposed to cannon or rifle shot  appendix no xv lieut col kingston    etc the minutes of the first council of war prove the unanimity of opinion for opening the treaty and it is proved by the evidence of colonel kingston that the force of the enemy was actually greater and their position stronger than the intelligence i had received and laid before the council of war represented them  maj forbes    to    lord balcarras    to    it is proved by the fullest evidence that the terms first proposed by the enemy were instantly and unanimously rejected by the council of war as dishonorable  the same unanimity in approving the terms i proposed and obtained is equally incontestably established  appendix no xvi appendix no xvii see also lord balcarras   0         and lastly two papers are produced and authenticated beyond a possibility of cavil the one general gatess return signed by himself showing the effective strength present of the rebel army the other the minutes of the last council of war showing that even supported as i was by the unanimity of the former councils in opening and conducting the treaty i was repugnant to the signing of it upon a slight hope entertained of a remote relief  a hope arising from some intelligence received in the night of sir henry clintons moving up the north river and gave my voice against a majority accordingly that i at last thought myself compelled to yield to the majority upon the uncertainty of the intelligence and the improbability of general clintons motions being effectual if true upon the doubts entertained of some part of the troops if the negotiation of the treaty ceased and of a greater part for want of bodily strength if desperate enterprises were to be afterward undertaken and lastly upon the reflection that a miscarriage of such enterprises must be fatal to the whole army and that even a victory could not save it  lord balcarras lord harrington to this mass of evidence apposite and direct to every fact essential to my justification i beg leave to add the opinion of the army that the terms obtained were better than the situation of things gave us a right to expect for a proof that such was their opinion i refer to the testimony of lord balcarras  reflections upon the convention a fair judgment upon recent events is hardly to be expected especially while many prejudices are alive it will be allowed me to assume what no one has ever ventured to deny that there may be a combination of circumstances under which an army may be justified in treating with an enemy that the army under my command was under such circumstances at saratoga is also generally acknowledged but what is not denied to me from my own situation is attempted to be withheld by some on account of the quality of the enemy they suggest that there should be no treaty with rebels it is unnecessary in answer to have recourse to history i will not take defense from treaties between spain the haughtiest power of the world and the archrebel the great prince of orange nor between charles the first and the archrebels the english parliament for such in both instances they were called i need only refer to the examples existing at that time in america and since much improved on at home my superior officer in america with the approbation of government had treated upon different occasions with general washington the british government in its highest collective authority the king in parliament has since commissioned five members of that parliament the one a peer the others of eminent station in military and civil capacities to treat with rebels i had almost said to sue to rebels for peace by the surrender of almost every principle for the maintenance of which they had prosecuted the war  thus highly justified in treating with rebels i am at a loss to discover by what possible mode of defense i could have acquitted myself to god or my country when the brave and intelligent officers of my army unanimously resolved upon military principle precedent and reason that the treaty was expedient and the terms honorable if i had delivered them up to certain destruction or even to be prisoners at discretion  if the informed and dispassionate part of mankind should agree in sentiment with the unanimous voice of the army upon the convention of saratoga surely to impute to it the final loss of the army is too palpable an injustice long to remain upon the minds of the most prejudiced the convention expressly preserved the army for the service of the state according to that convention a truce was made during the war between that army and the enemy in america and it now might have been acting against the house of bourbon in any other part of the world the army was lost by the noncompliance with the treaty on the part of the congress and that violation of faith no man will ever be found to justify  i will not decide how far it was encouraged in america by the persuasion that the ministry of britain had neither power nor spirit to redress the wrong and that they had sunk the nation so low in point of respect that the world would overlook where she was concerned an action that would have excited in any other case universal censure and indignation but whatever motives the congress may have had the tameness and silence with which the british ministers have borne this outrage is astonishing that men so constant and so prodigal in their anger against the congress as never before to have failed in expressing it even in cases where it bordered upon being ridiculous should on a sudden become cold and mute and dead to feeling in a case where resentment was justly founded can hardly be accounted for except upon the principle that it was better to suppress the justest censure upon a power they detested than that even a particle of unmerited odium should be wanting to load the man whom they were resolved to depress  conclusion i am not aware that in the preceding review of evidence i have neglected any part essential to my defense i do not reckon as such that part which applies to the management of the public purse the calumny designed to wound me upon that head was too gross to succeed it perished in its birth and scorn is the only sentiment excited by the remembrance of its momentary existence in regard to the more plausible objections pointed against my conduct i have not only endeavored to meet them in the crossexamination but have searched for them in every place where i could suppose them to originate or be entertained if some have escaped i shall stand excused when it is recollected how they have grown and changed from one shape to another and that it has never been my fortune to be confronted with an avowed and regular accuser  i despair of ever being so but i desire it to be understood that although i am earnest in this mode of defense i am so far from declining another that i shall think it one very happy circumstance of the past enquiry if any thing contained in it should have effect hereafter to produce an enquiry by court martial  it would not be an ungrateful task to follow the defense of the campaign with a detail of the occurrences which happened between the time of signing the convention and my leaving america many of them would be found curious and the cares and perplexities in which i bore a principal and most painful part would create a new interest in the minds of my friends but i do not think myself at liberty upon the plan i laid down at my outset to enter into matter where no blame is imputed or implied if my proceedings during that interval deserve any credit i am content with that testimony of it which i may assume from the silence of my enemies  i have not the same reasons for passing over the transactions in which i have been engaged since my return to england because blame and of a very atrocious nature has been imputed to me but as the principal of these transactions are already before the public i shall mention them very briefly and merely to introduce connectedly such further thoughts upon them as could not with propriety be stated upon any former occasion  immediately after my arrival a board of general officers was appointed to enquire into the causes of the failure of the expedition from canada this enquiry was made the foundation of an order against my appearing at court  the board reported that they could not take cognizance of me being under parole  the prohibition from the kings presence nevertheless still remained in force  i had recourse to parliament for enquiry and openly and repeatedly and strenuously called upon the ministers to join issue with me before that tribunal objection was taken against immediate enquiry because generals sir guy carleton and sir william how who might be parties were absent but it was evidently the disposition of the house that an enquiry should be instituted the ensuing session  i pledged myself zealously to prosecute that measure i accused ministers of injurious treatment toward myself and it became my duty upon occasions with which my own affairs had no connection to express deeper resentments of their conduct toward the public  in this state of things parliament was prorogued on the   d of june on the   th of june i received the first order to repair to boston as soon as i had tried the bath waters the order and my answer representing the hardship of being sent back unheard and the second conditional order with entire slight of my representations are too well known to require repetition but there are two circumstances attending the dates of these orders with which i was not acquainted till long after and which have never yet been taken notice of  the one is that at the very time i was told that my presence was material and as the second letter from the secretary at war expressed of so much importance to the troops detained prisoners in new england that it must not be dispensed with  at that very time it was determined to ratify the convention according to the requisition of the congress and to transmit the ratification through other hands and without any participation with me or employment of me in carrying it to a conclusion it was very possible the troops might have been sailed for england before i had reached america had i even complied as early as the condition of either order could possibly be construed to prescribe but at all events the circumstance could not but serve to mark to me the true intent and meaning of the order beyond a possibility of mistake  that it was an order of vindictive punishment and my presence with the troops if i reached america in time was material and important to mark to them the degree of disgrace to which i was reduced the terms are a mockery and an insult upon common sense if applied in the situation in which i was placed to the service of the king or the consolation of the troops such a display of vengeance might indeed be intended to apply to their prudence and to act as a caution and warning how at their return they should support a general under the extremity of the kings displeasure in times when the maintenance of the constitution in its purity is the ruling principle of an administration the kings name is introduced by office only to denote an act of the executive part of the state in times when an administration mean to rule by the influence of monarchy the language of office is to connect the royal person with the act and to give him attributes of passion and displeasure from which in his political character he is held exempt i disclaim language and ideas so unconstitutional and disrespectful and never mean to allude to my sovereign personally but in acts of justice and mercy   the other circumstance attending these dates is not less remarkable viz  the determination of changing the nature of the war as afterward declared by the commissioners in america must have been taken at this time  i am very much disinclined to believe that the consideration of my person as a proper victim upon that occasion was ever regularly and formally debated in the cabinet but i cannot think it uncharitable to the individual adviser of the crown whoever he was who could project such an order to suppose that if upon the first exercise of the extremes of war on the one side and in the ardour of retaliation on the other it had so happened that an object so well to be spared as an obnoxious and disgraced lieutenant general had opportunely presented itself to the enemys rigor and had been detained in their prisons the order for the voyage would not have been thought by that individual quite thrown away detention with or without the troops of a troublesome and bold complainant could not be immaterial or unimportant to such a person and the order was of an import   to make assurance double sure  and take a bond of fate  that he might tell palehearted fear it lied   the living presence of an injured man is perhaps more offensive and insupportable to the sight of a mean injurer that the spectre of him would be after death  but to return to the facts i was recapitulating  i remained under the conditional order in england  the ensuing session the parliamentary enquiry now laid before the public took place it ended as has been stated in july       in september i received a severe reprimand a denial of a court martial and a prohibition of serving my country in its exigence though other officers precisely in my situation were employed  i resigned  the blame laid upon me for the part i took in these transactions is that intemperately and factiously i engaged in opposition that i was guilty of disobedience to the kings orders and it has been added in a late publication that even my defense of my conduct is a libel upon the kings government  i think i have perceived that the first part of these charges a rash engagement in opposition is not combated by some who wish me well so strenuously as other imputations have been it may possibly have appeared to friendly and prudential observers as a palliating plea for a restitution to favor upon some future occasion to have to say that i had acted upon the sudden impulse of passion and the sequel might be that i had repented and would offend no more  without doubting the kindness which suggests these excuses i have been impelled by principles too forcible and have taken my part too decidedly to look for a resource in those or any other subterfuges it would be inconsistent and dishonorable in me to withhold a public declaration upon this occasion in addition to those i have made upon others that i engaged in resistance to the measures of the court upon mature reflection that after collecting in my mind all the lights upon men and things which my experience and observation could furnish i believed that the constitution of england was betrayed and neither blaming or suspecting any men who conceived different opinions and acted upon them i thought it a point of time in which a man believing as i did was called upon to sacrifice to his country the test of this motive it is true must rest between god and my conscience but let it not be supposed that i acted blindly  the path of interest a broad and beaten track lay clearly before me from the time i arrived in england supple joints and an attentive eye always giving way to power on one side and sometimes pushing my friends into the dirt on the other would have carried me safely through i even believe that the adviser of the letters i lately alluded to would rather have seen me in that track than in the other which he prescribed for me across the atlantic  as little would i be supposed to want discernment of the path i took for the barefaced preferences rewards and punishments held forth for parliamentary conduct were among the most glaring parts of the system i had contemplated and it was impossible to doubt that as a delinquent there i should be pressed both by art and vengeance to the end the enemies i had provoked foresaw  the loss of my profession and the impoverishment of my fortune i trust it will be an innocent revenge on my part to show them i can bear my condition firmly and that i am incapable of redeeming what i have lost were it ever in my option by the disavowal of a single principle i have professed  i come now to the second charge disobedience of orders and in a point that so nearly touches the very essence of military character i trust i shall not trespass upon the patience of the reader if i treat it a little more at large than i have done in my correspondence with the secretary at war  i admit that subordination and implicit obedience as applied to the operation of arms are primary principles in the military system an army is a mere name without them the officer who hesitates to meet certain death upon command deserves to receive it from the hand of the executioner  but there are possible exceptions to these general principles especially out of the field in the most absolute services and in the british service they are known and marked and coexistent with the military establishment itself in the mutiny act which confines obedience to legal commands an army must again be garbled like the army of cromwell which god avert before an order could be executed like that of cromwell for garbling the parliament  a high spirit will contract the limits of obedience still more with illegal he will reject dishonorable commands and he will follow the reasoning i have already premised and state it as a maxim thus he who obeys at the expense of fortune comfort health and life is a soldier he who obeys at the expense of honor is a slave  but i may be asked by some disciplinarians who is to be the judge in these nice definitions of obedience it is uncommon military doctrine i may be told to reason upon the kings orders  i confess it is so since the reign of james the second in the british service it never has been necessary we have been used in this age to see the kings name give wings and inspiration to duty discipline in this country has been raised upon personal honor  a firmer basis than fear or servility ever furnished and the minister who first shakes that happy confidence who turns military command to political craft who dares to use his gracious sovereigns name as an engine of state to glut his own anger or to remove his own fears he is amongst the worst enemies to that sovereign but should his purposes go further a consideration of far greater magnitude to the public and should it be seen that the royal name was brought forth for the discipline of parliament the minister so using it would be not only an enemy to his sovereign but a traitor to the constitution of the state  i will close the defense of my principles respecting military subordination by reference to an anecdote well authenticated and not very remote  an officer in a neighboring nation for some error he had committed in a day of battle received a blow from his prince who commanded in person the officer drew a pistol and his first movement was to point it at his master but the next and it was instantaneous was to turn the muzzle and discharge the ball into his own heart though my case differs both in the provocation and the consequence in many circumstances my conduct may justly be supported upon the same principle i receive an affront that a liberal spirit cannot endure and in a name against which no personal resentment can be pursued nor indeed entertained but a suicide of my professional existence if i may be allowed the phrase is preferable to the state in which the affront placed me in one instance only i renounce the parallel  god forbid i should be thought even in a burst of passion to have pointed at my sovereign it was not from his hand i received the blow  i shall solicit the readers attention very little further but i feel the necessity of repeating my application to the candor of the public both as a writer and an appellant defense and imputation of blame to others are naturally interwoven in my cause it required a more distinct conception and an abler hand than mine to keep them always apart and open to separate view in some parts my defense may be weakened by this deficiency of skill but i have no right to offer the same excuse for suffering any blame to rest upon others beyond what i thought myself justified to support  upon this principle i think it just at taking leave of the secretary of state for the american department briefly to enumerate the only facts and propositions respecting the plan of the expedition from canada that i think clearly maintainable against him  first fact it is clear that the plan of a junction of the greater part of the forces in canada with the army of sir william how was formed in the year      when sir william how was in full success when his whole force was in the neighborhood of new york or in the jersies and mr washington was beaten and at the weakest  second fact this plan of a junction was continued and upon just reasoning in the close of the year      when sir william howes first proposal of operations for the ensuing campaign arrived those proposals were made upon the datum of a number of troops sufficient to furnish besides the main army an offensive army of  0000 men rank and file to act on the side of rhode island by taking possession of providence and penetrating from thence into the country toward boston and another offensive army not less than  0000 to move up the north river to albany exclusive of  000 for the defense of new york  in either of the above cases the plan of junction could hardly have failed of success  third fact on the   d of february sir william howes alteration of the first plan was received and he then proposed to act with the greater part of his force on the side of philadelphia at the opening of the campaign and to enable him so to do to defer the offensive plan from rhode island till the reinforcements should arrive and to destine only  000 men to act defensively upon the lower part of the hudsons river  fourth fact on the  d of march the secretary of state signified his majestys entire approbation of this deviation from the plan first suggested  from these facts arises my first proposition that at the time the change of plan for sir william howes operations was adopted by which no offensive force was to remain upon the hudsons river nor a diversion probably to take place from rhode island the plan of my operations the success of which would probably depend in a great degree upon cooperation and diversion ought to have been changed likewise instead of that it was enforced and made positive by the refusal of the latitude i had proposed of acting upon the connecticut or in case of exigency embarking the troops and effecting the junction by sea  fifth fact on the   th of march a letter from sir william how by the secretary of state acquainting him that a brigade of british and some companies of brigadiers and light infantry had been withdrawn from rhode island which made the force left there merely defensive the same letter mentions the prospects the enemy had of bringing  0000 men into the field  sixth fact i did not leave england till the beginning of april by which time the secretary of state must have known or ought to have known that no dependence could be placed upon reinforcements from england arriving at new york in time for sir william how to resume the intention he had deferred viz a diversion from rhode island or of making the force upon the hudsons river adequate to offensive operation  hence arises my second proposition that the latitude i had proposed or other expedients of precaution ought then at least to have been adopted instead of which i was suffered to sail ignorant of sir william howes plans and ignorant of the defalcation or the delays in the reinforcements destined for him the consequence was that neither his letter to sir guy carleton put into my hands after my arrival in canada nor his letter to me of the   th of june informing me of his destination for pensylvania removed my expectation of cooperation because i was to suppose that subsequent to the dates of either of those letters he would receive orders from the secretary of state respecting the junction and also a timely reinforcement  seventh fact the secretary of state makes no mention of the northern expedition in any of his dispatches to sir william how at the end of march when my orders were fixed nor in the month of april and it is a further fact that i am persuaded will not be contested that he did not mention any orders or recommendations relative to cooperation verbally to sir william howes aiddecamp or any other confidential person who sailed about that time  the first mention made of the necessity of cooperation was in the secretary of states letter of the    th of may wherein his lordship  trusts that whatever he sir william howe may meditate it will be executed in time to cooperate with the army ordered to proceed from canada  the proposition clearly justified by these facts is that if the secretary of state had thought proper to signify the kings expectation of a cooperation to be made in my favor in the month of march or beginning of april as in consistency he ought to have done it would have arrived before sir william how embarked his army and in time for him to have made a new disposition but instead of that this very material injunction was not dispatched till it was almost physically impossible it should have any effect and so indeed it happened for sir william how received it on the   th of august at a distance from hudsons river too great for any detachment from his own army to be made in time could it even have been spared and the reinforcement from england upon which sir william how depended to strengthen sir henry clinton was much later still  too late as it has been shown to enable that general with all his activity and zeal to give any effectual support  indeed the conduct of the secretary of state in inserting this paragraph in his letter of the   th of may when it could not avail after omitting it when certainly it would have been timely seems so preposterous that it can only be explained by one fact it transpired about that time that sir william howes ay was destined for pensylvania and people who had considered the force of the enemy to be collected from the northern provinces began to be alarmed for my army it is well known though i cannot ascertain the date that an officer of very great ability and a perfect knowledge in the country through which i was to pass as soon as he heard no disposition was made for a support from new york foretold to the secretary of state or his near friends the fall of my army under this apprehension it might appear to the secretary of state a proper caution that an expectation of cooperation should exist under his hand  if plans so inconsistently formed and managed by the secretary of state with so much seeming confidence as to mislead his generals and so much real reserve as to destroy them should be defended by that infatuated belief then entertained of the inability of the enemy to resist i should beg leave to state as one proposition more that after the experience of their actions at trenton and many other places and the intelligence of their new levies received from sir william how such confidence was an additional fault and perhaps a more pernicious one than any i have stated  thus much for the noble lord in his public capacity what share of the persecution i have sustained more than i have directly expressed in different parts of my defense are imputable to his private councils is not within my knowledge but if in speaking of my persecutors in general i may be thought sometimes to have used strong terms i have only to say that having advanced no fact which i am not able and resolved to maintain i have not felt myself called upon in applying those facts for any further attention than to preserve the language of a gentleman which is an attention due to myself as well as to the public it is open and manly enmity alone that unites respect with resentment  i wish i could as easily apologize for all the other faults with which this undertaking abounds as a composition at a time when so many pens are employed i must not expect to be spared i shall treat with silent respect any comments that are fairly founded and delivered with liberality and with contempt equally silent the common invectives of the political press this appeal is not to rest upon literary criticism or party disputation but upon the broad equity of my country i know that prejudice and malice will vanish before the man who dares to submit his actions to that test  if acquitted there i feel i am not degraded and i have not a sensation within my breast which does not at the same time assure me i cannot be unhappy  j burgoyne  appendix no i copy of a letter from lieutenant general burgoyne to lord george germain dated hertfordstreet  st january      my lord my physician has pressed me to go to bath for a short time and i find it requisite to my health and spirits to follow his advice but i think it a previous duty to assure your lordship that should my attendance in town become necessary relatively to information upon the affairs of canada i shall be ready to obey your summons upon one days notice  your lordship being out of town i submitted the above intentions a few days ago personally to his majesty in his closet and i added that as the arrangements for the next campaign might possibly come under his royal contemplation before my return i humbly laid myself at his majestys feet for such active employment as he might think me worthy of  this was the substance of my audience on my part i undertook it and i now report it to your lordship in the hope of your patronage in this pursuit a hope my lord founded not only upon a just sense of the honor your lordships friendship must reflect upon me but also upon a feeling that i deserve it in as much as a solid respect and sincere personal attachment can constitute such a claim  i leave in the hands of mr doyley such of the memorandums confided to me by general carleton as require dispatch should your lordship think proper to carry them into execution  i also leave in that gentlemans hands the copy of an application relative to boats for the artillery and which i take the liberty to submit to your lordship as well worthy of consideration upon the supposition that the enemy should arm upon lake george and that any operation should be advisable by that route  i likewise leave the disposition of winter quarters which i received by the last ship from canada i find no dispatch is come to your lordship by that occasion and i conceived those papers might be of use  i have the honor to be my lord etc j burgoyne   no ii extract of a letter from lord george germain to sir guy carleton dated whitehall   d august      the rapid success of his majestys arms in driving the rebels out of canada does great honor to your conduct and i hope soon to hear that you have been able to pursue them across the lakes and to possess those posts upon the frontiers which may effectually secure your province from any future insult  his majesty in appointing you commander in chief of his forces in canada was pleased to extend your commission to the frontiers of his provinces bordering thereupon wisely foreseeing that it might be necessary for the completing your plan of operations that you should march your army beyond the limits of your own government i trust before this letter reaches you that you will by your spirit and activity have cleared the frontiers of canada of all the rebel forces and will have taken the proper measures for keeping possession of the lakes that service being performed his majesty commands me to acquaint you that there still remains another part of your duty to be undertaken which will require all your abilities and the strictest application the restoring peace and the establishing good order and legal government in canada it is an object of the greatest importance to this country the difficulties attending it are immense but his majesty depends upon your zeal and upon your experience for carrying it into execution his majesty ever anxious for the happiness of his subjects commands me to inform you that no time should be lost in beginning so important a work and that you do therefore return to quebec detaching lieutenant general burgoyne or such other officer as you shall think most proper with that part of your forces which can be spared from the immediate defense of your province to carry on such operations as shall be most conducive to the success of the army acting on the side of new york and that you direct the officer so detached to communicate with and put himself as soon as possible under the command of general how you will order such artillery as you shall judge necessary to proceed with this detachment and as a great quantity of heavy cannon and military stores were sent upon the supposition that quebec might have been in the hands of the rebels you will upon requisition from general how supply him with such cannon and stores as may not be wanted for the protection of canada   no iii thoughts for conducting the war from the side of canada by lieutenant general burgoyne when the last ships came from quebec a report prevailed in canada said to have been founded upon positive evidence that the rebels had laid the keels of several large vessels at skenesborough and ticonderoga and were resolved to exert their utmost powers to construct a new and formidable fleet during the winter  i will not however give credit to their exertions in such a degree as to imagine the kings troops will be prevented passing lake champlain early in the summer but will suppose the operations of the army to begin from crown point  but as the present means to form effectual plans is to lay down every possible difficulty i will suppose the enemy in great force at ticonderoga the different works there are capable of admitting twelve thousand men  i will suppose him also to occupy lake george with a considerable naval strength in order to secure his retreat and afterward to retard the campaign and it is natural to expect that he will take measures to block up the roads from ticonderoga to albany by the way of skenesborough by fortifying the strong ground at different places and thereby obliging the kings army to carry a weight of artillery with it and by felling trees breaking bridges and other obvious impediments to delay though he should not have power or spirit finally to resist its progress  the enemy thus disposed upon the side of canada it is to be considered what troops will be necessary and what disposition of them will be most proper to prosecute the campaign with vigor and effect  i humbly conceive the operating army i mean exclusively of the troops left for the security of canada ought not to consist of less than eight thousand regulars rank and file the artillery required in the memorandums of general carleton a corpse of watermen two thousand canadians including hatchetmen and other workmen and one thousand or more savages  it is to be hoped that the reinforcement and the victualllng ships may all be ready to sail from the channel and from cork on the last day of march i am persuaded that to sail with a fleet of transports earlier is to subject government to loss and disappointment it may reasonably be expected that they will reach quebec before the  0th of may a period in full time for opening the campaign the roads and the rivers and lakes by the melting and running off of the snows are in common years impracticable sooner  but as the weather long before that time will probably have admitted of labor in the docks i will take for granted that the fleet of last year as well bateaux as armed vessels will be found repaired augmented and fit for immediate service the magazines that remain of provision i believe them not to be abundant will probably be formed at montreal sorel and chamblee  i conceive the first business for those entrusted with the chief powers should be to select and post the troops destined to remain in canada to throw up the military stores and provision with all possible dispatch in which service the abovementioned troops if properly posted will greatly assist and to draw the army destined for operation to cantonments within as few days march of st johns as conveniently may be i should prefer cantonments at that season of the year to encampment as the ground is very damp and consequently very pernicious to the men and more especially as they will have been for many months before used to lodgings heated with stoves or between decks in ships all these operations may be put in motion together but they severally require some observation  i should wish that the troops left in canada supposing the number mentioned in my former memorandum to be approved might be made as follows rank and file the   st regiment british exclusive of their light company of grenadiers     macleans corpse  00 the   th regiment     the ten additional companies from great britain   0 brunswic and hesse hanau to be taken by detachments or complete corpse as major general reidesel shall recommend leaving the grenadiers light infantry and dragoons complete   0 detachments from the other british brigades leaving the grenadiers and light infantry complete and squaring the battalions equally  00  00   my reason for selecting the   st regiment for this duty is that when i saw it last it was not equally in order with the other regiments for services of activity  i propose the   th regiment as it is not at present brigaded  i propose macleans corpse because i very much apprehend desertion from such parts of it as are composed of americans should they come near the enemy  in canada whatsoever may be their disposition it is not so easy to effect it  and i propose making up the residue by detachment because by selecting the men least calculated for fatigue or least accustomed to it which may be equally good soldiers in more confined movements and better provided situations the effective strength for operation is much greater and the defensive strength not impaired  i must beg leave to state the expeditious conveyance of provision and stores from quebec and the several other depositaries in order to form ample magazines at crown point as one of the most important operations of the campaign because it is upon that which most of the rest will depend if sailing vessels up the st lawrence are alone to be employed the accident of contrary winds may delay them two months before they pass the rapids of richelieu and afterward st peters lake delays to that extent are not uncommon and they are only to be obviated by having a quantity of small craft in readiness to work with oars from the mouth of the sorrel to chamblee rowing and tacking is a sure conveyance if sufficient hands are found from chamblee to st therese which is just above the rapids landcarriage must be used and great authority will be requisite to supply the quantity necessary  a business thus complicated in arrangement in some parts unusual in practice and in others perhaps difficult can only be carried to the desired effect by the peremptory powers warm zeal and consonant opinion of the governor and though the former are not to be doubted a failure in the latter vindicated or seeming to be vindicated by the plausible obstructions that will not fail to be suggested by others will be sufficient to crush such exertions as an officer of a sanguine temper entrusted with the future conduct of the campaign and whose personal interest and fame therefore consequentially depend upon a timely outset would be led to make  the assembly of the savages and the canadians will also entirely depend upon the governor  under these considerations it is presumed that the general officer employed to proceed with the army will be held to be out of the reach of any possible blame till he is clear of the province of canada and furnished with the proposed supplies  the navigation of lake champlain secured by the superiority of our naval force and the arrangements for forming proper magazines so established as to make the execution certain i would not lose a day to take possession of crown point with brigadier frasers corpse a large body of savages a body of canadians both for scouts and works and the best of our engineers and artificers well supplied with intrenching tools  the brigade would be sufficient to prevent insult during the time necessary for collecting the stores forming magazines and fortifying the posts all which should be done to a certain degree previous to proceeding in force to ticonderoga to such a degree i mean as may be supposed to be effected in time of transporting artillery preparing fascines and other necessaries for artillery operations and by keeping the rest of the army back during that period the transport of provisions will be lessened and the soldiers made of use in forwarding the convoys  but though there would be only one brigade at crown point at that time it does not follow that the enemy should remain in a state of tranquillity corpse of savages supported by detachments of light regulars should be continually on foot to keep them in alarm and within their works to cover the reconnoitering of general officers and engineers and to obtain the best intelligence of their strength position and design  if due exertion is made in the preparations stated above it may be hoped that ticonderoga will be reduced early in the summer and it will then become a more proper place for arms than crown point  the next measure must depend upon those taken by the enemy and upon the general plan of the campaign as concerted at home if it be determined that general howes whole forces should act upon hudsons river and to the southward of it and that the only object of the canada army be to effect a junction with that force the immediate possession of lake george would be of great consequence as the most expeditious and most commodious route to albany and should the enemy be in force upon that lake which is very probable every effort should be tried by throwing savages and light troops round it to oblige them to quit it without waiting for naval preparations should those efforts fail the route by south bay and skenesborough might be attempted but considerable difficulties may be expected as the narrow parts of the river may be easily choked up and rendered impassable and at best there will be necessity for a great deal of of land carriage for the artillery provision etc which can only be supplied from canada in case of success also by that route and the enemy not removed from lake george it will be necessary to leave a chain of posts as the army proceeds for the securities of your communication which may too much weaken so small an army  lest all these attempts should unavoidably fail and it become indispensibly necessary to attack the enemy by water upon lake george the army at the outset should be provided with carriages implements and artificers for conveying armed vessels from ticonderoga to the lake  these ideas are formed upon the supposition that it be the sole purpose of the canada army to effect a junction with general how or after cooperating so far as to get possession of albany and open the communication to new york to remain upon the hudsons river and thereby enable that general to act with his whole force to the southward  but should the strength of the main american army be such as to admit of the corpse of troops now at rhode island remaining there during the winter and acting separately in the spring it may be highly worthy consideration whether the most important purpose to which the canada army could be employed supposing it in possession of ticonderoga would not be to gain the connecticut river  the extent of country from ticonderoga to the inhabited country upon that river opposite to charles town is about sixty miles and though to convey artillery and provision so far by land would be attended with difficulties perhaps more than those above suggested upon a progress to skenesborough should the object appear worthy it is to be hoped resources might be found in that case it would be advisable to fortify with one or two strong redoubts the heights opposite to charles town and establish posts of savages upon the passage from ticonderoga to those heights to preserve the communication and at the same time prevent any attempt from the country above charles town which is very populous from molesting the rear or interrupting the convoys of supply while the army proceeded down the connecticut sold the junction between the canada and rhode island armies be effected upon the connecticut it is not too sanguine an expectation that all the new england provinces will be reduced by their operations  to avoid breaking in upon other matter i omitted in the beginning of these papers to state the idea of an expedition at the outset of the campaign by the lake ontario and oswego to the mohawk river which as a diversion to facilitate every proposed operation would be highly desirable provided the army should be reinforced sufficiently to afford it  it may at first appear from a view of the present strength of the army that it may bear the sort of detachment proposed by myself last year for this purpose but it is to be considered that at that time the utmost object of the campaign from the advanced season and unavoidable delay of preparation for the lakes being the reduction of crown point and ticonderoga unless the success of my expedition had opened the road to albany no greater numbers were necessary than for those first operations the case in the present year differs because the season of the year affording a prospect of very extensive operation and consequently the establishment of many posts patroles etc will become necessary the army ought to be in a state of numbers to bear those drains and still remain sufficient to attack any thing that probably can be opposed to it  nor to argue from probability is so much force necessary for this diversion this year as was required for the last because we then knew that general schuyler with a thousand men was fortified upon the mohawk when the different situations of things are considered viz the progress of general how the early invasion from canada the threatening of the connecticut from rhode island etc it is not to be imagined that any detachment of such force as that of schulyer can be supplied by the enemy for the mohawk i would not therefore propose it of more and i have great diffidence whether so much can be prudently afforded than sir john johnsons corpse an hundred british from the second brigade and an hundred more from the  th regiment with four pieces of the lightest artillery and a body of savages sir john johnson to be with a detachment in person and an able field officer to command it i should wish lieutenant colonel st ledger for that employment  i particularize the second brigade because the first is proposed to be diminished by the   st regiment remaining in canada and the rest of the regiment drafted for the expedition being made also part of the canada force the two brigades will be exactly squared  should it appear upon examination of the really effective numbers of the canada army that the force is not sufficient for proceeding upon the above ideas with a fair prospect of success the alternative remains of embarking the army at quebec in order to effect a junction with general how by sea or to be employed separately rately to cooperate with the main designs by such means as should be within their strength upon other parts of the continent and though the army upon examination of the numbers from the returns here and the reinforcements designed should appear adequate it is humbly submitted as a security against the possibility of its remaining inactive whether it might not be expedient to entrust the latitude of embarking the army by sea to the commander in chief provided any accidents during the winter and unknown here should have diminished the numbers considerably or that the enemy from any winter success to the southward should have been able to draw such forces toward the frontiers of canada and take up their ground with such precaution as to render the intended measure impracticable or too hazardous but in that case it must be considered that more force would be required to be left behind for the security of canada than is supposed to be necessary when an army is beyond the lakes and i do not conceive any expedition from the sea can be so formidable to the enemy or so effectual to close the war as an invasion from canada by ticonderoga this last measure ought not to be thought of but upon positive conviction of its necessity  j burgoyne hertfordstreet feb   th      no iv extract of a letter from lord george germain to general carleton dated whitehall   th march      my letter of the   d august      was entrusted to the care of captain le maitre one of your aiddecamps after having been three times in the gulf of st lawrence he had the mortification to find it impossible to make his passage to quebec and therefore returned to england with my dispatch which though it was prevented by that accident from reaching your hands in due time i nevertheless think proper to transmit to you by this earliest opportunity  you will be informed by the contents thereof that as soon as you should have driven the rebel forces from the frontiers of canada it was his majestys pleasure that you should return to quebec and take with you such part of your army as in your judgment and discretion appeared sufficient for the defense of the province that you should detach lieutenant general burgoyne or such other officer as you should think most proper with the remainder of the troops and direct the officer so detached to proceed with all possible expedition to join general how and to put himself under his command  with a view of quelling the rebellion as soon as possible it is become highly necessary that the most speedy junction of the two armies should be effected and therefore as the security and good government of canada absolutely require your presence there it is the kings determination to leave about  000 men under your command for the defense and duties of that province and to employ the remainder of your army upon two expeditions the one under the command of lieutenant general burgoyne who is to force his way to albany and the other under the command of lieutenant colonel st ledger who is to make a diversion on the mohawk river  as this plan cannot be advantageously executed without the assistance of canadians and indians his majesty strongly recommends it to your care to furnish both expeditions with good and sufficient bodies of those men and i am happy in knowing that your influence among them is so great that there can be no room to apprehend you will find it difficult to fulfill his majestys expectations  in order that no time may be lost in entering upon these important undertakings general burgoyne has received orders to sail forthwith for quebec and that the intended operations may be maturely considered and afterward carried on in such a manner as is most likely to be followed by success he is directed to consult with you upon the subject and to form and adjust the plan as you both shall think most conducive to his majestys service  i am also to acquaint you that as soon as you shall have fully regulated every thing relative to these expeditions and the king relies upon your zeal that you will be as expeditious as the nature of the business will admit it is his majestys pleasure that you detain for the canada service the  th regiment deducting  00 for the expedition to the mohawk   0 battalion companies of the   th and   st regiments     battalion companies of the   th deducting  00 for the expedition to the mohawk     eleven additional companies from great britain     detachments from the two brigades  00 detachments from the german troops   0 royal highland emigrants  00    0  you will naturally conclude that this allotment for canada has not been made without properly weighing the several duties which are likely to be required his majesty has not only considered the several garrisons and posts which probably it may be necessary for you to take viz quebec chaudiere the disaffected parishes of point levi montreal and posts between that town and oswegatche trois rivieres st johns sele aux noix la prairie vergere and some other towns upon the south shore of st lawrence opposite the isle of montreal with posts of communication to st johns but he has also reflected that the several operations which will be carrying on in different parts of america must necessarily confine the attention of the rebels to the respective scenes of action and secure canada from external attacks and that the internal quiet which at present prevails is not likely to be interrupted or if interrupted will soon be restored by your influence over the inhabitants he therefore trusts that  000 men will be quite sufficient to answer every possible demand  it is likewise his majestys pleasure that you put under the command of lieutenant general burgoyne the grenadiers and light infantry of the army except of the  th regiment and the   th regiment as the advanced corpse under the command of brigadier general fraser      first brigade battalion companies of the  th   st and   th regiments deducting a detachment of  0 from each corpse to remain in canada      second brigade battalion companies of the  0th   d and   d regiments deducting  0 from each corpse to remain as above      all the german troops except the hanau chasseurs and a detachment of   0      the artillery except such parts as shall be necessary for the defense of canada      together with as many canadians and indians as may be thought necessary for this service and after having furnished him in the fullest and compleatest manner with artillery stores provisions and every other article necessary for his expedition and secured to him every assistance which it is in your power to afford and procure you are to give him orders to pass lake champlain and from thence by the most vigorous exertion of the force under his command to proceed with all expedition to albany and put himself under the command of sir william how  from the kings knowledge of the great preparations made by you last year to secure the command of the lakes and your attention to this part of the service during the winter his majesty is led to expect that every thing will be ready for general burgoynes passing the lakes by the time you and he shall have adjusted the plan of the expedition  it is the kings further pleasure that you put under the command of lieutenant colonel st ledger detachment from the  th regiment  00 detachment from the   th regiment  00 sir john johnsons regiment of new york     hanau chasseurs         together with a sufficient number of canadians and indians and after having furnished him with proper artillery stores provisions and every other necessary article for his expedition and secured to him every assistance in your power to afford and procure you are to give him orders to proceed forthwith to and down the mohawk river to albany and put himself under the command of sir william how  i shall write to sir william how from hence by the first packet but you will nevertheless endeavor to give him the earliest intelligence of this measure and also direct lieutenant general burgoyne and lieutenant colonel st ledger to neglect no opportunity of doing the same that they may receive instructions from sir william how you will at the same time inform them that until they shall have received orders from sir william how it is his majestys pleasure that they act as exigencies may require and in such manner as they shall judge most proper for making an impression on the rebels and bringing them to obedience but that in so doing they must never lose view of their intended junctions with sir william how as their principal objects  in case lieutenant general burgoyne or lieutenant colonel st ledger should happen to die or be rendered through illness incapable of executing those great trusts you are to nominate to their respective commands such officer or officers as you shall think best qualified to supply the place of those whom his majesty has in his wisdom at present appointed to conduct these expeditions   no v copy of a letter from lieutenant general burgoyne to lord george germain dated quebec may         private  my lord i take the opportunity of a vessel dispatched by sir guy carleton to england to inform your lordship of my arrival here the  th instant and though my present situation as acting under a superior upon the spot may make an official correspondence unnecessary i cannot persuade myself i shall not appear guilty of impropriety in assuming the honor of a private and confidential one relatively to the objects of my destination  from my present information i have reason to expect the preparations for opening the campaign to be very forward on our part due exertions were used in the course of the winter and the uncommon mildness of the weather greatly favored them to convey provisions to chamble and st johns one large victualler arrived after i left the st lawrence last november all residues of other victuallers have been collected i am in hopes of finding a sufficiency of provision to enable me to cross the lake champlain at least without the arrival of the cork fleet i hope also to find artillery stores enough to feel the pulse of the enemy at ticonderoga should their situation and resolution be such as to make great artillery preparations requisite i shall certainly be under the necessity of waiting at crown point the arrival of the ordnance ships from england a good body of the indians i am assured are ready to move upon the first call and measures are taking for bringing them forthwith to proper redezvous  i cannot speak with so much confidence of the military assistance i am to look for from the canadians the only corpse yet instituted or that i am informed can at present be instituted are three independent companies of  00 men each officered by seigneurs of the country who are well chosen but they have not been able to engage many volunteers the men are chiefly drafted from the militia according to a late regulation of the legislative council those i have yet seen afford no promise of use of arms  aukwark ignorant disinclined to the service and spiritless various reasons are assigned for this change in the natives since the time of the french government it may partly be owing to a disuse of arms but i believe principally to the unpopularity of their seigneurs and to the poison which the emissaries of the rebels have thrown into their minds should i find the new companies up the country better composed or that the well affected parties can be prevailed upon to turn out volunteers though but for a short occasion as they did last year i shall move sir guy to exert further measures to augment my numbers  the army will fall short of the strength computed in england the want of the camp equipage clothing and many other necessary articles will cause inconvenience i am nevertheless determined to put the troops destined for my command immediately in motion and assisted by the spirit and health in which they abound i am confident in the prospect of overcoming difficulties and disappointments  having settled all measures with sir guy carleton both for this purpose and for the expeditious transport of the stores as they may arrive and having already dispatched instructions to captain lutwidge who commands the fleet upon lake champlain to secure the navigation in which i clearly see he will find no trouble i shall proceed in person this afternoon for montreal and from thence make my final arrangements for pursuing the kings orders  i should think myself deficient in justice and in honor were i close my letter without mentioning the sense i entertain of general carletons conduct that he was anxiously desirous of leading the military operations out of the province is easily to be discerned but his deference to his majestys decision and his zeal to give effect to his measures in my hands are equally manifest exemplary and satisfactory i shall take every possible means to transmit to your lordship an account of my proceedings from time to time and have the honor to be with perfect respect  your lordships most obedient and most humble servant j burgoyne p s i have mentioned nothing of intelligence concerning the enemy concluding that sir guy carleton will transmit the material part of it and in a manner more full than in my power to do i understand they have labored hard to strengthen ticonderoga and threaten a vigorous resistance there and that they have built some vessels on lake george as your lordship may remember i had foreseen     second no v copy of a letter from lieutenant general burgoyne to lord george germain dated montreal may         my lord i had the honor to write to your lordship the day i left quebec having reason to imagine this letter may reach that place in time to be dispatched with my former one i cannot omit the occasion to inform your lordship that the hopes i expressed of being able to put the troops in motion without waiting the arrival of the fleets from england and ireland are confirmed  the only delay is occasioned by the impracticability of the roads owing to late extraordinary heavy rains and this difficulty will be speedily removed by exerting the services of the parishes as soon as the weather clears in the mean time i am employing every means that water carriage will admit for drawing the troops and stores toward their point i trust i shall have vessels sufficient to move the army and stores together and in that case will take post at once within sight of ticonderoga and only make use of crown point for my hospital and magazine  a continuation of intelligence from different spies and deserters confirms the design of the enemy to dispute ticonderoga vigorously they are also building bowgallies at fort george for the defense of that lake etc fortifying on the road to skenesborough  it is consigned to the new england colonies to furnish supplies of men and provision to oppose the progress of my army and they have undertaken the task upon condition of being exempt from supplying mr washingtons main army  it is my design while advancing to ticonderago and during the siege of that post for a siege i apprehend it must be to give all possible jealousy on the side of connecticut if i can by maneuver lead the enemy to suspect that after the reduction of ticonderago my views are pointed that way the connecticut forces will be very cautious of leaving their own frontier and i may gain a start that may much expedite and facilitate my progress to albany  your lordship may rest assured that whatever demonstration i may endeavor to impose on the enemy i shall

astray and the misrepresentations the specious allurements the insidious promises and diversified plots in which the rebels are exercised and all of which they employed for that effect have served only in the end to enhance the honor of the tribes in general by demonstrating to the world how few and how contemptible are the apostates it is a truth known to you all that these pitiful examples excepted and they probably have before this day hid their faces in shame the collective voices and hands of the indian tribes over this vast continent are on the side of justice of law and of the king  the restraint you have put upon your resentment in waiting the king your fathers call to arms the hardest proof i am persuaded to which your affection could have been put is another manifest and affected mark of your adherence to that principle of connection to which you were always fond to allude and which it is mutually the joy and the duty of the parent to cherish  the clemency of your father has been abused the offers of his mercy have been despised and his farther patience would in his eyes become culpable in as much as it would withold redress from the most grievous oppressions in the provinces thatever disgraced the history of mankind it therefore remains for me the general of one of his majestys armies and in this council his representative to release you from those bonds which your obedience imposed  warriors you are free  go forth in might of your valor and your cause strike at the common enemies of great britain and america  disturbers of public order peace and happiness  destroyers of commerce parricides of the state  the circle round you the chiefs of his majestys european forces and of the princes his allies esteem you as brothers in the war emulous in glory and in friendship we will endeavor reciprocally to give and to receive examples we know how to value and we will strive to imitate your perseverance in enterprise and your constancy to resist hunger weariness and pain be it our task from the dictates of our religion the laws of our warefare and the principles and interest of our policy to regulate your passions when they overbear to point out were it is nobler to spare than to revenge to discriminate degrees of guilt to suspend the uplisted stroke to chastise and not to destroy  this war to you my friends is new upon all former occasions in taking the field you held yourselves authorized to destroy wherever you came because every where you found an enemy the case is now very different  the king has many faithful subjects dispersed in the provinces consequently you have many brothers there and these people are the more to be pitied that they are persecuted or imprisoned wherever they are discovered or suspected and to disemble is to a generous mind a yet more grievous punishment  persuaded that your magnanimity of character joined to your principles of affection to the king will give me fuller control over your minds than the military rank with which i am invested i enjoin your most serious attention to the rules which i hereby proclaim for your invariable observation during the campaign  i positively forbid bloodshed when you are not opposed in arms  aged men women children and prisoners must be held sacred from the knife or hatchet even in the time of actual conflict  you shall receive compensation for the prisoners you take but you shall be called to account for scalps  in conformity and indulgence to your customs which have affixed an idea of honor to such badges of victory you shall be allowed to take the scalps of the dead when killed by your fire and in fair opposition but on no account or pretense or subtlety or prevarication are they to be taken from the wounded or even dying and still less pardonable if possible will it be held to kill men in that condition on purpose and upon a supposition that this protection to the wounded would be thereby evaded  base lurking assassins incendiaries ravagers and plunderers of the country to whatever army they may belong shall be treated with less reserve but the latitude must be given you by order and i must be the judge of the occasion  should the enemy on their part dare to countenance acts of barbarity toward those who may fall into their hands it shall be yours also to retaliate but till severity shall be thus compelled bear immovable in your hearts this solid maxim it cannot be too deeply impressed that the great essential reward worthy service of your alliance the sincerity of your zeal to the king your father and neverfailing protector will be examined and judged upon the test only of your steady and uniform adherence to the orders and counsels of those to whom his majesty has entrusted the direction and the honor of his arms   answer from an old chief of the iroquois i stand up in the name of all the nations present to assure our father that we have attentively listened to his discourse we receive you as our father because when you speak we hear the voice of our great father beyond the great lake  we rejoice in the approbation you have expressed of our behavior  we have been tried and tempted by the bostonians but we have loved our father and our hatchets have been sharpened upon our affections  in proof of the sincerity of our professions our whole villages able to go to war are come forth the old and infirm our infants and wives alone remain at home  with one common assent we promise a constant obedience to all you have ordered and all you shall order and may the father of days give you many and success  no vii copy of a letter from general burgoyne to lord george germain dated skenesborough july    th      i have the honor to inform your lordship that the enemy disloged from ticonderoga and mount independent on the  th instant and were driven on the same day beyond skenesborough on the right and to humerton on the left with the loss of     pieces of cannon all their armed vessels and bateaux the greatest part of their baggage and ammunition provision and military stores to a very large amount  this success has been followed by events equally fortunate and rapid i subjoin such a detail of circumstances as the time will permit and for his majestys further information i beg leave to refer your lordship to captain gardner my aid de camp whom i thought it necessary to dispatch with news so important to the kings service and so honorable to the troops under my command  journal of the late principal proceedings of the army having remained at crownpoint three days to bring up the rear of the army to establish the magazines and the hospital and to obtain intelligence of the enemy on the   0th june i ordered the advanced corpse consisting of the british light infantry and grenadiers the   th regiment some canadians and savages and ten pieces of light artillery under the command of brigadier general fraser to move from putnam creek where they had been encamped some days up the west shore of the lake to fourmilepoint so called from being within that distance off the fort of ticoderoga the german reserve consisting of the brunswick chasseurs light infantry and grenadiers under lieutenant colonel breyman were moved at the same time to richardsons farm on the east shore opposite to putnam creek   st july the whole army made a movement forward brigadier frasers corpse occupied the strong post called threemilepoint on the west shore the german reserve the eastshore opposite the army encamped in two lines the right wing at the fourmilepoint the left wing nearly opposite on the east shore  the royal george and inflexible frigates with the gunboats were anchored at this time just without the reach of the enemys batteries and covered the lake from the west to the east shores the rest of the fleet had been some time without guns in order to assist in carrying provisions over lake champlain  the enemy appeared to be posted as follows a brigade occupied the old french lines on the height to the north of the fort of ticonderoga these lines were in good repair and had several intrenchments behind them chiefly calculated to guard the northwest flank and were further sustained by a blockhouse they had farther to their left a post at the sawmills which are at the foot of the carryingplace to lake george and a blockhouse upon an eminence above the mills and a blockhouse and hospital at the entrance of the lake  upon the right of the lines and between them and the old fort there were two new blockhouses and a considerable battery close to the water edge  it seemed that the enemy had employed their chief industry and were in the greatest force upon mount independence which is high and circular and upon the summit which is table land was a star fort made of pickets and well supplied with artillery and a large square of barracks within it the foot of the hill on the side which projects into the lake was entrenched and had a strong abbattis close to the water this intrenchment was lined with heavy artillery pointed down the lake flanking the water battery above described and sustained by another battery about half way up the hill on the west side the hill runs the main river and in its passage is joined by the water which comes down from lake george the enemy had here a bridge of communication which could not at this time be reconnoitred on the east side of the hill the water forms a small bay into which falls a rivulet after having encirculed in its course part of the hill to the south east the side to the south could not be seen but was described as inaccessible  july   about nine in the morning a smoke was observed toward lake george and the savages brought in a report that the enemy had set fire to the further blockhouse and had abandoned the sawmills and that a considerable body were advancing from the lines toward a bridge upon the road which led from the sawmills toward the right of the british camp a detachment of the advanced corpse was immediately put in march under the command of brigadier fraser supported by the second brigade and some light artillery under the command of major general phillips with orders to proceed to mount hope which is to the north of the lines to reconnoitre the enemys position and to take advantage of any post they might abandon or be driven from the indians under captain fraser supported by his company of marksmen were directed to make a circuit to the left of brigadier frasers line of march and endeavor to cut off the retreat of the enemy to their lines but this design miscarried through the impetuosity of the indians who attacked too soon and in front and the enemy were thereby able to retire with the loss of one officer and a few men killed and one officer wounded major general phillips took possession of the very advantageous post of mount hope this night and the enemy were thereby entirely cut off from all communication with lake george  july   mount hope was occupied in force by general frasers whole corpse the first british brigade and two entire brigades of artillery the second brigade british encamped upon the left of the first and the brigade of gall having been drawn from the east shore to occupy the ground where frasers corpse had originally been the line became complete extending from threemilepoint to the westermost part of mount hope on the same day major general reidesel encamped on the east shore in a parallel line with threemilepoint having pushed the reserve forward near the rivulet which encircles mount independence the enemy cannonaded the camps of mount hope and of the german reserve during most part of this day but without effect  july   the army worked hard at their communications and got up the artillery tents baggage and provisions the enemy at intervals continued the cannonade upon the camps which was not in any instance returned  the thunderer radeau carrying the battering train and stores having been warped up from crown point arrived this day and immediately began to land the artillery   th july lieutenant twiss the commanding engineer was ordered to reconnoitre sugar hill on the south side of the ommunion from lake george into lake champlain which had been possessed in the night by a party of light infantry it appeared at first to be a very advantageous post and it is now known that the enemy had a council some time ago upon the expediency of possessing it but the idea was rejected upon the supposition that it was impossible for a corpse to be established there in force lieutenant twiss reported this hill to have the entire command of the works and buildings both of ticonderoga and mount independence at the d stance of about   00 yards from the former and   00 from the latter that the ground might be levelled so as to receive cannon and that the road to convey them though difficult might be made practicable in twentyfour hours this hill also commanded in reverse the bridge of communication saw the exact situation of their vessels nor could the enemy during the day make any material movement or preparation without being discovered and even having their numbers counted  it was determined that a battery should be raised on sugar hill for light twentyfour pounders medium twelves and eightinch howitzers this very arduous work was carried on so rapidly that the battery would have been ready the next day  it is a duty in this place to do some justice to the zeal and activity of major general phillips who had the direction of the operation and having mentioned that most valuable officer i trust it cannot be thought a digression to add that it is to his judicious arrangements and indefatigable pains during the general superintendency of preparation which sir guy carleton entrusted to him in the winter and spring that the service is indebted for its present forwardness the prevalence of contrary winds and other accidents having rendered it impossible for any necessaries prepared in england for the opening of the campaign yet to reach the camp   th july soon after daylight an officer arrived express on board the royal george where in the night i took up my quarters as the most centrical situation with information from brigadier fraser that the enemy were retiring and that he was advancing with his picquets leaving orders for the brigade to follow as soon as they could accoutre with intention to pursue by land this movement was very discernible as were the british colors which the brigadier had fixed upon the fort of ticonderoga knowing how safely i could trust to that officers conduct i turned my chief attention to the pursuit by water by which route i understood one column were retiring in two hundred and twenty bateaux covered by five armed galleys  the great bridge of communication through which a way was to be opened was supported by twentytwo sunken piers of large timber at nearly equal distances the space between were made of separate floats each about fifty feet long and twelve feet wide strongly fastened together by chains and rivets and also fastened to the sunken piers before this bridge was a boom made of very large pieces of timber fastened together by rivetted bolts and double chains made of iron an inch and an half square  the gunboats were instantly moved forward and the boom and one of the intermediate floats were cut with great dexterity and dispatch and commodore lutwidge with the officers and seamen in his department partaking the general animation a passage was formed in half an hour for the frigates also through impediments which the enemy had been laboring to construct since last autumn  during this operation major general reidesel had passed to mount independence with the corpse breyman and part of the left wing he was directed to proceed by land to sustain brigadier fraser or to act more to the left if he saw it expedient so to do  the   d regiment british and the brunswick regiment of prince frederick were stationed at ticonderoga and mount independence in the place of the parties of frasers brigade which had been left in possession of the artillery and stores and the rest of the army was ordered to follow up the river as they could be collected without regard to the place in the line  about three in the afternoon i arrived with the royal george and inflexible and the best sailing gunboats at south bay within three miles of skenesborough at which latter place the enemy were posted in a stockaded fort and their armed galleys in the falls below  the foremost regiments viz the  th  0th and   st were immediately disembarked and ascended the mountains with the intention of getting behind the fort and cutting off the retreat of the enemy but their precipitate flight rendered this maneuver ineffectual the gunboats and frigates continued their course to skenesborough falls where the armed vessels were posted captain carter with part of his brigade of gunboats immediately attacked and with so much spirit that two of the vessels very soon struck the other three were blown up and the enemy having previously prepared combustible materials set fire to the fort mills storehouses bateaux etc and retired with the detachment left for that purpose the main body having gone off when the troops were ascending the mountain a great quantity of provisions and some arms were here consumed and most of their officers baggage was burnt sunk or taken their loss is not known about  0 prisoners were made among which were two wounded officers  during these operations upon the right brigadier general fraser continued his pursuit to castletown till one oclock having marched in a very hot day from four oclock in the morning till that time some stragglers of the enemy were picked up from whom the brigadier learned that their rear guard was composed of chosen men and commanded by colonel francis one of their best officers during the time that the men were refreshing major general reidesel came up and arrangements for continuing the pursuit having been concerted brigadier fraser moved forward again and during the night lay upon his arms in an advantageous situation three miles nearer the enemy   th july at three in the morning he renewed his march and about five his advanced scouts discovered the enemys centries who fired their pieces and joined the main body the brigadier observing a commanding ground to the left of his light infantry immediately ordered it to be possessed by that corpse and a considerable body of the enemy attempting the same they met the enemy were driven back to their original post the advanced guard under major grant was by this time engaged and the grenadiers were advanced to sustain them and to prevent the right flank from being turned the brigadier remained on the left where the enemy long defended themselves by the aid of logs and trees and after being repulsed and prevented getting to the castletown road by the grenadiers they rallied and renewed the action and upon a second repulse attempted their retreat by pitsford mountain the grenadiers scrambled up a part of that ascent appearing almost inaccessible and gained the summit before them which threw them into confusion they were still greatly superior in numbers and consequently in extent and the brigadier in momentary expectation of the brunswickers had latterally drawn from his left to support his right at this critical moment general reidesel who had pressed on upon hearing the firing arrived with the foremost of his columns viz the chasseurs company and eighty grenadiers and light infantry his judgment immediately pointed to him the course to take he extended upon brigadier frasers left flank the chasseurs got into action with great gallantry under major barner they fled on all sides leaving dead upon the field colonel francis and many other officers with upwards of  00 men above  00 were wounded most of whom perished in the woods attempting to get off and one colonel seven captains ten subalterns and   0 men were made prisoners above  00 stand of arms were also taken  the number of the enemy before the engagement amounted to  000 men the british detachment under brigadier general fraser the parties left the day before at ticonderoga not having been able to join consisted only of   0 fighting men  the bare relation of so signal an action is sufficient for its praise should the attack against such inequality of numbers before the german brigade came up seem to require explanation it is to be considered that the enemy might have escaped by delay that the advanced guard on a sudden found themselves too near the enemy to avoid action without retreating and that brigadier fraser had supposed the german troops to be very near the difference of time in their arrival was merely accidental the germans pushed for a share in the glory and they arrived in time to obtain it i have only to add that the exertions of brigadier fraser on this day were but a continuance of that uniform intelligence activity and bravery which distinguish his character upon all occasions and entitle him to be recommended in the most particular manner to his majestys favor  the officers and soldiers of this brigade have prevented any distinctions of individuals by a general and equal display of spirit  the country people about skenesborough having reported that part of the enemy were still retreating the  th regiment was detached with orders to take post near fort anne and observe the enemys motions this was effected but with great difficulty as the roads were almost impracticable and the bridges broken the other troops were employed all that day and night in dragging fifty bateaux over the carrying place at wood creek to facilitate the movement of the rest of the first brigade to fort anne to dislodge the enemy   th july a report was received from lieutenant colonel hill  th regiment that the enemy had been reinforced in the night by a considerable body of fresh men that he could not retire with his regiment before them but he would maintain his ground the two remaining regiments of the first brigade were ordered to quicken their march and upon second intelligence of the enemy and firing being heard the  0th regiment was ordered forward with two pieces of artillery and major general phillips was sent to take the command a violent storm of rain which lasted the whole day prevented the troops from getting to fort anne so soon as was intended but the delay gave the  th regiment an opportunity of distinguishing themselves by standing and repulsing an attack of six times their number the enemy finding the position not to be forced in front endeavored to turn it and from the superiority of their numbers that inconvenience was to be apprehended and lieutenant colonel hill found it necessary to change his position in the height of action so critical an order was executed by the regiment with the utmost steadiness and bravery the enemy after an attack of three hours were totally repulsed and fled toward fort edward setting fire to fort anne but leaving a sawmill and a blockhouse in good repair which were afterward possessed by the kings troops  the  th regiment acquired during their expedition about thirty prisoners some stores and baggage and colors of the  d hampshire regiment  one unlucky accident happened to counterbalance in some degree this success captain montgomery an officer of great merit was wounded early in the action and was in the act of being dressed by the surgeon when the regiment changed ground being unable to help himself he and the surgeon were taken prisoners i since hear he has been well treated and is in a fair way of recovery at albany   th and  0th july the army very much fatigued many parts of it having wanted their provisions for two days almost the whole their tents and baggage assembled in their present position the right wing occupies the heights of skenesborough in two lines the right flank to the mountains covered by the regiment of reidesels dragoons en potence the left to the wood creek  the brunswick troops under major general reidesel upon castletown river with breymans corpse upon the communication of roads leading to putney and rutland the regiment of hesse hanau are posted at the head of east creek to preserve the communication with the camp at castletown river and secure the bateaux  brigadier frasers corpse is in the center ready to move on either wing of the army  the scattered remains of the enemy are at fort edward on the hudsons river where they have been joined as i am informed by general putnam with a considerable corpse of fresh troops  roads are opening for the army to march to them by fort anne and the wood creek is clearing of fallen trees sunken stones and other obstacles to give passage to bateaux for carrying artillery stores provisions and camp equipage these are laborious works but the spirit and zeal of the troops are sufficient to surmount them some little time must also be allowed for the supplies of provisions to overtake us in the mean time all possible diligence is using at ticonderoga to get the gunboats provision vessels and a proper quantity of bateaux into lake george a corpse of the army will be ordered to penetrate by that route which will afterward be the route for the magazines and a junction of the whole is intended at fort edward  i transmit to your lordship herewith returns of the killed and wounded and lists of such parts of provisions and stores taken from the enemy as could be collected in so short a time  i have the honor to be with the greatest respect your lordships etc   no viii copy of a letter from lieutenant general burgoyne to lord george germain dated skenesborough july         private  my lord having given your lordship a detail in my public letter of this date of the late transactions i now do myself the honor to state to your lordship such circumstances as appear to me more proper for a private communication  mr peters and mr jessup who came over to canada last autumn and proposed to raise battalions one from the neighborhood of albany the other from charlotte county are confident of success as the army advances their battalions are now in embryo but very promising they have fought and with spirit sir guy carleton has given me blank commissions for the officers to fill up occasionally and the agreement with them is that the commissions are not to be so effective till two thirds of the battalions are raised some hundreds of men a third part of them with arms have joined me since i have penerated this place professing themselves loyalists and wishing to serve some to the end of the war some for the campaign though i am without instructions upon this subject i have not hesitated to receive them and as fast as companies can be formed i shall post the officers till a decision can be made upon the measure by my superiors i mean to employ them particularly upon detachments for keeping the country in awe and procuring cattle their real use i expect will be great in the preservation of the national troops but the impression which will be caused upon public opinion should provincials be seen acting vigorously in the cause of the king will be yet more advantageous and i trust fully justify the expense  the manifesto of which i enclosed your lordship a copy in my last dispatches and herewith send a duplicate has great effect where the country is not in the power of the rebels where it is the committees turn all their efforts to counteract it they watch or imprison all suspected persons compel the people in general to take arms and to drive the cattle and to burn the corn under penalty of immediate death great numbers have been hanged should these wretches succeed to make a desert of the country by fire and massacre it will at least be a pleasing reflection that while advantages are reaped from the clement part of the manifesto they and not the kings troops are the executioners of its threats  your lordship will have observed i have made no mention of the indians in the pursuit from ticonderoga it is not possible to draw them in many respects from the plunder of that place and i confidentially acknowledge this is not the only instance in which i have found little more than a name if under the management of their conductors they are indulged for interested reasons in all the caprices and humors of spoiled children like them they grow more unreasonable and importunate upon every new favor were they left to themselves enormities too horrid to think of would ensue guilty and innocent women and infants would be a common prey  this is the character of the lower canadian indians who alone have been with the army hitherto i am informed the outawas and other remote nations who are within two days march of joining me are more brave and more tractable that they profess war not pillage they are under the directions of a m st luc a canadian gentleman of honor and parts and one of the best partisans the french had last war and of one langlade the very man who projected and executed with these very nations the defeat of general braddock my first intention was to turn this whole corpse to the connecticut immediately to force a supply of provisions to intercept reinforcements and to confirm the jealousy i have in many ways endeavored to excite in the new england provinces but finding that the enemy are laboring to remove their magazines from forts george and edward and every where destroying the roads and preparing to drive and burn the country toward albany i have determined to employ them to prevent if possible by their terror the continuance of those operations and after arriving at albany they may be employed to renew the alarm toward connecticut and boston  your lordship will pardon me if i a little lament that my orders do not give me the latitude i ventured to propose in my original project for the campaign to make a real effort instead of a feint upon new england as things have turned out were i at liberty to march in force immediately by my left instead of my right i should have little doubt of subduing before winter the provinces where the rebellion origiginated  if my late letters reach mr how i still hope this plan may be adopted from albany in the mean while my utmost exertions shall continue according to my instructions to force a junction  i have sent some indians through the woods in the hope of their reaching st ledger with the account of my progress now is the critical time for his push upon the mohawk i have certain intelligence that all the country round fort stanwix is in alarm but i imagine it proceeds from the appearance of some savages detached by colonel butler not apprehending st ledger can be got quite so forward   second no viii to lord george german camp near saratoga august  0      my lord in my last dispatch a duplicate of which will be enclosed herewith i had the honor to inform your lordship of the proceedings of the army under my command to the  0th of july  from that period to the   th of august every possible measure was employed to bring forward bateaux provisions and ammunition from fort george to the first navigable part of hudsons river a distance of eighteen miles the roads in some parts steep and in others wanting great repair of the horses furnished by contrat in canada not more than a third part was yet arrived the delay was not imputable to neglect but to the natural accidents attending so long and intricate a combination of land and water carriage fifty team of oxen which had been collected in the country through which i had marched were added to assist the transport but these resources together were found far inadequate to the purposes of feeding the army and forming a magazine at the same time exceeding heavy rains augmented the impediments it was often necessary to employ ten or twelve oxen upon a single bateau and after the utmost exertions for the fifteen days above stated there were not above four days provision before hand nor above ten bateaux in the river  intelligence had reached me that lieutenant colonel st ledger was before fort stanwix which was defended the main army of the enemy opposed to me was at stillwater a place between saratoga and the mouth of the mohawk  a rapid movement forward appeared to be of the utmost consequence at this period the enemy could not have proceeded up the mohawk without putting themselves between two fires in case colonel st ledger should have succeeded and at best being cut off by my army from albany they must either therefore have stood an action have fallen back toward albany or have passed the hudsons river in order to secure a retreat to new england higher up which ever of these measures they had taken so that the kings army had been enabled to advance colonel st legers operations would have been assisted a junction with him probably secured and the whole country of the mohawk opened to maintain the communication with fort george during such a movement so as to be supplied by daily degrees at a distance continually increasing was an obvious impossibility the army was much too weak to have afforded a chain of posts escorts for every separate transport would have been a still greater drain nor could any have been made so strong as to force their way through such positions as the enemy might take in one nights march from the white creek where they had a numerous militia had the enemy remained supine through fear or want of comprehending so palpable an advantage the physical impossibility of being supplied by degrees from fort george was still in force because a new necessity of land carriage for nine miles arises at stillwater and in the proportion that carriages had been brought forward to that place the transport must have ceased behind  the alternative therefore was short either to relinquish the favorable opportunity of advancing upon the enemy or to attempt other resources of supply  it was well known that the enemys supplies in live cattle from a large tract of country passed by the route of manchester arlington and other parts of the hampshire grants to bennington in order to be occasionally conveyed from thence to the main army a large deposit of corn and of wheel carriages was also formed at the same place and the usual guard was militia though it varied in numbers from day to day a scheme was formed to surprise bennington the possession of the cattle and carriages would certainly have enabled the army to leave their distant magazines and to have acted with energy and dispatch success would also have answered many secondary purposes  lieut col baume an officer well qualified for the undertaking was fixed upon to command he had under him  00 dismounted dragoons of the regiment of riedesel captain frasers marksmen which were the only british all the canadian volunteers a party of the provincials who perfectly knew the country  00 indians and two light pieces of cannon the whole detachment amounted to abo ut  00 men the instructions were positive to keep the regular corpse posted while thel ight troops felt their way and not to incur the danger of being surrounded or having a retreat cut off  in order to facilitate this operation and to be ready to take advantage of its success the army moved up the east shore of hudsons river on the   th a bridge was formed of rafts over which the advanced corpse passed and encamped at saratoga lieutenant colonel breymans corpse were posted near batten kill and upon intelligence from colonel baume that the enemy were stronger at bennington than expected and were aware of his attack that corpse consisting of the brunswick grenadiers light infantry and chasseurs were sent forward to sustain him  it since appears that lieutenant colonel baume not having been able to complete his march undiscovered was joined at a place called sancoix mills about four miles short of bennington by many people professing themselves to be loyalists a provincial gentleman of confidence who had been sent with the detachment as knowing the country and the character of the inhabitants was so incautious as to leave at liberty such as took the oath of allegiance  his credulity and their profligacy caused the first misfortune colonel baume was induced to proceed without sufficient knowledge of the ground his design was betrayed the men who had taken the oaths were the first to fire upon him he was attacked on all sides he showed great personal courage but was overpowered by numbers  during this time lieutenant colonel breyman was upon the march through a heavy rain and such were the other impediments stated in that officers report of bad roads tired horses difficulties in passing artillery carriages etc that he was from eight in the morning of the   th to four in the afternoon of the following day making about twentyfour miles  he engaged fought gallantly and drove the enemy from three several heights but was too late to succor colonel baume who was made prisoner and a considerable part of his dragoons were killed or taken the failure of ammunition from the accidental breaking to pieces of a tumbril unfortunately obliged lieutenant colonel breyman to retire conquering troops and to leave behind two pieces of cannon besides two which had been lost by lieutenant colonel baume the indians made good their retreat from the first affair as did captain fraser with part of his company and many of the provincials and canadians  the loss as at present appears amounts to about  00 men killed and taken in both actions and twentysix officers mostly prisoners but men who were dispersed in the woods drop in daily a correct return shall be transmitted to your lordship the first opportunity  this my lord is a true state of the event i have not dwelt upon errors because in many instances they were counterbalanced by spirit the enemy will of course find matter of parade in the acquisition of four pieces of cannon but that apart they have small cause of exultation their loss in killed and wounded being more than double to ours by the confession of their prisoners and deserters and of many inhabitants who were witnesses to the burial of their dead  the chief subject of regret on our side after that which any loss of gallant men naturally occasions is the disappointment of not obtaining live cattle and the loss of time in bringing forward the magazines  this heavy work is now nearly completed and a new bridge of boats is thrown over the hudsons river opposite to saratoga the former one of rafts having been carried away by the swell of water after the late continual rains when enabled to move nothing within my scale of talent shall be left unattempted to fulfill his majestys orders and i hope circumstances will be such that my endeavors may be in some degree assisted by a cooperation of the army under sir william how  i have the honor to be with great respect your lordships most obedient and most humble servant signed j burgoyne the letter that follows no   is also materially referrable to no      no ix copy of a letter from lieutenant general burgoyne to lord george germain dated camp near saratoga august  0      private my lord i need not enlarge upon the concern i have in communicating any sinister events i am persuaded your lordship will give me credit for partaking every sentiment that your lordship or any other man warmed with principle and zeal in this contest can feel  in regard to the affair of saintcoick i have only to add to the public account that if ever there was a situation to justify enterprise and exertion out of the beaten track of military service it was that in which i found myself had i succeeded i should have effected a junction with st ledger and been now before albany and i flatter myself i need only mention those views to show that in hazarding this expedition i had the soundest principles of military reasoning on my side viz that the advantages to be expected from success were in a great degree superior to the evils that could attend miscarriage the secondary purposes to which i alluded in the public letter were to try the affections of the country to complete the provincial corpse many recruits for which were unable to escape from their villages without a force to encourage and protect them and to distract the councils of the enemy by continuing their jealousy toward new england  major general reidesel has pressed upon me repeatedly the mounting his dragoons the men were animated with the same desire and i conceived it a most favorable occasion to give into their ideas and solicitations because in exerting their zeal to fulfill their favorite purpose they necessarily would effect the greater purpose of my own the rest of the troops were selected from such as would least weaken the solid strength of the army in case of ill success and i thought it expedient to take a little trial of the provincials and canadians before i might have occasion for them in more important actions  the original detachment could not have been made larger without opening roads and other preparations of time nor should i have thought it justifiable to expose the best troops to loss upon a collateral action had my instructions been followed or could mr breyman have marked at the rate of two miles an hour any given twelve hours out of the two and thirty success would probably have ensued misfortune would certainly have been avoided i did not think it prudent in the present crisis to mark these circumstances to the public so strongly as i do in confidence to your lordship but i rely and i will venture to say i expect because i think justice will warrant the expectation that while for the sake of public harmony that necessary principle for conducting nice and laborious service i color the faults of the execution your lordship will in your goodness be my advocate to the king and to the world in vindication of the plan  the consequences of this affair my lord have little effect upon the strength or spirits of the army but the prospect of the campaign in other respects is far less prosperous than when i wrote last in spire of st legers victory fort stanwix holds out obstinately i am afraid the expectations of sir j johnson greatly fail in the rising of the country on this side i find daily reason to doubt the sincerity of the resolution of the professing loyalists i have about  00 but not half of them armed who may be depended upon the rest are trimmers merely actuated by interest the great bulk of the country is undoubtedly with the congress in principle and in zeal and their measures are executed with a secrecy and dispatch that are not to be equalled wherever the kings forces point militia to the amount of three or four thousand assemble in twentyfour hours they bring with them their subsistence etc and the alarm over they return to their farms the hampshire grants in particular a country unpeopled and almost unknown in the last war now abounds in the most active and most rebellious race of the continent and hangs like a gathering storm upon my left in all parts the industry and managment in driving cattle and removing corn are indefatigable and certain and it becomes impracticable to move without portable magazines another most embarrassing circumstance is the want of communication with sir william how of the messengers i have sent i know of two being hanged and am ignorant whether any of the rest arrived the same fate has probably attended those dispatched by sir william how for only one letter is come to hand informing me that his intention is for pensylvania that washington has detached sullivan with   00 men to albany that putnam is in the highlands with  000 men that after my arrival at albany the movements of the enemy must guide mine but that he wished the enemy might be driven out of the province before any operation took place against the connecticut that sir henry clinton remained in the command in the neighborhood of new york and would act as occurrences might direct  no operation my lord has yet been undertaken in my favor the highlands have not even been threatened the consequence is that putnam has detached two brigades to mr gates who is now strongly posted near the mouth of the mohawkriver with an army superior to mine in troops of the congress and as many militia as he pleases he is likewise far from being deficient in artillery having received all the pieces that were landed from the french ships which got into boston  had i a latitude in my orders i should think it my duty to wait in this position or perhaps as far back as fort edward where my communication with lake george would be perfectly secure till some event happened to assist my movement forward but my orders being positive to force a junction with sir william how i apprehend i am not at liberty to remain inactive longer than shall be necessary to collect twentyfive days provision and to receive the reinforcement of the additional companies the german drafts and recruits now and unfortunately only now on lake champlain the waiting the arrival of this reinforcement is of indispensible necessity because from the hour i pass the hudsons river and proceed toward albany all safety of communication ceases i must expect a large body of the enemy from my left will take post behind me i have put out of the question the waiting longer than the time necessary for the foregoing purposes because the attempt then critical depending on adventure and the fortune that often accompanies it and hardly justifiable but by orders from the state would afterward be consummately desperate i mean my lord that by moving soon though i should meet with insurmountable difficulties to my progress i shall at least have the chance of fighting my way back to ticonderoga but the season a little further advanced the distance increased and the march unavoidably tardy because surrounded by enemies a retreat might be shut by impenetrable bars or the elements and at the same time no possible means of existence remain in the country  when i wrote more confidently i little foresaw that i was to be left to pursue my way through such a tract of country and hosts of foes without any cooperation from new york nor did i then think the garrison of ticonderoga would fall to my share alone a dangerous experiment would it be to leave that post in weakness and too heavy a drain it is upon the lifeblood of my force to give it due strength  i yet do not despond  should i succeed in forcing my way to albany and find that country in a state to subsist my army i shall think no more of a retreat but at the worst fortify there and await sir w howes operations  whatever may be my fate my lord i submit my actions to the breast of the king and to the candid judgment of my profession when all the motives become public and i rest in the confidence that whatever decision may be passed upon my conduct my good intent will not be questioned  i cannot close so serious a letter without expressing my fullest satisfaction in the behavior and countenance of the troops and my complete confidence that in all trials they will do whatever can be expected from men devoted to their king and country  i have the honor to be etc j burgoyne p s upon reperusing this letter i am apprehensive that the manner in which i have expressed myself respecting the reinforcement being only upon lake champlain may seem ambiguous  i do not mean to impute the delay to any thing but accidents nor do i mean to contest sir guy carletons reasoning upon not complying with my requisitions to garrison ticonderoga i only lament it     x copy of a letter from sir william how to lieutenant general burgoyne dated new york july the   th      dear sir i have received yours of the second instant on the   th have fince heard from the rebel army of your being in possession of ticonderoga which is a great event carried without loss i have received your two letters viz from plymouth and quebec your last of the   th may and shall observe the contents there is a report of a messenger of yours to me having been taken and the letter discovered in a double wooden canteen you will know if it was of any consequence nothing of it has transpired to us i will observe the same rules in writing to you as you propose in your letters to me washington is waiting our motions here and has detached sullivan with about   00 men as i learn to albany my intention is for pensylvania where i expect to meet washington but if he goes to the northward contrary to my expectations and you can keep him at bay be assured i shall soon be after him to relieve you  after your arrival at albany the movements of the enemy will guide yours but my wishes are that the enemy be drove out of this province before any operation takes place in connecticut sir henry clinton remains in the command here and will act as occurences my direct putnam is in the highlands with about  000 men success be ever with you  yours etc william how   second no x sir guy carletons letter this

craig the  th instant and heartily condole with you upon the very disagreeable accounts they contain all which i sincerely lamented both on the public account and your own  this unfortunate event it is to be hoped will in future prevent ministers from pretending to direct operations of war in a country at three thousand miles distance of which they have so little knowledge as not to be able to distinguish between good bad or interested advices or to give positive orders in matters which from their nature are ever upon the change so that the expedience or propriety of a measure at one moment may be totally inexpedient or improper in the next  having given over all hopes of being relieved this fall i determined upon sending home captain foy to furnish his majestys confidential servants and

sir i take the liberty of informing your excellency that there has yet been no arrangement made for marching the field artillery by land should the corpse of troops upon an expedition under your command in the course of the campaign quit the lakes champlain and george and the rivers  i have upon the strictest information which could be procured reason to believe that neither carriages nor horses will be to be had nearer than albany should the route of your army be that way and even in that country it will necessarily require a considerable time before any can be got all which must necessarily delay the operations of the campaign after the reduction of ticonderoga i therefore submit to your excellencys consideration whether horses and such ammunitioncarriages as may be wanted should not be procured for the service of the campaign for the field artillery attached to the corpse of troops your excellency is to command this campaign  i have the honor to be sir with the greatest respect your excellencys most obedient and most humble servant m phillips major general commanding the royal artillery in canada  his excellency lieutenant general burgoyne  copy of a letter to major general phillips respecting horses dated montreal june        sir i have the honor of your letter of this days date informing me that no arrangement has yet been made for moving the field artillery by land and that upon the best information you can obtain neither carriages nor horses can be procured on the other side lake champlain nearer than albany  in consequence of this representation i have to request you to give in your opinion upon the mode of procuring horses and carriages from this country combining the considerations of dispatch sufficiency economy toward government and i wish to know the opinion as soon as possible  i am with truest regard sir your obedient humble servant j burgoyne lieutenant general  major general phillips  extracts of letters from major general phillips etc extract of a letter from major general phillips to lieutenant general burgoyne montreal june        i have the honor of your excellencys letter to me of yesterday in answer to one i wrote on the subject of the fieldartillery being supplied with horses etc etc  you are pleased sir to order me to give an opinion upon the mode of procuring horses and carriages from this country combining the consideration of dispatch sufficiency and economy toward government  there are but two modes of procuring horses for the service supposing the country is not to furnish them upon corvees the one is by purchasing of horses upon the account of government the other by contract  the first of these modes has always appeared to me difficult uncertain and full of openings for every species of imposition and the expense uncertain  government must trust various people to buy horses and in this country it will not be possible to procure any persons who will not immediately pursue the views of gaining money to themselves with a consideration for the kings service add to this that it will become such a charge that many commissaries must be appointed and various other officers of that sort etc which being a mixture of inspectors into the purchases of horses and necessarily also at times the being purchasers it will be difficult ever to ascertain the price and seldom that the goodness of horses can be depended on  i have seen in my service this mode attempted but it has to my knowledge failed i must allow that could it be carried into execution complete it would be the cheapest for government but taking into consideration the various impositions which will arise and that the setting out on a plan of this nature will require a very large sum of money perhaps from  0000l to  0000l to be entrusted into various hands i freely give it as my opinion that it is not a perfect plan the contracting for a certain number of horses at a fixed price for the hire by day reduces the whole to a very simple and therefore generally a certain plan it depends in the setting out by making as cheap as fair and just a bargain on the part of government as can be and being so made that the military and civil officers do their duty by attending to the receiving of horses only as they are fitting for service the contractor has his interest so directly connected with fulfilling his contract as upon failure it ceases that he will exert all means to do it and the care of government will be that it be done honestly and completely  i have thus obeyed your excellencys orders and given an opinion which i submit entirely to your consideration   extract of a letter to nathaniel day esquire commissary general etc dated montreal june  th      i beg the favor of you to calculate what number of horses and carriages supposing them such as are in common use in canada will be sufficient for conveying by land thirty days provision for  0000 men together with about  000 gallons of rum and you will please to make me your report as soon as possible   extract of a letter to sir guy carleton montreal june        having had the honor to represent to your excellency the necessity of being provided with a certain number of horses and carriages for the artillery victual and other indispensible purposes of the army when it shall be obliged to quit the borders of the lakes and rivers and having understood from your excellency that such provision could not be made by the ordinary methods of covee and that if proposed without compulsion upon the country the effect would be precarious dilatory and expensive i have the honor now to lay before your excellency proposals for contracts for an expeditious supply of horses for the artillery and  00 carts with two horses each for the other purposes  i am too ignorant of the prices of the country to offer any judgment upon the reasonableness of these proposals nor have i any long acquaintance with mr jordan or other motive for wishing him the preference if other persons can be found equally capable responsible and expeditious i have only thus far interfered upon a conviction after considering the route the kings orders direct and taking all possible methods of information upon the supply to be expected as we proceed that to depend upon the country altogether would be to hazard the expedition  your excellency will observe that in order to save the public expense as much as possible i have reduced this requisition much below what would be adequate to the service and i mean to trust to the resources of the expedition for the rest  00 carts will barely carry fourteen days provisions at a time and major general phillips means to demand as few horses as possible subject to whatever future augmentations future services may require the present number wanted will be about  00 there will then remain unprovided for for expeditious movement the transport of bateaux from lake george to hudsons river and the carriage of the tents of the army and many other contingencies that i need not trouble your excellency to point out to you   extract of a letter to general harvey montreal may         you have permitted me as formerly to write to you confidentially i take the first conveyance to renew a correspondence so pleasing and honorable to myself and that may in some cases become beneficial to the public service it shall never be employed but to convey truths to do justice to facts and persons and to secure myself in the continuance of an esteem so valuable to me as yours against appearances and misrepresentations  i have reason to be exceedingly satisfied with all that has been done and with most things that are doing exertions have been made during the winter which was remarkably favorable in all the departments and preparations are very forward those that have been committed to the directions of general phillips have been executed with a diligence precision and foresight that entitle him to the fullest praise the troops are in a state of health almost unprecedented and their spirits and general improvement are equally objects of great pleasure and promise to this agreeable representation i have the happiness to add that sir guy carleton has received me and the orders i brought in a manner that in my opinion does infinite honor to his public and private character  that he should have wished for the lead in active and important military operations is very natural that he thinks he has some cause of resentment for the general tenor of treatment he has received from some of the ministers is discernible but neither his disappointment nor his personal feelings operate against his duty and i am convinced he means to forward the kings measures entrusted to my hands with all the zeal he could have employed had they rested in his own  my intention is during my advance to ticonderoga and siege of that post for a siege i apprehend it must be to give all possible jealousy on the side of connecticut if i can by maneuver make them suspect that after the reduction of ticonderoga my views are pointed that way it may make the connecticut forces very cautious of leaving their own frontiers and much facilitate my progress to albany i mention this intention only to lord george and yourself and i do it lest from any intelligence of my motions that may reach england indirectly it should be supposed i have suffered myself to be diverted from the main object of my orders the king and his majestys ministers may rest assured that whatever demonstrations i may endeavor to impose upon the enemy i shall really make no movement that can procrastinate my progress to albany  one thing more occurs i had the surprise and mortification to find a paper handed about at montreal publishing the whole design of the campaign almost as accurately as if it had been copied from the secretary of states letter my own caution has been such that not a man in my own family has been let into the secret sir guy carletons i am confident has been equal i am therefore led to doubt whether imprudence has not been committed from private letters from england and wish you would ask my friend doyley to whom my very affectionate compliments whether there is any person within the line of ministerial communication that he can suspect to be so unguarded it is not of great consequence here except as far as regards st legers expedition but such a trick may be of most prejudicial consequence in other cases and should be guarded against   extract of a letter to general harvey camp on the river bouquet near lake champlain june         i have had to contend against wet weather that rendered the roads almost impracticable at the carrying places and consequently the passage of the bateaux and exceedingly dilatory besides a great deal of contrary wind indeed the combination of land and water movement bad roads inactivity and sometimes disobedience in the country and a thousand other difficulties and accidents unknown in other services disconcert all arrangements i do not mention this upon my own account as i do not hold myself responsible for delays within the province of canada but i mention it to do justice to others who i really think have infinite merit in overcoming the obstructions we have met with and who ought to be justified against some acquaintances of yours and mine who travel across a map very fast and are very free in their comments when others who have ten times their knowledge and resources do not answer their predictions and expectations  i have been exceedingly distressed in regard to the brigadiers of this army sir guy carleton the day i took leave of him put into my hands an extract of a letter from the secretary at war approving the appointment of those gentlemen but observing that whenever any of them should lead their brigades out of the province of canada in order to join the troops under general how there would be a necessity for their command ceasing as brigadiers etc  were this to be put in execution according to the letter of the order and the geographical limits of canada and supposing major general phillips at the same time to be employed solely in the artillery i should find myself at the head of an army to undertake a siege and afterward pursue objects of importance and possibly of time without a single intermediate british officer between the lieutenant general commanding pro tempore in chief and a lieutenant colonel it would be preposterous and impertinent in me to say one word more to you as an officer upon the impossibility of methodizing or conducting such an army with such a total deficiency of staff had lord barrington condescended to have communicated his intentions to me in london i think i could have convinced him of the impropriety as it is i must conclude that the spirit of the order goes only to prevent those gentlemen bearing a higher rank and pay than senior lieutenant colonels serving in the same army and that therefore there can be no fault in keeping it dormant till the junction takes place in other words i look upon mine to be the canada army till such time as i am in communication with general how so as to make part of his force and consequently without measuring degrees north and south that the arrangements made in canada and approved of by the king remain in force till that time  i am persuaded my dear general you will support me in this liberty if such it is to be called not only as the absolute order and method of the service depends upon it but also to avoid to these gentlemen who have really great merit the vexation and the ridicule of being deprived of their rank and pay in the hour of that very service with a view to which their appointment was originally made i think i can answer that the junction made and the reasons for reverting to their former ranks become obvious they will submit to his majestys pleasure without a murmur   extract of a letter from lieutenant general burgoyne to general harvey head quarters skenesborough july         the mere compliment of service i have given to the troops in orders and in the relation designed for the gazette is not doing them sufficient justice it is a duty in me further through you and i know i shall impose a pleasing task on you to assure the king that their behavior is as uniformly good in the camp as in action  after what i have publicly mentioned of fraser i am sure i need not press you in his favor i cannot but feel confident in the hope that his majestys grace will find its way through all obstacles to prevent so discouraging a circumstance as the return of this gallant officer to the mere duty of lieutenant colonel at the head of one battalion after having given ascendancy to the kings troops and done honor to his profession by the most spirited actions in critical periods of two successive campaigns  you will observe sir both in the public letter and in the order of battle which captain gardner will put into your hands that major general phillips is occasionally employed separately from the strict line of his department this does not proceed from inattention to the explanation of his majestys pleasure two years ago but from absolute necessity the staff being composed without any british major general brigadier fraser being posted where he is of infinite use at the head of the advanced corpse the service would suffer in the most material degree if the talents of general phillips were not suffered to extend beyond the limits of the artillery and i hold myself fully justified in continuing the great use of his assistance under this extension by what i understand to be the signification of the kings pleasure to sir guy carleton viz that this measure must not be made a precedent but not forbidding it during the present exigency  i flatter myself the king will be satisfied with the diligence used in taking the field as well as with the subsequent operations if not my disappointment can only proceed from my own deficiency in stating the embarrassments i found notwithstanding previous preparations and cordial assistances remote situations of the troops currents winds roads want of materials for caulking the vessels inactivity and desertion of the canadian corvees were all against me a great difficulty lay in providing horses and carriages for the bare transport of provisions and tents when we should arrive at fort george or any other place where the army should have no resource of water carriage i found an active and i think a reasonable contractor who supplied this necessity at a much cheaper rate than it could have been done any other way i enclose a copy of the contract to the treasury to which i refer you you will observe that i have limited the number to the mere indispensible purposes of provisions and tents trusting to the country for the further assistance of officers baggage and the other attirail of an army experience already shows me that i judged right in not trusting to the country for more for had this precaution been omitted i should be bound fast to the spot where i am or obliged to return by water to ticonderoga  i avow also to you my advice to general carleton to grant commissions to two provincial battalions to be raised from albany and charlotte county by a mr jessup and a mr peters upon condition that the commissions should not take place till two thirds of the corpse should be effective provincial corpse acting zealously in the kings cause must have great impression upon public opinion and will besides in fact be of singular use to the ease and preservation of the regular troops  upon this principle therefore i have not hesitated further to receive and to pay such loyalists as have come in with their arms since the success of ticonderoga and wish to be employed though i have not power to grant commissions i post the officers and form them into companies till the measure can be decided by those who have more authority  i hope all these articles of expense will meet with the support of your opinion and have only to add that as no job shall be done myself so will i use all efforts to prevent such being done by others  i am indispensibly obliged to wait some time on this position to clear roads and make bridges which is great labor in this country and to bring up a stock of provision and also to give time to the gunboats bateaux and provision vessels to be put into lake george to scour that lake and secure the future route of the magazines i propose to possess fort edward at the same time that the force is ready to move down the lake by which means if the enemy do not evacuate fort george the garrison must inevitably be caught in the mean while i have ordered reidesel to make roads reconnoitre the country and make all other possible feints of a march to the connecticut and by some other measures i hope to give alarms that way   instructions for lieutenant colonel baume on a secret expedition to the connecticut river amendments made by genesis burgoyne  the erasures were made by genesis burgoyne the erasures are printed in italics and the amendments in the opposite column  the object of your expedition is to try the affections of the country to disconcert the councils of the enemy to mount the reidesels dragoons to complete peterss corpse and to obtain large supplies of cattle horses and carriages  the several corpse of which the enclosed is a list are to be under your command  the troops must take no tents and what little baggage is carried by officers must be on their own bat horses  you are to proceed by the route from batten kill to arlington and take post there so as to secure the pass from manchester you are to remain at arlington till the detachment of the provincials under the command of captain sherwood shall join you from the southward  you are then to proceed to manchester where you will take post so as to secure the pass of the mountains on the road from manchester to rockingham from hence you will detach the indians and light troops to the northward toward otter creek on their return and also receiving intelligence that no enemy is in force in the neighborhood of rockingham   you will proceed by the road over the mountains to rockingham where you will take post this will be the most distant part on the expedition      upon the connecticut river    and must be proceeded upon with caution as you will have the defile of the mountains behind you which might make a retreat difficult you must therefore endeavor to be well informed of the force of the enemys militia in the neighboring country  should you find it may with prudence be effected  you are to remain there as long as necessary to fulfill the intention of the expedition from thence   and you are afterward to descend by the connecticut river to brattlebury and from that place by the quickest march you are to return by the great road to albany    while the indians and light troops are detached up the river  during your whole progress your detachments are to have orders to bring in to you all horses fit to mount the dragoons under your command or to serve as bat horses to the troops they are likewise to bring in   saddles and bridles as can be found      together with as many    the number of horses requisite besides those necessary for mounting the regiment of dragoons ought to be   00 if you can bring more for the use of the army it will be so much the better  your parties are likewise to bring in wagons and other convenient carriages with as many draft oxen as will be necessary to draw them and all cattle sit for slaughter milch cows excepted which are to be left for the use of the inhabitants regular receipts in the form hereto subjoined are to be given in all places where any of the abovementioned articles are taken to such persons as have remained in their habitations and otherwise complied with the terms of general burgoynes manifesto but no receipts to be given to such as are known to be acting in the service of the rebels      as you will have with you persons perfectly acquainted with the abilities of the country it may perhaps be advisable to tax the several districts with the portions of the several articles and limit the hours for their delivery and should you find it necescessary to move before such delivery can be made hostages of the most respectable people should be taken to secure their following you the ensuing day all possible means are to be used to prevent plundering  as it is probable that captain sherwood who is already detached to the southward and will join you at arlington will drive in a considerable quantity of cattle and horses to you you will therefore send in this cattle to the army with a proper detachment from peterss corpse to cover them in order to disencumber yourself but you must always keep the regiments of dragoons compact  the dragoons themselves must ride and take care of the horses of the regiment those horses which are destined for the use of the army must be tied together by strings of ten each in order that one man may lead ten horses you will give the unarmed men of peterss corpse to conduct them and inhahitants whom you can trust you must always take your camps in good position but at the same time where there is pasture and you must have a chain of sentinels round your cattle and horses when grazing  colonel skeene will be with you as much as possible in order to assist you with his advice to help you to distinguish the good subjects from the bad to procure you the best intelligence of the enemy and to choose those people who are to bring me the accounts of your progress and success  when you find it necessary to halt for a day or two you must always entrench the camp of the regiment of dragoons in order never to risk an attack or affront from the enemy  as you will return with the regiment of dragoons mounted you must always have a detachment of captain frasers or peterss corpse in front of the column and the same in the rear in order to prevent your falling into an ambuscade when you march through the woods  you will use all possible means to make the country believe that the troops under your command are the advanced corpse of the army and that it is intended to pass the connecticut on the road to boston you will likewise have it insinuated   that the main army from albany is to be joined at springfield by a corpse of troops from rhode island    insinuate  you will send off occasionally cattle or carriages to prevent being too much incumbered and will give me as frequent intelligence of your situation as possible  it is highly probable that the corpse under mr warner now supposed to be at manchester will retreat before you but should they contrary to expectation be able to collect in great force and post themselves advantageously it is left to your discretion to attack them or not always bearing in mind that your corpse is too valuable to let any considerable loss be hazarded on this occasion  should any corpse be moved from mr arnolds main army in order to intercept your retreat you are to take as strong a post as the country will afford and send the quickest intelligence to me and you may depend on my making such a movement as shall put the enemy between two fires or otherwise effectually sustain you  it is imagined the progress of the whole of this expedition may be effected in about a fortnight but every movement of it must depend upon your success in obtaining such supply of provisions as will enable you to subsist for your return to the army in case you can get no more      and should not the  be able to reach albany before your expedition should be completed i will find means to send you notice of it and give your route another direction  all persons acting in committees or any officers acting under the directions of congress either civil or military are to be made prisoners  batten kill   th august      sir i had the honor of acquainting your excellency by a man sent yesterday evening by colonel skeene to headquarters of the several corpse under my command being encamped at saratoga as well as of my intention to proceed the next morning at five oclock the corpse moved at that time and marched a mile when i received a letter from brigadier general fraser signifying your excellencys order to post the corpse advantageously on batten kill till i should receive fresh instructions from your excellency the corpse is now encamped at that place and wait your excellencys orders i will not trouble you sir with the various reports which spread as they seem rather to be founded on the different interests and feelings of the people who occasion them  i have the honor to be most respectfully your excellencys most obedient and humble servant f baume the reinforcement of fifty chasseurs which your excellency was pleased to order joined me last night at eleven oclock    general burgoyne  cambridge   th august      sir in consequence of your excellencys orders i moved this morning at four oclock with the corpse under my command and after a march of sixteen miles arrived at cambridge at four in the evening on the road i received intelligence of forty or fifty of the rebels being left to guard some cattle i immediately ordered thirty of the provincials and fifty savages to quicken their march in hopes to surprise them they took five prisoners in arms who declared themselves to be in the service of the congress yet the enemy received advice of our approach and abandoned the house they were posted in the provincials and savages continued their march about a mile when they fell in with a party of fifteen men who fired upon our people and immediately took to the woods with the greatest precipitation the fire was quick on our side but i cannot learn if the enemy sustained any loss a private of captain sherwoods company was the only one who was slightly wounded in the thigh from the many people who came from bennington they agree that the number of the enemy amounted to   00 i will be particularly careful on my approach at that place to be fully informed of their strength and situation and take the precautions necessary to fulfill both the orders and instructions of your excellency  i cannot ascertain the number of cattle carts and wagons taken here as they have not been as yet collected a few horses have been also brought in but am sorry to acquaint your excellency that the savages either destroy or drive away what is not paid for with ready money if your excellency would allow me to purchase the horses from the savages stipulating the price i think they might be procured cheap otherwise they ruin all they meet with their officers and interpreters not having it in their power to control them your excellency may depend on hearing how i proceed at bennington

the enemy to mount the regiment of reidesel dragoons to complete lieutenant colonel peterss corpse and to procure a large supply of horses for the use of the troops together with cattle and carriages  the route marked for this expedition is to arlington and manchester and in case it should be found that the enemy is not in too great force upon the connecticut riv it is intended to pass the

continue the requisites of the service with every principle of humanity in the mode of obtaining them and it may be proper to inform the country that the means to prevent their cattle and horses being taken for the future will be to resist the enemy when they shall presume to force them and drive them voluntarily to my camp  i have the honor to be etc etc etc j burgoyne   calculations of the number

your excellency to take into consideration the expediency of supplying from canada a garrison for ticonderoga  my communication will widen so much as i proceed the drain upon the army for posts will be so considerable not to speak of detachments and safeguards to protect and to awe the country that if that first diminution is not replaced my effective strength may become inadequate to the services intended my present intelligence is that putnam is collecting an army to oppose me at saratoga fort edward is also talked of to sustain a siege  your excellency will i am sure agree with me that ticonderoga or some other fortified post on the south part of lake champlain ought to be considered on the frontiers of the province of canada i am aware of the difficulties that arise from the manner in which the secretary of states orders are penned but i submit to your excellency whether under the principle laid down in the beginning of the order and afterward repeated that  000 men were held sufficient for the defense of that province you would not be justified in sparing for the purpose of this garrison the overplus of the  000 that may remain after completing my army  and notwithstanding the corpse for the canada service are precisely named by the secretary of state i would further submit whether upon my pressing requisition the garrison might not justifiably be furnished by detachment even though there was no overplus under the following words of the order after haviug secured to him lieutenant general burgoyne every assistance which it is in your power to afford and procure your excellencys zeal for the service and favor toward me will be better interpreters for the latitude i propose than any thing i can further suggest my present purpose sir is to get a sufficient number of gunboats upon the lake george to scour that lake as expeditiously as possible to support them with a proper force to attack fort george on that side while with the main of the army as soon as refreshed and supplied i attack fort edward from hence and therebycut off the communication from albany to fort george and consequently prevent the succor or retreat of that garrison   extract of a letter from lieutenant general burgoyne to sir guy carleton headquarters near fort anne july   th      the construction your excellency puts upon the orders of the secretary of state is too full and decisive for me to presume to trouble you further upon the subject of a garrison for ticonderoga from canada i must do as well as i can but i am sure your excellency as a soldier will think my situation a little difficult a breach into my communication must either ruin my army entirely or oblige me to return in force to restore which might be the loss of the campaign to prevent a breach ticonderoga and fort george must be in very respectable strength and i must besides have posts at fort edward and other carryingplaces these drains added to common accidents and losses of service will necessarily render me very inferior in point of numbers to the enemy whom i must expect always to find strongly posted i ask pardon for dwelling so much upon this subject and have only to add my request to your excellency to forward the additional companies as expeditiously as may be   copy of lieutenant general burgoynes letter to colonel baume near saratoga august         seven at night sir the accounts you have sent me are very satisfactory and i have no doubt of every part of your proceeding continuing to be the same  i beg the favor of you to report whether the road you have passed is practicable and if so if it is convenient for a considerable corpse with cannon  should you find the enemy too strongly posted at bennington and maintaining such a countenance as may make an attack imprudent i wish you to take a post where you can maintain yourself till you receive an answer from me and i will either support you in force or withdraw you  you will please to send off to my camp as soon as you can wagons and draft cattle and likewise such other cattle as are not necessary for your subsistence  let the wagons and carts bring off all the flour and wheat they can that you do not retain for the same purpose this transport must be under the charge of a commission officer  i will write you at full tomorrow in regard to getting horses out of the hands of the savages  in the mean time any you can collect from them fit to mount the regiments at a low price shall be allowed  i am with great esteem sir your most obedient humble servant j burgoyne   no xiii colonel st legers account of occurrences at fort stanwix a minute detail of every operation since my leaving la chine with the detachment entrusted to my care your excellency will permit me to reserve to a time of less hurry and mortification than the present while i enter into the interesting scene before fort stanwix which i invested the  d of august having previously pushed forward lieutenant bird of the kings reigment with thirty of the kings troops and two hundred indians under the direction of captains hare and wilson and the chiefs joseph and bull to seize fast hold of the lower landingplace and thereby cut off the enemys communication with the lower country  this was done with great address by the lieutenant though not attended with the effect i had promised myself occasioned by the slackness of the messasagoes the brigade of provision and ammunition boats i had intelligence of being arrived and disembarked before this party had taken post  the fourth and fifth were employed in making arrangements for opening wood creek which the enemy with the indefatigable labor of one hundred and fifty men for fourteen days had most effectually choked up and the making a temporary road from pine ridges upon fish creek sixteen miles from the fort for a present supply of provision and the transport of our artillery the first was effected by the diligence and zeal of captain bouville assisted by captain harkimer of the indian department with one hundred and ten men in nine days while lieutenant lundy acting as assistant quartermaster general had rendered the road in the worst of weather sufficiently practicable to pass the whole artillery and stores with seven days provision in two days  on the  th in the evening intelligence arrived by my discovering parties on the mohawk river that a reinforcement of eight hundred militia conducted by general herkimer were on their march to relieve the garrison and were actually at that instant at oriska an indian settlement twelve miles from the fort the garrison being apprised of their march by four men who were seen enter the fort in the morning through what was thought an impenetrable swamp i did not think it prudent to wait for them and thereby subject myself to be attacked by a sally from the garrison in the rear while the reinforcement employed me in front i therefore determined to attack them on the march either openly or covertly as circumstances should offer at this time i had not two hundred and fifty of the kings troops in camp the various and extensive operations i was under an absolute necessity of entering into having employed the rest and therefore could not send above eighty white men rangers and troops included with the whole corpse of indians sir john johnson put himself at the head of this party and began his march that evening at five oclock and met the rebel corpse at the same hour the next morning the impetuosity of the indians is not to be described on the sight of the enemy forgetting the judicious disposition formed by sir john and agreed to by themselves which was to suffer the attack to begin with the troops in front while they should be on both flanks and rear they rushed in hatchet in hand and thereby gave the enemys rear an opportunity to escape in relation to the victory it was equally complete as if the whole had fallen nay more so as the two hundred who escaped only served to spread the panic wider but it was not so with the indians their loss was great i must be understood indian computation being only about thirty killed and the like number wounded and in that number some of their favorite chiefs and confidential warriors were slain on the enemys side almost all their principal leaders were slain general herkimer has since died of his wounds it is proper to mention that the four men detached with intelligence of the march of the reinforcement set out the evening before the action and consequently the enemy could have no account of the defeat and were in possession only of the time appointed for their arrival at which as i suspected they made a sally with two hundred and fifty men toward lieutenant birds post to facilitate the entrance of the relieving corpse or bring on a general engagement with every advantage they could wish  captain hoyes was immediately detached to cut in upon their rear while they engaged the lieutenant immediately upon the departure of captain hoyes having learned that lieutenant bird misled by the information of a cowardly indian that sir john was pressed had quitted his post to march to his assistance i marched the detachment of the kings regiment in support of captain hoyes by a road in sight of the garrison which with executive fire from his party immediately drove the enemy into the fort without any further advantage than frightening some squaws and pilfering the packs of the warriors which they left behind them after this affair was over orders were immediately given to complete a twogun battery and mortar beds with three strong redoubts in their rear to enable me in case of another attempt to relieve the garrison by their regimented troops to march out a larger body of the kings troops  captain lernoult was sent with   0 men to the lower landing place where he established himself with great judgment and strength having an enclosed battery of a threepounder opposed to any sally from the fort and another to the side of the country where a relief must approach and the body of his camp deeply entrenched and abbatised  when by the unabating labor of officers and men the smallness of our numbers never admitting of a relief or above three hours cessation for sleep or cooking the batteries and redoubts were finished and new cheeks and axletrees made for the sixpounders those that were sent being reported rotten and unserviceable  it was found that our cannon had not the least effect upon the sodwork of the fort and that our royals had only the power of teizing as a sixinch plank was a sufficient security for their powder magazine as we learnt from the deserters at this time lieutenant glenie of the artillery whom i had appointed to act as assistant engineer proposed a conversion of the royals if i may use the expression into howitzers the ingenuity and feasability of this measure striking me very strongly the business was set about immediately and soon executed when it was found that nothing prevented their operating with the desired effect but the distance their chambers being too small to hold a sufficiency of powder there was nothing now to be done but to approach the town by sap to such a distance that the rampart might be brought within their portice at the same time all materials were preparing to run a mine under their most formidable bastion  in the midst of these operations intelligence was brought in by our scouts of a second corpse of  000 men being on their march the same zeal no longer animated the indians they complained of our thinness of troops and their former losses i immediately called a council of the chiefs encouraged them as much as i could promised to lead them on myself and bring into the field  00 of the best troops they listened to this and promised to follow me and agreed that i should reconnoitre the ground properest for the field of battle the next morning accompanied by some of their chief warriors to settle the plan of operations when upon the ground appointed for the field of battle scouts came in with the account of the first number swelled to  000 immediately after a third that general burgoynes army was cut to pieces and that arnold was advancing by rapid and forced marches with  000 men it was at this moment i began to suspect cowardice in some and treason in others however i returned to camp not without hopes with the assistance of my gallant coadjutor sir john johnson and the influence of the superintending colonels claus and butler of inducing them to meet the enemy a council according to their custom was called to know their resolutions before the breaking up of which i learned that  00 were already decamped in about an hour they insisted that i should retreat or they would be obliged to abandon me i had no other party to take and a hard party it was to troops who could do nothing without them to yield to their resolves and therefore proposed to retire at night sending on before my sick wounded artillery etc down the wood creek covering them by our line of march  this did not fall in with their views which were no less than treacherously committing ravage upon their friends as they had lost the opportunity of doing it upon their enemies to effect this they artfully caused messengers to come in one after the other with accounts of the nearer approaches of the rebels one and the last affirmed that they were within two miles of captain lernoults post not giving entire credit to this and keeping to my resolution of retiring by night they grew furious and abandoned seized upon the officers liquor and clothes in spite of the efforts of their servants and became more formidable than the enemy we had to expect i now thought it time to call in captain lernoults post retiring with the troops in camp to the ruined fort called william in the front of the garrison not only to wait the enemy if they thought proper to sally but to protect the boats from the fury of the savages having sent forward captain hoyes with his detachment with one piece of cannon to the place where bull fort stood to receive the troops who waited the arrival of captain lernoult most of the boats were escorted that night beyond canada creek where no danger was to be apprehended from the enemy the creek at this place bending from the road has a deep cedar swamp between every attention was now turned to the mouth of the creek which the enemy might have possessed themselves of by a rapid march by the oneyda castle at this place the whole of the little army arrived by twelve oclock at night and took post in such a manner as to have no fears of any thing the enemy could do here we remained till three oclock next morning when the boats which could come up the creek arrived or rather that the rascally part of all nations of the indians would suffer to come up and proceeded across lake oneyda to the ruined fort of brereton where i learnt that some boats were still laboring down the creek after being lightened of the best part of their freight by the messasagoes captain lernoult proposed with a boat full of armed men to repass the lake that night to relieve them from their labor and supply them with provision this transaction does as much honor to the humanity as to the gallantry of this valuable officer  on my arrival at the onondago falls i received an answer to my letter from your excellency which showed in the clearest light the scenes of treachery that had been practiced upon me the messenger had heard indeed on his way that they were collecting the same kind of rabble as before but that there was not an enemy within forty miles of fort stanwix  soon after my arrival here i was joined by captain lernoult with the men and boats he had been in search of i mean immediately to send off for the use of the upper garrison all the overplus provision i shall have after keeping a sufficiency to carry my detachment down which i mean to do with every expedition in my power the moment this business is effected for which purpose i have ordered here the snow the sloop is already gone from this with her full lading  officers from each corpse are sent to montreal to procure necessaries for the men who are in a most deplorable situation from the plunder of the savages that no time may be lost to join your army  i have the honor to be with the greatest respect sir your excellencys most obedient and most faithful servant barry st ledger oswego aug         his excellency general burgoyne  no xiv copy of a letter from lieutenant general burgoyne to lord george germain dated at albany  0th october      my lord no possibility of communication with your lordship having existed since the beginning of september at which time my last dispatch was sent away i have to report to your lordship the proceedings of the army under my command from that period a series of hard toil incessant effort stubborn action till disabled in the collateral branches of the army by the total defection of the indians the desertion or timidity of the canadians and provincials some individuals excepted disappointed in the last hope of any timely cooperation from other armies the regular troops reduced by losses from the best part to   00 fighting men not  000 of which were british only three days provisions upon short allowance in store invested by an army of   000 men and no apparent means of retreat remaining i called into council all the generals field officers and captains commanding corpse and by their unanimous concurrence and advice i was induced to open a treaty with major general gates  your lordship will see by the papers transmitted herewith the disagreeable prospect which attended the first overtures and when the terms concluded are compared i trust that the spirit of the councils i have mentioned which under such circumstances dictated instead of submitting will not be refused a share of credit  before i enter upon the detail of these events i think it a duty of justice my lord to take upon myself the measure of having passed the hudsons river in order to force a passage to albany i did not think myself authorized to call any men into council when the peremptory tenor of my orders and the season of the year admitted no alternative  provisions for about thirty days having been brought forward the other necessary stores prepared and the bridge of boats completed the army passed the hudsons river on the   th and   th of september and encamped on the heights and in the plain of saratoga the enemy being then in the neighborhood of stillwater    th the whole army made a movement forward and encamped in a good position in a place called dovacote    th it being found that there were several bridges to repair that work was begun under cover of strong detachments and the same opportunity was taken to reconnoitre the country    th the army renewed their march repaired other bridges and encamped upon advantageous ground about four miles from the enemy    th the enemy appeared in considerable force to obstruct the further repair of bridges and with a view as it was conceived to draw on an action where artillery could not be employed a small loss was sustained in skirmishing but the work of the bridges was effected  sept    the passages of a great ravine and other roads toward the enemy having been reconnoitred the army advanced in the following order  brigadier general frasers corpse sustained by lieutenant colonel breymans corpse made a circuit in order to pass the ravine commodiously without quitting the heights and afterward to cover the march of the line to the right these corpse moved in three columns and had the indians canadians and provincials upon their fronts and flanks the british line led by me in person passed the ravine in a direct line south and formed in order of battle as fast as they gained the summit where they waited to give time to frasers corpse to make the circuit and to enable the left wing and artillery which under the commands of major general phillips and major general reidesel kept the great road and meadows near the river in two columns and had bridges to repair to be equally ready to proceed the   th regiment guarded the bateaux  the signal guns which had been previously settled to give notice of all the columns being ready to advance having been fired between one and two oclock the march continued the scouts and flankers of the column of the british line were soon fired upon from small parties but with no effect after about an hours march the picquets which made the advanced guard of that column were attacked in force and obliged to give ground but they soon rallied and were sustained  on the first opening of the wood i formed the troops a few cannonshot dislodged the enemy at a house from whence the picquets had been attacked and brigadier general frasers corpse had arrived with such precision in point of time as to be found upon a very advantageous height on the right of the british  in the mean time the enemy not acquainted with the combination of the march had moved in great force out of their intrenchments with a view of turning the line upon the right and being checked by the disposition of brigadier general fraser countermarched in order to direct their great effort to the left of the british  from the nature of the country movements of this sort however near may be effected without a possibility of their being discovered  about three oclock the action began by a very vigorous attack on the british line and continued with great obstinacy till after sunset the enemy being continually supplied with fresh troops the stress lay upon the  0th   st and  d regiments most parts of which were engaged near four hours without intermission the  th had been ordered early in the day to form in reserve  the grenadiers and   th regiment were some part of the time brought into action as were part of the light infantry and all these corpse charged with their usual spirit  the riflemen and other parts of breymans corpse were also of service but it was not thought advisable to evacuate the heights where brigadier general fraser was posted otherwise than partially and occasionally  major general phillips upon first hearing the firing found his way through a difficult part of the wood to the scene of action and brought up with him major williams and four pieces of artillery and from that moment i stood indebted to that gallant and judicious second for incessant and most material services particularly for restoring the action in a point which was critically pressed by a great superiority of fire and to which he led up the  0th regiment at the utmost personal hazard  major general riedesel exerted himself to bring up a part of the left wing and arrived in time to charge the enemy with regularity and bravery  just as the light closed the enemy gave ground on all sides and left us completely masters of the field of battle with the loss of about five hundred men on their side and as supposed thrice that number wounded  the darkness preventing a pursuit the prisoners were few  the behavior of the officers and men in general was exemplary brigadiergeneral fraser took his position in the beginning of the day with great judgment and sustained the action with constant presence of mind and vigor brigadiergeneral hamilton was the whole time engaged and acquitted himself with great honor activity and good conduct  the artillery in general was distinguished and the brigade under captain jones who was killed in the action was conspicuously so  the army lay upon their arms the night of the   th and the next day took a position nearly within cannon shot of the enemy fortifying their right and extending their left to the brow of the heights so as to cover the meadows through which the great river runs and where their bateaux and hospitals were placed the   th regiment the regiment of hesse hanau and a corpse of provincials encamped in the meadows as a further security  it was soon found that no fruits honor excepted were attained by the preceding victory the enemy working with redoubled ardor to strengthen their left their right was already unattackable  on our side it became expedient to erect strong redoubts for the protection of the magazines and hospital not only against a sudden attack but also for their security in case of a march to turn the enemys flank  september    a messenger arrived from sir harry clinton with a letter in cipher informing me of his intention to attack fort montgomery in about ten days from the date of his letter which was the   th instant this was the only messenger of many that i apprehend were dispatched by sir william how and him that had reached my camp since the beginning of august he was sent back the same night to inform sir harry of my situation and of the necessity of a diversion to oblige general gates to detach from his army and my intention to wait favorable events in that position if possible to the   th of october  in the course of the two following days two officers in disguise and other confidential persons were dispatched by different routes with verbal messages to the same effect and i continued fortifying my camp and watching the enemy whose numbers increased every day  i thought it advisable on the  d of october to diminish the soldiers ration in order to lengthen out the provisions to which measure the army submitted with the utmost cheerfulness the difficulties of a retreat to canada were clearly foreseen as was the dilemma should the retreat be effected of leaving at liberty such an army as general gatess to operate against sir william how  this consideration operated forcibly to determine me to abide events as long as possible and i reasoned thus the expedition i commanded was evidently meant at first to be hazarded circumstances might require it should be devoted a critical junction of mr gatess force with mr washington might possibly decide the fate of the war the failure of my junction with sir harry clinton or the loss of my retreat to canada could only be a partial misfortune  in this situation things continued till the seventh when no intelligence having been received of the expected cooperation and four or five days for our limited stay in the camp only remained it was judged advisable to make a movement to the enemys left not only to discover whether there were any possible means of forcing a passage should it be necessary to advance or of dislodging him for the convenience of a retreat but also to cover a forage of the army which was in the greatest distress on accouut of the scarcity  a detachment of fifteen hundred regular troops with two twelve pounders two howitzers and six sixpounders were ordered to move and were commanded by myself having with me major general phillips major general reidesel and brigadiergeneral fraser  the guard of the camp upon the heights was left to brigadiergeneral hamilton and specht the redoubts and the plain to brigadier general gall and as the force of the enemy immediately in their front consisted of more than double their numbers it was not possible to augment the corpse that marched beyond the numbers above stated  i formed the troops within threequarters of a mile of the enemys left and captain frasers rangers with indians and provincials had orders to go by secret paths in the woods to gain the enemys rear and by showing themselves there to keep them in a check  the further operations intended were prevented by a very sudden and rapid attack of the enemy on our left where the british grenadiers were posted to support the left wing of the line major acland at the head of them sustained the attack with great resolution but the enemys great numbers enabling them in a few minutes to extend the attack along the front of the germans which were immediately on the right of the grenadiers no part of that body could be removed to make a second line to the flank where the stress of the fire lay the right was at this time engaged but it was soon observed that the enemy were marching a large corpse round their flank to endeavor cutting off their retreat the light infantry and part of the   th regiment which were at that post were therefore ordered to form a second line and to secure the return of the troops into camp while this movement was proceeding the enemy pushed a fresh and strong reinforcement to renew the action upon the left which overpowered by a great superiority gave way and the light infantry and   th regiment were obliged to make a quick movement to save that point from being entirely carried in doing which brigadiergeneral fraser was mortally wounded  the danger to which the lines were exposed becoming at this moment of the most serious nature orders were given to major general phillips and reidesel to cover the retreat while such troops as were most ready for the purpose returned for the defense of them the troops retreated hard pressed but in good order they were obliged to leave six pieces of cannon all the horses having been killed and most of the artillerymen who had behaved as usual with the utmost bravery under the command of major williams being either killed or wounded  the troops had scarcely entered the camp when it was stormed with great fury the enemy rushing to the lines under a severe fire of grapeshot and small arms the post of the light infantry under lord balcarras assisted by some of the line which threw themselves by order into the intrenchments was defended with great spirit and the enemy led on by general arnold was finally repulsed and the general wounded but unhappily the intrenchments of the german reserve commanded by lieutenant colonel breymann who was killed were carried and although ordered to be recovered they never were so and the enemy by that misfortune gained an opening on our right and rear the night put an end to the action  under the disadvantages thus apparent in our situation the army was ordered to quit the present position during the night and take post upon the heights above the hospital  thus by an entire change of front to reduce the enemy to form a new disposition this movement was effected in great order and without loss though all the artillery and camp were removed at the same time the army continued offering battle to the enemy in their new position the whole day of the  th  intelligence was now received that the enemy were marching to turn the right and no means could prevent that measure but retiring toward saratoga the army began to move at nine oclock at night major general reidesel commanding the vanguard and major general phillips the rear  this retreat though within musket shot of the enemy and encumbered with all the baggage of the army was made without loss but a very heavy rain and the difficulties of guarding the bateaux which contained all the provisions occasioned delays which prevented the army reaching saratoga till the night of the  th and the artillery could not pass the fords of the fishkill till the morning of the  0th  at our arrival near saratoga a corpse of the enemy between five and six hundred were discovered throwing up intrenchments on the heights but retired over a ford of the hudsons river at our approach and joined a body posted to oppose our passage there  it was judged proper to send a detachment of artificers under a strong escort to repair the bridges and open a road to fortedward on the west side of the river the   th regiment captain frasers marksmen and mackoys provincials were ordered for that service but the enemy appearing on the heights of the fishkill in great force and making a disposition to pass and give us battle the   th regiment and frasers marksmen were recalled the provincials left to cover the workmen at the first bridge run away upon a very slight attack of a small party of the enemy and left the artificers to escape as they could without a possibility of their performing any work  during these different movements the bateaux with provisions were frequently fired upon from the opposite side of the river and some of them were lost and several men were killed and wounded in those which remained  october    the attacks upon the bateaux were continued several were taken and retaken but their situation being much nearer to the main force of the enemy than to ours it was found impossible to secure the provisions any otherwise than by landing them and carrying them upon the hill this was effected under fire and with great difficulty  the possible means of further retreat were now considered in councils of war composed of the general officers minutes of which will be transmitted to your lordship  the only one that seemed at all practicable was by a night march to gain fortedward with the troops carrying their provision upon their backs the impossibility of repairing bridges putting a conveyance of artillery and carriages out of the question it was proposed to force the ford at fortedward or the ford above it before this attempt could be made scouts returned with intelligence that the enemy were entrenched opposite these fords and possessed a camp in force on the high ground between fortedward and fortgeorge with cannon they had also parties down the whole shore to watch our motions and posts so near to us upon our own side of the water as must prevent the army moving a single mile undiscovered  the bulk of the enemys army was hourly joined by new corpse of militia and volunteers and their numbers together amounted to upwards of   000 men their position which extended three parts in four of a circle round us was from the nature of the ground unattackable in all parts  in this situation the army took the best position possible and fortified waiting till the   th at night in the anxious hope of succors from our friends or the next desirable expectation an attack from our enemy  during this time the men lay continually upon their arms and were cannonaded in every part even rifleshot and grapeshot came into all parts of the line though without any considerable effect  at this period an exact account of the provisions was taken and the circumstances stated in the opening of this letter became complete  the council of war was extended to all the field officers and captains commanding corpse of the army and the event ensued which i am sure was inevitable and which i trust in that situation was honorable but which it would be superfluous and melancholy to repeat  after the execution of the treaty general gates drew together the force that had surrounded my position and i had the consolation to have as many witnesses as i have men under my command of its amounting to the numbers mentioned above  during the events stated above an attempt was made against ticonderoga by an army assembled under major general lincoln who found means to march with a considerable corpse from huberton undiscovered while another column of his force passed the mountains between skenesborough and lake george and on the morning of the   th of september a sudden and general attack was made upon the carrying place at lake george sugar hill ticonderoga and mount independence the sea officers commanding the armed sloop stationed to defend the carrying place as also some of the officers commanding at the posts of sugar hill and at the portage were surprised and a considerable part of four companies of the   d regiment were made prisoners a blockhouse commanded by lieutenant lord of the   d was the only post on that side that had time to make use of their arms and they made a brave defense till cannon taken from the surprised vessel was brought against them  after stating and lamenting so fatal a want of vigilance i have to inform your lordship of the satisfactory events which followed  the enemy having twice summoned brigadier general powell and received such answer as became a gallant officer entrusted with so important a post and having tried during the course of four days several attacks and being repulsed in all retreated without having done any considerable damage  brigadier general powell from whose report to me i extract this relation gives great commendations to the regiment of prince frederick and the other troops stationed at mount independence the brigadier also mentions with great applause the behavior of captain tailor of the   st regiment who was accidentally there on his route to the army from the hospital and lieutenant beecroft of the   th regiment who with the artificers in arms defended an important battery  on the   th instant the enemy enabled by the capture of the gunboats and bateaux which they had made after the surprise of the sloop to embark upon lake george attacked diamond island in two divisions  captain aubrey and two companies of the   th regiment had been posted at that island from the time the army passed the hudsons river as a better situation for the security of the stores at the south end of lake george than fort george which is on the continent and not tenable against artillery and numbers the enemy were repulsed by captain aubrey with great loss and pursued by the gunboats under his command to the east shore where two of their principal vessels were retaken together with all the cannon they had just time to set fire to the other bateaux and retreated over the mountains  i beg leave to refer your lordship for further particulars to my aiddecamp lord petersham and i humbly take occasion to recommend to his majestys notice that nobleman as one endued with qualities to do important services to his country in every station to which his birth may lead in this late campaign in particular his behavior has been such as to entitle him to the fullest applause and i am confident his merit will be thought a sufficient ground for preferment though deprived of the eclat and sort of claim which generally attends the delivery of fortunate dispatches  i have only to add my lord a general report of the killed and wounded i do not give it correct the hurry of the time and the separation of the corpse having rendered it impossible to make it so the british officers have bled profusely and most honorably those who remain unwounded have been equally forward and the general officers from the mode of fighting have been more exposed than in other services among the rest of this station i have had my escapes it depends upon the sentence his majesty shall pass upon my conduct upon the judgment of my profession and of the impartial and respectable parts of my country whether i am to esteem them blessings or misfortunes  i have the honor to be signed j burgoyne   second no xiv copy of a letter from lieutenant general burgoyne to lord george germain dated albany  0th october      private by lord petersham  my lord i have little to add to my public letter respecting the course of unsuccessful events therein detailed i rest my confidence in the justice of the king and his councils to support the general they thought proper to appoint to as arduous an undertaking and under as positive a direction as perhaps a cabinet ever framed it will i am sure be remembered my lord that a preference of exertions was the only latitude given me and that to force a junction with sir william how or at least a passage to albany was the principle the letter and the spirit of my orders  indeed the appearances at the time i passed the hudsonsriver though subject to doubt in some instances as i then wrote your lordship were upon a general view such as i am persuaded would have rendered inaction censurable had my orders instead of being peremptory been discretionary promises of the professing loyalists were not then brought to the test the spirit of the enemy in combat against regular british troops had only been tried at ticonderago at huberton at skenesborough and fort anne in all which places it had failed the total disappointment of effectual cooperation could not be foreseen or supposed and sure i am had i then made supposition that any thing like what has happened might have happened and remained cautiously posted no exertion attempted my conduct would have been held indefensible by every class and distinction of men in government in the army and in the public  the expediency of advancing being admitted the consequences have been honorable misfortunes the british have persevered in a strenuous and bloody progress had the force been all british perhaps the perseverance had been longer but as it was will it be said my lord that in the exhausted situation described and in the jaws of famine and invested by quadruple numbers a treaty which saves the army to the state for the next campaign was not more than could have been expected i i call it saving the army because if sent home the state is thereby enabled to send forth the troops now destined for her internal defense if exchanged they become a force to sir william how as effectually as if any other junction had been made  i should now hold myself unjustifiable if i did not confide to your lordship my opinion upon a near inspection of the rebel troops the standing corpse which i have seen are disciplined i do not hazard the term but apply it to the great fundamental points of military institution sobriety subordination regularity and courage the militia are inferior in method and movement but not a jot less serviceable in woods my conjectures were very different after the affair of ticonderago but i am convinced they were delusive and it is a duty to the state to confess it  the panic of the rebel troops is confined and of short duration the enthusiasim is extensive and permanent  it is a justice to major general phillips to inform your lordship that when the crisis of our situation at saratoga arrived he very handsomely offered to hazard his person by making a circuit through the woods and attempt to throw himself into ticonderago to defend that place should it be the object of the enemy to endeavor the retaking it  in regard to myself i am sunk in mind and body but while i have a faculty of either it shall be exerted for the kings service i shall wait in the neighborhood of boston the orders of sir william how  i have the honor to be etc j burgoyne   no xv minutes of a council of war held on the heights of saratoga oct    present lieutenant general burgoyne major general reidesel major general philips brigadier general hamilton   the lieutenant general states to the council the present situation of affairs  the enemy in force according to the best intelligence he can obtain to the amount of upwards of   000 men and a considerable quantity of artillery are on this side the fishkill and threaten an attack on the other side the hudsons river between this army and fort edward is another army of the enemy the numbers unknown but one corpse which there has been an opportunity of observing is reported to be about   00 men they have likewise cannon on the other side the hudsons river and they have a bridge below saratoga church by which the two armies can communicate  the bateaux of the army have been destroyed and no means appear of making a bridge over the hudsons river were it even practicable from the position of the enemy  the only means of retreat therefore are by the ford at fort edward or taking the mountains in order to pass the river higher up by rafts or by any other ford which is reported to be practicable with difficulty or by keeping the mountains to pass the head of hudsons river and continue to the westward of lake george all the way to ticonderoga it is true this last passage was never made but by indians or very small bodies of men  in order to pass cannon or any wheel carriages from hence to fort edward some bridges must be repaired under fire of the enemy from the opposite side of the river and the principal bridge will be a work of fourteen or fifteen hours there is no good position for the army to take to sustain that work and if there were the time stated as necessary would give the enemy on the other side the hudsons river an opportunity to take post on the strong ground above fort edward or to dispute the ford while general gatess army followed in the rear  the intelligence from the lower part of hudsons river is founded upon the concurrent reports of prisoners and deserters who say it was the news in the enemys camp that fort montgomery was taken and one man a friend to government who arrived yesterday mentions some particulars of the manner in which it was taken  the provisions of the army may hold out to the  0th there is neither rum nor spruce beer  having committed this state of facts to the consideration of the council the general requests their sentiments on the following propositions   st to wait in the present position an attack from the enemy or the chance of favorable events   d to attack the enemy   d to retreat repairing the bridges as the army moves for the artillery in order to force the passage of the ford   th to retreat by night leaving the artillery and the baggage and should it be found impracticable to force the passage with musquetry to attempt the upper ford or the passage round lake george  in case the enemy by extending to their left leave their rear open to march rapidly for albany  upon the first proposition resolved that the situation would grow worse by delay that the provision now in store not more than sufficient for the retreat should impediments intervene or a circuit of country become necessary and as the enemy did not attack when the ground was unfortified it is not probable they will do it now as they have a better game to play  the second unadvisable and desperate there being no possibility of reconnoitering the enemys position and his great superiority of numbers known  the third impracticable  the fifth thought worthy of consideration by the lieutenant general major general phillips and brigadiergeneral hamilton but the position of the enemy yet gives no opening for it  resolved that the fourth proposition is the only resource and that to effect it the utmost secrecy and silence is to be observed and the troops are to be put in motion from the right in the still part of the night without any change in the disposition  n b it depended upon the delivery of six days provision in due time and upon the return of scouts who had been sent forward to examine by what route the army could probably move the first four miles undiscovered whether the plan should take place on that day or on the morrow  the scouts on their return reported that the enemys position on the right was such and they had so many small parties out that it would be impossible to move without our march being immediately discovered  minutes and proceedings of a council of war consisting of all the general officers and field officers and captains commanding corpse on the heights of saratoga october    the lieutenant general having explained the situation of affairs as in the preceding council with the additional intelligence that the enemy was entrenched at the fords of fort edward and likewise occupied the strong position on the pineplains between fort george and fort edward expressed his readiness to undertake at their head any enterprise of difficulty or hazard that should appear to them within the compass of their strength of spirit he added that he had reason to believe a capitulation had been in the contemplation of some perhaps of all who knew the real situation of things that upon a circumstance of such consequence to national and personal honor he thought it a duty to his country and to himself to extend his council beyond the usual limits that the assembly present might justly be esteemed a full representation of the army and that he should think himself unjustifiable in taking any step in so serious a matter without such a concurrence of sentiments as should make a treaty the act of the army as well as that of the general  the first question therefore he desired them to decide was whether an army of   00 fighting men and well provided with artillery were justifiable upon the principles of national dignity and military honor in capitulating in any possible situation  resolved nem con in the affirmative  question   is the present situation of that nature  resolved nem con that the present situation justifies a capitulation upon honorable terms  the lieutenant general then drew up the message marked no   and laid it before the council it was unanimously approved and upon that foundation the treaty opened  october    major kingston having delivered the message marked no   returned with the proposals marked no   and the council of war being assembled again the lieutenant general laid the proposals before them when it was resolved unanimously to reject the  th article and not to admit of it in any extremity whatever  the lieutenant general then laid before the council the answers to major general gatess proposals as marked in the same paper together with his own preliminary proposals which were unanimously approved of  october    the council being assembled again major general gatess answers to lieutenant general burgoynes proposals were laid before them whereupon it was resolved that they were satisfactory and a sufficient ground for proceeding to a definitive treaty  no   major kingston delivered the following message to major general gates october    after having fought you twice lieutenant general burgoyne has waited some days in his present position determined to try a third conflict against any force you could bring to attack him  he is apprised of the superiority of your numbers and the disposition of your troops to impede his supplies and render his retreat a scene of carnage on both sides in this situation he is impelled by humanity and thinks himself justifiable by established principles and precedents of state and of war to spare the lives of brave men upon honorable terms should major general gates be inclined to treat upon that idea general burgoyne would propose a cessation of arms during the time necessary to communicate the preliminary terms by which in any extremity he and his army mean to abide  no   major general gatess proposals together with lieutenant general burgoynes answers i general burgoynes army being exceedingly reduced by repeated defeats by desertion sickness etc their provisions exhausted their military horses tents and baggage taken or destroyed their retreat cut off and their camp invested they can only be allowed to surrender prisoners of war  answer lieutenant general burgoynes army however reduced will never admit that their retreat is cut off while they have arms in their hands  ii the officers and soldiers may keep the baggage belonging to them the generals of the united states never permit individuals to be pillaged  iii the troops under his excellency general burgoyne will be conducted by the most convenient route to new england marching by easy marches and sufficiently provided for by the way  answer this article is answered by general burgoynes first proposal which is here annexed  iv the officers will be admitted on parole may wear their sidearms and will be treated with the liberality customary in europe so long as they by proper behavior continue to deserve it but those who are apprehended having broke their parole as some british officers have done must expect to be close confined  answer there being no officer in this army under or capable of being under the description of breaking parole this article needs no answer  v all public stores artillery arms ammunition carriages horses etc etc must be delivered to commissaries appointed to receive them  answer all public stores may be delivered arms excepted  vi these terms being agreed to and signed the troops under his excellency general burgoynes command may be drawn up in their encampments where they will be ordered to ground their arms and may thereupon be marched to the river side to be passed over in their way toward bennington  answer this article inadmissible in any extremity sooner than this army will consent to ground their arms in their encampment they will rush on the enemy determined to take no quarter  vii a cessation of arms to continue till sunset to receive general burgoynes answer  signed horatio gates camp at saratoga oct    major kingston met the adjutantgeneral of major general gatess army october   th at sunset and delivered the following message  if general gates does not mean to recede from the  th article the treaty ends at once  the army will to a man proceed to any act of desperation rather than submit to that

the notes they gave question  general gates having in answer to general burgoynes message given a solemn affirmation on his honor that no detachment has been made from his army during the negotiation of the treaty is the treaty in its present situation binding on this army or is the generals honor engaged for the signing it  here follow the names of the officers as they voted  the lieutenant generals opinion being clear that he is not bound by what has passed he would not execute the treaty upon the sole consideration of the point of honor notwithstanding the respectable majority against him  he is likewise far from being convinced that this army by great exertions and by great enduring in point of provisions might not yet be relieved but he is compelled to yield on the following considerations  the treaty was generally thought a most advantageous one before the intelligence arrived that intelligence is refuted and ocular demonstration of its falsity pledged as far as relates to general gatess force the other parts are only founded on hearsay and not to be depended upon  should general clinton be where reported yet the distance is such as to render any relief from him improbable during the time our provisions could be made to last   declares his post untenable and says if this convention is not signed he apprehends there will be considerable desertion   says he thinks the   th regiment not to be depended on   is of the same opinion   thinks the   d regiment is disheartened by the situation of their post and not equal to their former exertions  several officers think the men in general seem to have got the convention in their heads as desirable  many of the best officers are absent by sickness and wounds from all the corpse  though the other officers at the head of the british corpse think they can answer for the spirit of their men if attacked on their present ground it is evident the most sanguine do not think any part of the army in that elevation and alacrity of spirit necessary for undertaking desperate enterprises  to break off the treaty now renders a future renewal of it hopeless as our condition must every hour grow worse  a defeat is fatal to the army a victory does not save it as they have neither provisions to advance nor retreat against an enemy who by experience we know are capable of rallying at every advantageous post  and that the life and property of every provincial and dependant of this army depends upon the execution of this treaty  postscript to the appendix though the following letters are not referred to in any part of the defense it is hoped they will not be deemed superfluous  extract of a letter from major general phillips to lieutenant general burgoyne dated cambridge september         my dear sir the boston news papers have given extracts from english and new york papers wherein you are mentioned your arrival your speeches in parliament and a variety of other matters concerning you i do not always give credit to news papers and therefore the publishers at boston will excuse me if in the instance of news i do not give them in my opinion more veracity than i allow the news compilers at london  i will not plague you about our situation as you will know it by my assuring you it is almost exactly as you left us so no more about it the troops here depend upon you their chief in whatever may relate to them their interest their honor it is not doubted but you will exert yourself that the officers may gain preferment in common with other parts of the army that you will have the goodness to exert yourself in behalf of their situation respecting the very great expense of living and endeavor to procure the allowance of forage money and in short that you will use all your powers of persuasion and interest for these troops which have served under you with zeal and with honor and endeavor by serving their situation and promoting their honor to alleviate misfortunes which nor fortitude nor valor could prevent and which they suffer however with resignation and patience i am most perfectly convinced of your affectionate i will say your grateful regard for us all and i leave myself and the troops to your friendly care to your humanity to your honor  you cannot expect a letter of entertainment i have not even a power of making it one of intelligence it shall be however a letter of perfect sincerity and in the fullest sense of it i profess to be  my dear sir your very sincere friend and faithful servant signed w phillips p s i enclose you the copy of a memorial to the secretary at war i am sure you will assist it    copy of a letter from lieutenant general burgoyne to lord amherst enclosing the memorial referred to in the above dated november        my lord the heavy misfortune i sustain in being precluded the kings presence touches me in no point more nearly than in the prevention of doing justice to the various and extensive merits of the army i had the honor to command that the consequences of my supposed or real errors should involve pretensions and interests of so many gallant officers is a painful reflection and it can only be alleviated by the truest sense of the trust to be reposed in your lordship for the general protection of the service the enclosed memorial was accompanied with expressions of reliance in the name of the whole army upon my efforts to support it the officers in new england little conceive my present situation i take the first opportunity to transmit their cause to your lordships happier auspices with this solemn declaration which i have mentioned upon different public occasions and which i can omit no occasion to repeat that there is not a british officer who served under me during the campaign of      to whom i can impute blame that the instances are very numerous wherein particular distinction is due and as a body they have a claim to my sincerest respect for their zeal in the kings service and to my utmost gratitude for their attention to me personally  i have the honor to be etc etc etc j burgoyne  finis advertisement in plan iv the third and fourth positions of the army in the engagement of
