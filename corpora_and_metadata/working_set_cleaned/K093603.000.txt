one thousand eight hundred or i wish you a happy new year being a choice collection of favorite songs on serious moral and lively subjects  written and carefully revised by george saville carey  when winter nights grow dull and long propose the dance or sing your song or join concordant in some glee for life should never vapid be tewkesbury printed by w did and sold by west and hughes paternosterrow c chapple pall mall and s reed strand london   00  to mr incledon sir from the very eminent line you are ranked in as a vocal performer and the great pleasure i have often received when i have heard you sing some of the following songs i thought there would be no impropriety trusting at the same time that you would not take it amiss were i to inscribe the following little work to you i have been the more particularly urged to publish my songs in this manner from hearing of the frequent applications which have been made for them to almost every bookseller in town who have not had it in their power until now to gratify their different customers there are more people capable of reading than singing a song therefore those that have not studied music sufficiently may have the opportunity of looking over the words in the closet many of them have been set by some of the most able composers and many also by the most moderate ones which have often been the cause of putting the reader out of humor with the words from the musicians misconception of the subject or his deficiency in respect to effect and harmony many an author has had the mortification of seeing his words martyred by the composer of the music who has evidently shown by his emphasis if i may be allowed that phrase being wrongly placed that although he might be full master of his science so far as to know a crotchet from a minim yet if you had set him to read perhaps he did not know a substantive from a verb and a total stranger altogether of antithesis or inflection in such case good words are often prostituted through ignorance which is as mortifying as if any body were to put a valuable piece of broad cloth into the hands of an unskilful tailor who having no taste in respect to fashion or shape often produces a coat not only unfit to be worn but unfit to be seen also from which reason it has disgusted and been thrown upon the shelf to rot in oblivion and on the other hand many a song which has been merely measure without the least pretention to the name of poetry divested at the same time of instructive matter as well as of figure or incident has become a favorite ditty with the public from the ingenuity of the composer of the music who may have been lucky enough to give it a good tune  in the above instance we are told the italian composers do often excel and the late ingenious bonnel thornton joint writer of the connoisieur has in some part of his works given us a translation of one of their popular airs which we also find to be strictly measure and runs thus  where which and wherefore  there this and therefore this is a kind of fashionable scaffolding for the music which the composer builds upon and finishes his part by line and rule like a good mason or bricklayer who never considers or looks into the imperfection of the architect but is perfectly contented that he has finished his part of the business well let the superstructure be ever so contemptible but you are a better judge of music than i am and if this metaphor should not hold good you will be kind enough to pardon  sir your most obedient servant geo s carey  contents i wish you

resolution see the nights taken its leave the streamers of day begin from the eastward to dart the ravilia beats and i am summoned away it is hard my dear betsey to part it is not the foe in the field that i dread nor the point of the glittering steel it is not the whistling bullet of lead it is parting with thee that i feel i must not indulge in the thought of my dear the bustle of war is around the bellowing trumpet blows loud in the ear my spirits start up at the sound i will fight for my king as a soldier should fight yet were i to scape with my life when the wars are all over twoud be my delight to make my dear betsey my wife the disconsolate sailor when my money was gone that i gained in the wars and the world gan to frown at my fate what mattered my zeal or my honored scars when indifference stood at each gate the face that would smile when my purse was well lined showed a different aspect to me and when i could naught but ingratitude find i hid once again to the sea i thought it unwise to repine at my lot to bear with cold looks on the shore so i packed up the trifling remnants i would got and a trifle alas was my store a handkerchief held all the treasure i had which over my shoulder i threw away then i trudged with a heart rather sad to join with some jolly ships crew the sea was less troubled by far than my mind for when the wide main i surveyed i could not help thinking the world was unkind and fortune a slippery jade and i vowed if once more i could take her in tow i would let the ungrateful ones see that the turbulent winds and the billows could show more kindness than they did to me the disconsolate sailors return once more i returned to my own native shore which i left so dejected so heartless and poor each face looked indignant and shy i sought for relief on the perilous main and fortune she cheered my poor heart once again while i braved the caprice of the sky though death seemed impatiently waiting around with sharppointed lightning and thunder profound or roared in the turbulent wind when a calm has returned i have said to each mate though the heavens have frowned there is nothing i hate so much as the frowns of mankind i had not forgot how my heart was oppressed and slighted by those whom i would often caressed and parted my penny so free but if ever dame fortune should leave me again no more shall ingratitude give me a pain i will seek for resource on the sea mary of the tyne what pleasure often it is to reveal the pain or pleasure that we feel it is bliss while either we impart unto a sympathetic heart  just like that sweet heart of thine my lovely mary of the tyne i lose when near thee all my care when from thee i am all despair my bosom heaves with anxious pain until i meet with thee again what are the adverse pangs of mine my lovely mary of the tyne say is it from thy beauteous face or is it from thy natural grace or is it thy angelic mind or is it every one combined making one sweet form divine my lovely mary of the tyne should it be love thou wilt sure forgive that is the food on which i live but if thou should that bliss deny then must thy faithful lover die or linger out his life and pine for lovely mary of the tyne the maid of the rock i sat out one eve with intention to roam to the rock where the surges wantonly play when the owl had stolen out from his secret home and brightvested hesperus closed in the day the moon was at full and with dignity rose and tissud with silver the greenmantld seas the god of the ocean was gone to repose and aeolus fanned with a whispering breeze on reaching the cave where old legends report and many a sorrowful tale has been sung where bloodhunting robbers have often held their court on each side was some vestige of chivalry hung my eyes were alarmed on beholding a maid who near to the cavern sat silent in grief her head on her hand all in sorrow was laid a hard rocky pillow was all her relief she started with fear and she fain would have fled i begged her to stay and her sorrows relate then told her from me she had nothing to dread that i was sent there by the order of fate  you came by the order of one she replied who has done all she can to distract my poor mind oerwhelmd in the deep my dear william my pride then sunk and she gave her last breath to the wind the affectionate soldier twas in the evening of a wintry day when safe returning from a long campaign allen oertoild and weary with the way came home to see his sally once again his battered arms he carelessly threw down and viewed his sally with enraptured eyes but she received him with a modest frown she knew not allen in his rough disguise his hair was knotted and his beard unshorn his tattered coutrements about him hung a tear of pleasure did each cheek adorn and blessings fell in torrents from his tongue am i so altered by this cruel trade that you your faithful allen have forgot or is your heart unto another strayed ah  why escaped i from the murdering shot when thus he spoke her wonted color fled she ran and sunk upon her allens breast all pale awhile she looked like one that is dead he kissed she breathed and all her love confessed yes my delight  though altered as thou art reduced by honest courage to this state thou art the golden treasure of my heart my longlost husband and my wished for mate sequel to poll of plymouth when edward first heard poll of plymouth was dead the functions of life made a pause his piteous eyes stood aghast in his head his shipmates inquired the cause reviving awhile he addressed them around his hand closely pressed on his heart within this sad letter at once i have found the spectre of death and his dart it tells that my dear poll of plymouth is dead my comfort my joy and my wife when i was torn from her she flew to her bed and sighing resigned her dear life he fancied he saw his dear poll in the clouds ah stay for poor edward he cries then swift as his fancy he ran up the shrouds and eagerness flashed in his eyes he called for all hands and he gave a loud shriek and now all distracted he raves said do you not see that my hearts sprung a leak then threw himself into the waves all hands were employed to prevent his sad fate and the longboat was put out in vain that drags him aboard but alas twas too late for he never once breathed again the shipwrecked boy twas near a rock within a bay where many a shattered vessel rides an ample cottage sheltered lay which overlooked the ebbing tides its calm inhabitants would view the ocean struggling with the sky when ever the northern tempests blew or when each wave ran mountains high once at the closing of a day when angry boreas in his rage had cleared the darkning clouds away which caused a thundering war to wage a shipwreckd seaboy pale and spent with buffeting the threatening waves straight to the peaceful cottage went and bending low for succor craves he told his tale with feeble voice for he would a heart that could not feign the listening hearers all rejoice that he was safe on land again the parents and the children strove who now should first his wants supply while pity caused each heart to move and sympathy filled every eye the can was filled the fire was made to cheer and dry their drenched guest for each brought something to his aid and anxiously the boy caressed at length revived expressed his mind and showed his gratitude so plain forgot the thunder and the wind resolved to try the sea again the shipwrecked boy at home the goddess of war threw her spear on the ground and peace waved her olive branch gracefully round a stillness now reigned over the widespreading main the sirens began a melodious strain the shipwrecked seaboy his troubles forgot the yawn of the waves and the whistling shot his dear native home strongly pressed on his mind his parents and sisters so loving and kind he hurried fast on with his heart all elate to embrace them around and his story relate his hardearned wages he longed to divide amongst those that he loved near his own fireside but when he arrived say what pen can express the genial delight the joy in excess so welcome at home was this brave little guest you would have thought that their welcoming never would have ceased he hailed em around and he smiled with glee cried hold out your hands take this present from me a fine silken kerchief each neck to enfold but gave to his parents a purse full of gold the fiddler was sent for that lived on the green such dancing and romping sure never was seen they gambold till phoebus peeped over the shed then kissing and blessing went peaceful to bed the furloughed soldier as i have plodded my way to some far country town full many a wearisome day my purse has contained but a scanty halfcrown and that has soon melted away often weary and sad in some wintry road with rain i have been wet to the skin of my knapsack grown tired i have sought for abode at some friendly good alehouse or inn i have hoped that good fortune on turning her wheel would cast me perchance on the place where the wound in my bosom would instantly heal at the sight of my sallys dear face she grieves for she knows how i am destined to roam on the strength of my furlough to rest and then she often wishes her allen at home to bury his cares in her breast on yonder style a duet on yonder style let us sit awhile to hear the nightingale the lazy moon will get up soon and silver over the vale ah did you know the pangs i feel i can no longer now conceal the tender tale i must reveal on yonder style let us sit awhile to hear

over the vale allen brook of windermere say have you in the village seen a lovely youth of pensive mein if such a one has passed by with melancholy in his eye where is he gone ah tell me where it is allen brook of windermere last night he sighing took his leave which caused me all the night to grieve and many maids i know there be who try to wean my love from me but heaven knows my hearts sincere to allen brook of windermere my throbbing breast is full of woe to think that he should serve me so but if my love should angered be and try to hide himself from me then death shall bear me on a bier to allen brook of windermere love without return where are those hours fled that used to yield delight my days with pleasure sped and sweet repose at night within the shaded cot which stands on yonder lea it was alas my lot my mary first to see ah were her love like mine how happy had i been crowned with such bliss divine while mary reigned my queen but she increased my woe while at her feet i

drank to the king to our lasses and friends and the muses appear as the liquor ascends setting fancy awing or on tiptoe to roam for a song or a catch to make strangers at home may the man be despised of whatever degree who has wealth without feeling to make a friend free may his wife night and morning his caput well comb who is in want of a heart to make strangers at home or the boor that will frown when an alien appears whose heart fills his bosom with national fears that encloses his door if from paris or rome some poor stranger might knock who is in want of a home or when merit appears in her scanty attire that may want a good meal or the warmth of a fire may the wretch that denies her never enter this dome to chill the warm hearts of us strangers at home and may he that is a stranger to friendship and love be denied all those blessings we hope for above may his mind be perplexed by some spellsetting gnome who cannot as we do make strangers at home let us join all our hands with a bountiful mind and each to his neighbor be cordial and kind may the spirit of light when we are raised from the tomb give us all a free welcome  as strangers at home hold your jaw acit

plaintive rill in soft accordance to the murmuring dove that morn and evening tells his tale of love or in the grove that hangs the brow beside sits nestling near his faithful feathered bride  twas there i first with faithless edward strayed twas there my eyes my foolish heart betrayed he saw i loved  which if he had not seen he had not then so great a tyrant been or over a heart like mine exulting shown that he would no love for me about his own can i forget while near the medways side how often he called me his intended bride and charmed me as we trod the banks along with some soft tale or heartbewitching song my ear was charmed i listened and believed my love grew stronger as the youth deceived who could have thought that falsehood ever hung mixed with the lovelike notes of edwards tongue ye banks of medway witness to his vows ye willows too that shaded us with boughs ye tides that swelled and kissed the meadows brim as if you envied me each kiss of him come swell again receiving while i weep my briny tears and mix them with the deep for edwards vows are false as subtle sands that many a fair and gallant vessel strands my edwards false and to some other strayed and

paints a ruddiness over each face they all bid defiance to impotent drivelling exercise makes the blood vivid and chaste how pleasants the sound when the huntsman is hollowing near to the skirt of some echoing wood each horseman with eagerness joins in the cry and the glorious clamor resounds to the sky while stretched all along the poor victim lies wallowing farmers with pleasure exult in his blood willy of the woodland side sure willy will never return back again i have waited this hour or more like the linnet alas i am left to complain which sits on the whins of the moor my heart it will break with concern unless my dear willy return some damsel has stole the dear heart of my swain and i shall never see my sweet willy again the thrush and the ouzel are now gone to rest the bat and the owl are awing the sun has this hour been sunk in the west and the sleeplulling nightingales sing how pensively passes the day whenever my willys away some damsel has stole the clear heart of my swain and i shall never see my sweet willy again william of allerton green with a face full of grief and a heart full of love poor william of allerton green in the deepest recess of a neighboring grove by robin the woodman was seen his looks were intent on a murmuring rill which ran over the pebbles below the flood from his eyes served the streamlet to fill which sprang from the fountain of woe his phaebe he would missed a whole night and a day they would promised to meet at a wake he feared that some phantom had led her astray which dances each night on the lake but robin the woodman now langhd in his sleeve who well knew the cause of his tears and smiling he said i will your sorrows relieve and soon put an end to your fears it is true the poor thing had mistaken her way i met her with grief in each eye so like a poor sheep that was going astray she is pounded in safety hard by being all over sorrow just like to yourself and making even just such ado i thought her a foolish young simpering elf because she was piping for you young william jumped up all enraptured with joy said where is my dearest delight now robin cried dont you be jealous my boy with me she has housed all the night between wife and myself we have kept her from harm and cautioned her never to roam you have nothing to do but to lend her your arm and see the dear creature safe home give the friendless charity edward loves me clara cried but she knew him full of pride in a beggars habit dressed put his feelings to the test as he proudly passed by she entreated charity with a high disdainful look he but little notice took saying do not trouble me i have naught to do with thee still his clara drew more nigh crying sir your charity while she spoke a gentle gale blue aside her humble veil and exposed her lovely face when he slackened in his pace but she still with downcast eye cried dear sir your charity soon as he her face beheld all the mystery was revealed saying while he seized her hand listen now to my demand while thus suppliant on my knee give thy edward charity beggared he must ever be doomed to endless misery clara smiling now replied seeing she had checked his pride all your love dear youth give me give the friendless charity the gallant lieutenant prepare prepare we are hailed on board it is famed britannia gives the word see the gallic bird on high turn turn upon your enemy be

neighboring sister aid be steady hearts etc etc ere yet the battle is begun unite ye britons be as one be firm true hearted and sincere and then oh then you have naught to fear be steady hearts etc etc eleanor of exeter as wandering out one summers morn near exons peerless stream i sought fair eleanor forlorn and listened to her theme my heart was soon a prisoner made enchanted were my eyes my ruddy cheeks began to fade my bosom heaved with sighs but when i heard her edmunds name repeated in each strain my heart renewed its wonted flame my cheeks they flushed again the love which modesty forbad that she should show to me the doubts which often made me sad were changed to exstacy i ran and knelt at ellens feet she trembled all with fear and though she bid me often retreat she did it with a tear i wiped the precious gem away and told how much i loved her eyes shot forth a vivid ray while she that love approved then every morn and every eve we passed an hour divine which caused full many a swain to grieve that eleanor was mine when i from church all trim and gay led her across the green every swain would whispering say would i would so happy been every man his mode sure every man in his way is a prig from the cut of his coat or the tie of his wig and most in some partial opinion is blessed for every man thinks his own is the best the coachman though plain is an absolute fop with his shoulders well squared and his head like a mop or his broad silver buttons and tripplecapd coat and all the slang speeches of newgate by rote the bishop and dean have a snug kind of cut with a solemn a sage and monastical strut the fullpuffed sleeve and the wellstarched band his wristbands like snow and a lillywhite hand the judge is a fop though he looks rather droll with his scarlet and fur and his head like an owl and the sergeant as if through the mohawks he would bled or had lately been scalpd by the patch on his head the quakers a very queer kind of a quiz his back so erect and so prim in his phiz in superfine cloth though his coat be but plain yet the quakers a coxcomb a coxcomb in grain the players a prigster of every kind of every fashion of every mind sometimes like a beggar sometimes like a king a tragical comical whimsical thing since men about fashion make such a great pother and every prig will find fault with his brother let each be indulged in his different way for charmen can tell it is the whim of a day bacchuss advice or the good evening since all are subject to vexation while in this state of expectation for joy is often alloyd by sorrow we laugh today and cry tomorrow no more with worldly sickness pine but let your regimen be wine let us compound with time for pleasure our days he gives in scanty measure slowly often with grief he crambles perplexing with his thorny brambles till bacchus comes and drives away the languid vapors of the day or if you should in love be pining and at your mistress window whining when she is unheedful of your plaining when all your resolutions waning then take a goblet like to mine and bury all your love in wine while you are young be not too scanty when you are old take bumpers plenty for when we slacken in our paces and care has wrinkld over our faces wine makes young men often sage and gives a vigor to old age then let us laugh while we are living there is nothing ever got by grieving and when the spirit leaves its prison and to some better state is risen good fellows shall in bumpers join and drink a long farewell in wine ye blushing rays ye blushing rays of chearing light come and dispel the shades of night the envious night which often tries to keep enclosed my sarahs eyes ah gentle maid though fair be kind come and illume my pensive mind darksome appears the brightest place whenever compared to sarahs face disclose those eyes of sapphire blue and brighter far than morning dew awake my sarah make me blessed and ease thy edwards throbbing breast the negros soliloquy by yon bright streamers in the sky which glimmer on the sea the chearing sun approaches nigh yet brings no hope to me the peaceful night yields me no rest which gives to others sleep my heart it bleeds within my breast my eyes do naught but weep the toils i could endure of day or spurn the tyrants chain but norahs driven far away which racks my tortured brain my wife is she  ah cruel heart that could her heart oppress but it is alone the tyrants part to triumph over distress haste blessed tidings haste along from fair britannias isle all come and ease the anxious throng and make the slave to smile if then good hap my nora lives these limbs shall never have rest until we meet oh then i will cleave forever to her breast my little blithsome sparrow why turns my jen her head away my little blithsome sparrow that used to wanton smile and play upon the banks of yarrow sweet her breath as primrose pale her waist well shaped and narrow and with her smiles she cheered the dale and crowned the banks of yarrow ah what is it makes my jenny weep what makes her look aw sorrow say has she lost some favorite sheep that fed on bonny yarrow alas alas i sadly fear the cause of aw this sorrow she is seen some other swain more dear upon the banks of yarrow ah woe is me ah well a day i see what is caused this sorrow i will over the hills and far away and think no more of yarrow the pirates to the restless main well bend our sails a desperate trade to try nor dread the howling northern gales or lowering of the sky since there is no living here on land let us scowr the bounteous sea on merchant fair or contraband well practice piracy on shore some pirates thieve apace from precept every day to plunder there is no disgrace when once you have learnt the way of tithes the parson trims the farm prompt by his reverend plea then tell me lads where is the harm in water piracy regraters and forestallers too accumulate their store the world must own this sentence true they peculate the poor the lawyer is a name i hate and all men will agree they often lop a mans estate what is that but piracy then whod be squeamish since our lives are all we have to lose each man gets bolder as

melancholy while underneath this verdant holly we must laugh while we can since lifes but a span and to yield to old cares a folly to repine at ones fate is treason since fate has furnished us with reason let us ever be seen like this gay evergreen in good health throughout the season when youre warm in conversation twere best avoid prevarication and when matters grow wrong let us strike up a song and drink to each kind relation when age with wrinkld brow approaches and hoary time on strength encroaches may each wintry day like the holly look gay and our end be without reproaches edward and editha when fair editha with young edward sat upon a cliff that overlooked the main as if intended by some wayward fate a sudden tempest rose of wind and rain which from the dreadful height with fury cast the beauteous maid adown the frightful steep into the green and wide expanded waste with thetis there for ever more to sleep a maniac wild distracted edward fled to all he met this piteous burden said say have you seen where ever you have been editha dear my fairy queen often over the desert wild he would thoughtless roam or where the gloom by clustring limes is made and there bewildered make a transient home or hold vague converse with edithas shade and now he would sally forth by frenzy led or from his cell rush with an hideous scream then tear the beauteous ringlets from his head and seek the margin of some mournful stream his eyes expressed the tempest in his brain and thus he sung in slow and pensive strain ye willows green say have ye seen editha dear my fairy queen once where the hurrying torrent rushes down with thundering roar upon the gulf below while peering rocks above the brambles frown like stately monarchs with imperious brow there while poor edward sat in abject mood he thought editha lavd upon each wave then braved the deepest current of the flood and died like her within a watery grave but ere he sunk beneath the ruthless tide around he looked and thus he fainting cried ye willows green say have ye seen editha dear my fairy queen the loaves and the fishes the cooks of our councils great plenty provide they furnish the tables and then they divide but if you would know what their favorite dish is it is the oldfashioned food called the loaves and the fishes chorus then round about round about round about reel since some have but little and some a great deal each patriot prates loud of his countrys good and swears that for charters he would spill his dear blood he may talk of his zeal but his principle wish is to come in at last for the loaves and the fishes chorus  then round about etc when a poor man is hungry he will make a long face and should he want fishmeat then give him a place let neptune and ceres provide to his wishes the oldfashioned food called the loaves and the fishes chorus  then round about etc the bishop often prays he translated might be or that chance would present him a much better see if a brother should die the prelates good wish is that heaven would send him the loaves and the fishes chorus  then round about etc and such is the ease with the kites of the law when they get a poor client once into their claw should a judge slip his wind the first legal wish is that they may be benchd near the loaves and the fishes chorus  then round about etc the great men in place are for raising the crown and those that are out are for pulling it down the party on both sides have self in their wishes and all things give way to the loaves and the fishes chorus  then round about etc may heaven soon grant that we all have a meal save those who pretend that they are chuck full of zeal for those who are full must relinquish their wishes when they cannot make room for the loaves and the fishes chorus then round about round about round about reel since some have but little and some a great deal spring water cresses when hoary frost hung on each thorn ere night had well withdrawn her gloom poor phoebe went one wintry morn from colnbrookdown to langlybroom when from the brake or from the rill half clad and with neglected tresses her rushy basket tried to fill with fresh and green spring water cresses yet many a cheerful strain she would sing while wading through the chilling stream her thoughtless spirits were a wing with love or with some jocund theme then with her humble merchandise in hopes to conquer her distresses away to london next she hies and cries her young spring water cresses through many an alley lane or street ere luxury has left her bed youre sure poor phoebe next to meet trying to get her daily bread the wind and rain she often defies when ever her purse some mite possesses with cheerful voice she daily cries come buy my young spring water cresses pity kindled into love in spite of what my tongue can say celias deaf to all persuasion cold seems her heart as earthly clay when loves my theme she is all evasion why did the gods impress my mind or raise such ardour in my breast and yet the fair be so unkind to triumph over a heart distressed say why thou cherubdimpld boy have thou fettered my affection or why with frowns my peace destroy and leave me wilderd by distraction ah would you celia were i laid quite breathless in the silent grave would you not then dear cruel maid in pity once your bosom heave fair celia listened to his strain with a heartfelt strange obtrusion when pity raised a gentle flame which kindled into soft delusion love fanned the blaze with magic breath and made her own the genial heat no more no more dear youth of death or vainly kneel at celias feet the nymph these words so sweetly said strephon was with joy confounded quickly he reared his drooping head and like the heart elate he bounded he seized her hand and blessed her tongue and smiled with joy at her decree said through the plains let it be sung that celia owns her love for me what is liberty old johnny bull the other day came to me across the way said neighbor tell me tell me pray what is liberty i instantly replied sir it is rushing like a tide sir good order to deride sir that is liberty it is trying without reason sir to propagate high treason sir or cut a brothers wheezen sir that is liberty to knock your neighbor down sir if ever it were known sir that he possessed a crown sir that is liberty to set up guillotines sir to murder kings and queens sir and all such pretty scenes sir that is liberty to pull down church and state sir at any kind of rate sir or knock you over the pate sir that is liberty to make mankind a clod sir and what is very odd sir acknowledging no god sir that is liberty john said the times are bad sir the folks are surely mad sir for making such a sad stir if that be liberty clody and clara or loves controversy clody is it because i love you more than ever mortal loved before is it your sport to use me so will you not marry clara  clara  no why will you teaze me every day when i have so often

no  my own fireside kit cumile talks of his highfashiond joys of each trifle he speaks with delight his hours each day with his horse he employs and his bottle and mistress at night give me the delights that will cherish the mind dupd neither by folly or pride a wife that is friendly that is loving and kind on my knee by my own fire side the overgrown cit that has throve by the gripe distressing his neighbors around would gladly his sins puff away with his pipe or tries them in liquor to drowned on his riches he fain would eternity raise but time clips the wings of his pride give me that eternal that genial blaze that glows by my own fireside let princes for honor contend in the wars and the statesman for profit or place astrologers wander about in the stars or my lord break his neck in the chase such pleasures are transient and dangerous all it is a truth that can never be denied i sit at my ease should they rise should they fall and regale by my own fireside an old friend with a new face of friendship men often will boast to each other for we all are considered as sister or brother lifes a mere masquerade and it is often the case that you will meet an old friend that shall wear a new face you shall sit at the board where the toasts freely pass and good sentiments given on filling each glass but meet the next morning and often you will trace that your overnight friend has put on a new face if you have ever been connected with placemen or trade when your word or your vote would have yielded them aid though your hand might be squeezed by old grub or his grace when their ends are once served they will show a new face should fortune by chance throw a purse in your way what a many fine things will each flatterer say should she once turn her back you shall sink in disgrace and the devil a friend but will wear a new face then let each worthy fellow take care of himself and keep a few comforts in store on his shelf yet be not a niggard with prudence keep pace and despise that old friend that shall wear a new face the responsive dove young phillis overnight had been to dance upon the rural green and while she mingled with the swains assembled from the neighboring plains the envied partner which she chose was thyrsis first of village beaus as accidents often come by chance they both were wounded in the dance each found within the troubled breast a pain that would not let them rest she to the wood sequestered strayed and in the gloomy sheltering shade said to herself in accents low what can it be disturbs me so when over her head a listening dove responsive cried  fair maid it is love when thyrsis heard she would left her home resolved with hasty steps to roam and with an ardent lovers faith he sought each woods remotest path until he found his phillis dear who wondering cried  what brought you here when straight replied the pensive dove what should it be fair maid but love i thought it was queer as i leaned over a gate one midsummers eve when the sky in the brook looked so clear young robin came slily and tugged at my sleeve and i could not help thinking it queer he patted my cheek and he played with my hand and he gave such a whimsical leer then talked about things i could scarce understand that i could not help thinking it queer now all of a sudden he let his thoughts loose and he asked if to church i would steer i thought him a whimsical madheaded goose for his talking of matters so queer i meant to have chid him for what he had said when he whispered so soft in my ear that if i had checked him my heart would have bled for it panted and fluttered so queer how long have you loved me pray robin said i when he answered a calendar year i then was resolved with his suit to comply although it seemed hasty and queer folks thought it so odd that an hour or so should have made me so ready appear but many a lass who have answered with  no have died like old maidens so queer love and time john met with peg the other day as she to church was walking and as he had a deal to say he straight began a talking he asked her if her heart was free or if she him approved and all the while could plainly see her snowy bosom moved his heart was yet tween hope and fear and strove his doubts to smother unless those heavings of his dear might move thus for another awhile she blushed and now she smiled cried prithee be not simple yet love the more his heart beguiled and sported in each dimple she thought he talked too soon of love twas time enough for wooing he told her time did swiftly move and time was loves undoing peg then replied if that is the case it is time that we were moving and said with sadness in her face he sure wont kill for loving why then cried john let us haste to church and all our fears deliver old time shall linger in the lurch and love shall live for ever away they went  made most of time in spite of all his flurry love saw they both were in their prime so bound them in a hurry the royal cottager when ever i think on that dear spot on which i fixed my rural cot then when my rose hung on my arm all free from guile and free from harm my days they glided on with glee and all things then were well with me but when once drawn away by fate unto a more exalted state by smiling fortune promised fair until she brought her train of care twas then i first began to see that happiness had fled from me the noise of cities glare of courts where gay dissimulation sports where envy fain would blight my rose because her cheek so purely glows let fortune take her stores again give me my cot and rural plain and while i tread the oceans side the greatest pleasure greatest pride shall be each day with rose to walk in social inoffensive talk and when each blissful day shall close the waves shall lull us to repose poll of prestbury on a rural village green where the rustic sports are seen when the lads and lasses play at the close of summers day there young william chanced to see pretty poll of prestbury if she trippd the turf along if she warbld out a song william seemed to show surprise in his loveenrapturd eyes said how happy he could be with sweet poll of prestbury often he fidld near her side asking her to be his bride she would turn her head away telling him she would naught to say william cried ah turn to me pretty poll of prestbury bashfully she raised her head and these words in pity said  william you are come too late  to be allens is my fate cruel fate replied he adieu sweet poll of prestbury thou were once my hope and pride all the world was naught beside now each hope is fled away leaving me to love a prey to pine to weep to think on thee my pretty poll of prestbury the rationals the viands cleared let naught be heard but jollity and fun and while we sit let us call in wit she will treat us with a pun good wine you know makes wit to flow along in full career but let your wit be always fit to meet a sages ear for should you dash your thoughts with trash or smuttily besmear well make you drink twice to the brink to wash your senses clear your lasses toast but make no boast lest envy should appear some wag that is by perhaps may try her blazoned charms to share they are not wise who riches prize and tell where they are laid and he is the same that boasts the fame of his betrothed maid then let us be blithe lest with his scythe old time upon his stumps should come and see we wanted glee and take us in the dumps finis w did printer tewkesbury
