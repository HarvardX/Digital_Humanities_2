the dissenters in england vindicated from some reflections in a late pamphlet entitled lawful prejudices etc having applied my self here particularly to the removing of national prejudices i doubt not but it has been expected i should speak something to a late tract entitled lawful prejudices etc and i acknowledge the title seems to call me to that work  i confess i have heard much of lawful prejudices against the union but never saw the attempt made till this outofseasonpiece to say no more of it showed it self in the world  i forbear replying to it at large not on account of the argument nor of the performance in both which it is my opinion the author has acted so much below his ordinary that to me it is one of the unaccountablest things in that part of nature how a man so capable and that is so deservedly admired in all other cases could form such a piece of indigesture i ask his pardon if i am wrong as this piece seems to be  whether it was a new scene he was to act which he was unacquainted with having ever till now acted with wisdom charity and justice and when driven by heaven knows what influence out of his element like a traveller out of his knowledge he made all his steps equally irregular or from what other confusion of thoughts it might proceed i will not determine  i decline all advantages this gives me and very seriously profess i should entirely have declined entering the lists at all with this paper had not the indecency on the whole body of dissenters in england obliged me to justify and defend them against what i confess i never expected to find them charged with especially by the person whom common fame reports to be the author of this paper  in my undertaking this which i think is a debt i am bound to pay to truth and innocence i shall endeavor not only to keep the rules of decency and good manners but shall take care not to break in upon that respect which i always professed to the very reverend author both in his person and character and which i shall still retain notwithstanding this unhappy excursion  this will prevent me saying any thing which i am not forced to in the necessary pursuit of truth and the just vindication of an injured people but in that i hope he himself will pardon me the same plainness which i desire to use with all the world and which an honest impartiality obliges me to  i shall say little to the matter of the national oath solemn covenant or sinfulness of the union here i had given my opinion on that head before without the least prospect of this gentlemans present attempt and i see no reason from any thing he has advanced to alter a word in it  i think still the national covenants not at all concerned here nor the bishops in the parliament at all established by the union uniting with england as already constituted is neither constituting nor approving their authority since a protest against their civil authority clears you of the last and you have nothing of concern in the first but this is not my present business  nor shall i enter upon the argument he brings against the church of england tho i own them maletreated and wronged also particularly in the matters of the sacramental test  i am no more for bishops sacramental tests or any sort of sinful compliances than he that is remotest from them but every blame should be placed where it justly falls  but i come to that which has extorted this sheet from me and against my inclination driven me to the necessity of debate with a gentleman i sincerely value and whom i acknowledge my self to be no match for but tho my respect for the author is the utmost restraint upon me yet i cannot but be astonished to see a man of his integrity and very reverend character fall so hard and i must say so unhandsomly upon a people whom once the church of scotland was not ashamed to call brethren and who never have deserved this treatment from scotland much less now and this is the cause of my engaging in the present dispute  and with all imaginable respect to my reverend antagonist i must be allowed to say here he has not done them justice nay has grossly injured wronged and illtreated them neither which is worst of all is the fact he charges them with true  it has been but the last lords day when in this city a reverend english dissenting minister preached in the church of the grayfriers where i was a witness that the ministry of the kirk of scotland esteemed the english presbyterians as orthodox since they committed to him not only the pulpit for preaching but the administration of ordinances admitting him to baptize in the same pulpit he had preached in  now it is very strange to me what can be meant by saying we cannot trust the presbyterian dissenters how gentlemen can you trust them in sacreds and not in civils admit them to the function and right of the sacred office and not veoture them or join with them in defense of that office  if they incline to episcopacy will you come so near the brink of apostasy to prelatick principles as to receive such into the ministerial brotherhood  really if you can unite with them thus you may unite with them any how and any where and to say you cannot trust them is very hard indeed it is very hard  in the next place can you not trust the presbyterian dissenters this is beyond all the rest since it singles out those dissenters who it may be said you can only trust or those who are nearest in judgment to the kirk here and i must therefore take the liberty to say it is a bill of exclusion against the whole body of dissenters in england directly    st because they are the only dissenters in england you really ought to depend upon the rest will join with you in interest will assist and receive mutual assistance and be your friends but they will never own your kirk nor submit to your discipline    ly who of the dissenters will you own if not the presbyterians the independents you may approve in doctrine but you cannot join with them in church government nor they with you the anabaptists you disowne as sectaries and the quakers as heretics and it is the complaint here that the union will open the door to all those and let them in to the kirk of scotland who then can trust if not the presbyterians  it cannot therefore be any breach of my charity to say it is a public disowning the whole body of dissenters in england as persons that cannot be trusted  in the next place i would beg this gentleman and all the sincere lovers of the reformed churches in this island to reflect how fatal to their general interest how destructive to the preservation of them in either their separate or conjunct concerns how directly tending to their entire subversion and how plain an opening the door to their confusion must any design of raising jealousies and misunderstandings between us be  what is it gentlemen makes the high church in england and the prelatists here against the union but the apprehension of an entire incorporation of interests and affection hands and hearts between the kirk of scotland and the dissenters in england if that union is not the effect of the other both parties are undone and it is the only way to render the union dangerous to commence a distrust between us therefore is the only effectual step to disappoint the nations of the benefit of the union continue us all in jealousies and confusions and encourage the enemies of our peace to crush and insult us all  this must needs move any considering man and fill him with concern that we should thus be doing that very work our selves which all the powers of hell jacobitism and dividers can never do without us  it is not for me to enter upon the character of the dissenters in england or of their vigorous defense of themselves both in their religious principles and civil libertys to the honor of that great body both as christians and as english men  they need it not these things are too well known even to this reverend person himself and to all scotland to need any repetition  and how either passion or want of charity should so far prevail on this person at other times so free from the first and so known for the last i am perfectly at a loss about  the first thing he charges on the presbyterians in england is that their divines of which he names only mr baxter mr how and dr bates offered to submit to episcopacy and on this submission which was but by a few and those are all dead he ventures to say that all or most of them declare for a moderate episcopacy and then adds upon the whole body that they cannot be trusted to clear up this slander  first i must beg this gentleman to examine what this episcopacy was and to what reduced to which they offered to submit and whether he himself is not as much a bishop as any english prelate would then have been abating the title of lord which is a civil not an ecclesiastical dignity    then i desire him to examine whether the bishops themselves did not reject their proposal for that reason that it reduced them all to presbyters and parish priests    whether some of the greatest divines in the church of england have not insulted the dissenters on that head that their pretended submission was a plot against episcopacy it self that they only acknowledged an abrupt and imperfect superintendency and that too with intolerable limitations    next whether all those very gentlemen who he says did submit did not at last reject episcopacy refuse a compliance particularly on account of reordination and the oath of induction and lose their livings on that article    whether had they complied in his terms it reflects on the whole body and how he can qualify himself to say that some people give the presbyterians in england that character without acknowledging it was an injury to them since nothing can be more unjust than to charge a body of men for the errors of a few    whether the presbyterians in england are as far from sinful complyances or leaning toward episcopacy now as the presbyterians in scotland of whom it is yet a question whether an equality are not episcopally inclined and whether it would not be as just to charge the whole kirk with it as to charge the whole body of presbyterians in england because of the sinful compliance of a few  this i cannot but regrate as a hard and uncharitable treatment of the dissenters who have so vigorously and with such success opposed the encroachments of the church and stood their ground to the last  but this is not all a worse charge follows and in terms which i am sorry to say are neither consistent with charity or justice and it grieves me to be forced in the just defense of the absent and injured people called dissenters to charge any man much less this gentleman with want of truth his charge is  that the dissenters did so far countenance and favor the dispensing power by the tenor of their addresses that instead of silently receiving the benefits of the indulgence they set up for advocats to support it and that to rescue themselves from the severity of one law they gave a ow to all laws etc page    i hope our author will not attempt to come off of the charge by his putting it with a somesay in the front since he either believes it or would have it believed or else it is not to his purpose and if he does not believe it he ought to have quoted it as a slander  note here he does not say some of the dissenters but the dissenters which i think is allowed to be a general and to signify the dissenters as a body of people so called and distinguished  if he means only some of them it will do him no service for some also rejected the proposal of addressing with contempt  if he will have the majority determine it those that refused it were twenty for one and so it is against him and no body did it  if he means they did it as the dissenters or in genral it is false in fact and he will not pretend to it and yet this gentleman tells us the dissenters did it and leaves the world to conclude it was the whole body of dissenters  this is very hard and very unkind and i am sorry i am forced to examine so far into it but to state the fact fairly will end the whole dispute    that many of the dissenters were ignorantly drawn in to thank the king for what was the effect of an illegal dispensing power viz granting a toleration without considering that there lay hid a snake in the grass against their laws and civil liberties is acknowledged    that the artifices of the court their messengers booted apostles engines and contrivances wheedled some wellmeaning ignorant people into the snare is also not to be hid which wicked crew have been detected and some of them used as they deserved viz contemned by all honest men and particularly by the very people they deceived    the repentance of and amends made by the people so deceived their firm adherence to liberty and their principles ever since has been eminent to the overthrow of all those that formed that horrid delusion upon them and no man should reproach a penitent    and when all is done these were but a few and so few as bear no proportion worth notice to the number of the honest dissenters that to the last opposed those illegal proceedings  and to say it was the dissenters a term general and embracing the the whole as a body is most unsufferably injurious    as to the general viz addressing or thanking the king for his indulgence our author is also mistaken in his charging the dissenters unless he make it appear that any of those addresses recognized the kings right of dispensing with the laws  the liberty of conscience they thankt him for it is true was their native right and their right as christians it had been withheld from them by an unjust and illegal persecution  now tho a man restores me my right which another invaded i may thank him for the fact tho it was a debt to justice without joining in his reserved design because i am obliged in civility to him that delivers me from oppression tho it be his duty to do it else all our addresses to king william or her present majesty may be censured also  to say the king did it with an evil design is not to the purpose unless those that gave the thanks knew that design which thousands at that time were not convinced of and as soon as they were convinced abhorred the design and publicly opposed it  so far then as any of the dissenters in their addresses owned the invasion of the english laws and the kings dispensing power so far they are to be charged but if this gentleman was to examine how many he can charge with that he would be far from laying it upon the whole body for so scandalous a few  i might refer him home also and enquire whether there was no addressing here at the same time and whether some even of the ministers in scotland i care not to collect names did not address on the same head and thank the king for the very same thing  and twould be very hard if i should from thence charge the kirk of scotland with countenancing the dispensing power of king james but the justice would be the same if i should  upon these accounts i think the dissenters in england illtreated and i am i confess not a little surpised that these things being of such recent memory should slip the thoughts of any man for certainly if such addresses were made here by ministers themselves it should have been the last thing any minister here should have done to reproach the dissenters in england with and i make no doubt this gentleman will when he reflects on this do so much justice as to acknowledge his error  i shall enter into none of the arguments brought together however abruptly against the union the thing is over and the debate useless and i hope the effects will soon convince the nation of the benefit my design is not an answer to the book but a vindication of the dissenters in england from some of the worst treatment i ever remember them to have met with from one of their own brethren in my time and i think with the least provocation  i humbly and sincerely recommend it to him to reflect on the unkindness and injustice of it and to make such amends to the good name of his brethren as his own respect to justice shall persuade him is their due  finis
