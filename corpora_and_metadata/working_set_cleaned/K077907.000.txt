an account of the mechanism of the eye  wherein its power of refracting the rays of light and causing them to converge at the retina is considered with an endeavor to ascertain the true place of a cataract and to show the good or ill consequences of a judicious or injudicious removal of it  by john tailor surgeon in norwich  hear him ye deaf and all ye blind behold he from thick films shall purge the visual ray and on the sightless eyeball four the day norwich printed by henry crossgrove and sold by the booksellers of london and norwich       to mr william cheselden surgeon to st thomass hospital and fellow of the royal society sir i have heard that the watchword in the time of war is frequently the name of one of the generals and that he who makes use of it upon being demanded who goes there is allowed without further questions to pass on about his business  this engaged me to ask the liberty of prefixing your name to this trifle which however unworthy it may be of the honor will yet derive a double advantage from it first to itself then to it is author it will itself by this means pass unquestioned into the world and it is author will have an opportunity of paying due acknowledgments for the benefits he has received from your industry and ingenuity the success which has so frequently attended the use of your needle in this delicate operation sufficiently shows the niceness of your hand and the little damage you have ever done where unavoidable accidents have conspired to render the operation unsuccesful is a great evidence of the accuracy of your judgment  the knowledge i have of this branch of my profession such as it is i am wholly indebted to you for and the success i have had on a great number of subjects within these two years will i hope prove that i have followed no ill director  if i have in any degree made it probable that the opacity of the crystalline humor is the true cataract i must here own that i had the first hint of it from you and if i have done no injustice to your opinion by unworthily defending it i hope shortly to see some one of my brethren more able than myself take this method of giving you public thanks for the discovery  i am worthy sir your most obliged and most obedient humble servant john tailor  the preface i think it necessary for my own vindication to say something by way of preface and i expect to be pardoned for it by all honest impartial men for it is to such only i appeal having already suffered as much as i could suffer from men of a character quite contrary  i am sorry i have it to say that the worst usage i have met with has been from the gentlemen of my own profession and that this trifle of mine whilst an embryo has been sufficiently ridiculed by them it is perhaps still shapeless and unformed but if there are found in it the features of a man twill at least demand some regard from all those who would deserve the character of men i have been driven to such a dilemma by their unnatural treatment that for some time i have suspended the publication and was once resolved entirely to suppress it this following has been their way of arguing if it is his own twill not bear the light if twill bear the light it is not his own either side of this would be equally prejudicial to me but i shall endeavor to prove that if i have not made a very ill use of my time and advantages it may bear the light and yet be my own  when i have done this in the best manner i am capable i shall desire this following fair challenge may be annexed to my account of myself that if any of my unkind brethren have any thing to say which they think will prove me too ignorant for my profession that they may do it in the same public manner which i have made use of to prove that i am not so  the worthy gentleman to whom i have made an offer of this trifle in the dedication will be my witness of the truth of the following particulars that i attended the practice of st thomass hospital regularly and diligently the time i was a pupil there and that it was furnished at that time with a set of the best and most rational practitioners which have been ever known there  i think according to the account of the hospital that there are very seldom less than   or  000 subjects cured of their several diseases in a year and i believe it will very readily be granted by all unprejudiced people that where accidents are so various and numerous a young surgeon may improve himself more in five or six months than he can with the best private master in the kingdom in as many years here moreover a man has the opportunity of learning every branch of his profession and he who does not endeavor to practice it afterward as it comes in his way ought i think to be suspected of great negligence in his observation or want of ability to see into the reason of the practice either of which will certainly make him fearful of undertaking it because the success will always appear doubtful to him but when a man has by diligent observation on the chirurgical part and a competent knowledge of the rational qualified himself to discharge the duty of his profession with ability and honesty i think his endeavoring to do so should not only not render him obnoxious to the gentlemen of his profession but even make him claim some share of their regard and protection too from the insults of the rest of the world but to come nearer to the point and the occasion of this preface  when i came to practice in this city full of expectation of the usage just now mentioned i soon found myself miserably deceived for instead of that i was immediately surrounded with calumny and detraction and from what quarter why even from those gentlemen by whom i thought to be protected there was immediately a party raised against me who not contented with aspersing my abilities fell foul upon my manners and would fain have insinuated if they could have got any man of sense to have believed them that if a man wore tolerable good clothes and liked the company of a friend twas impossible he could be a good surgeon these are a set of worthy people who are themselves   dully grave insipidly serene and carry all their wisdom in their mien and in short they like nobody but such as are like themselves so that an awkard saintlike behavior a solemn gait an hypocritial elevation of the eye and an affected religious grimace is sufficient with them to set a man at the head of his profession if a man is recommended to any of them the first question is is he one of us if they are answered in the negative they immediately fly and though they know nothing of the man swear he has no faith no honor no capacity no money nor any thing else which can render a man qualified to be employed in any thing  it is a great hardship to fall into the hands of these gentlemen and yet to be quite void of all those valuable talents which must recommend one to their favor for my part if i am called to a patient i expect my business is with his body and not with his soul i can set a broken leg as well as my neighbors but as to cases of conscience i must leave them to be set right by gentlemen whose profession qualifies and authorizes them to do it  but i am afraid if we come to examine the matter a little more closely we shall find that this is generally all stratagem and that my worthy brethren who make use of it have an odd way of imposing upon the world and giving of it one term for another their pretended gravity should be called natural dullness for it is so in fact and where there is fire it will show itself their pretense to religion in opposition to human reason is not because they have more of the first than their neighbors but less of the latter their canting custom of asking a peculiar blessing on every thing they undertake is because they know their skill will stand very much in need of it their disaffection to human learning is because they know nothing more of it than the name and so of every thing else in short i am tired of them but i will beg leave to say they are very pretty people to trust mens lives and limbs with  i have often wondered that when the act was made for examining all surgeons before they were admitted to practice in and about london at surgeonshall the same order did not pass through every county that the country might have had the same advantage of having a set of able men amongst them as the town has many and great would have been the benefits of it to the profession in general to every able professor of it in particular and to all those whose misfortunes oblige them to have recourse to it or them for assistance every apprentice would be obliged to be diligently attentive in his business in order to qualify himself to pass his examination and this certainly in time would be of infinite advantage to the profession every able professor of it would certainly be known by that very examination to be so and by this means would be placed in his proper sphere and fear no danger from the canting blockheads beneath him the benefit of the patient is too obvious to be insisted upon his limbs very frequently and often his life too would be preserved by it  but as a capacity is not every thing which is required of a surgeon i wish there was any method as certain as this to try their honesty some i have known who have wanted both others who have had the first and wanted the latter but in order to make a good surgeon it is absolutely necessary that a man should want neither of them i will beg the liberty to relate a story or two of a gentleman who has been remarkably kind to me and i am very glad i have this opportunity of returning his civility and letting the world know that he is a man of real merit this friend of mine was sent for to a child that had dislocated its knee he carried with him plasters bandage etc in order to reduce it which he endeavored to do in the best manner his capacity would admit of after the business was over he encouraged the friends by promising the greatest success next day he called to see his little patient and found the family much pleased at his great skill declaring that the childs complaint in that part was entirely removed the doctor finding in this case that he had not spent his skill in vain began to exert himself upon it and undertook a case of much more difficulty which proved a dislocation in fact in which he assured them of the like success and that he would cure that as expeditiously as he did the other which to prove his assertions true he actually did by which wonderful cure he has demonstrated his genius in a laudable manner another brother of mine some small distance from this place had the care of a gentlewoman whom he kept in torment several years and left her at last as bad or worse than he found her she applied herself to a surgeon of my acquaintance who made a perfect cure of her in fourteen days this wonderful man was asked some time after how it came about that a man of his pretended abilities and long practice after a trial of years should miss of success in a case where a young fellow just beginning to practice succeeded to the surprise of the whole town in a few days and whether he did not think it ought to diminish his character and add to the character of the other he had a conflict with himself for some time whether he should sacrifice his capacity or honesty at last it went on the side of dear capacity and answered she had money but i shall leave him as i found him and hasten to tell you the reason of my publishing the following account of a cataract  i am more sensible than any other man can be of my own inability to perform accurately what i have proposed in my title page my design not being at all to instruct those whose regular education in physic and mathematics have qualified them to understand these things infinitely better than i can pretend to do and i declare before i enter upon the work that i have no other view in it than to satisfy the world that i am no emprick as i have been vilely and maliciously represented to be in my profession of couching but that i know as much of the nature and structure of the eye as is required of any one who pretends to the operation  the reason why this nice and necessary operation is so rarely performed by gentlemen regularly bred to the profession of surgery i take to be this that it having been a long time the distinguishing excellency of several of our famous mountebanks the regular surgeons by undertaking it are under the dreadful apprehensions of being ranked with itinerant operators commonly known by the name of quacks the fault is absolutely their own for did they not join with these empiricks whom upon every other account they sufficiently despise to oppress every young fellow who dares attempt a thing which is not the general profession of the whole fraternity whatever pains he has taken or whatever advantages he has had to make himself master of the performance did they not join to do this i say how ineffectual would all the little malice and calumny of these contemptible wretches be toward ruining the reputation of a regular surgeon and how easy would it be for us for it is we only who can do it by making a collection of the injudicious and barbarous practices of those illiterate murdering raseals so to destroy their reputations if it is not a scandal to the word reputation to use it in suck company that in a few years we might be able to take this and some other branches of our profession home to ourselves the original proprietors without any manner of danger of the foregoing imputation  an account of the mechanism of the eye as i have proposed to give some account of the mechanism of the eye i know no properer way of beginning it than by an anatomical dissection of the eye itself and after i have shown some few general diseases that the particular coats and humors of the eye are subject to i shall proceed to show how the said coats and humors are instrumental to vision and then by what particular diseases the eye is rendered totally opake and there i shall endeavor to ascertain the true place of a cataract and the consequence of a judicious or injudicious removal of it  the globe of the eye is moved by six muscles four straight and two oblique viz elevator depressor adductor abductor obliquus superior and inferior the first of these arises out of the bottom of the orbit and after it has ascended and grown tendinous is inserted into the upper part of the tunica sclerotis near the cornea the depressor arises and is inserted directly opposite to the elevator the adductor arises from the bottom of the orbit and is inserted on the side next the nose into the tunica sclerotis the abductor arises and is inserted directly opposite to the adductor the superior oblique muscle arises between the elevator and adductor at the bottom of the orbit thence ascending by the sutura transversalis becomes a round tendon which passes through a little annular cartilage called trochlea from its bearing the form of a pully at the upper and inner part of the orbit near its edge is inserted near the bottom of the eye the inferior oblique muscle arises from the os maxillae superioris thence passing over the depressor is inserted at the bottom of the eye near the abductor the four straight muscles are so fixed to the sclerotis that they lift up the eye depress it bring it toward the nose or from it hold it fast turn it round just as they act either separately or conjointly  the superior oblique muscle moves the eye round toward the nose about its axis and pulls it upward and inward and thereby directs the pupil outward and downward and thus the eye is disposed to see things placed near it the inferior oblique muscle turns the eye toward the outward corner and also upwards if these two act together they fix the eye fierce and protuberant out of the orbit moreover another use of these muscles is to suspend the eye and render it very fit to perform the motions of the other four between these muscles fat is interspersed which serves to lubricate and facilitate their motion  next we come to the coats and humors of the eye the first is the tunica adnata or conjunctiva it makes that which is called the white of the eye and is full of blood vessels which are very visible in an ophthalmia the symptoms of this disease are heat pain pulsation and an apparent distention of these blood vessels it may be occasioned externally by any thing forced against or coming into the eye irritating or compressing the fibers of this coat if this inflammation be only external the case symptomatical and the patient not worn out by other diseases it is easily curable on the contrary if it becomes so great as to tumefie the face and the humors very pungent and corrosive we judge it difficult to cure its cure depends on bleeding lenient purgation blistring cupping etc together with the assistance of a cooling diet topical application and proper collyria  the next coat is the sclerotis it expandes itself nearly into a globe membranous and hard almost like leather and encompasses the whole eye growing gradually thinner clearer and prominent in the forepart which part of it is called cornea from its transparency they make together one firm coat for the use of the other coats and humors this coat is sometimes diseased by a little white speck of a cartilaginous substance covering part of and sometimes the whole pupilla if this excrescence is only superficial it may be removed by an operation in surgery called leucotomy but if the cornea is throly affected i believe it incurable this operation is performed in the following manner viz i place the patient in a proper position and fixing the speculum oculi invented for that purpose in order to keep the globe without motion pare off the excrescence with a small curvd knife leaving as few inequalities as possible and having prevented an inflammation by proper repellents i blow a powder into the eye which assisted by the motion of the eyelid smooths off the inequalities left by the knife  next to this coat lies the tunica choroides it is a membrane of little firmness being much thinner than the former it is tinged by a dark liquor separated from the blood vessels so that it appears of a rusty dark color this coat has a perforation in it called pupilla the part of this coat which makes the circumference of this hole and which lies upon the side of the crystalline humor is called uvea composed of circular and straight fibers it is qualified by this means to contract and dilate as light and objects make different impressions upon it the outside of this last membrane is called iris where appear different colors on the inside of it from its circumference arise the processus ciliares made of short fibers like lines drawn from the circumference to the center  the last coat is the retina so called from its resemblance to a net it covers the whole fund of the eye and is nothing more than a fine expansion of the medullary fibers of the optic nerve upon which the rays of light meeting in a point convey the images of outward objects to the brain the disease of this coat is called gutta serena the eye seems clear in appearance and there are no other signs of blindness except a preternatural dilatation of the pupilla i shall have occasion to speak more largely of this disease by and by  between these coats are contained three humors the aqueous the crystalline and the vitreous the first is called aqueous because it resembles water being a thin transparent fluid it serves to extend the cornea into an equal convexity besides it serves moreover for the crystalline humor to move forward or backward in as occasion requires us to see objects nearer or farther from us  next is the crystalline it is compounded of numberless spherical segments closely united and transparent its shape is a deprest spheriod it is enclosed in a fine membrane called aranea and is much thicker than either the aqueous or vitreous its diseases and uses i shall speak of in another place  the next is the vitreous it is very clear and tenacious it lies behind the crystalline and fills the greatest part of the eye it is vascular on every side its foreside concave for the crystalline humor to lodge in and backside unequal it keeps the retina and crystalline humor at a proper distance this humor is sometimes so vitiated as to hinder or utterly destroy sight which disease is often mistook for a gutta serena  i shall now proceed to speak of the parts of the eye as they are subservient to vision  the use of the muscles in general is to direct the globe of the eye and fix it in such a position as that the rays of light reflected from any object which we would have visible to us may pass through the pupilla and paint the image of it on the retina  to form the image of any object it is necessary that the rays of light coming from it should converge and meet in a foous and we judge of the comparative magnitude of all bodies by the angle which is subtended by those bodies before the eye  to qualify the eye to perform this nature has given it a spherical form and composed it of transparent goats and humors the latter to transmit the rays coming from the luminous points of objects and the former to refract them in such a degree as to bring them all together in a point on the retina  all unequal diaphanous bodies refract the rays of light by attraction and the ray bends toward that part or the body where there is the greatest quantity of matter this in unequal bodies is the middle  therefore all rays on whatever parts of such bodies they fall are refracted toward a line drawn through the center of those bodies and made to converge behind them at a distance proportionable to the greater or less convexity of the bodies themselves thus when the eye is too flat as in old people from a decay of the humors or a shrinking of the coats or both the converging rays do not coalesce at the retina but would pass on if suffered and not come to a point but at some distance beyond it by this means vision becomes weak and indistinct  on the contrary those called myopes or nearsighted people have their eyes too gibbous and the convexity of them is so great that the rays meet and cross one another before they arrive at the retina the former eyes are helped by convexglasses which put the rays into a state of easy refraction before they fall upon the eye the latter are helped by concaveglasses through which the rays passing do diverge and fall upon the eye in such a manner as to require a greater degree of refraction than they would in their natural course in the former case the eye is not helped by the objects appearing bigger but more distinct for very small objects are rendered distinctly visible to such an eye by the help of a convexglass whereas very large ones cannot be seen enough to be distinguished by the naked eye  i dont propose to give any new theory of vision nor to be able to describe the manner of it better than it is already done by an eminent author for which reason i shall make use of his own words so far as they are serviceable to my present purpose and conducive to the main end of this treatise which is to ascertain the true place of a cataract  all the rays which come from one point of an object are by the cornea and humors of the eye united in a point of the retina which is in a straight line drawn from the same point of the object through the center of the eye and consequently all the rays which come from all the points of an object are united on the retina in the same order and proportion as the points of the objects are from whence those rays come  therefore the interposition which these rays make upon the retina must be the image of the object  and thus vision in general is performed but to know what the several parts of the globe contribute hereunto it is needful to observe that the cornea is more unequal than any other part of it by which means all the rays are gathered to pass through the pupilla and none of them are lost upon the uvea  the aqueous humor being thinnest and most liquid easily changes its figure when either the ligamentum ciliare contracts or both the oblique muscles squeeze the middle of the bulb of the eye to render it oblong when objects are too near us  the straight fibers of the uvea dilate the pupilla when there are but few rays of light and the circular fibers contract it when there are too many  when the pupilla is contracted we see most distinctly when it is dilated we see most clearly  the glassy humor keeps the crystalline at such a distance from the retina as is necessary for uniting the rays which come from one point of the object exactly in one point of the retina the impression of the object is made upon the retina  the choroides is tinctured black that the rays of light which pass through the retina may not be reflected back again to confuse the image of the object  being distinct vision consists in the union of all the rays which come from one point of an object exactly in one point of the retina and that the rays which come from objects at different distances are united at different distances behind the crystalline humor they cannot both be exactly united upon the retina therefore the eye cannot see equally distinct at the same time objects at different distances  the optic nerves pierce the globe of the eye a little on the inside of the optic axes their external coat which is a production of the dura matter is continued to the sclerotis as their internal from the pia matter is to the choroides and their medullary fibers passing through all are expanded into the retina upon which the images of objects are painted  the center of this expansion is insensible and all rays which fall upon it are lost and consequently that point of the object from which those rays come is invisible to the eye the reason of which proceeds probably from the blood vessels which enter with the optic nerve and cover this part of the retina  but whatsoever its cause is there is a manifest advantage in the optic nerves being inserted on the inside of the optic axes for if they had pierced the eye in the axis then the middle point of every object had been invisible and where all things conduce to make us see best there we had not seen at all  we must likewise have lost some part of an object if the optic nerves had been placed on the outside of the optic axes because an object may be so placed as that all the rays which come from one point may fall upon the outside of both eyes but it is impossible they should fall upon the inside of both eyes and therefore that point which is lost in one eye is visible by the other  this shall serve for the general theory of vision i shall now come to speak of a few diseases of the eye by which vision is rendered incomplete or totally destroyed and first of the cataract  before i define a cataract twill be necessary to premise a few things in order to clear the way for my definition for since the hypothesis i go upon is new and not yet clearly demonstrated it would be looked upon as a strange piece of presumption to overlook in the gross all the different objections which may be made against it and satisfy myself with only a few probabilities collected out of my own little experience and observation which may seem to make for it  objection i it is demonstrated by the mathematicians that neither corpuscles in the aqueous or crystalline humor can be perceived on the retina and it is said by physicians that a beginning of a cataract is a suffusion of the eye when little clouds motes and flies seem to float about in the air now if these assertions are both true one would be apt to conclude that neither the aqueous nor crystalline humor can be the seat of a cataract the first is indisputable but the latter is not always true in fact  for i have known a good number of subject with real confirmed cataracts who never remember to have been thus affected at the beginning of them  and although some at the beginning of cataracts are thus affected it is no proof that the disease may not be in one or the other of these humors for the same cause which will produce a cataract may at the same time the cataract is forming affect also the fund of the eye and by disordering the blood vessels here and there stop the influx of the animal spirits into the little filaments of the optic nerve which help to make the retina this will certainly produce them clouds motes etc  and i have the more reason to believe this because i have couched several who after the cataract has been well suppressed have remained blind with a gutta serena which is i suppose a total stoppage of the influx of the animal spirits into the nervous filaments aforementioned  objection ii it is supposed that without the assistance of the crystalline humor there could be no vision that is except that humor lay always ready to receive the rays and refract them after they had passed the pupilla they would still proceed with so small a degree of refraction that their place of converging would be beyond the retina and by consequence vision would be rendered very indistinct or perhaps the eye would only perceive a confussd glare of light if this humor was taken away and this could be demonstrated twould not destroy my supposition for i freely acknowledge that after the removal of a cataract or the crystalline humor which as i proceed i shall use synonymously vision is never so perfectly performed as it was before the eye was diseased  and if the subjects i have hitherto performed the operation upon were of consideration enough to have given me pains beyond my needle i make no doubt but i could have fixed them with glasses which would have still assisted their sight and made them some amends for the loss of the aforesaid humor  objection iii if vision can be performed without this humor and the maxim is true quod natura nihil agit frustra why was it placed in the eye  i answer it is placed there to enable the eye to see equally well at different distances for since the rays proceeding from the luminous points of nigh objects diverge more than those from more remote objects the power of making them equally converge at the retina is very probably lodged in the crystalline humor which according to the different distances of objects approaches nigher to or removes farther from the retina and perhaps too assumes a different convexity  and this i look upon to be unquestionable because i have made it my constant observation that after a successful depressure of a cataract the patient sees best at a distance something greater than the eye requires when all its parts are in their natural situation and that if the object is placed considerably further from or nearer to the eye vision is rendered indistinct or confused  objection iv but if the crystalline humor is depressed what becomes of it afterward and how is the cavity filled up which the said humor possessed in its natural situation  answer when i pass my needle into the eye i press directly forward to the crystalline humor and endeavoring to disengage it from the ligamentum ciliare i depress it to the bottom of the vitreous humor when the pupilla immediately seems clear to me and such a torrent of confused light rushes into the eye as sometimes affrights the patient even more than the puncture of the needle  common sense tells us that if a solid body which is immersed in a fluid should be removed from one part of that fluid into another it makes no alteration in the bulk of the whole for whatever place the solid is removed to it fills up but so much space precisely as it did in the space which it was removed from immediately upon the removal of the crystalline humor the aqueous turns in and fills up the cavity  n b from the different specific gravity of the crystalline humor which in all probability is different in different stages of the distemper we may account for what is called the rising again of the cataract as to what becomes of the crystalline humor after it is depressed it is not unlikely that being broke from the vessels which nourished it it shrinks by degrees and as it were melts into the vitreoeus  dr turner says a cataract is a disease of the eye in which a film or skin growing before the pupilla like a curtain drawn against a hole letting the light into a room hinders the passage of the same till it is depressed by the needle as in couching  there is no one of my profession who pays a greater veneration to the authority of that worthy learned and ingenious gentleman than myself i am beholden to him that i have a regular methodical and i may venture to say a certain system of surgery in my head and hand but as he himself who had always more business in other parts of surgery than a man of his studious temper could well attend to very rarely if ever performed the operation i hope twill not be thought presumption if when i come to speak of the operation itself i should venture to give some reasons which may seem to thwart his opinion and establish my own  that there are such films as the doctor mentions on this side the pupilla and in the aqueous humor i can readily grant having met with several of them in the little course of my practice these the practitioners are allowed to call suffusions films etc but not cataracts for i am determined to call no disease of the eye by this latter name except that particular one which is to be remedied by the use of the needle but the case as mentioned by the doctor can receive no benefit that i know of by the operation nor did i ever attempt to couch a patient though i have had several offered me when the circumstances were as beforementioned this i shall endeavor to demonstrate in describing the operation itself  the french authors with vaughion at the head of them imagine a cataract to be a film separated from the crystalline humor and floating in tine aqueous that all its parts are existent in its first conformation that it is a cystis and that cystisses are never formed de novo but are only membranes disengaged from the neighboring parts which increasing in thickness receive nourishment from the parts to which they adhere  i shall beg leave to examine this opinion a little and however specious and refined it may seem i am afraid we shall find as little reality in it as there is in the ordinary profession of friendship amongst the gentlemen of their country  first they say it is a membrane disengaged from the crystalline and floating in the aqueous the first they dont offer to prove and the latter is false in fact for if this pretended disengaged membrane should float in the aqueous the patient would have at least a chance of seeing now and then a little by its being removed wholly or in part from before the pupilla but such a removal we find never happens and that after the formation of the cataract the eye continues in a constant equal blindness till the cause is removed by the needle i must beg them then to fix their floating island before they pretend to make a rational hypothesis of it and if they do i hope they will be so kind as to let us know to what membranes they will join it and in what manner it receives nourishment from them then well talk farther with them  what have led the frenchmen into the talk of its being a cystis and that no cystisses are formed de novo is the late discoveries made by the improvements of microscopes they are wonderfully pleased with and fond of the opinion that every thing which is proceeds originally from an egg or seed but however true this may be of perfect beings i dont expect that the same will be asserted of the funguss of trees and other supernatural excrescences i can be very well content to believe that sloughs and mucus may be detached from several membranes in the body and may afterward increase by an addition of the same matter and yet there may be no cystis but i shall prove presently that it is impossible a cataract should be in this part of the eye and that will at once put an end to the controversy  what has given me frequent occsion o reflecting lately has been the odd manne of our authors of general theories they undertake to describe and define every particular disease with as much freedom an positiveness as if they had been acquainte themselves with a good number of patient laboring under such disease and had mad the causes symptoms cure etc of it their peculiar study  how just a proceeding this is will appea by the following definition of a cataract in a late modern writer of this sort  a suffusion says he is a thick foulness o excrescence of the tunica cornea adnata or aqueous humor which when confirm makes the cataract  according to this account any thing which thickens the cornea or makes the aqueous humor dark and cloudy may be termed a cataract for he seems to use the word cataract not as any particular disease but only as something which shall darken and obscure the sight by hindering the transmission of the rays of light thus the albugo pterygium hyopyon or the viscidity of the aqueous humor frequently consequent upon an ophthalmia may be justly deemed a cataract but how this squares with the real notion of this disease and its cure i shall leave my readers after a few pages to determine  but passing over all the different definitions and surmises of others i shall take the liberty for reasons which i shall give afterward to define it in the following manner  a cataract is a disease of the crystalline humor whereby the said humor is totally or at least one side of it rendered opake the humor in this diseased state reflect all or most of the rays of light instead of transmitting them to the retina in consequence of which the humor appears whitish bluish yellowish etc and the eye is blind  causes any blow or shock which may alter the particular position of the particles of which this humor is composed for to make a body diaphanous it is not only necessary that it should be made of such particular particles but that those particles should be combined and united after a particular manner thus salts wet paper or the oculus mundi stone grow opake by being dried horn by being scraped glass by being reduced to powder or otherwise flawd turpentine by being stirred about with water till they mix imperfectly  the matter which is separated for the natural nourishment of this humor from the blood may from the too great viscidity of the blood itself either be separated in too small a quantity the glands and strainers of these parts being exceeding fine and by this atrophy the humors may grow dry and opake as paper salts oculus mundi stone etc or otherwise upon a fever or ophthalmia the vessels leading to this humor may be so enlarged as to admit particles of an improper figure or magnitude the heterogeneous particles if i may so call them instead of properly nourishing the humor may be lodged irregularly in its pores as water and turpentine as above and by destroying that equality which we are told is necessary to transparency render the humor opake  it may be caused by violent grief which occasions a more than natural secretion of tears from an adjacent part this may from a continuance make so great a revulsion that the crystalline humor may probably grow dry or suffer diminution for want of its usual supplies i have reasons to imagine this because in eyes thus diseased i have found this humor much smaller than ordinary  it may and often does proceed from an unskillful treating of the eye in an ophthalmia whilst there is a more than ordinary flux of matter upon the parts which seems to entreat a passage through the coats instead of alluring it forwards by kind discutients i have too frequently known it drove back by cold repellents and by lodging itself in the coats and humors of the eye at once deprive it of its use and beauty  dr pitcarn in speaking of a cataract says some ascribe it to the thickning or coagulating of the aqueous humor and others to that of the crystalline but these know nothing of the nature of the eye for corpuscles floating in the aqueous or crystalline humo cannot be prerceivd on the retina  for once i will run the risque of having my understanding censured and venture to say that though the corpuscles themselves are not seen being within the eye yet they can hinder the eye from discerning every distinct part of any object which is without it and these little specks of darkness amidst a glare of light are mistaken by the patient for something positive when they are only privations and the effect would be the same if there were any stoppages in the small nervous filaments which compose the retina  thus the doctors philosophy is true when he says they cannot be seen etc but if he would pretend to infer from thence that they can be no causes why the eye cannot see other things his consequence is false and clearly demonstrated to be so by mr cheselden at the end of his anatomy  diagnostick it is known by a diminution of sight in the patient and by something which appears like a bluish cloud behind the pupilla though the color of it often varies i do not yet know whether there be any reason given for the variety of colors but i have observed that the green and yellow are generally in old subjects  prognostic not so rnuch the age of the person is to be considered as the age and ripeness of the cataract i have seen both very young and very old subjects couched with success though the best prognostic is certain to be made in a middle age and good habit  if a surgeon understands the operation and is at all able to judge when the cataract is ripe for it he has a great deal of reason to promise success  if an uncommon inflammation supervenes which he cannot foresee and sometimes it is impossible for him to prevent he is not to be blamed if he misses of success though he had seemed pretty positive in promising it both to his patient and himself  regimen before the operation in order to prevent an ophthalmia use proper evacuations as bleeding lenient purgatives etc a few days before the operation  operation the most temperate seasons are the best for which reason i make choice of spring or autumn it is requisite the day should be fine and clear and the light well chosen i oblige the patient to recline his head backwards upon a pillow the pillow is supported by the back of a chair of a proper height behind the patient an assistant is placed to keep his head without motion twill be necessary too for a person on each side to secure the hands of the patient for i have seen very ill consequences attend the neglect of this having thus prepared the patient i place myself on a stool raised by pillows according to the height of the subject till i have a full command of the patients eye then bidding him turn his eye toward his nose so that the tunica conjunctiva may be sufficiently apparent i plunge my needle directly into the vitreous humor through the tunica conjunctiva about the distance of the tenth part of an inch from the cornea then thrusting it boldly to the upper part of the crystalline gently turn the flat part of my needle on the top of the cataract by which means i have a greater surface upon it and the cataract consequently less liable to slip from under my needle i depress it very slowly and place it as i think at the bottom of the vitreous humor i dont immediately remove my needle off it but continue it depressed for about half a minute for reasons which i shall give when i come to speak of the causes of a cataracts rising again after this i draw my needle back about the sixth part of an inch and gently raising the point take it quite out of the eye  regimen after the operation immediately after the operation i apply a repellant compress and order the patient to be put to bed raising his head something higher than usual and after suffering of him to remain quiet a few hours i renew my dressing and begin to treat him with a cool regimen proper diet etc as in a symptomatical fever this i do to second the intention of the former regimen notwithstanding which an ophthalmia in spite of all i can do will sometimes supervene and then it must be treated as such  these ophthalmias are sometimes so violent as to become difficult of cure and often produce all the effects and perhaps too really bring that distemper upon the eye called gutta serena this last mentioned disease is seated on the retina and may be brought on by any thing which will enlarge the capillary arteries of that membrane for they lying contiguous to the nerves and their diameters being increased the intermediate nerves are so pressed betwixt them that the influx of the animal spirits is entirely prohibited and all commumication is cut off betwixt them and the original of the optic nerves in the brain which is the commune sensorium thus though the cataract continues well depressed and the eye in all appearance perfectly clear yet the patient will remain blind and it is too often beyond the reach of art to give him any assistance  however i generally use all the evacuations proper in a stubborn ophthalmia with calomel purgatives etc and keep the patient to an attenuating diet obliging him to abstain from all viscid nutriments and to use much exercise this method i have known to meet with its desired success  there are many other causes besides this common one which may render the operation unsuccessful first the rising again of the cataract  the cataract will sometimes rise again even before the needle is out of the eye there are many specious reasons to be assigned for it though perhaps none of them true however i shall mention what i have hitherto imagined not without a promise to correct any thing i shall here say if i find it contradicted by future practice  the first reason which is perhaps more obvious to others than myself is that the crystalline humor being diseased is become specifically lighter than the vitreous and that being disengaged from the membranes to which it in some measure adhered and depressed to the bottom of the vitreous upon removal of the needle it ascends by its own specific levity and places itself at or near the place from whence it was removed  the next is that consisting of very glutinous parts and being joined perhaps to the uvea the needle only removes the main body which still remains attached to the uvea by certain small elastick filaments which as soon as the needle is removed contract themselves and again lift up the crystalline humor into its natural position  if it remains depressed for some days and afterward rises again but being a second or third time depressed it continues where you would place it it may proceed from an increased viscidity in the humor itself or from a rarefaction of that fluid into which it is immersed both of which will perhaps be consequent upon an inflammation perhaps from an elasticity in the cornea whereby the aqueous humor may be immediately thrust into its place by removal of the crystalline which elasticity and contraction of the cornea may possibly be too great to be overcome by the diffrent specific gravity of the crystalline  but i must confess if i was to give my opinion of the general cause of the rising again of the cataract immediately upon its being depressed i should imagine it to be the lifting up the point of the needle before i withdraw it very near back again to the place from whence i removed the cataract for i imagine that the specific gravity of the crystalline humor being very little different if at all from that of the vitreous would never be sufficient to overcome the resistance of the said vitreous humor which is a very viscid and tenacious fluid unless there was a passage made for it to rise again by that motion of the needle which i have just now expressed and therefore hold it necessary that after the cataract is depressed the needle ought to be kept some time upon it that the fluid above it may have time perfectly to reunite so as becoming all over equally tenacious it may be empowered to keep the cataract in the position we would have it  another cause of ill success is the wounding the uvea or iris the consequence of which will be an irregular form of the pupilla some of which i have seen entirely closed however if they are not so there is always such a callosity upon the wounded membrane as stops up the pupilla in one part and leaves such an opening of it on the other that by stopping up the rays where they should pass and suffering them to pass where they should not the eye is rendered entirely useless  these parts too when wounded sometimes ulcerate by which ulceration the whole coats and humors of the eye become one common mass of pus and the eye entirely sinks  the reason that a person is obliged to wound the uvea and iris is when he would endeavor to remove a film which lies in the aqueous humor or on this side the pupilla and this till i know better i shall call an injudicious practice  it often happens that the said coats are wounded through the fault of the patient even when the operation is the most judiciously performed for he not havingcourage to keep his eye in the position he was directed and by endeavoring to fly from the pain which is given by the first puncture of the needle which he imagines is only to be done by motion and not being able to move his eye any farther toward the great canthus turns it back against the point or edge of the needle and by this means in spite of all the art or address of the surgeon will with that motion wound the coats abovementioned but this last accident does not happen to a man who knows what he is doing perhaps above once in twenty times  another reason of ill success is the cataract proving milky to be able to determine mine whether it is so or not before i touch it with my needle i have not yet learned and should be glad to be informed by any body who has  another cause of ill success which is also sometimes attributed to the surgeon may be a strange fondness of sight which engages the patient after having been couched three or four days to pull off the dressings in the absence of the surgeon by which he exposing the eye to the assaults of the open air brings on that ophthalmia which we were endeavoring to prevent in this case he himself is blamable and not the surgeon for all the ill consequences that may attend it one of which i have found often to be the entire loss of sight  another misfortune which too frequently attends the unhappy patient is when the cataract is accompanied with a gutta serena perhaps of as long standing as the cataract itself this we find when upon depressing the cataract and there is no possibility of judging of it before and the pupilla remaining clear the patient notwithstanding continues in total darkness this case is indeed deplorable i should be unwilling to think that there was any part of mankind such strangers to common sense as to imagine this to be a fault of the surgeon but i myself have more than once been calumniated on this very account i cannot help saying i have been unfairly dealt with by some of the gentlemen of my own profession who have misrepresented the cases and deluded the common people as well as injured me this was the case of three subjects that i lately couched in yarmouth  n b i have met with the same treatment on account of a subject which i cut for the stone where i will undertake to demonstrate to any man in england that it was as impossible to meet with success in that operation as it was circumstancd as it is to succeed in the operation of couching where the cataract is attended with a gutta serena for unless a man could directly look into the body in the one case or down to the bottom of the eye in the other he can be no more able to make a positive prognostic than he would be to alter the circumstances  i shall make here another observation that where there is a cataract in one eye and the other eye sound and good the patient dont ought to be encouraged to suffer the diseased eye to be couched because the symptoms which may possibly attend it may be the occasion of the loss of both  i shall take the liberty of mentioning a case of my own wherein i have met with some of the aforementioned accidents about five months since a patient came to me with a confirmed cataract in one eye and a suffusion in the other i found the cataract good and after the common preparations depressed it with no apparent ill accident the eye continued clear and the patient saw for some days at which time an inflammation came on which equally affected both eyes and notwithstanding all i could do to abate it the coats and humors were so thickened by it that the eye which had the suffusion in it became totally blind and some time after that which i had couched was in like manner entirely deprived of sight though the cataract remain depressed and the pupilla perfectly clear  observation it seems pretty plain that the suffusion abovementioned was nothing more than the beginning of a cataract caused by the crystalline humor growing thick and muddy and that this inflammation by increasing the viscidity of the matter separated for the nourishment of the said humor increased the thickness so as to render the humor entirely opake or in other terms ripened the cataract the reason why i did not venture to couch it afterward was an uncommon dilatation of the pupilla which had been from the beginning of the suffusion the disease of the other was a direct gutta serena caused by the inflammation in the manner before deseribd  the subject i have been treating of being altogether new i shall beg leave to add the following queries to be considered by the gentlemen of my profession not troubling myself whether they make for or against my hypothesis  query i whether the reason of the dilaation of the pupilla in one eye and not the her may not be this that the crystalline humor being rendered somewhat less transparent than formerly the patient finds that the rays of light do not strike so clearly and for cibly as they used to do or in other words the eye is darker than in its natural state to amend which he naturally and one may almost say involuntarily dilates the pupilla in order to receive more rays of light and recompense the defect of the diseased humor  the same is done whenever we want to see objects in the dark but in this case the cause remaining constant the dilatation is constant too till the pupilla by the frequent use of this motion becomes actually wider than it ought naturally to be in such a dilatation as i here mention we cannot promise any great success from the use of the needle for was the humor itself perfectly clear such a dilated pupilla would admit such a glare and flow of rays to the retina as would render vision confused and indistinct much less can we hope to have a good eye when that humor so necessary to vision is entirely removed  query ii whether the cataract sometimes appearing at first in a white point and afterward spreading itself like a line drawn from a center to a circumference is not a proof that it is a transparent body already formed growing thick and cloudy rather than the beginning of a new membrane  n b the composition of the crystalline humor in the anatomy of the eye  query iii whether cataracts very old and discolored declining in the same manner and becoming angulous and uneven is not a proof of the same thing  query iv whether it would not be worth while to observe after the couching a young subject if the same subject is ever troubled with a second cataract properly distinguishing whether it be the same cataract risen again or not and this i think is best to be done by observing the interval of time which passes between his being couched and the appearance of this second cataract whether if this observation be just and a second cataract be formed in the same eye and in the same subject this would not destroy my hypothesis  query v whether our not being able to remove a cataract at its first appearance is not a proof that it is not the crystalline humor because for all what we know certainly the crystalline humor is equally removable at all times  query vi whether or no in that stage of the disease which we call a milky cataract there may not be such a solution of continuity of the parts of the crystalline humor as may suffer the needle to pass backwards and forwards in it without being able to remove it out of its place  query vii and whether in a farther stage of this disease the parts may not again close and stick together in such a manner as that the whole body of the humor may be at once removed by only pressing upon a particular part of it  query viii whether there may not be a gradation of coloring settled from sir isaac newtons theory beginning at a light blue and ending at a greenish yellow whereby we might be able to determine the exact age of a cataract as soon as we see it and whether such a particular color will or will not successfully bear the needle  query ix whether it is not possible to invent a speculum oculi which may keep the globe of the eye without motion and without giving that pain to the patient which too frequently contributes to the bringing on of an inflammation i mention this because i have seen so many inconveniences attend the use of the common speculum oculi that rather than use it myself i have chose to have nothing to assist me except the pressure of the thumb and finger  query x whether a trembling which i have observed in the aqueous humor some time after couching does not proceed from a loss of part of that humor in couching and whether this trembling is one reason why the rays of light pass confused into the eye  query xi whether there is room for the needle to pass between the crystalline humor and the uvea without removing the former so as to spoil the eye or cutting or lacerating the latter  query xii whether if this last is practicable there is not a possibility of removing a film that may be in the forepart of the pupilla notwithstanding the needle enters in at the backpart of it  query xiii whether there might not be a nice experiment made by placing an eye like a lens in the hole of a dark chamber i think if i remember rightly i have met with the following account in an author of experimental philosophy stripping the fund of the eye of its integuments he placed it as abovementioned and holding a piece of white paper within the room at a small distance from the eye he distinctly perceived the images of all objects from without painted upon the paper as they would have been upon the retina if the eye had been in its natural position  had a nice hand been there who would have gone on the outside and with a needle as in couching depressed the crystalline humor and if notwithstanding this depression the person within could still perceive the images as before it would be a certain proof that the eye might see notwithstanding the loss of the crystalline humor  the eye should be taken down and dissected and by observing in what part the crystalline humor after its removal was lodged we should receive a great light into the theory of couching and much satisfaction as to the truth of this hypothesis  i only mention this as it seems to me possible without being able to determine whether it is practicable or not  conclusion before i conclude i thought it my duty to mention and in the words of a great man that as a candid and sincere behavior ought to be preferred to all other considerations i would not let my heart reproach me with a consciousness of having gained even the possibility of a praise which is not in every particular my right i therefore thought proper to acknowledge that i am obliged to a very ingenious gentleman whom i have the honor to be acquainted with for two or three hints that he has given me in the latter part of this short dissertation which otherwise probably might have been omitted  nb i believe it will be necessary to observe to such persons as are not judges of the subject i have been treating of that i have therein demonstrated the reason of my not meeting with success in some patients that i have couched particularly in yarmouth  finis
