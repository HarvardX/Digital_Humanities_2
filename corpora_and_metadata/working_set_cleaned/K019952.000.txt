an ode to the naiads of fleetditch  by arthur murphy esquire  out with it dunciad let the secret pass that secret to each fool that he is an ass pope aspice number mage sit nostrum penetrabile telum virg london printed for m cooper in paternoster row mdcclxi  advertisement it is a just image given us by mr congreve of the situation of an author where he mentions a poet ambitious of praise and a critic picking his pocket it is indeed almost impossible for any man to distinguish himself in the literary world without having a gang of these people swarming about him though he has at the same time this consolation that all such petty larceny attempts are a mark of his fame and the unprovoked abuse of illdesigning persons is in its own nature involuntary praise  the author of the following trifle has had his share of this kind of trouble ever since his name has been heard of he has boasted upon a former occasion of the honor a certain reverend writer did him by his calumny but as if that was not sufficient his name is now adorned with a parson churchill this last persons hand he has felt in his pocket twice in a very short time in the rosciad it was but a dip and away but as if this astonishing genius who has lately amazed mankind had improved in his trade in his apology he has attempted to make an entire rummage whether he has taken any thing out of the present writers pocket is a point not very certain so that the loss however cannot be very great  but it may be asked can the reverend mr churchill curate of st johns westminster be considered as mr murphys literary pickpocket when he boldly owns his name and shows himself to the public  in answer to this it should be considered that these people have various ways of doing their business some of them sneak in alleys and little lurking holes and as a gentleman passes by they make a snatch at his pocket and should they prove so unfortunate as to give an alarm and meet with a short turn  pray remember the poor  for the love of   others of them go more daringly to work  bob do you see that gentleman yonder  shall i do him  ay ay cries bob do him by all means  so i will  link your honor  light your honor across the street  my name is charley dunghill  i ply here every night your honor  then on he runs twirling his link almost in your face  gives you an unlucky splash and in your sudden confusion makes a snap at your handkerchief his friends admire his dexterity he is proclaimed abroad for a notable clever fellow you are told he is a bruiser into the bargain and handles an oakstick wonderfully this will be acknowledged to be the case among the pilferers in our common streets and among their brethren of the quill the conduct is so similar that the writer of the subsequent ode cannot consider the reverend charles churchill in any other light than that of a critic picking his pocket and as he is well informed that mr john fielding has attained many points highly serviceable to society by quick notice and sudden pursuit among the nimblefingered race who infest this metropolis he is in hopes that the same means will operate equally in the literary world for this purpose he now thinks proper to celebrate the egregious endowments of this new adventurer desiring it may be remembered that this is the first notice he has given of him for notwithstanding the insinuations of mr churchill and his friends be it hereby known that mr murphy never wrote or caused to be written directly or indirectly a single line in the critical review in justice however to the public and himself he thinks it now incumbent on him to give the best description he can of the man who has at two different times made an attempt upon him should this furious drawcansir after this think proper to proceed in his design mr murphy in consideration of his being unbeneficed and reflecting how hard the present dearness of provisions and the late tax upon porter must bear upon the reverend bard most heartily gives his consent to be abused by him body soul and muse as often as thirst or hunger shall prompt his genius and should he be told hereafter that the author of unpoetic libels is not hurt in his preferment but that to one bishop churchill seems a wit he promises him to repine less at his success though provoked than mr churchill and his little faction seem unprovoked to have done at mr murphys  lincolns end    th june      p s to some particular ideas and modes of expression which will be found in the following lines the author persuades himself that they who are acquainted with the style and coloring of mr dryden in the mac flecknoe and mr pope in the dunciad will take no exception unless they should choose to criticize the too manifest inferiority of his genius    ode to the naiads of fleetditch i ye nutbrown naiads of that sable flood to which auxiliar sewers their homage pay and little rills meandring over the mud wind from a thousand urinals their way to swell his course what time the king of dykes into the silver thames impetuous strikes each weed that on the margin grows drinks life and stench as on he flows now the rich stream of nuisance foul and strong with kenneldrains confederated pours along over filth and cloacinas yellow reign now swelling over his banks amain see him devolve in sullen pride dead cats and dogs and drunken bards down headlong with the tide ii yes nymphs ye blackeyd daughters of fleetditch when midnight in her mantle black as pitch led forth her shadowy train on parnassus high domain the muse has heard your piteous cry has heard ye pierce the vaulted sky and like ten thousand grinding scizzars shrill your screams her ears with discord harsh did fill while you performed through all the mire the orgies of your sooty quire then sitting on the swampy bank with sable ooze your tresses dank dirt still inspiring all your throng from every breast burst forth the miserable song iii perdition quick perdition seize the caitiff the pernicious man who first the citizens to please of a new bridge devised the plan no longer our muchloved domain in dear stagnation shall remain no more the mudnymphs here shall keep their lazy courts no more shall sleep in puddle here but over the bed where gentle smedley plunged his head where famed oldmixon awful sire soucd in and wallowd in the mire where all our favorites loved to sink inhaling vigor from the stink this bed the scene of all our joys in evil hour you bridge destroys may quick perdition seize the man who big with ruin formed the plan iv these were the notes that reached the muses ears the muses marked your unmelodious without the meed of some melodious tear milton tears then saw ye headlong down the steep explore the bottom of the deep plunged into endless night even now in every cell beneath where toads obscene and adders breathe concealed from human sight the virgins of poetic eye can your disastrous state descry can see from your dripping hair the faded honors rend away each feature fell with dire dismay and all your slattern bosoms bare v your screams too pierced the watchmans soul soho he cried and couched his quivering pole ah naiads cureless is your woe then let your sorrows flow yes rant and rave and yell and hiss the more you cry the less you will  yes over your heads a street shall rise through which fair albion with surprise shall see rough industry with eye intent adown his cheek while wholesome dewdrops roll urge eager on on schemes of riches bent and lay his burden at the wished for goal thither pomona her first fruits shall send the gifts of golden ceres that way bend wellloaded commerce over your heads shall bound and with the gilded carr the ecchoing pavement shall resound vi ah deem not burghers of the dyke that to insult ye all forlorn my willing hand the lyre does strike alas you have full cause to mourn to you no more shall muchloved shirley come no more reveal the honors of his bum no more you will see him drunk with gin no more admire his ghastly grin with him no longer now you will flirt and fling the mud and fling the dirt no more alas you will bruise the toad for him its venom to unload and fill him with rank poison to the brim but now he will look both impotent and grim his eyes sunk hollow in their pit and nothing from his mouth to spit vii where shall your churchill in that dismal hour when stopped are all your sewers and all your power where shall he wander not thy warbling fount aonian aganippe not thy shades laurelld parnassus nor thy sacred mount thricehonourd pindus not the tuneful maids that with sweet airs bid isis banks resound or knit in dance where camus winds along with the young graces over the enameled ground move to some measure of immortal song not these could ever charm not these detain his steps unhallowed from your drear domain your dripping arches where the lazy flood just oozes through and stagnates into mud he still preferred there often was heard to your delighted ears to read his page his modern atalantis of the stage how wanton lucy spreads her charms and clasps her favorite in her arms he told of wounds obscene and amorous scars in the soft conflict gained of venus wars of the sweet thefts and kind deceits the falsehoods perjuries and cheats of every actress and her crony through the whole dramatis personae through your vast courts while all your strumpet brood heard the lewd loves with wanton glee and testified their joy in frantic mood from ha ha ha  to he he he viii not even the solemn bell that tolls the signal of departed souls and bodies waiting funeral rite withheld him from his dear delight though the pale corse from every sable shroud called for the last sad obsequies aloud inter us doctor by the powers above nor grudge malignant to our claycold limbs one particle of earth  so lightly fall whatever the critical review indites whatever the mimic in his pleasant vein conceives of clumsy curates  so may flexney for each dull work afford thee half a crown and in st giless none be happier thought than thy unclassic muse  though now in haste yet tarry doctor in mere pity tarry the dust thrice thrown you then may wing your flight he wings his flight allheedless of their prayer no dirge he mutters over the tomb but wages war with every nameless playr irrevrend war  but now his doom with yours impends  what shall he do with tears and sighs and groans he will rue your empires fall  no more he will sit in foremost row before the astonished pit in brawn oldmixons rival as in wit and grin dislike and kiss the spike and twist his mouth and wreath his head awry the arch absurd quick glancing from his eye and giggle and wriggle and fiddle and piddle and piddlepaddle and fiddlefaddle and show with pious leer and double chin that arrogance and gospel dwell within ix ah parodissa ironissa too soft simperilla mild but never true envyna pale waggilla once a maid but now called in to each lewd scribblers aid oh all ye mudnymphs ah the hours are fled when at his wellknown voice your every head above the filth you raised and at the sight of the dear bard with frantic cries of hideous joy the realms of light you pierced then headlong from the skies as arethusa her son sprung from gods you led him floundring to your drear abodes from hollow cells he heard the adders hiss as first he entered on this world of p  no water there from limpid sources springs to chafe his head no nymph the towel brings far other rites your sisterhood employ far other orgies of obscener joy with ordure fresh his body one anoints and wakes new vigor in his languid joints another stradling over his head with grace lets fly the briny torrent in his face the briny torrent down his temples ran he breathed fleetditch and stunk above a man then rolled his eyes and stard tremendous wit though to mere mortals but a priest b  then bowed his uncouth form and smiled and with soft prate the hours beguiled with wonder eyed the secret store of infrence sly and quaint conceit like embryos on the swampy floor waiting from him their birth to meet he saw where essays against each good play and much of libel upon merit lay against gray and mason much pert flimsy ode of yellowtincturd rosciad many a load much gazetteer much craftsman struck his view much of himself and much of shirley too he saw where scandals streams arise and wind their urinary course along from grubstreet bards the fount of lies scanty at first but swelling strong from tributary urns joy over his visage burns as a view around he takes of criticisms dull stagnate lakes as defamation pours and stinks along as inuendos rills creep softly by as irony its bottom to the eye betrays all foul and malice deep and strong now flows amain with tide profound now shallow grown just murmurs over the ground x joy fills his soul joy sheds a mellower grace over the brown horrors of his walnut face of every stream he quaffs deep drafts immense and drinks oblivion of all truth and sense intoxicates his brains until in fuming rills at flexneys door he all again distills but ah ye naiads now your reign is over and now your unborn bard no more to your beloved haunts shall go and woo his loves impure in grots of mud below no more seek inspiration at your shrine but all alone unheard unknown he will pine mirth shall no more revisit those dim eyes unless he hear when patient merit sighs but merit still shall hold her steady flight though malice all her deadliest shafts should aim though clouds often interpose shall rise to light and soar on wings which her own hands have formed to fame finis
