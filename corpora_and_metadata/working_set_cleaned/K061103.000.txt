every one has his fault a comedy in five acts as it is performed at the theater royal covent garden  by mrs inchbald  london printed for g g j and j robinson paternosterrow       prologue by the rev mr nares spoken by mr farren our author who accuses great and small and says so boldly there are faults in all sends me with dismal voice and lengthened phiz humbly to own one dreadful fault of his a fault in modern authors not uncommon it is  now dont be angry  he is  a woman can you forgive it nay i will tell you more one who has dared to venture here before has seen your smiles your frowns  tremendous sight o be not in a frowning mood tonight the play perhaps has many things amiss well let us then reduce the point to this let only those that have no failings hiss the rights of women says a female pen are to do every thing as well as men to think to argue to decide to write to talk undoubtedly  perhaps to fight for females march to war like brave commanders not in old authors only  but in flanders i grant this matter may be strained too far and maid against man is most uncivil war i grant as all my city friends will say that men should rule and women should obey that nothing binds the marriage contract faster than our  a zounds madam i am your lord and master i grant their nature and their frailty such women may make too free  and know too much but since the sex at length has been inclined to cultivate that useful part  the mind  since they have learnt to read to write to spell  since some of them have wit  and use it well  let us not force them back with brow severe within the pale of ignorance and fear confined entirely to domestic arts producing only children pies and tarts the favorite fable of the tuneful nine implies that female genius is divine then drive not critics with tyrannic rage a supplicating fairone from the stage the comic muse perhaps is growing old her lovers you well know are few and cold it is time then freely to enlarge the plan and let all those write comedies  that can  dramatis personae men lord norland mr farren sir robert ramble mr lewis mr solus mr quick mr harmony mr munden mr placid mr fawcett mr irwin mr pope hammond mr powell porter mr thompson edward miss grist women lady eleanor irwin mrs pope mrs placid mrs mattocks miss spinster mrs webb miss wooburn mrs esten servants etc scene london  every one has his fault a comedy act i scene i an apartment at mr placids enter mr placid and mr solus placid you are to blame   solus i say the same by you   placid and yet your singularity pleases me for you are the first elderly bachelor i ever knew who did not hug himself in the reflection that he was not in the trammels of wedlock   solus no i am only the first elderly bachelor who has truth and courage enough to confess his dissatisfaction   placid and you really wish you were married   solus i do i wish still more that i had been married thirty years ago oh i wish a wife and halfascore children would now start up around me and bring along with them all that affection which we should have had for each other by being earlier acquainted but as it is in my present state there is not a person in the world i care a straw for and the world is pretty even with me for i dont believe there is a creature in it who cares a straw for me   placid pshaw you have in your time been a man of gallantry and consequently must have made many attachments   solus yes such as men of gallantry usually make i have been attached to women who have purloined my fortune and to men who have partaken of the theft i have been in as much fear of my mistress as you are of your wife   placid is that possible   solus yes and without having one of those tender delicate ties of a husband an excuse for my apprehension  i have maintained children    placid then why do you complain for the want of a family   solus i did not say i ever had any children i said i had maintained them but i never believed they were mine for i could have no dependence upon the principles of their mother  and never did i take one of those tender infants in my arms that the forehead of my valet the squinteye of my apothecary or the doublechin of my chaplain did not stare me in the face and damp all the fine feelings of the parent which i had just called up   placid but those are accidents which may occur in the marriage state   solus in that case a man is pitied  in mine he is only laughed at   placid i wish to heaven i could exchange the pity which my friends bestow on me for the merriment which your ill fate excites   solus you want but courage to be envied   placid does any one doubt my courage   solus no if a prince were to offend you you would challenge him i have no doubt   placid but if my wife offend me i am obliged to make an apology  was not that her voice i hope she has not overheard our conversation   solus if she have she will be in an ill humor   placid that she will be whether she have heard it or not   solus well goodday i dont like to be driven from my fixed plan of wedlock and therefore i will not be a spectator of your mutual discontent   going placid but before you go mr solus permit me to remind you of a certain concern that i think would afford you much more delight than all you can at this time of life propose to yourself in marriage make happy by your beneficence a near relation whom the truest affection has drawn into that state but who is denied the blessing of competency to make the state supportable   solus you mean my nephew irwin but do not you acknowledge he has a wife and children did not he marry the woman he loved and has he not at this moment a large family by whom he is beloved and is he not therefore with all his poverty much happier than i he has often told me when i have reproached him with his indiscreet marriage that in his wife he possessed kingdoms do you suppose i will give any part of my fortune to a man who enjoys such extensive domains no  let him preserve his territories and i will keep my little estate for my own use exit   placid john john  enter servant has your mistress been enquiring for me   john yes sir  my lady asked just now if i knew who was with you   placid did she seem angry   john no sir  pretty well   placid you scoundrel what do you mean by pretty well in anger   john much as usual sir   placid and do you call that pretty well you scoundrel i have a great mind    enter mrs placid speaking very loud mrs placid what is the matter mr placid what is all this noise about you know i hate a noise what is the matter   placid my dear i was only finding fault with that blockhead   mrs placid pray mr placid do not find fault with any body in this house but i have something which i must take you very severely to talk about sir   placid no my dear not just now pray   mrs placid why not now   placid looking at his watch because dinner will be ready in a few minutes i am very hungry and it will be cruel of you to spoil my appetite john is the dinner on table   mrs placid no john dont let it be served yet  mr placid you shall first hear what i have to say   sitting down exit servant placid but then i know i shant be able to eat a morsel   mrs placid sit down he sits  i believe mr placid you are going to do a very silly thing i am afraid you are going to lend some money   placid well my dear and suppose i am   mrs placid then i dont approve of people lending their money   placid but my dear i have known you approve of borrowing money and once in our lives what should we have done if every body had refused to lend   mrs placid that is nothing to the purpose  and now i desire you will hear what i say without speaking a word yourself   placid well my dear   mrs placid now mind you dont speak till i have done  our old acquaintance captain irwin and lady eleanor his wife with whom we lived upon very intimate terms to be sure while we were in america are returned to london and i find you have visited them very frequently   placid not above two or three times upon my word for it hurts me to see them in distress and i forbear to go   mrs placid there you own they are in distress i expected as much now own to me that they have asked you to lend them money   placid i do own it  i do own it now are you satisfied   mrs placid no for i have no doubt but you have promised they shall have it   placid no upon my word i have not promised   mrs placid then promise me they shall not   placid nay my dear you have no idea of their distress   mrs placid yes i have and it is that which makes me suspicious   placid his regiment is now broken all her jewels and little bawbles are disposed of he is in such dread of his old creditors that in the lodging they have taken he passes by the name of middleton  they have three more children my dear than when we left them in new england and they have in vain sent repeated supplications both to his uncle and her father for the smallest bounty   mrs placid and is not lord norland her father a remarkably wise man and a good man and ought you to do for them what he has refused   placid they have offended him but they have never offended me   mrs placid i think it is an offense to ask a friend for money when there is no certainty of returning it   placid by no means for if there were a certainty even an enemy might lend   mrs placid but i insist mr placid that they shall not find a friend in you upon this occasion  what do you say sir   placid after a struggle no my dear they shall not   mrs placid positively shall not   placid positively shall not  since they have found an enemy in you   enter servant servant dinner is on table   placid ah i am not hungry now   mrs placid what do you mean by that mr placid i insist on your being hungry   placid oh yes i have a very excellent appetite i shall eat prodigiously   mrs placid you had best exeunt   scene ii an apartment at mr harmonys enter mr harmony followed by miss spinster miss spinster cousin cousin harmony i will not forgive you for thus continually speaking in the behalf of every servant whom you find me offended with your philanthropy becomes insupportable and instead of being a virtue degenerates into a vice   harmony dear madam do not upbraid me for a constitutional fault   miss spinster very true you had it from your infancy i have heard your mother say you were always foolishly tenderhearted and never showed one of those discriminating passions of envy hatred or revenge to which all her other children were liable   harmony no since i can remember i have felt the most unbounded affection for all my fellow creatures i even protest to you dear madam that as i walk along the streets of this large metropolis so warm is my heart toward every person who passes me that i long to say how do you do and i am glad to see you to them all some men i should like even to stop and shake hands with  and some women i should like even to stop and kiss   miss spinster how can you be so ridiculous   harmony nay it is truth and i sincerely lament that human beings should be such strangers to one another as we are we live in the same street without knowing one anothers necessities and oftentimes meet and part from each other at church at coffeehouses play houses and all public places without ever speaking a single word or nodding good bye though it is a hundred chances to ten we never see one another again   miss spinster let me tell you kinsman all this pretended philanthropy renders you ridiculous there is not a fraud a theft or hardly any vice committed that you do not take the criminals part shake your head and cry provisions are so scarce and no longer ago than last lordmayorsday when you were told that mr alderman ravenous was ill with an indigestion you endeavored to soften the matter by exclaiming provisions are so scarce  but above all i condemn that false humanity which induces you to say many things in conversation which deserve to stigmatize you with the character of deceit   harmony this is a weakness i confess but though my honor sometimes reproaches me with it as a fault my conscience never does for it is by this very failing that i have frequently made the bitterest enemies friends  just by saying a few harmless sentences which though a species of falsehood and deceit yet being soothing and acceptable to the person offended i have immediately inspired him with lenity and forgiveness and then by only repeating the selfsame sentences to his opponent i have known hearts cold and closed to each other warmed and expanded as every human creatures ought to be   enter servant servant mr solus exit servant   miss spinster i cannot think mr harmony why you keep company with that old bachelor he is a man of all others on earth i dislike and so i am obliged to quit the room though i have a thousand things to say exit angrily   enter solus harmony mr solus how do you do   solus i am very lonely at home will you come and dine with me   harmony now you are here you had better stay with me we have no company only my cousin miss spinster and myself   solus no i must go home do come to my house   harmony nay pray stay what objection can you have   solus why to tell you the truth your relation miss spinster is no great favorite of mine and i dont like to dine with you because i dont like her company   harmony that is to me surprising   solus why old bachelors and old maids never agree we are too much alike in our habits we know our own hearts so well we are apt to discover every foible we would wish to forget in the symptoms displayed by the other miss spinster is peevish fretful and tiresome and i am always in a fidget when i am in her company   harmony how different are her sentiments of you for one of her greatest joys is to be in your company solus starts and smiles poor woman she has to be sure an uneven temper    solus no perhaps i am mistaken   harmony  but i will assure you i never see her in half such good humor as when you are here for i believe you are the greatest favorite she has   solus i am very much obliged to her and i certainly am mistaken about her temper  some people if they look ever so cross are goodnatured in the main and i dare say she is so besides she never has had a husband to sooth and soften her disposition and there should be some allowance made for that   harmony will you dine with us   solus i dont care if i do yes i think i will i must however step home first  but i will be back in a quarter of an hour  my compliments to miss spinster if you should see her before i return   exit enter servant servant my lady begs to know sir if you have invited mr solus to dine because if you have she shall go out exit servant   enter miss spinster harmony yes madam i could not help inviting him for poor man his own house is in such a state for want of proper management he cannot give a comfortable dinner himself   miss spinster and so he must spoil the comfort of mine   harmony poor man poor man after all the praises he has been lavishing upon you   miss spinster what praises   harmony i will not tell you for you will not believe them   miss spinster yes i shall  oh no  now i recollect this is some of your invention   harmony nay i told him it was his invention for he declared you looked better last night than any other lady at the opera   miss spinster no this sounds like truth  and depend upon it though i never liked the manners of mr solus much yet    harmony nay solus has his faults   miss spinster so we have all   harmony and will you leave him and me to dine by ourselves   miss spinster oh no i cannot be guilty of such ill manners though i talked of it besides poor mr solus does not come so often and it would be wrong not to show him all the civility we can for my part i have no dislike to the man and if taking a bit of dinner with us now and then can oblige either you or him i should be to blame to make any objection come let us go into the drawing room to receive him   harmony ay this is right this is as it should be   exeunt scene iii a room at the lodgings of mr irwin mr irwin and lady eleanor irwin discovered lady eleanor my dear husband my dear irwin i cannot bear to see you thus melancholy is this the joy of returning to our native country after a nine years banishment   irwin yes for i could bear my misfortunes my wretched poverty with patience in a land where our sorrows were shared by those about us but here in london where plenty and ease smile upon every face where by birth you claim distinction and i by services  here to be in want  to be obliged to take another name in shame of our own  to tremble at the voice of every stranger for fear he should be a creditor  to meet each old acquaintance with an averted eye because we would not feel the pang of being shunned  to have no reward for all this even in a comfortable home but there to see our children looking up to me for that support i have not in my power to give  can i  can i love them and you and not be miserable   lady eleanor and yet i am not so and i am sure you will not doubt my love to you or them   irwin i met my uncle this morning and was mean enough to repeat my request to him  he burst into a fit of laughter and told me my distresses were the result of my ambition in marrying the daughter of a nobleman who himself was too ambitious ever to pardon us   lady eleanor tell me no more of what he said   irwin this was a day of trials  i saw your father too   lady eleanor my father lord norland oh heavens   irwin he passed me in his carriage   lady eleanor i envy you the blessing of seeing him for oh  excuse my tears  he is my father still  how did he look   irwin as well as he did at the time i used to watch him from his house to steal to you  but i am sorry to acquaint you that to guard himself against all returning love for you he has i am informed adopted a young lad on whom he bestows every mark of that paternal affection of which you lament the loss   lady eleanor may the young man deserve his tenderness better than i have done  may he never disobey him  may he be a comfort and cherish his benefactors declining years  and when his youthful passions teach him to love may they not like mine teach him disobedience   enter a servant with a letter irwin what is that letter   servant it comes from mr placid the servant who brought it said and requires no answer exit   irwin it is strange how i tremble at every letter i see as if i dreaded the contents how poverty has unmannd me aside  i must tell you my dear that finding myself left this morning without a guinea i wrote to mr placid to borrow a small sum this is his answer reading the superscription to mr middleton  that is right  he remembers the caution i gave him i had forgot whether i had for my memory is not so good as it was i did not even recollect this hand though it is one i am so well acquainted with and ought to give me joy rather than sorrow opens the letter hastily reads and lets it drop now i have not a friend on earth   lady eleanor yes you have me you forget me   irwin in a transport of grief i would forget you  you  and all your children   lady eleanor i would not lose the remembrance of you or of them for all my fathers fortune   irwin what am i to do i must leave you i must go i know not where i cannot stay to see you perish takes his hat and is going   lady eleanor holding him where would you go it is evening  it is dark  whither would you go at this time   irwin distractedly i must consider what is to be done  and in this room my thoughts are too confined to reflect   lady eleanor and are london streets calculated for reflection   irwin no  for action to hurry the faint thought to resolution   lady eleanor you are not well  your health has been lately impaired  your temper has undergone a change too  i tremble lest any accident    irwin what accident wildly   lady eleanor i know your provocations from an ungrateful world but despise it as that despises you   irwin but for your sake i could   lady eleanor then witness heaven i am happy  though bred in all the delicacy the luxury of wealth and splendor yet i have never murmured at the change of fortune while that change has made me wife to you and mother of your children   irwin we will be happy  if possible but give me this evening to consider what plan to fix upon  there is no time to lose we are without friends  without money  without credit  farewell for an hour  i will see mr placid if i can and though he have not the money to lend he may perhaps give me some advice   lady eleanor suppose i call on her women are sometimes more considerate than men and    irwin do you for the best and so will i  heavens bless you exeunt separately   act ii scene i a coffee or clubroom at a tavern enter sir robert ramble  and mr solus and mr placid at the opposite side solus sir robert ramble how do you do   sir robert my dear mr solus i am glad to see you i have been dining by myself and now come into this public room to meet with some good company   solus ay sir robert you are now reduced to the same necessity which i frequently am  i frequently am obliged to dine at taverns and coffeehouses for want of company at home   sir robert nay i protest i am never happier than in a house like this where a man may meet his friend without the inconvenience of form either as a host or a visitor   solus sir robert give me leave to introduce to you mr placid he has been many years abroad but i believe he now means to remain in his own country for the rest of his life this mr placid is sir robert ramble   sir robert to mr placid sir i shall be happy in your acquaintance and i assure you if you will do me the honor to meet me now and then at this house you will find every thing very pleasant i verily believe that since i lost my wife which is now about five months ago i verily believe i have dined here three days out of the seven   placid have you lost your wife sir and so lately   sir robert with great indifference yes sir about five months ago  is it not mr solus you keep account of such things better than i do   solus oh ask me no questions about your wife sir robert if she had been mine i would have had her to this moment   placid what wrested her from the gripe of death   sir robert no sir only from the gripe of the scotch lawyers   solus more shame for you shame to wish to be divorced from a virtuous wife   placid was that the case divorced from a virtuous wife i never heard of such a circumstance before pray sir robert very anxiously will you indulge me by letting me know in what manner you were able to bring about so great an event   sir robert it may appear strange to you sir but my wife and i did not live happy together   placid not at all strange sir i can conceive  i can conceive very well   solus yes he can conceive that part to a nicety   sir robert and so i was determined on a divorce   placid but then her character could not be unimpeached   sir robert yes it was sir you must know we were married in scotland and by the laws there a wife can divorce her husband for breach of fidelity and so though my wifes character was unimpeached mine was not and she divorced me   placid and is this the law in scotland   sir robert it is blessed blessed country that will bind young people together before the years of discretion  and as soon as they have discretion to repent will unbind them again   placid i wish i had been married in scotland   solus but sir robert with all this boasting you must own that your divorce has greatly diminished your fortune   sir robert taking solus aside mr solus you have frequently hinted at my fortune being impaired but i do not approve of such notions being received abroad   solus i beg your pardon but every body knows that you have played very deep lately and have been a great loser and every body knows    sir robert no sir every body does not know it for i contradict the report wherever i go a man of fashion does not like to be reckoned poor no more than he likes to be reckoned unhappy we none of us endeavor to be happy sir but merely to be thought so and for my part i had rather be in a state of misery and envied for my supposed happiness than in a state of happiness and pitied for my supposed misery   solus but consider these misfortunes which i have just hinted at are not of any serious nature only such as a few years economy    sir robert but were my wife and her guardian to become acquainted with these little misfortunes they would triumph in my embarrassments   solus lady ramble triumph they join mr placid she who was so firmly attached to you that i believe nothing but a compliance with your repeated request to be separated caused her to take the step she did   sir robert yes i believe she did it to oblige me and i am very much obliged to her   solus as good a woman mr placid    sir robert very good  but very ugly   solus she is beautiful   sir robert to solus i tell you sir she is hideous and then she was grown so insufferably peevish   solus i never saw her out of temper   sir robert mr solus it is very uncivil of you to praise her before my face lady ramble at the time i parted with her had every possible fault both of mind and person and so i made love to other women in her presence told her bluntly that i was tired of her that i was very sorry to make her uneasy but that i could not love her any longer  and was not that frank and open   solus oh that i had but such a wife as she was   sir robert i must own i loved her myself when she was young   solus do you call her old   sir robert in years i am certainly older than she but the difference of sex makes her a great deal older than i am for instance mr solus you have often lamented not being married in your youth but if you had what would you have now done with an old wife a woman of your own age   solus loved and cherished her   sir robert what in spite of her loss of beauty   solus when she had lost her beauty most likely i should have lost my eyesight and have been blind to the wane of her charms   placid anxiously but sir robert you were explaining to me  mr solus give me leave to speak to sir robert  i feel myself particularly interested on this subject  and sir you were explaining to me    sir robert very true where did i leave off oh at my ill usage of my lady ramble yes i did use her very ill and yet she loved me many a time when she has said to me sir robert i detest your principles your manners and even your person often at that very instant i have seen a little sparkle of a wish peep out of the corner of one eye that has called to me oh sir robert how i long to make it up with you   solus to mr placid do not you wish that your wife had such a little sparkle at the corner of one of her eyes   sir robert to mr placid sir do you wish to be divorced   placid i have no such prospect mrs placid is faithful and i was married in england   sir robert but if you have an unconquerable desire to part a separate maintenance will answer nearly the same end  for if your lady and you will only lay down the plan of separation and agree    placid but unfortunately we never do agree   sir robert then speak of parting as a thing you dread worse than death and make it your daily prayer to her that she will never think of going from you  she will determine upon it directly   placid i thank you i am very much obliged to you i thank you a thousand times   sir robert yes i have studied the art of teasing a wife and there is nothing vexes her so much as laughing at her can you laugh mr placid   placid i dont know whether i can i have not laughed since i married  but i thank you sir for your instructions  i sincerely thank you   solus and now sir robert you have had the good nature to teach this gentleman how to get rid of his wife will you have the kindness to teach me how to procure one   enter mr irwin sir robert hah sure i know that gentlemans face   solus my nephew let me escape his solicitations aside  here waiter exit   placid irwin starting having sent him a denial i am ashamed to see him aside here mr solus  exit following mr solus   irwin aside more cool faces my necessitous countenance clears even a clubroom   sir robert my dear captain irwin is it you yes faith it is  after a nine years absence i most sincerely rejoice to see you   irwin sir robert you shake hands with a cordiality i have not experienced these many days and i thank you   sir robert but what is the matter you seem to droop  where have you left your usual spirits has absence from your country changed your manners   irwin no sir but i find some of my countrymen changed i fancy them less warm less friendly than they were and it is that which perhaps has this effect upon me   sir robert am i changed   irwin you appear an exception   sir robert and i assure you that instead of being grown more gloomy i am even more gay than i was seven years ago for then i was upon the point of matrimony  but now i am just relieved from its cares   irwin i have heard as much but i hope you have not taken so great an aversion to the marriagestate as never to marry again   sir robert perhaps not but then it must be to some rich heiress   irwin you are right to pay respect to fortune money is a necessary article in the marriage contract   sir robert as to that  that would be no great object at present no thank heaven my estates are pretty large i have no children i have a rich uncle excellent health admirable spirits  and thus happy it would be very strange if i did not meet my old friends with those smiles which never for a moment quit my countenance   irwin in the dispensation of the gifts of providence how few are found blessed like you sighing   sir robert and i allure you my dear mr irwin it gives me the most serious reflections and the most sincere concern that they are not   irwin i thank you sir most heartily i thank you for mankind in general and for myself in particular for after this generous unaffected declaration with less scruple than i should to any man in the world i will own to you that i am at this very time in the utmost want of an act of friendship   sir robert aside and so am i  now must i confess myself a poor man or pass for an unfeeling one and i will choose the latter bowing with great ceremony and coldness any thing that i can command is at your service   irwin confounded and hesitating why then sir robert  i am almost ashamed to say it  but circumstances have been rather unfavourable  my wifes father affecting to smile is not reconciled to us yet  my regiment is broke  my uncle will not part with a farthing  lady eleanor my wife wipes his eyes has been supported as yet with some little degree of tenderness elegance and  in short i owe a small sum which i am afraid of being troubled for i want a trifle also for our immediate use and if you would lend me a hundred pounds  though upon my honor i am not in a situation to fix the exact time when i can pay it   sir robert my dear sir never trouble yourself about the time of paying it because it happens not to be in my power to lend it you   irwin not in your power i beg your pardon but have not you this moment been saying you are rich   sir robert and is it not very common to be rich without money are not half the town rich and yet half the town has no money i speak for this end of the town the west end the squares for instance part of piccadilly down st jamessstreet and so home by pall mall we have all estates bonds drafts and notes of hand without number but as for money we have no such thing belonging to us   irwin i sincerely beg your pardon and be assured sir nothing should have induced me to have taken the liberty i have done but the necessities of my unhappy family and having understood by your own words that you were in affluence   sir robert i am in affluence i am i am but not in so much perhaps as my hasty inconsiderate account may have given you reason to believe i forgot to mention several heavy encumbrances which you will perceive are great drawbacks on my fortune  as my wife sued for the divorce i have her fortune to return i have also two sisters to portion off  a circumstance i totally forgot but my good friend though i am not in circumstances to do what you require i will do something that shall be better i will wait upon your fatherinlaw lord norland and entreat him to forgive his daughter and i am sure he will if i ask him   irwin impossible   sir robert and so it is now i recollect for he is no other than the guardian of my late wife and a request from me will be received worse than from any other person  however mr irwin depend upon it that whenever i have an opportunity of serving you i will and whenever you shall do me the favor to call upon me i shall be heartily glad to see you if i am not at home you can leave your card which you know is all the same and depend upon it i shall be extremely glad to see you or that at any time exit   irwin is this my native country is this the hospitable land which we describe to strangers no  we are savages to each other nay worse  the savage makes his fellowsavage welcome divides with him his homely fare gives him the best apartment his hut affords and tries to hush those griefs that are confided in his bosom  while in this civilized city among my own countrymen even among my brother officers in the army and many of my nearest relations so very civilized they are i could not take the liberty to enter under one roof without a ceremonious invitation and that they will not give me i may leave my card at their door but as for me or any one of mine they would not give us a dinner unless indeed it was in such a style that we might behold with admiration their grandeur and return still more depressed to our own poverty  can i bear this treatment longer no not even for you my eleanor and this takes out a pistol shall now be the only friend to whom i will apply  and yet i want the courage to be a villain   enter mr harmony speaking as he enters irwin conceals the pistol instantly harmony let me see half a dozen newspapers  every paper of the day   enter waiter waiter that is about three dozen sir   harmony get a couple of porters and bring them all   he sits down they bring him papers and he reads  irwin starts sits down leans his head on one of the tables and shows various signs of uneasiness then comes forward irwin am i a man a soldier  and a coward yes i run away i turn my back on life  i forsake the post which my commander providence has allotted me and fly before a banditti of rude misfortunes rally me love connubial and parental love rally me back to the charge no those very affections sound the retreat sits down with the same emotions of distraction as before   harmony that gentleman does not seem happy i wish i had an opportunity of speaking to him aside   irwin comes forward and speaks again but oh my wife what will be your sufferings when i am brought home to your wretched habitation  and by my own hand   harmony i am afraid sir i engross all the news here   holding up the papers irwin still apart poor soul how her heart will be torn   harmony after looking steadfastly on him captain irwin till this moment i had not the pleasure of recollecting you it is mr irwin is it not   irwin his mind deranged by his misfortunes yes sir but what have you to say to him more than to a stranger   harmony nothing more sir than to apologize to you for having addressed you just now in so familiar a manner before i knew who you were and to assure you that although i have no other knowledge of you than from report and having been once i believe in your company at this very house before you left england yet any services of mine as far as my abilities can reach you may freely command   irwin pray sir do you live at the west end of the town   harmony i do   irwin then sir your services can be of no use to me   harmony here is the place where i live here is my card   gives it to him irwin and here is mine and now i presume we have exchanged every act of friendship which the strict forms of etiquette in this town will admit of   harmony by no means sir i assure you my professions never go beyond my intentions and if there is any thing that i can serve you in    irwin have you no sisters to portion off no ladys fortune to return or perhaps you will speak to my wifes father and entreat him to forgive his child   harmony on that subject you may command me for i have the honor to be intimately acquainted with lord norland   irwin but is there no reason you may recollect why you would be the most unfit person in the world to apply to him   harmony none i have been honored with marks of his friendship for many years past and i do not know any one who could with less hazard of his resentment venture to name his daughter to him   irwin well sir if you should see him two or three days hence when i am set out on a journey i am going if you will then say a kind word to him for my wife and children i will thank you   harmony i will go to him instantly going   irwin no do not see him yet stay till i am gone he will do nothing till i am gone   harmony may i ask where you are going   irwin no very tedious journey but it is a country to those who go without a proper passport always fatal   harmony i will see lord norland tonight perhaps i may persuade him to prevent your journey i will see him tonight or early in the morning depend upon it  i am a man of my word sir though i must own i do live at the west end of the town   exit irwin sdeath am i become the ridicule of my fellow creatures or am i not in my senses  i know this is london  this house a tavern  i know i have a wife oh twere better to be mad than to remember her she has a father  he is rich and proud  that i will not forget but i will pass his house and send a malediction as i pass it  furiously no breathe out my last sigh at his inhospitable door and that sigh shall breathe  forgiveness exit   scene ii the lodgings of mr irwin enter mrs placid followed by lady eleanor irwin lady eleanor i am ashamed of the trouble i have given you mrs placid it had been sufficient to have sent me home in your carriage to attend me yourself was ceremonious   mrs placid my dear lady eleanor i was resolved to come home with you as soon as mr placid desired i would not   lady eleanor was that the cause of your politeness i am sorry it should   mrs placid why sorry it is not proper he should have his way in every thing   lady eleanor but i am afraid you seldom let him have it at all   mrs placid yes i do  but where my dear is mr irwin   lady eleanor weeping i cannot hear the name of mr irwin without shedding tears his health has been so much impaired of late and his spirits so bad  sometimes i even fear for a failure in his mind weeps again   mrs placid is not he at home   lady eleanor i hope he is goes to the side of the scenes tell your master mrs placid is here   enter servant servant my master is not come in yet madam   lady eleanor not yet i am very sorry for it  very sorry indeed   mrs placid bless me my dear dont look thus pale come sit down and i will stay with you till he returns   sits down herself lady eleanor my dear you forget that mr placid is in the carriage at the door all this time   mrs placid no i dont come let us sit and have half an hours conversation   lady eleanor nay i insist upon your going to him or desiring him to walk in   mrs placid now i think of it they may as well drive him home and come back for me enter mr placid why surely mr placid you were very impatient i think you might have waited a few minutes longer   placid i would have waited my dear but the evening is so damp   lady eleanor ah it is the evening which makes me alarmed for mr irwin   placid lady eleanor you are one of the most tender anxious and affectionate wives i ever knew   mrs placid there now he wishes he was your husband  he admires the conduct of every wife but his own and envies every married man of his acquaintance but it is very ungenerous of you   placid so it is my dear and not at all consistent with the law of retaliation for i am sure there is not one of my acquaintance who envies me   mrs placid mr placid your behavior throughout this whole day has been so totally different to what it ever was before that i am half resolved to live no longer with you   placid aside it will do  it will do   lady eleanor oh my dear friends do not talk of parting how can you while every blessing smiles on your union even i who have reason to regret mine yet while that load of grief a separation from mr irwin is but averted i will think every other affliction supportable a loud rapping at the door that is he   mrs placid why you seem in raptures at his return   lady eleanor i know no greater rapture   enter irwin pale trembling and disordered lady eleanor my dear you are not well i see   irwin yes  aside to her in anger  why do you speak of it   placid how do you do irwin   irwin i am glad to see you bows   mrs placid but i am sorry to see you look so ill   irwin i have only been taking a glass too much   lady eleanor weeps placid pshaw dont i know you never drink   irwin you are mistaken i do when my wife is not by i am afraid of her   placid impossible   irwin what to be afraid of ones wife   placid no i think that very possible   mrs placid but it does not look well when it is so it makes a man appear contemptible and a woman a termagant come mr placid i cannot stay another moment good night heaven bless you to lady eleanor  good night my dear mr irwin and now pray take my advice and keep up your spirits   irwin i will madam shaking hands with placid and do you keep up your spirits exeunt mr and mrs placid irwin shuts the door with care after them and looks round the room as if he feared to be seen or overheard i am glad they are gone i spoke unkindly to you just now did i not my temper is altered lately and yet i love you   lady eleanor i never doubted it nor ever will   irwin if you did you would wrong me for there is not a danger i would not risk for your sake there is not an infamy i would not be branded with to make you happy nor a punishment i would not undergo with joy for your welfare  but there is a bar to this we are unfortunately so entwined together so linked so rivetted so cruelly painfully fettered to each other you could not be happy unless i shared the self same happiness with you  but you will learn better  now you are in london and amongst fashionable wives you must learn better walks about and smiles with a ghastly countenance   lady eleanor do not talk do not look thus wildly  indeed indeed you make me very uneasy   irwin what uneasy when i come to bring you comfort and such comfort as you have not experienced for many a day he pulls out a pocketbook here is a friend in our necessity  a friend that brings a thousand friends plenty and  no not always  peace he takes several papers from the book and puts them into her hands  she looks at them then screams   lady eleanor ah it is money trembling these are bank notes   irwin hush for heavens sake hush we shall be discovered trembling and in great perturbation what alarms you thus   lady eleanor what alarms you   irwin do you say i am frightened   lady eleanor a sight so new has frightened me   irwin nay they are your own by heaven they are no one on earth has a better or a fairer right than you have it was a laudable act by which i obtained them  the parentbird had forsook its young and i but forced it back to perform the rites of nature   lady eleanor you are insane i fear no no i do not fear  hope you are   a loud rapping at the streetdoor  he starts takes the notes from her and puts them hastily into his pocket irwin go to the door yourself and if it is any one who asks for me say i am not come home yet   she goes out then returns lady eleanor it is the person belonging to the house no one to us   irwin my dear eleanor are you willing to quit london with me in about two hours time   lady eleanor instantly   irwin nay not only london but england   lady eleanor this world if you desire it to go in company with you will make the journey pleasant and all i loved on earth would still be with me   irwin you can then leave your father without regret never never to see him more   lady eleanor why should i think on him who will not think of me weeps   irwin but our children    lady eleanor we are not to leave them behind   irwin one of them we must but do not let that give you uneasiness you know he has never lived with us since his infancy and cannot pine for the loss of parents whom he has never known   lady eleanor but i have known him he was my first and sometimes i think more closely wound around my heart than all the rest the grief i felt on being forced to leave him when we went abroad and the constant anxiety i have since experienced lest he should not be kindly treated have augmented i think my tenderness   irwin all my endeavors today as well as every other day have been in vain to find into what part of the country his nurse has taken him  nay be not thus overcome with tears we will in spite of all my haste to be gone stay one more miserable day here in hopes to procure intelligence so as to take him with us and then smile with contempt on all we leave behind exeunt   end of the second act act iii scene i a library at lord norlands enter lord norland followed by mr harmony lord norland in anger i tell you mr harmony that if an indifferent person one on whom i had never bestowed a favor in my life were to offend me it is in my nature never to forgive can i then forgive my own daughter my only child on whom i heaped continually marks of the most affectionate fondness shall she dare to offend me in the tenderest point and you dare to suppose i will pardon her   harmony your child consider   lord norland the weakest argument you can use as my child was not she most bound to obey me as my child ought she not to have sacrificed her own happiness to mine instead of which mine has been yielded up for a whim a fancy a fancy to marry a beggar and as such is her choice let her beg with him   harmony she does by me  pleads hard for your forgiveness   lord norland if i thought she dared to send a message to me though dictated on her knees she should find that she had not yet felt the full force of my resentment   harmony what could you do more   lord norland i have done nothing yet at present i have only abandoned her  but i can persecute   harmony i have no doubt of it and that i may not be the means of aggravating your displeasure i assure you that what i have now said has been entirely from myself without any desire of hers and at the same time i give you my promise i will never presume to intrude the subject again   lord norland on this condition but on no other i forgive you now   harmony and now then my lord let us pass from those who have forfeited your love to those who possess it  i heard some time ago but i never presumed to mention it to you that you had adopted a young man as your son   lord norland a young man pshaw  no a boy  a mere child who fell in my way by accident   harmony a chance child ho ho  i understand you   lord norland do not jest with me sir do i look    harmony yes you look as if you would be ashamed to own it if you had one   lord norland but this boy i am not ashamed of  he is a favorite  rather a favorite  i did not like him so well at first  but custom  and having a poor creature entirely at ones mercy one begins to love it merely from the idea of  what would be its fate if one did not   harmony is he an orphan then   lord norland no   harmony you have a friendship for his parents   lord norland i never saw the father his mother i had a friendship for once sighing   harmony ay while the husband was away   lord norland i tell you no violently  but ask no more questions who his parents are is a secret which neither he nor any one that is now living knows except myself nor ever shall   harmony well my lord since it is your pleasure to consider him as your child i sincerely with you may experience more duty from him than you have done from your daughter   lord norland thank heaven his disposition is not in the least like here is  no very much impassioned i have the joy to say that never child was so unlike its mother   harmony starting how his mother   lord norland confusion  what have i said  i am ashamed    harmony no  be proud   lord norland of what   harmony that you have a lawful heir to all your riches proud that you have a grandson   lord norland i would have concealed it from all the world i wished it even unknown to myself and let me tell you sir as not by my design but through my inadvertency you are become acquainted with this secret that if ever you breathe it to a single creature the boy shall answer for it for were he known to be here is though he were dearer to me than ever she was i would turn him from my house and cast him from my heart as i have done her   harmony i believe you  and in compassion to the child give you my solemn promise never to reveal who he is i have heard that those unfortunate parents left an infant behind when they went abroad and that they now lament him as lost will you satisfy my curiosity in what manner you sought and found him out   lord norland do you suppose i searched for him no  he was forced upon me a woman followed me about eight years ago in the fields adjoining to my country seat with a halfstarved boy in her hand and asked my charity for my grandchild the impression of the word made me turn round involuntarily and casting my eyes upon him i was rejoiced not to find a feature of his mothers in all his face and i began to feel something like pity for him in short he caught such fast hold by one of my fingers that i asked him carelessly if he would go home and live with me on which he answered me so willingly yes i took him at his word   harmony and did never your regard for him plead in his mothers behalf   lord norland never for by heaven i would as soon forgive the robber who met me last night at my own door and holding a pistol to my breast took from me a sum to a considerable amount as i would pardon her   harmony did such an accident happen to you   lord norland have you not heard of it   harmony no   lord norland it is amazing we cannot put a stop to such depredations   harmony provisions are so scarce   enter servant servant miss wooburn my lord if you are not engaged will come and sit an hour with you   lord norland i have no company but what she is perfectly acquainted with and shall be glad of her visit   exit servant harmony you forget i am a stranger and my presence may not be welcome   lord norland a stranger what to my ward to lady ramble for that is the name which custom would authorize her to keep but such courtesy she disdains in contempt of the unworthy giver of the title   harmony i am intimate with sir robert my lord and though i acknowledge that both you and his lady have cause for complaint yet sir robert has still many virtues   lord norland not one he is the most vile the most detestable of characters he not only contradicted my will in the whole of his conduct but he seldom met me that he did not give me some personal affront   harmony it is however generally held better to be uncivil in a persons presence than in his absence   lord norland he was uncivil to me in every respect   harmony that i will deny for i have heard sir robert in your absence say such things in your praise    lord norland indeed   harmony most assuredly   lord norland i wish he had sometimes done me the honor to have spoken politely to my face   harmony that is not sir roberts way  he is no flatterer but then no sooner has your back been turned than i have heard him lavish in your praise   lord norland i must own mr harmony that i never looked upon sir robert as incorrigible i could always discern a ray of understanding and a beam of virtue through all his foibles nor would i have urged the divorce but that i found his wifes sensibility could not bear his neglect and even now notwithstanding her endeavor to conceal it she pines in secret and laments her hard fortune all my hopes of restoring her health rest on one prospect  that of finding a man worthy my recommendation for her second husband and by creating a second passion expel the first  mr harmony you and i have been long acquainted  i have known your disposition from your infancy  now if such a man as you were to offer    harmony you flatter me   lord norland i do not  would you venture to become her husband   harmony i cannot say i have any particular desire but if it will oblige either you or her  for my part i think the short time we live in this world we should do all we can to oblige each other   lord norland i should rejoice at such an union myself and i think i can answer for her  you permit me then to make overtures to her in your name   harmony considering this is rather a serious piece of business  however i never did make a difficulty when i wished to oblige a friend  but there is one proviso my lord i must first mention it to sir robert   lord norland why so   harmony because he and i have always been very intimate friends and to marry his wife without even telling him of it will appear very uncivil   lord norland do you mean then to ask his consent   harmony not absolutely his consent but i will insinuate the subject to him and obtain his approbation in a manner suitable to my own satisfaction   lord norland you will oblige me then if you will see him as early as possible for it is reported he is going abroad   harmony i will go to him immediately  and my lord i will do all in my power to oblige you sir robert and the lady aside  but as to obliging myself that was never one of my considerations   exit enter miss wooburn lord norland i am sorry to see you thus you have been weeping will you still lament your separation from a cruel husband as if you had followed a kind one to the grave   miss wooburn by no means my lord tears from our sex are not always the result of grief they are frequently no more than little sympathetic tributes which we pay to our fellowbeings while the mind and the heart are steeled against the weakness which our eyes indicate   lord norland can you say your mind and heart are so steeled   miss wooburn i can my mind is as firmly fixed against sir robert ramble as at our first acquaintance it was fixed upon him and i solemnly protest    lord norland to a man of my age and observation protestations are vain  give me a proof that you have rooted him from your heart   miss wooburn any proof you require i will give without a moments hesitation   lord norland i take you at your word and desire you to accept a gentleman whom i shall recommend for your second husband miss wooburn starts  you said you would not hesitate a moment   miss wooburn i thought i should not  but this is something so unexpected    lord norland you break your word then and still give cause for this ungrateful man to ridicule your fondness for him   miss wooburn no i will put an end to that humiliation and whoever the gentleman is whom you mean to propose  yet do not name him at present  but give me the satisfaction of keeping the promise i have made to you at least for a little time without exactly knowing how far it extends for in return i have a promise to ask from you before i acquaint you with the nature of your engagement   lord norland i give my promise now name your request   miss wooburn then my lord hesitating and confused  the law gave me back upon my divorce from sir robert the very large fortune which i brought to him  i am afraid that in his present circumstances to enforce the strict payment of this debt would very much embarrass him   lord norland what if it did   miss wooburn it is my entreaty to you in whose hands is invested the power to demand this right of law to lay my claim aside for the present lord norland offers to speak i know my lord what you are going to say i know sir robert is not now but i can never forget that he has been my husband   lord norland to show my gratitude for your compliance with the request i have just made you goes to a table in the library here is the bond by which i am empowered to seize on the greatest part of his estates in right of you take the bond into your own possession till your next husband demands it of you and by the time you have called him husband for a few weeks this tenderness or delicacy to sir robert will be worn away   enter harmony hastily harmony my lord i beg pardon but i forgot to mention    miss wooburn oh mr harmony i have not seen you before i know not when i am particularly happy at your calling just now for i have  hesitating a little favor to ask of you   harmony if it were a great favor madam you might command me   miss wooburn but  my lord i beg your pardon  but the favor i have to ask of mr harmony must be told to him in private   lord norland oh i am sure i have not the least objection to you and mr harmony having a private conference i will leave you together harmony appears embarrassed you do not derange my business  i will be back in a short time exit   miss wooburn mr harmony you are the very man on earth i most wanted to see harmony bows i know the kindness of your heart the liberality of your sentiments and i wish to repose a charge to your trust very near to me indeed  but you must be secret   harmony when a lady reposes a trust in me i should not be a man if i were not   miss wooburn i must first inform you that lord norland has just drawn from me a promise that i will once more enter into the marriagestate and without knowing to whom he intends to give me i will keep my promise  but it is in vain to say that though i mean all duty and fidelity to my second husband i shall not experience moments when my thoughts  will wander on my first   harmony starting hem  hem  to her  indeed   miss wooburn i must always rejoice in sir roberts successes and lament over his misfortunes   harmony if that is all    miss wooburn no i would go one step further harmony starts again i would secure him from those misfortunes which to hear of will disturb my peace of mind i know his fortune has suffered very much and i cannot will not place it in the power of the man whom my lord norland may point out for my next marriage to distress him farther  this is the writing by which that gentleman may claim the part of my fortune from sir robert ramble which is in landed property carry it my dear mr harmony to sir robert instantly and tell him that in separating from him i meant only to give him liberty not make him the debtor perhaps the prisoner of my future husband   harmony madam i will most undoubtedly take this bond to my friend but will you give me leave to suggest to you that the person on whom you bestow your hand may be a little surprised to find that while he is in possession of you sir robert is in the possession of your fortune   miss wooburn do not imagine sir that i shall marry any man without first declaring what i have done  i only wish at present it should be concealed from lord norland  when this paper is given as i have required it cannot be recalled and when that is past i shall divulge my conduct to whom i please and first of all to him who shall offer me his addresses   harmony and if he is a man of my feelings his addresses will be doubly importunate for this proof of liberality to your former husband  but are you sure that in the return of this bond there is no secret affection no latent spark of love   miss wooburn none i know my heart and if there was i could not ask you mr harmony nor any one like you to be the messenger of an imprudent passion sir roberts vanity i know may cause him to judge otherwise but undeceive him let him know this is a sacrifice to the golden principles of duty and not an offering to the tinselled shrine of love enter lord norland put up the bond  harmony conceals it   lord norland well my dear have you made your request   miss wooburn yes my lord   lord norland and has he granted it   harmony yes my lord i am going to grant it   lord norland i sincerely wish you both joy of this good understanding between you but mr harmony in a whisper are not you going to sir robert   harmony yes my lord i am going this moment   lord norland make haste then and do not forget your errand   harmony no my lord i shant forget my errand it will not slip my memory  good morning my lord  good morning madam exit   lord norland now my dear as you and mr harmony seem to be on such excellent terms i think i may venture to tell you if he has not yet told you himself that he is the man who is to be your husband   miss wooburn he mr harmony  no my lord he has not told me and i am confident he never will   lord norland what makes you think so   miss wooburn because  because  he must be sensible he would not be the man i should choose   lord norland and where is the woman who marries the man she would choose you are reversing the order of society men only have the right of choice in marriage were women permitted theirs we should have handsome beggars allied to our noblest families and no such object in our whole island as an old maid   miss wooburn but being denied that choice why forbid to remain as i am   lord norland what are you now neither a widow a maid nor a wife if i could fix a term to your present state i should not be thus anxious to place you in another   miss wooburn i am perfectly acquainted with your friendly motives and feel the full force of your advice  i therefore renew my promise  and although mr harmony in respect to the marriage state is as little to my wishes as any man on earth i will nevertheless endeavor  whatever struggles it may cost me  to be to him if he prefers his suit a dutiful an obedient  but for a loving wife that i can never be again   exeunt severally scene an apartment at sir rorbert rambles enter sir robert and mr harmony sir robert i thank you for this visit i was undetermined what to do with myself your company has determined me to stay at home   harmony i was with a gentleman just now sir robert and you were the subject of our conversation   sir robert had it been a lady i should be anxious to know what she said   harmony i have been with a lady likewise and she made you the subject of her discourse   sir robert but was she handsome   harmony very handsome   sir robert my dear fellow what is her name what did she say and where may i meet with her   harmony her name is wooburn   sir robert that is the name of my late wife   harmony it is her i mean   sir robert zounds you had just put my spirits into a flame and now you throw cold water all over me   harmony i am sorry to hear you say so for i came from her this moment and what do you think is the present she has given me to deliver to you   sir robert pshaw i want no presents some of my old love letters returned i suppose to remind me of my inconstancy   harmony do not undervalue her generosity this is her present  this bond which has power to take from you three thousand a year her right   sir robert ah this is a present indeed are you sure you speak truth let me look at it  sure my eyes deceive me  no by heaven it is true reads the very thing i wanted and will make me perfectly happy now i will be generous again my bills shall be paid my gaming debts cancelled poor irwin shall find a friend and i will send her as pretty a copy of verses as ever i wrote in my life   harmony take care how you treat with levity a woman of her elevated mind she charged me to assure you that love had no share whatever in this act but merely compassion to the embarrassed state of your affairs   sir robert sir i would have you to know i am no object of compassion however a ladys favor one cannot return and so i will keep this thing   puts it in his pocket harmony nay if your circumstances are different from what she imagines give it me back and i will return it to her   sir robert no poor thing it would break her heart to send it back  no i will keep it  she would never forgive me were i to send it back i will keep it and she is welcome to attribute her concern for me to what she pleases but surely you can see  you can understand  but heaven bless her for her love and i would love her in return  if i could   harmony you would not talk thus if you had seen the firm dignity with which she gave me that paper  assure him said she no remaining affection comes along with it but merely a duty which i owe him to protect him from the humiliation of being a debtor to the man whom i am going to marry   sir robert with the utmost emotion why she is not going to be married again   harmony i believe so   sir robert but are you sure of it sir are you sure of it   harmony both she and her guardian told me so   sir robert that guardian my lord norland is one of the basest vilest of men  i tell you what sir i will resent this usage   harmony wherefore  as to his being the means of bringing about your separation in that he obliged you   sir robert yes sir he did he certainly did  but though i am not the least offended with him on that head for at that i rejoice yet i will resent his disposing of her a second time   harmony and why   sir robert because little regard as i have for her myself yet no other man shall dare to treat her so ill as i have done   harmony do not fear it  her next husband will be a man who i can safely say will never insult or even offend her but sooth indulge and make her happy   sir robert and do you dare to tell me that her next husband shall make her happy now that is worse than the other  no sir no man shall ever have it to say he has made her either happy or miserable but myself   harmony i know of but one way to prevent it   sir robert and what is that   harmony pay your addresses to her and marry her again yourself   sir robert and i would rather than she should be happy with any body else the devil take me if i would not   harmony to show that i am wholly disinterested in this affair i will carry her a letter from you if you like and say all i can in your behalf   sir robert ha ha ha now my dear harmony you carry your goodnatured simplicity too far however i thank you i sincerely thank you  but do you imagine i should be such a blockhead as to make love to the same woman i made love to seven years ago and who for the last six years i totally neglected   harmony yes for if you neglected her six years she will now be a novelty   sir robert egad and so she will you are right   harmony but being in possession of her fortune you can be very happy without her   sir robert take her fortune back sir taking the bond from his pocket and offering it to harmony i would starve i would perish die in poverty and infamy rather than owe an obligation to a vile perfidious inconstant woman   harmony consider sir robert if you insist on my taking this bond back it may fall into the husbands hands   sir robert take it back  i insist upon it gives it him and harmony puts it up but mr harmony depend on it lord norland shall hear from me in the most serious manner for his interference  i repeat he is the vilest the most villainous of men   harmony how can you speak with such rancour of a nobleman who speaks of you in the highest terms   sir robert does he faith   harmony he owns you have some faults   sir robert i know i have   harmony but he thinks your good qualities are numberless   sir robert now damme if ever i thought so ill of him as i have appeared to do  but who is the intended husband my dear friend tell me that i may laugh at him and make you laugh at him   harmony no i am not inclined to laugh at him   sir robert is it old solus   harmony no   sir robert but i will bet you a wager it is somebody equally ridiculous   harmony i never bet   sir robert solus is mad for a wife and has been praising mine up to the heavens you need say no more i know it is he   harmony upon my honor it is not however i cannot disclose to you at present the persons name i must first obtain lord norlands permission   sir robert i shall ask you no more i will write to her  she will tell me  or i will pay her a visit and ask her boldly myself  do you think anxiously  do you think she would see me   harmony you can but try   enter servant servant mr solus   sir robert now i will find out the secret immediately  i will charge him with being the intended husband   harmony i will not stay to hear you enter solus mr solus how do you do i am extremely sorry that my enagagements take me away as soon as you enter exit harmony running to avoid an explanation   solus sir robert what is the matter has any thing ruffled you why i never saw you look more out of temper even while you were married   sir robert ah that i had never married never known what marriage was for even at this moment i feel its torments in my heart   solus i have often heard of the torments of matrimony but i conceive that at the worst they are nothing more than a kind of violent tickling which will force the tears into your eyes though at the same time you are bursting your sides with laughter   sir robert you have defined marriage too favorably there is no laughter in the state all is melancholy all gloom   solus now i think marriage is an excellent remedy for the spleen i have known a gentleman at a feast receive an affront disguise his rage step home vent it all upon his wife return to his companions and be as good company as if nothing had happened   sir robert but even the necessary expenses of a wife should alarm you   solus i can then retrench some of my own oh my dear sir a married man has so many delightful privileges to what a bachelor has  an

ever draws upon me to tell another the suit of which i gave him hope has failed  yet if i can but overcome captain irwins delicacy so far as to prevail on him to accept one proof more of my good wishes toward him  but to a man of his nice sense of obligations the offer must be made with caution   enter lord norland lord norland mr harmony i beg your pardon i come in thus abruptly from the anxiety i feel concerning what passed between us this morning in respect to miss wooburn you have not changed your mind i hope   harmony indeed my lord i am very sorry that it will not be in my power to oblige you   lord norland in anger how sir did not you give me your word   harmony only conditionally my lord   lord norland and what were the conditions   harmony have you forgot them her former

  lord norland yes but let me get out of the house without meeting him going to the opposite door can i go this way   harmony why should you shun him   lord norland because he used his wife ill   harmony he did but i believe he is very sorry for it  and as for you he said to me only a few hours ago  but no matter   lord norland what did he say i insist upon knowing   harmony why then he said that if he had a sacred trust to repose in any one you should be the man on earth to whom he would confide it   lord norland well i am in no hurry i can stay a few minutes   enter sir robert ramble sir robert oh harmony i am in such a distracted state of mind  seeing lord norland he starts and bows with the most humble respect   lord norland sir robert how do you do   sir robert my lord i am pretty well  i hope i have the happiness of seeing your lordship in perfect health   lord norland very well sir i thank you   sir robert indeed my lord i think i never saw you look better   lord

lord all your family are well   lord norland all very well   sir robert your little eleve  master edward  the young gentleman you have adopted  i hope he is well  hesitating and confused and  your ward sir  miss wooburn  i hope my lord she is well   lord norland yes sir robert miss wooburn is tolerably well   sir robert only tolerably my lord i am sorry for that   harmony i hope my lord you will excuse my mentioning the subject but i was telling sir robert just now of your intentions respecting a second marriage for that lady but sir robert does not appear to approve of the design   lord norland what objection can he have   sir robert my lord there are such a number of bad husbands there are such a number of dissipated unthinking unprincipled men  and  i should be extremely sorry to see any lady with whom i have had the honor of being so closely allied united to one who would undervalue her worth   lord norland pray sir robert were you not then extremely sorry for her while she was united to you   sir robert very sorry for her indeed my lord but at that time my mind was so taken up with other cares i own i did not feel the compassion which was her due but now that i am single i shall have leisure to pay her more attention and should i find her unhappy it must inevitably make me so   lord norland depend upon it that on the present occasion i shall take infinite care in the choice of her husband   sir robert if your lordship would permit me to have an interview with miss wooburn i think i should be able at least    lord norland you would not sure insult her by your presence   sir robert i think i should be able at least to point out an object worthy of her taste  i know what she will like better than any body in the world   lord norland her request has been that i may point her out a husband the reverse of you   sir robert then upon my honor my lord she will not like him   lord norland have not you liked women the reverse of her   sir robert yes my lord perhaps i have and perhaps i still do i do not pretend to love her i did not say i did nay i positively protest i do not but this indifference i acknowledge as one of my faults and notwithstanding all my faults give me leave to acknowledge my gratitude that your lordship has nevertheless been pleased to declare you think my virtues are numberless lord norland shows surprise   harmony aside to sir robert hush hush  dont talk of your virtues now   lord norland sir robert to all this incoherent language this is my answer this is my will the lady to whom i have had the honor to be guardian shall never while she calls me friend see you more   sir robert at this sentence stands silent for some time then suddenly recollecting himself sir robert lord norland i am too well acquainted with the truth of your word and the firmness of your temper to press my suit one sentence farther   lord norland i commend your discernment   sir robert my lord i feel myself a little embarrassed  i am afraid i have made myself a little ridiculous upon this occasion  will your lordship do me the favor to forget it   lord norland i will forget whatever you please   harmony following him whispers i am sorry to see you going away in despair   sir robert i never did despair in my life sir and while a woman is the object of my wishes i never will   exit lord norland what did he say   harmony that he thought your conduct that of a just and an upright man   lord norland to say the truth he has gone away with better manners than i could have imagined considering his jealousy is provoked   harmony ah i always knew he loved his wife notwithstanding his behavior to her for if you remember he always spoke well of her behind her back   lord norland no i do not remember it   harmony yes he did and that is the only criterion of a mans love or of his friendship   enter servant servant a young gentleman is at the door sir enquiring for lord norland   lord norland who can it be   harmony your young gentleman from home i dare say desire him to walk in bring him here   exit servant lord norland what business can he have to follow me   enter edward edward oh my lord i beg your pardon for coming hither but i come to tell you something you will be glad to hear   harmony good heaven how like his mother   lord norland taking him by the hand i begin to think he is  but he was not so when i first took him no no if he had he would not have been thus near me now  but to turn him away because his countenance is a little changed i think would not be right   edward to harmony pray sir did you know my mother   harmony i have seen her   edward did you ever see her my lord   lord norland i thought you had orders never to enquire about your parents have you forgot those orders   edward no my lord but when this gentleman said i was like my mother  it put me in mind of her   harmony you do not remember your mother do you   edward sometimes i think i do i think sometimes i remember her kissing me when she and my father went on board of a ship and so hard she pressed me  i think i feel it now   harmony perhaps she was the only lady that ever saluted you   edward no sir not by many   lord norland but pray young man to have done with this subject what brought you here you seem to have forgot your errand   edward and so i had upon my word speaking of my mother put it quite out of my head  but my lord i came to let you know the robber who stopped you last night is taken   lord norland i am glad to hear it   edward i knew you would and therefore i begged to be the first to tell you   harmony to lord norland should you know the person again   lord norland i cannot say i should his face seemed so much distorted   harmony ay wretched man i suppose with terror   lord norland no it appeared a different passion from fear   edward perhaps my lord it was your fear that made you think so   lord norland no sir i was not frightened   edward then why did you give him your money   lord norland it was surprise caused me to do that   edward i wondered what it was you said it was not fear and i was sure it could not be love   harmony how has he been taken   edward a person came to our steward and informed against him  and oh my lord his poor wife told the officers who took him they had met with misfortunes which she feared had caused a fever in her husbands head and indeed they found him too ill to be removed and so she hoped she said that as a man not in his perfect mind you would be merciful to him   lord norland i will be just   edward and that is being merciful is it not my lord   lord norland not always   edward i thought it had been  it is not just to be unmerciful is it   lord norland certainly not   edward then it must be just to have mercy   lord norland you draw a false conclusion great as is the virtue of mercy justice is greater still justice holds its place among those cardinal virtues which include all the lesser  come mr harmony will you go home with me and before i attend to this business let me persuade you to forget there is such a person in the world as sir robert and suffer me to introduce you to miss wooburn as the man who    harmony i beg to be excused  besides the consideration of sir robert i have another reason why i cannot go with you the melancholy tale which this young gentleman has been telling has cast a gloom on my spirits which renders me unfit for the society of a lady   lord norland now i should not be surprised were you to go in search of this culprit and his family and come to me to entreat me to forego the prosecution but before you ask me i tell you it is in vain  i will not   harmony lord norland i have lately been so unsuccessful in my petitions to you i shall never presume to interpose between your rigor and a weak sufferer more   lord norland plead the cause of the good and i will listen but you find none but the wicked for your compassion   harmony the good in all states even in the very jaws of death are objects of envy it is the bad who are the only real sufferers there where no internal consolation cheers who can refuse a little external comfort  and let me tell you my lord that amidst all your authority your state your grandeur i often pity you speaking with unaffected compassion   lord norland goodday mr harmony and when you have apologized for what you have said we may be friends again exit leading off edward   harmony nay hear my apology now i cannot  no it is not in my nature to live in resentment nor under the resentment of any creature in the world   exit following lord norland

such confusion before his wife aside   miss wooburn sir robert having recovered in some measure from the surprise into which this intrusion first threw me i have only to say that whatever pretense may have induced you to offer me this insult there are none to oblige me to bear with it   going sir robert lady ramb  recalling himself miss woo  she turns lady ramble  recalling himself again miss wooburn  madam  you wrong me  there was a time when i insulted you i confess but it is impossible that time should ever return   miss wooburn while i stay with you i incur the danger   going sir robert holding her nay listen to me as a friend whom you have so often heard as an enemy  you offered me a favor by the hands of mr harmony    miss wooburn and is this the motive of your visit  this the return    sir robert no madam that obligation was not the motive which drew me hither  the real cause of this seeming intrusion is  you are going to be married once more and i come to warn you of your danger   miss wooburn that you did sufficiently in the marriagestate   sir robert but now i come to offer you advice that may be of the most material consequence should you really be determined to yield yourself again into the power of a husband   miss wooburn which i most assuredly am   sir robert happy happy man how much is he the object of my envy none so well as i know how to envy him because none so well as i know how to value you she offers to go nay by heaven you shall not go till you have heard all that i came to say   miss wooburn speak it then instantly   sir robert no it would take whole ages to speak and should we live together as long as we have lived together still i should not find time to tell you  how much i love you   a loud rapping at the streetdoor miss

assured that through him only will i ever listen to a syllable you have to utter   sir robert one syllable only and i am gone that instant   miss wooburn well sir   he hesitates trembles seems to struggle with himself then approaching her slowly timidly and as if ashamed of his humiliation kneels to her  she turns away sir robert kneeling maria maria look at me  look at me in this humble state  could you have suspected this maria   miss wooburn no nor can i conceive what this mockery means   sir robert it means that now you are no longer my wife you are my goddess and thus i offer you my supplication that if you are resolved not to live single amongst the numerous train who present their suit you will once more select me   miss wooburn you  you who have treated me with cruelty who made no secret of your love for others  but gloried boasted of your gallantries   sir robert i did i did  but here i swear only trust me again  do but once more trust me and i swear by all i hold most

first time admitted into your house to solicit this ladys hand and after having had it once no force shall compel me to take a refusal   lord norland i will try however  madam quit the room instantly   sir robert my lord she shall not quit it   lord norland i command her to go   sir robert and i command her to stay   lord norland which of us will you obey   miss wooburn my inclination my lord disposes me to obey you  but i have so lately been accustomed to obey him that custom inclines me to obey him still   sir robert there there there my lord now i hope you will understand better for the future and not attempt to interfere between a man and his wife   lord norland to her be explicit in your answer to this question  will you consent to be his wife   miss wooburn no never   sir robert zounds my lord now you are hurrying matters  you should do it by gentle means  let me ask her gently with a most soft voice maria maria will you be my wife once again   miss wooburn never   sir robert

extraordinary behavior you were jealous   sir robert and so i am my lord i have cause to be so   lord norland no cause to be jealous of mr solus  he is not miss wooburns lover i assure you   sir

fourth act act v scene i an apartment at lord norlands enter hammond followed by lady eleanor hammond my lord is busily engaged madam i do not suppose he would see any one much less a stranger   lady eleanor i am no stranger   hammond your name then madam   lady eleanor that i cannot send in but tell him sir i am the afflicted wife of a man who for some weeks past has given many fatal proofs of a disordered mind in one of those fits of phrensy he held an instrument of death meant for his own destruction to the breast of your lord who by accident that moment passed and took from him what he vainly hoped might preserve his own life and relieve the wants of his family but his paroxysm over he shrunk from what he had done and gave the whole he had thus unwarrantably taken into a servants hands to be returned to its lawful owner the man admitted to this confidence betrayed his trust and instead of giving up what was so sacredly delivered to him secreted it and to obtain the promised reward came to this house but to inform against the wretched offender who now only resting on your lords clemency can escape the direful fate he has incurred   hammond madam the account you give makes me interested in your behalf and you may depend i will repeat it all with the greatest exactness   exit hammond lady eleanor looking around her this is my fathers house it is only through two rooms and one short passage and there he is sitting in his study oh in that study where i even in the midst of all his business have been so often welcome where i have urged the suit of many an unhappy person nor ever urged in vain now i am not permitted to speak for myself nor have one friendly voice to do that office for me which i have so often undertaken for others   reenter hammond edward following hammond my lord says that any petition concerning the person you come about is in vain his respect for the laws of his country demands an example such as he means to make   lady eleanor am i am i to despair then to hammond dear sir would you go once more to him and humbly represent    hammond i should be happy to oblige you but i dare not take any more messages to my lord he has given me my answer  if you will give me leave madam i will see you to the door   crosses to the other side and exit lady eleanor misery  distraction  oh mr placid oh mr harmony are these the hopes you gave me could i have the boldness to enter this house but you would neither of you undertake to bring me here  neither of you undertake to speak for me   she is following the servant edward walks softly after her till she gets near the door he then takes hold of her gown and gently pulls it she turns and looks at him edward shall i speak for you madam   lady eleanor who are you pray young gentleman is it you whom lord norland has adopted for his son   edward i believe he has madam but he has never told me so yet   lady eleanor i am obliged to you for your offer but my suit is of too much consequence for you to undertake   edward i know what your suit is madam because i was with my lord when hammond brought in your message and i was so sorry for you i came out on purpose to see you  and without speaking to my lord i could do you a great kindness  if i durst   lady eleanor what kindness   edward but i durst not  no do not ask me   lady eleanor i do not but you have raised my curiosity and in a mind so distracted as mine it is cruel to excite one additional pain   edward i am sure i would not add to your grief for the world  but then pray do not speak of what i am going to say  i heard my lords lawyer tell him just now that as he said he should not know the person again who committed the offense about which you came and as the man who informed against him was gone off there could be no evidence that he did the action but from a book a particular pocketbook of my lords which he forgot to deliver to his servant with the notes and money to return and which was found upon him at your house and this lord norland will affirm to be his  now if i did not think i was doing wrong this is the very book  takes a pocketbook front his pocket i took it from my lords table  but it would be doing wrong or i am sure i wish you had it looking wishfully at her   lady eleanor it will save my life my husbands and my childrens   edward trembling but what is to become of me   lady eleanor that providence who never punishes the deed unless the will be an accomplice shall protect you for saving one who has only erred in a moment of distraction   edward i never did any thing to offend my lord in my life  and i am in such fear of him i did not think i ever should  yet i cannot refuse you  take it  gives her the book but pity me when my lord shall know of it   lady eleanor oh should he discard you for what you have done it will embitter every moment of my remaining life   edward do not frighten yourself about that  i think he loves me too well to discard me quite   lady eleanor does he indeed   edward i think he does  for often when we are alone he presses me to his bosom so fondly you would not suppose  and when my poor nurse died she called me to her bedside and told me but pray keep it a secret  she told me i was  his grandchild   lady eleanor you are  you are his grandchild  i see  i feel you are  for i feel that i am your mother embraces him oh take this evidence back returning the book  i cannot receive it from thee my child  no let us all perish rather than my boy my only boy should do an act to stain his conscience or to lose his grandfathers love   edward what do you mean   lady eleanor the name of the person with whom you lived in your infancy was heyland   edward it was   lady eleanor i am your mother lord norlands only child edward kneels who for one act of disobedience have been driven to another part of the globe in poverty and forced to leave you my life behind she embraces and raises him your father in his struggles to support us all has fallen a victim  but heaven which has preserved my child will save my husband restore his sense and once more    edward starting i hear my lords step  he is coming this way  begone mother or we are all undone   lady eleanor no let him come  for though his frown should kill me yet must i thank him for his care of thee  she advances toward the door to meet him enter lord norland falling on her knees you love me  it is in vain to say you do not you love my child and with whatever hardships you have dealt or still mean to deal by me i will never cease to think you love me nor ever cease my gratitude for your goodness   lord norland where are my servants who let this woman in   she rises and retreats from him alarmed and confused edward oh my lord pity her  do not let me see her hardly treated  indeed i cannot bear it   enter hammond lord norland to lady eleanor what was your errand here if to see your child take him along with you   lady eleanor i came to see my father  i have a house too full of such as he already   lord norland how did she gain admittance   hammond with a petition which i repeated to your lordship exit hammond   lord norland her husband then it was who  to lady eleanor but let him know for this boys sake i will no longer pursue him   lady eleanor for that boys sake you will not pursue his father but for whose sake are you so tender of that boy it is for mine for my sake and by that i conjure you  offers to kneel   lord norland your prayers are vain  to edward go take leave of your mother for ever and instantly follow me or shake hands with me for the last time and

scene ii another apartment at lord norlands enter miss wooburn and mrs placid mrs placid well my dear farewell  i have staid a great while longer than i intended  i certainly forgot to tell mr placid to come back after he had spoken with lady eleanor or he would not have taken the liberty not to have come   miss wooburn how often have i lamented the fate of lord norlands daughter but luckily i have no personal acquaintance with her or i should probably feel a great deal more on her account than i do at present  she had quitted her fathers house before i came to it   enter mr harmony harmony my whole life is passed in endeavoring to make people happy and yet they will not let me  i flattered myself that after i had resigned all pretensions to you miss wooburn in order to accommodate sir robert  that after i had told both my lord and him in what high estimation they stood in each others opinion they would of course be friends or at least not have come to any desperate quarrel  instead of which what have they done but within this hour had a duel  and poor sir robert    miss wooburn for heavens sake tell me of sir robert    harmony you were the only person he mentioned after he received his wound and such encomiums as he uttered    miss wooburn good heaven if he is in danger it will be vain to endeavor to conceal what i shall suffer   retires a few paces to conceal her emotions mrs placid was my husband there   harmony he was one of the seconds   mrs placid then he shall not stir out of his house this month for it   harmony he is not likely for he is hurt too   mrs

friends    mrs placid but what did he say   harmony he said you had imperfections   mrs placid then he told a falsehood   harmony but he acknowledged they were such as only evinced a superior understanding to the rest of your sex  and that your heart    mrs placid bursting into tears i am sure i am very sorry that any misfortune has happened to him poor silly man but i do not suppose drying up her tears at once he will die   harmony if you will behave kind to him i should suppose not   mrs placid mr harmony if mr placid is either dying or dead i shall behave with very great tenderness but if i find him alive and likely to live i will lead him such a life as he has not led a long time   harmony then you mean to be kind but my dear miss wooburn going to her why this seeming grief sir robert is still living and should he die of his wounds you may at least console yourself that it was not your cruelty which killed him   miss wooburn rather than have such a weight on my conscience i would comply with the most extravagant of his desires and suffer his cruelty to be the death of me   harmony if those are your sentiments it is my advice that you pay him a visit in his affliction   miss wooburn oh no mr harmony i would not for the universe mrs placid do you think it would be proper   mrs placid no i think it would not  consider my dear you are no longer a wife but a single lady and would you run into the clutches of a man   harmony he has no clutches madam he is ill in bed and totally helpless  but upon recollection it would perhaps be needless to go for he may be too ill to admit you   miss wooburn if that is the case all respect to my situation my character sinks before the strong desire of seeing him once more oh were i even married to another i feel that in spite of all my private declarations or public vows i should fly from him to pay my duty where it was first plighted   harmony my coach is at the door shall i take you to his house come mrs placid wave all ceremonious motives on the present melancholy occasion and go along with miss wooburn and me   miss wooburn but mrs placid perhaps poor mr placid is in want of your attendance at home

punishment of the guilt has become his own executioner   lord norland then my daughter is wretched and her boy involved in his fathers infamy   solus the fear of his ghost haunting me will disturb the joys of my married life   placid mrs placid mrs placid my complying with your injunctions in respect of mr irwin will make me miserable for ever   miss wooburn i wish he had applied to me   sir robert and as i refused him his request i would give half my estate he had not applied to me   harmony and a man who always spoke so well of you all behind your backs  i dare say that in his dying moments there was not one of you whom he did not praise for some virtue   solus no no  when he was dying he would be more careful of what he said   lord norland sir robert goodday settle your marriage as you
