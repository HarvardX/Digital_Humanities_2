discourses on scripture mysteries preached at st marys oxford before the university in the year      at the lecture founded by the late rev john bampton m a canon of salisbury with notes illustrative and critical  by william hawkins m a prebendary of wells vicar of whitchurch dorset and late fellow of pembrokecollege oxford  oxford printed at the clarendon press and sold by d prince and j cook oxford and j f and c rivington london  m dcc lxxxvii  imprimatur  jos chapman vicecan oxon aug        to his grace the archbishop of canterbury my lord having had the honor of being appointed preacher of the bampton lectures for the current year by the heads of colleges in oxford i have the happiness to introduce them to the public with the additional great advantage of your graces protection an advantage the more considerable as it derives as much from the character as the rank of my patron  in this situation it will i presume become me to address your grace rather under the form of preface than in the style of dedication  my slender pretensions to your favor are grounded in the earnest endeavor of the following sheets fully and circumstantially to vindicate that faith which i need not tell your grace is not barely attacked but insulted every day the charity which is not easily provoked must resent the freedom i had almost said the audacity which distinguishes the infidels of the present generation these gentlemen affect to be the party aggrieved and to console themselves at the same time with a hope and sometimes a persuasion of the speedy abolition of confessions and systems and in consequence of it the revival of evangelical doctrine in its native simplicity  i cannot think opinions openly and arrogantly hostile to the national establishment can be justified even by their sincerity but infidelity in general is without this excuse it has been repeatedly shown to draw its principal resources from the vigilance of captiousness the popularity of profession the artifice of dissimulation the confusion of things not really connected and the occasional suppression or adulteration of truth to these i am sorry for our own sakes to add the inconsistency between certain controversial terms and the imprudence or unwariness of concession such resources as these are indeed inexhaustible mr bamptons wise and pious institution and every other of a similar nature supposes as much we contend with enemies who though with unequal forces will always be able to take the field however my lord i flatter myself i have happily chosen more advantageous ground than many of my fellow soldiers in this warfare to whose names on other accounts i look up with deference and veneration after all the event must be left in the hands of providence i have only to beg the favor of the intelligent reader to peruse these discourses and the annexed annotations which will be equally necessary with an inclination to be satisfied and in that spirit of candor and impartiallity with which i trust he will find them to have been composed i request his attention throughout the performance and reasonable allowances for the inaccuracy or inequality that may be discovered in it i hope he will be biassed not by speciousness of principle or habit of attachment but by preponderance of argument i submit it to his judgment whether i have in any instance shown an undue warmth or unwarrantable resentment and desire him finally to determine as he shall upon the whole be persuaded not of the abilities of the advocate but the merits of the cause open to conviction myself i shall always be ready to rectify an error or to renounce an opinion on competent representation but shall not pay the least regard to any censure or animadversion the features of which shall manifestly betray it to be the offspring of prepossession chagrin or malevolence  with sincerest wishes and prayers for your graces health and happiness and for the peace and prosperity of that church over which you so worthily preside  i remain with all duty and respect my lord your much obliged and most obedient servant william hawkins  extract from the last will and testament of the late reverend john bampton canon of salisbury  i give and bequeath my lands and estates to the chancellor masters and scholars of the university of oxford for ever to have and to hold all and singular the said lands or estates upon trust and to the intents and purposes herein after mentioned that is to say i will and appoint that the vice chancellor of the university of oxford for the time being shall take and receive all the rents issues and profits thereof and after all taxes reparations and necessary deductions made that he pay all the remainder to the endowment of eight divinity lecture sermons to be established for ever in the said university and to be performed in the manner following  i direct and appoint that upon the first tuesday in easter term a lecturer be yearly chosen by the heads of colleges only and by no others in the room adjoining to the printing house between the hours of ten in the morning and two in the afternoon to preach eight divinity lecture sermons the year following at st marys in oxford between the commencement of the last month in lent term and the end of the third week in act term  also i direct and appoint that the eight divinity lecture sermons shall be preached upon either of the following subjects  to confirm and establish the christian faith and to confute all heretics and schismatics  upon the divine authority of the holy scriptures  upon the authority of the writings of the primitive fathers as to the faith and practice of the primitive church  upon the divinity of our lord and savior jesus christ  upon the divinity of the holy ghost  upon the articles of the christian faith as comprehended in the apostles and nicene creeds  also i direct that thirty copies of the eight divinity lecture sermons shall be always printed within two months after they are preached and one copy shall be given to the chancellor of the university and one copy to the head of every college and one copy to the mayor of the city of oxford and one copy to be put into the bodleian library and the expense of printing them shall be paid out of the revenue of the lands or estates given for establishing the divinity lecture sermons and the preacher shall not be paid nor be entitled to the revenue before they are printed  also i direct and appoint that no person shall be qualified to preach the divinity lecture sermons unless he has taken the degree of master of arts at least in one of the two universities of oxford or cambridge and that the same person shall never preach the divinity lecture sermons twice  discourse i john xviii    pilate says unto him what is truth this question of all by far the most important was put to our blessed savior by the roman governor perhaps carelessly perhaps contemptuously but certainly without the least wish for information in much the same spirit of scorn or with similar indifference the same question is every day in the mouths sometimes of skeptics and scoffers and sometimes of men of a more serious cast who affect to be persuaded that we cannot and it may be desire not to give them satisfaction unhappily the christian world is divided and subdivided almost infinitely it is parcelled out into sectaries of a thousand denominations the fact is though the right of private judgment in matters of religion which has been exercised from the beginning was justly and necessarily asserted by the leaders and friends of the reformation it must be acknowledged folly perverseness pride and enthusiasm have by severally maintaining it been productive of that strange multiplicity of religious sentiment which we have so much cause to lament of that schism heresy skepticism and infidelity which have all along disturbed the church but fix a mark of peculiar disgrace on the last and present century  and indeed when it is considered that the scriptures are on many accounts particularly liable to be misapplied perverted or misconstrued a that some passages are to be understood in a literal and some in a figurative sense that some things are expressed agreeably to the modes of common speech and some in pure condescension to the human capacity that passages are to be compared with each other in order to a true understanding of them and doctrines to be deduced not so much from single and separate texts as from the manifest tenor of the scriptures at large that not unfrequently one and the same text shall be capable of different and even opposite construction that though most places in holy writ are of universal importance yet some are of temporary and occasional purport only that the sacred writings strictly speaking are the foundation of a rule of faith and manners such as a creed formulary or confession rather than the rule itself as will i trust in due time more fully appear and that an assent to the collective body of scripture as true does not imply a knowledge or belief of all scriptural truths when all this to which more were there occasion might be added is fairly considered we cannot possibly be at a loss to account for that variety of notion that wildness and absurdity of conceit that extravagance or impiety of opinion which i just now observed has more or less so shamefully dishonored the christian name in all ages of this exuberance of folly and wickedness popery has ever been industrious to avail itself from the acknowledged liableness of the scriptures to the grossest abuse when in the hands of such as are unlearned and unstable to use the apostles words the church of rome draws her most specious argument against the common use of them and would fain have us infer the necessity or the certainty of an infallible authority lodged in the church for the decision of controversies and ascertainment of a rule of faith from the confessed convenience and utility of such an authority b but unfortunately for her pretensions as much error and absurdity has repeatedly been demonstrated to be within her pale as out of it wh t is truth becomes therefore with many a question of as much difficulty as importance or rather of more form than importance some encouraging themselves in skepticism from these circumstances and others blindly acquiescing in any mode of religion or in none at all or at best in that which is usually called natural religion from a pretense of the utter impossibility of discovering the true under such a complication of perplexity  with points of inferior consequence i shall not trouble myself but to such as deny or call in question the capital articles of our religion on the strength of the above considerations let me insist that nothing of this nature ought to supersede their endeavors to find the truth and much less to discourage their obedience to it when found after inquiry we may in some respect or other be mistaken but without it we are inexcusable in fact the very diversity or contrariety complained of may be justly urged in behalf of the faith which is received in the church were the doctrine of the trinity for instance impugned from one quarter only and by consistent and uniform opposition infidelity would be a much more formidable thing than it is but you may as well look for one language at babel as for a catholic system of unbelief if i may be indulged with the expression to enumerate all the heresies which have at different times torn and dismembered the church of christ is in a manner to confute them and these their common animosity against her excepted are at perpetual enmity among themselves nay what is yet more extraordinary we shall find infidelity itself abounding in mysteries even while it reprobates them almost with the confidence of a faith which could remove mountains if the sacred theory we are to maintain be in many respects incomprehensible the substitutions of human wisdom will in due time be shown to be at least equally so and to require the same degree of assent without any thing like the same foundation  what is truth say others among us what is it but a system of doctrines officially taught and formally transmitted from generation to generation  but if doctrines are true why not officially taught and carefully transmitted is profession ridiculous or authority contemptible as such indeed the question is not what says the church  but  what says the scripture now by scripture and the earliest antiquity our surest guide and purest precedent we are not only willing but wishful to be tried it is true the bulk of christians are not equal to this trial in a certain sense they care for none of these things they take matters upon trust they are not able to give an answer to every man that asks a reason of the faith that is in them except that they were born and bred in it and suppose it to be unquestionable it is with respect to this implicitness of assent this tameness of acquiescence as it is opprobriously called that the doctrine of the holy trinity has no less impiously than ludicrously been exposed to contempt under the description of the sea p          in preface to stilling fleets discourse in vindication of the doctrine of the trinity trinity of the mob but this is very unfair representation surely no argument can be drawn from the incapacity or the credulity of the many to the disadvantage of a doctrine that with respect to the grounds on which we defend it solicits demands defies the penetration of enquiry and the inquisitiveness of criticism the spiritual state of the common people all over the world falls nearly under the same predicament but at the same time a proportionable degree of satisfaction will always be derived to every man from every degree of rational assurance that he is in the right way or belongs to a communion wherein the truth is held in purity approaching nearest to the standard of primitive christianity  what is truth  say others we are no strangers to the doctrines publicly established to the faith asserted in your articles and expressed in your creeds but to these subscription is much more universal than agreement we can produce you names even among yourselves of persons not a whit behind the very chiefest divines in point of rank probity or understanding who nevertheless hold that god is to be worshipped after a way which you call heresy who preach another gospel than that which ye have received from your fathers constantly affirming or perpetually insinuating that ye do err not knowing the scriptures  too true indeed it is that the principal controverted points subsisting among those who profess and call themselves christians are of the most serious nature if the tenets of our gainsayers and adversaries of many appellations are right and just the doctrines of the trinity and of the resurrection of the body which will be the objects of the ensuing disquisitions are heresies of the most abominable or ridiculous tendency however these are circumstances which should not check but stimulate the spirit of investigation it will be of infinite moment to inquire whether we or they are the mistaken party and on which side error really lies whether our doctrines or theirs have the strongest foundation in scripture and antiquity are best supported by presumptive argument and corroborative evidence or have least recourse to artifice and the pitifulness of subterfuge and evasion we do not wish to have this matter determined either vulgarly by a majority of voices or invidiously by the reputation of names  but again say others what is truth  what good purpose is answered or what advantage gained by this extraordinary zeal for theory and establishment what does it but gender strifes and feed the flame of contention the practical doctrines of the gospel are so forcibly yet so familiarly inculcated as not to be liable to misinterpretation concerning the faith thousands have erred but as one of our own poets has said his cannot be wrong whose life is in the right   it is well for us there is nothing argumentative in the jingle of a couplet i confess myself to be one of those who are hurt by every effort that has a plain aspect toward resolving all religion into morality i consider every attempt of this kind as an indirect attack upon the fundamentals of christianity according to the idea of these reasoners the character of the messiah and of the son of god will dwindle into that of a mere legislator or moral philosopher who teaches us to live soberly righteously and godly in this present world tit ii    this text and texts congenerous with this may plausibly be urged in exaltation of good works to the exclusion of faith but let them be contrasted with the following he that believes and is baptized shall be saved mark xvi    he that believe thon the son has everlasting life john vi    etc etc and where is boasting on the part of moral honesty or evangelical righteousness as speciously or as justly as men may harangue in demonstration of the excellence of piety and virtue or as loudly or as reasonably as they may exclaim against the violence and much more the virulence which has actuated the spirit of controversy in too many instances i presume no intelligent person if he is impartial will deny that the faith which st jude tells us was once delivered to the saints whatever we are precisely to understand by it is something entirely distinct from mere morality that it ought earnestly to be contended for agree ably to the same apostles exhortation that it is very possible to contend with meekness that errors and schisms and heresies are represented in scripture as things more or less sinful dangerous and damnable and that consequently it is of the utmost importance to our spiritual interests to be right in principle as well as in practice the petulancy the pride and the malevolence of bigots and of disputers of this world as the apostle calls them will no doubt be brought into judgment no less than the grossest immoralities but this will not by any means supersede or retard an honest and charitable attempt to enquire into and ascertain the leading doctrines of our common christianity  complaints against the damnatory clauses of the athanasian creed as it is commonly called reverberate from more quarters than one people do not seem to be sufficiently aware that a right faith and a good life are required by this form of confession under the same penalty which faith except a man keep whole and undefiled without doubt he shall perish everlastingly they that have done good shall go into life everlasting and they that have done evil into everlasting fire this is the catholic faith which except a man believe faithfully he cannot be saved  it is plain these clauses are to be considered as simply declarative on scriptural grounds of the necessity both of faith and of good works to salvation and at the same time as leaving all men to that infinite mercy and those inestimable merits which are fully adequate to the pardon and atonement of sins failings ignorances and errors of integrity c which few considerations will i apprehend fairly deliver the creed before us from the reproach of uncharitableness with regard to the several articles of which it consists i trust they will be found in the course of these disquisitions to have foundation in a fully competent authority and in the mean time i shall endeavor to remove one general prejudice against them and to create rather a prepossession in their favor by evincing that their acknowleged mysteriousness and incomprehensibility does by no means unqualify them for our assent  man is as such a rational creature and as a rational creature he is a believing one too we can no more conceive him to be without belief than without sense thought or reflection the atheist who says in his heart as well as with his lips there is no god believes there is none he protests against the supposed folly or extravagance of the fundamental article of all religion and on the strength of false conclusions resolves every thing into a concourse of atoms fortuitously uniting or into the operation of an unintelligent principle which we call nature or in other words into an everlasting succession of causes and effects it is possible for a man to deny his own existence or that there is any such thing as motion we have heard of instances of this sort though properly they are instances not of false persuasion but of insanity d still man is a rational creature whether he reasons well or ill and whether in consequence of such reasoning his faith be well or ill grounded it is certain we know little or nothing by intuition the mind yields assent to many mysterious truths by forming a very small chain of deductions such as the immensity of space the infinite progression of number and eternity as well a part ante as a part post space and duration says an ingenious author are mysterious abysses in which our thoughts are confounded with demonstrable propositions to all sense and reason flatly contradictory to one another any two points of time though never so distant are each of them exactly in the middle of eternity the remotest points of space that can be imagined are each of them precisely in the center of infinite space see deism revealed vol   p     in fact we have no stronger or more adequate conception of immensity than of omnipresence we have no clearer idea of the existence of something from all eternity than we have of eternal generation faith it is true strictly speaking has reference to religion only see note at p   of howes s discourse on the abuse of the talent of disputation in religion etc but i hope a truth or a mystery is not inadmissible purely on account of its respecting practice or implying obligation this will readily be granted even by infidels who deny the truths of revelation and much more by such christians as have called into debate particular points of that revelation to which in general they profess to subscribe it is well worth remarking that deists and heretics never fail to attack the professed atheist with such reasonings as if pursued through their just consequences may fairly and successfully be enforced upon themselves for if he affects to decry the fundamental principle of all religion the being of a god on account of the pretended inconceivableness of it will not they observe in order to confute him that unless a more complete a more uniform and intelligible system could be built on the ruins of this great article such his exception can have no weight and this is the very reasoning we urge against the principles both of deists and heretics with the professed atheist i shall no farther concern myself but desire to observe that deists and heretics of all denominations are agreed with us in one general point the acknowlegement of the existence of god and consequently the incomprehensibleness of the divine nature attributes and operations the primary notion which the human mind frames of god is this general and complex yet negative idea of incomprehensibleness there is a certain preeminence if i may so call it in the divine essence etc which utterly precludes investigation but if so all mysteries whether natural or religious whether relative e g to the extension of space etc or to the nature of the deity all these if considered purely as mysteries will stand upon a level in point of credibility and let a revelation be supposed all adventitious truths introduced thereby will be fixed upon the same foot because faith cannot have a stronger foundation in human reason than in divine authority this is granted without difficulty but then as the deist denies the authenticity of those writings which we affirm to contain such revelation so the heretic disputes the sense and scope of them the question therefore is whether the opinion of the one and the unbelief of the other is respectively the result of judgment or of passion of conviction or of pride of impartial enquiry or of unwillingness to submit the understanding of man to the wisdom of god for i repeat it neither the one nor the other can consistently with his own principles and acknowledgments controvert the received sense or deny the authority of those writings which the church holds to be the word of god barely on account of mysterious truths contained in them if the divine essence be necessarily incomprehensible no revelation can possibly make it less so so far from it that the very idea of a divine revelation with respect to that essence implies a revelation of mysteries i e of truths undiscoverable and inconceivable by our natural powers and accordingly the credit of revelation is rather confirmed than weakened by the number and importance of such truths for it is but natural to expect a more ample display of wonders and larger discoveries of sublime and sacred points of faith in this revelation and surely god is not the less to be believed the more he communicates to us of his nature properties and dispensations as far as these remarks affect revelation in general heretics in general will admit the justness of them though at the very instant that they allow the writings in question to be the sole rule of faith they endeavor as much as may be to reduce that rule to the measure of their own judgments and apprehensions i am however already justified in asserting that as much as some people are averse to believing what they do not understand they cannot avoid believing what they do not understand and that therefore on proper authority it is full as reasonable to believe an hundred mysteries as one e and here taking my leave of the deist i would desire the heretic by what appellation soever distinguished to recollect that revelation left human nature as it found it i mean with respect to our intellectual faculties that from the beginning of the creation to this very hour man is to be considered as a reasonable creature as a freeagent as sometimes believing upon competent evidence sometimes governed by passions and sometimes influenced by prepossession a truth which accounts in a moment for the multitude of persuasions which have engaged the speculative world to expect or require that god should manifest himself and his proceedings etc to every man fully and personally is to destroy every notion not only of faith but of obedience likewise and to wish to invert the essential frame and constitution of things difficulties unsurmountable difficulties of many kinds occur to our contemplations on that frame and constitution difficulties on which the light of revelation darts not a single beam if we indulge the excursive faculty of imagination beyond the bounds which reason and scripture have set us we shall find ourselves inextricably entangled in perplexity and sometimes in impiety too who shall discover the consistency between divine prescience and human free will yet that man acts freely and that god foreknows all events and decrees accordingly are equally truths not to be shaken by any seeming irreconcileableness or contrariety whatsoever so again that the most perfect freedom of agency must be ascribed to god cannot possibly be controverted and yet does he not necessarily foreknow his own actions does not necessarily act agreeably to the eternal rules of justice wisdom and holiness that god is in no sense the author of evil either natural or moral every reasonable man and much more every christian will maintain yet is it not certain that had this world never been made neither sin nor death could have entered into it human wisdom has fatigued itself to no purpose in the ventilation of these subjects f many real truths but at present seeming paradoxes will doubtless be capable of future explication and spiritual things in general should rather be received with the humility of reverence than encountered with the arrogance of discussion there will be no end to doubtful disputations while mens sentiments are modified by a partial attachment to a favorite principle and while truths apparently opposite and contradictory are separately contended for which ought both to be admitted as ultimately they will be reconciled  what has been here advanced concerning faith or mysteries in general will i trust secure at least a fair and earnest attention to what i shall have to offer in defense of the mysteries of the gospel if these mysteries should be found to be real objects of faith it will be neither right nor safe to think or to speak of them indifferently unhandsomely or contemptuously  that the doctrines of the church of england the doctrine of one god in trinity and trinity in unity and that of the resurrection of the body are as reconcilable to our ideas as the consistency of free will with necessity or of the divine perfections with the existence of evil i should suppose no man can deny and therefore the great question is whether those doctrines be undeniably in those scriptures which all with whom i am concerned acknowledge to be the rule of faith  that with respect to the trinity the doctrine of the church has been so long so frequently so copiously agitated with much less success on our part than might have been expected from some of the best soldiers of jesus christ the weapons of whose warfare have been mighty in this spiritual field this i must confess is a circumstance enough discouraging but however not without its counterbalance in certain considerations the race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong matters are capable of being set in new lights nor will any exertion be desperate which has for its object the honor of god and the peace of his church men are wedded to their errors as much as to their vices but as we are not to be remiss or hopeless in our labors for the reformation of sinners though the whole world should lie in wickedness so neither should we be impeded or disheartened in our attempts for the conversion of infidels and heretics by that pride that prejudice however contracted that hardness or that slowness of heart which indisposes them for the reception of truth  after all inquiries of this nature are of very considerable use and importance they cannot fail at least to stablish strengthen and settle ourselves to root and ground us in that faith which we shall find to be built upon the most immovable foundations  that assertors and vindicators of this faith that champions for the church militant might never be wanting in this place the zeal and the piety the wisdom and the munificence of our founder has nobly provided the present institution is happily distinguished by its location and in some degree to answer and accomplish it is end i shall proceed with as much confidence and satisfaction as may reasonably be supposed to arise from a proper sense of obligation a full persuasion of the truth of the great doctrines in question and particularly of the merits of the trinitarian cause  discourse ii john v    search the scriptures to the scriptures of the old testament our blessed savior referred the jews for satisfaction with respect to his claims to the character in which he appeared among them and to the scriptures of the new testament together with the other i am to refer for proofs of those great but mysterious doctrines which i have undertaken to defend the doctrines contained in the liturgy and in the articles of the church of england  without laying before you at present all or the principal texts by which the doctrine of the trinity is supported or in which the absolute divinity both of the son and of the holy ghost is explicitly asserted or necessarily implied we may previously remark that supposing them to be authentic unequivocal and intelligible the infidel is in fact precluded from taking advantage of those passages which are declarative either of the acknowleged humanity of jesus christ or of the gifts and operations of the blessed spirit that humanity and those operations being things manifestly distinct from the divine essence and real personality what we shall have to do therefore will be to enquire in due time and place whether the exceptions which have been made against the texts with which the catholic doctrine is fortified are grounded in principles of common candor and common sense or in other words whether the interpretations of antitrinitarians are critically just and agreeable to the rules which are generally allowed to govern interpretation in the mean time it will be well worth while to examine whether the doctrine before us is not proveable by evidence which though indirect and collateral is irresistible there is hardly any such thing as framing a sentence or a proposition that cannot be prevaricated with but the tenor of a context and the weight of circumstances will not easily admit of sophistication  according to the athanasian creed as it is called the catholic faith is this that we worship one god in trinity and trinity in unity and that the godhead of the father of the son and of the holy ghost is all one the glory equal the majesty coeternal but what says the scripture says it not in effect the same also that the father is the first person in the trinity merely in order of nomination the son the second and the holy ghost the third is sufficiently demonstrable from many considerations in the first place though the three divine persons are usually mentioned in a manner which at first sight seems to import an order of a different kind yet this order is upon some occasions inverted e g in st pauls often quoted benediction to the corinthians the grace of our lord jesus christ and the love of god and the communion of the holy ghost be with you and in the following passage of the same apostle there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit and there are differences of administrations but the same lord and there are diversities of operations but it is the same god which works all in all   cor xii   and in other places the same inversion is observable with regard to the first and second persons ye know says the apostle that no whoremonger nor unclean person etc has any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god ephesians v   now our lord jesus christ himself says the same apostle and god even our father which has loved us comfort your hearts etc no man says our lord knows the son but the father neither knows any man the father save the son and he to whom the son will reveal him matt xi    to this we may add the introduction of st pauls epistle to the galatians paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by jesus christ and god the father who has raised him from the dead etc from these instances we may at least draw this inference that the general priority of order above mentioned imports no distinction or preeminence of essence  the root ground or fountain of essence may be acknowledged to be in the father without the least prejudice to the trinitarian doctrine which supposes an eternal communication to the son and to the holy ghost the terms root and fountain etc are customary indeed but by no means strictly proper or precisely descriptive they are familiar not to our ideas but to our ears when we speak of or contemplate the divine nature absolutely and without reference to particular dispensations god the father is generally the first in our conception as far as he can be the object of conception but not to the exclusion of the divine nature either of the son or holy ghost in these dispensations in the heavenly economy we have a manifest and obvious reason for addressing our prayers and petitions public and private for the most part to the first person of the holy trinity in short the terms father and son under which it has pleased infinite wisdom by way of analogy to represent this mysterious relation to our minds these terms imply nothing more than nominal preeminence and subordination if the antitrinitarian should insist that they do imply more and ask what we mean by eternal generation or procession we will answer him the moment we are told what he means by eternal essence itself g  again the father is commonly represented to us under the character of the maker the governor preserver and judge of the world the son under that of our redeemer advocate and savior the holy ghost under that of our guide comforter and sanctifier and yet these characters we shall see with the names properties and attributes of the deity are frequently reciprocated thus in the following places among others the office of redeemer is ascribed in expess terms to the first person or if you please to god absolutely considered god will redeem my soul from the power of the grave i will ransom them from the power of the grave i will redeem them from death hosea xiii    my soul shall rejoice which thou have redeemed psalm lxxi    so likewise in numberless passages the father is styled savior to instance only a few there is no god else beside me a just god and a savior isa xlv    paul an apostle etc by the commandment of god our savior   timothy i   etc we trust in the living god who is the savior of all men to the only wise god our savior be glory and majesty now and ever jude v    and again the work of sanctification is indiscriminately said to be the work of father son and holy ghost thus our bodies are sometimes called the temple of god and sometimes of the holy ghost the apostle declares that it is god which works in us to will and to do of his good pleasure the same apostle prays that the very god of peace may sanctify the thessalonians and make his hebrew converts perfect in every good work to do his will working in them that which is wellpleasing in his sight and not to multiply examples st jude addresses his general epistle to those that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in jesus christ to which we may add that the father has sometimes other titles and characters given him which belong more peculiarly to the holy spirit and is called the god of consolation and the god of all comfort as according to one apostle all scripture is given by inspiration of god while we are assured by another that holy men of god spoke as they were moved by the holy ghost   timothy iii      pet i      again we find all the great properties and characters of the first person frequently attributed to the second in a passage in isaiah he is even called the h everlasting father the father of the everlasting age bp lowth and to lay no stress upon prophetic phraseology is not the first person the supreme god a selfexistent independent being the creator the governor and preserver of the world so is jesus christ for before abraham was says he i am john viii    and he that came from heaven is above all he fills all in all he is the head and by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible etc all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and upholdeth all things by the word of his power and by him all things consist coloss i    of some of these and the following texts at present we shall take the sense to be granted is god the father a being eternal and unchangeable so is god the son for he has neither beginning of days nor end of life he is alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last which is and which was and which is to come the almighty rev i   jesus christ the same yesterday to day and for ever is omniscience an attribute of the true god so is it likewise of him whom he sent into the world for he knew all things he knew what was in man he knows the hearts of all men acts i    he it is who searches the reins and heart can any power less than infinite raise the dead and is it not the prerogative of the supreme god to judge the world yet to do both is the work of jesus christ for he is the resurrection and the life john xi v    and as the father raises up the dead and quickens them even so the son quickens whom he will and whosoever eats his flesh has eternal life and he will raise him up at the last day ibid vi    in consequence of such resurrection we must all appear before his judgment seat   cor v  0 and once more is not the true god invisible and incomprehensible so is jesus christ for agreably to a text before cited no man knows the son but the father again the character and office of the third person are explicitly attributed to jesus christ the apostles wish or benediction which we have already had occasion to refer to may be produced as one instance of this now our lord jesus christ himself and god even our father comfort your hearts and establish you in every good word and work for without christ we can do nothing and he of god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption john xi v    and he gave himself for the church that he might sanctify and cleanse it and the apostle could do all things through christ which strengthened him farther the characters and properties both of the first and second person in the holy trinity are likewise many of them ascribed to the third thus in the old testament the work of creation seems to be attributed to the operation of the holy ghost as a distinct personage or agent the spirit of god says moses moved upon the face of the waters thou sendest forth thy spirit says the psalmist and they are created and job asserts that god by his spirit has garnished the heavens job xxvi    and the spirit of god ha smade me says elihu ibid xxxiii   for whatever might have been the precise notion of the ancient jews with regard to the spirit the spirit of god and the spirit of the lord of which we find such frequent mention or whatever they might understand by that parallel expression in respect at least of the work of creation the breath of the almighty or the breath of his mouth the light of the new testament i cor i  0 think sufficiently directs us to the above interpretation thus again the holy ghost is omniscient and eternal for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of god   cor ii  0 and christ through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god heb ix    thus the office of advocate or intercessor is attributed to the spirit who makes intercession for the saints according to the will of god romans viii    thus the resurrection of our lord himself is said to have been effected by the power of the holy ghost for christ was put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit   pet iii    and he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken our mortal bodies by his spirit that dwells in us thus again both prophets and apostles are said to be sent or commissioned by the holy ghost as well as by the father and the son the lord god and his spirit has sent me says isaiah the spirit entered into me says ezekiel and said unto me go shut thyself within thy house ezekiel iii    and the holy ghost said separate me barnabus and saul for the work whereunto i have called them acts xiii   once more the holy ghost is indiscriminately called the spirit of god and the spirit of christ and the gospel of god and the gospel of christ are terms equivalent and the apostles are sometimes styled servants of god and sometimes servants of jesus christ and the holy ghost is said to make overseers over the flock as god the father has set some in the church first apostles etc and as the son gave some apostles and some prophets etc and lastly the very terms of our salvation are reciprocated st paul testified to jews and greeks repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus christ acts xx    and among the principles of the doctrine of christ the apostle reckons repentance from dead works and faith toward god heb vi   our savior says in one place he that believes on the son has everlasting life and in another place he that believes on him that sent him has everlasting life the general scripture doctrine is that we are saved by the mercy of god through the merits of our redeemer and yet our salvation is sometimes ascribed absolutely to the mercy or grace of jesus christ thus st peter declares his and his brethrens belief that both jews and gentiles shall be saved through the grace of the lord jesus christ acts xv    and st jude exhorts christians to keep themselves in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life jude    to all this we may add that the title of lord which is one unquestionable character of supremacy is common to the three persons in the holy trinity to the second it is applied as well as to the first in places almost numberless and to the third beyond all doubt in the following the lord direct your hearts into the love of god and into the patient waiting for christ   thessalonians iii   now god himself and our father where by the way the word  himself  does not appear to be more emphatical than in the text sometime since cited and our lord jesus christ direct our way unto you and the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another etc to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before god at the coming of our lord jesus christ for that by the lord in these texts we are to understand the holy ghost is i apprehend demonstrable from these two considerations first because it is his peculiar office to direct the heart to make us to increase in love and to stablish our hearts unblameable in holiness and secondly because according to any other construction we shall at best make but very indifferent sense of either of these passages from this inversion then and reciprocation of which we have produced such a number of instances the divinity of each person in the trinity may reasonably be inferred especially as the sense of many at least of the texts i have produced is obvious and altogether uncontrovertible  again this great point is evincible from the necessary sense or natural import of certain passages let us turn to a few of the most remarkable   thessalonians iii      the sin against the holy ghost is pronounced by our blessed lord himself to be of all sins the most damnable i say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men and whosoever speaks a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speaks against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come matt xii    now without staying to inquire here into the precise nature of this sin or how far it may be absolutely incapable of remission or in what sense our saviors audience understood him or he meant to be understood it will be sufficient for our purpose to remark that the doctrine of the holy trinity in general and particularly of the personal existence and coequal divinity of the holy ghost with that of the father and of the son is plainly and truly though covertly comprehended in the above texts and in their parallels in the other evangelists for otherwise we shall be unavoidably driven into the following absurd and execrable conclusions viz that the highest degree of impiety and profaneness against god the father is a mere venial sin and that a blasphemy or a sin a sin humanly speaking at least without hope or possibility of pardon may be committed against a being less than the supreme god and even against a kind of spiritual chimera a motion a virtue a quality or an operation  again as touching brotherly love says st paul ye need not that i write unto you for ye yourselves are taught of god to love one another   thessalonians iv   now that by him who in this place is absolutely styled god we are to understand jesus christ i have little or no difficulty to pronounce for the two following reasons first because though we may very properly be said to be taught of god when we are instructed by the mouth or by the preaching of his prophets or apostles or others commissioned by him yet the doctrine of universal love and charity was more immediately and peculiarly the doctrine of our blessed savior a new commandment says he i give unto you that ye love one another  by this all all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another john xiii     this is my commandment that ye love one another john xiv    and secondly because the apostle seems to regard this great duty as a principle recently taught and particularly enforced by the precept and example of our divine master  again he that has seen me has seen the father john i     says our lord and he that sees me sees him that sent me now in what sense are these declarations true not in the literal for the father could not be visible in the human person of the son because god is a spirit and no man has seen god at any time whom no man has seen or can see   timothy vi     and by necessary consequence our savior hereby in effect asserts that notwithstanding his appearance in the flesh he himself really and truly partook of the divine nature that according to his own expression the father dwelt in him or in the language of the apostle in him dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily or substantially  again in the gospels st john the baptist is called the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths strait matt iii    but in the evangelical prophet the style is at once more explicit and more majestical prepare ye says he the way of the lord make strait in the desert a highway for our god isa xl   in the course of the same sublime chapter jerusalem is called upon to lift up her voice with strength to lift it up and say unto the cities of judah behold your god and then the prophecy proceeds in the following words behold the lord god will come with strong hand and his arm shall rule for him behold his reward is with him and his work before him he shall feed his flock like a shepherd etc now unless it can be demonstrated that these passages do not refer ultimately at least to the coming and to the person of the messiah he is manifestly here announced under the different characters of a good shepherd a righteous judge and the lord god besides if there is no such reference the several apostolical citations from the prophet are most impertinently ridiculous  once more the first and second persons of the blessed trinity are expressly distinguished and respectively characterised as equal in a passage wherein the apostle occasionally asserts the unity of essence in the godhead we know says he that there is none other god but one for though there be that are called gods to us there is but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him   cor viii   etc  it may be pretended indeed that the terms under which the son is here characterised are not of equal weight and significance with those which are descriptive of the father but i will take upon me to aver that the same might have been pretended had these terms been transposed and the passage had run thus to us there is but one god the father by whom are all things and we by him and one lord jesus christ of whom are all things and we in him and in many places the three divine persons are severally specified and referred to as jointly concurring in the wonderful scheme of mans redemption particularly in the following st peter inscribes his first epistle to the strangers scattered through pontus galatia etc elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ and st john salutes the churches of asia with wishing them grace and peace from him which is which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from jesus christ   rev    i am sensible indeed that by the seven spirits just mentioned interpreters do not universally understand the holy ghost but this at least i cannot help remarking may be offered in favor of the sense in which i have taken the expression that it is a sense of which the words are full as capable as of any other whatever and that by the present construction a very considerable difficulty is removed which clogs a different interpretation for admitting the holy ghost to be signified by the seven spirits there will be nothing singular or unprecedented in this inversion of the order of persons in the trinity but why angels according to the sense of some commentators should be mentioned before jesus christ who is higher than the angels even in many of our adversaries conceptions seems accountable only by forced and unnatural explications and still more perplexed and incompatible with the nature of a blessing or a salutation in general or with the apostolical greetings and benedictions in particular the sense of others seems to be who by the seven spirits understand the graces of the spirit or the various operations of divine providence i however granting the passage to be rather obscure i would take occasion to observe from it yet farther that although we should be very cautious of deducing doctrines of faith from symbols or mystical expressions yet types and emblems confessedly significant and characteristical will justify our suitable conclusions it may be questioned perhaps what is precisely to be understood by the seven spirits just mentioned or by many other symbols in the revelation but it would be excess of perverseness to doubt whether the lamb in our apostles allegorical prophecy be the emblem of jesus christ whenever therefore we observe divine honors plainly ascribed to the lamb or find him spoken of in terms of equal importance and majesty with those which are predicated of him who is indisputably the true god the inference is obvious and unavoidable how then will the antitrinitarian evade the force of such passages as these and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth etc heard i saying blessing and glory and honor and power be unto him that sits upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever rev v    the lamb shall overcome them for he is lord of lords and king of kings rev xvii    i saw no temple therein for the lord god almighty and the lamb are the temple of it and the city had no need of the sun etc for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof rev xxi     and he showed me a pure river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb rev xxii i  and the kings of the earth and the great men etc hid themselves in the rocks and the mountains and said unto the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb rev vi     if any man should affect to make a distinction betwixt him that sits on the throne and the lamb or him who is said to sit on the right hand of god in proof of the superiority of the former i would desire him to remember that the throne in question is called sometimes simply the throne of god sometimes as in a text lately produced the throne of god and of the lamb that in another place the lamb is said to be in the midst of the throne in another to sit down in the throne of the father and that it is the throne of the son of god which is for ever and ever so likewise notwithstanding the diversity of constructions to which the expression of the seven spirits is liable the personality operation and divinity of the holy ghost may be demonstrated from the plain literal sense of many places in this book which are utterly void of emblematical ornament or allusion indeed the whole was evidently dictated by the spirit by whose inspiration all scripture was given who alone searches the deep things of god   cor ii  0 and under whose immediate direction our apostle wrote this epistle for he tells us expressly before he communicates his revelations that he was in the spirit on the lords day and elsewhere that he was carried away in the spirit and the solemn call to all persons concerned is frequently repeated he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches rev ii    to all this we may add that the personal inherency of the spirit in the essence of the godhead is demonstrable from st pauls illustration of a passage just now quoted from him the spirit says he searches all things yea the deep things of god for what man continues he knows the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knows no man but the spirit of god if the conscious spirit in man is man the spirit of god must be essentially god  i desire to observe yet farther that nothing less than a belief in the doctrine of the trinity as it is received in the church can satisfy the full demands of the terms  faith  and mystery  which we meet with so repeatedly in the new testament and to which there is so much reference under the old the whole of the mystery of the divine will made known in the dispensation of the fullness of times ephesians i  0 the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world etc   cor ii   or if you please the real character of the universal savior who was to be both god and man was a secret from the beginning this stupendous doctrine was infinitely and by the divine intention too sublime for the carnal conceptions of the jews who whatever they might ultimately understand by or hope from the messiah promised to adam to abraham to the patriarchs and to others and foretold by the prophets in language clear and strong indeed but at the same time figurative magnificent and mysterious expected and primarily desired only a temporal deliverer who should restore again and perpetuate the kingdom to israel nay it is abundantly evident that the prophets themselves those holy men of god who spoke as they were moved by the holy ghost   pet i    had not an insight into the full scope and whole import of the sacred truths and oracles which they delivered our lord seems to allude to this ignorance when he acquaints his disciples that many prophets and kings had desired to see the things which they saw and had not seen them luke x    etc it is true this was said by way of anticipation because as will be shown it was not then even to them given to know the capital mystery of the kingdom of heaven but st peter is plain and full upon this subject when speaking in his first general epistle of the salvation obtained for us by jesus christ he proceeds in the following words of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into   pet i  0 the expressions here are i think in themselves almost sufficiently decisive upon the great point before us for it is hard to conceive that the prophets in whom it seems the spirit of christ resided and much harder that the angels should not have a clear idea of the work of human redemption should not be able to comprehend what is the breadth and length and depth and height as st paul expresses himself with an eye i imagine to this dispensation supposing that work to have been accomplished by any person less than very god but admit the divinity of jesus christ and the inquisitiveness and the incapacity of men and angels will by no means be unaccountable all this i trust will afford a most strong argument that the faith which the apostles preached after the ascension of our savior the faith which was first delivered to the christian saints the faith which we are required to hold fast without wavering heb x    and to build up ourselves upon jude  0 is a faith in the incarnation of the eternal son of god or in other words in the doctrine of the holy trinity as it has all along been held in the christian church in consequence of the removal of a popular objection against all this i hope in the ensuing disquisitions to set in a still clearer point of view the great doctrine before us  discourse iii acts i   by many infallible proofs these words immediately refer to the great event of our lords resurrection but in consequence of it to the divinity of his person of this therefore i shall proceed to lay more proofs before you taking first this opportunity to obviate the following popular objection that notwithstanding all that has been or can be advanced the doctrine before us is not so absolutely clear and indisputable as we would have it thought and as a fundamental article of faith ought to be in as much as no text can be produced which precisely and totidem verbis speaks the language of the first article of our church viz in the unity of the godhead there be three persons of one substance power and eternity the father the son and the holy ghost or of the second two whole and perfect natures that is to say the godhead and manhood are joined together in one person never to be divided whereof is one christ very god and very man or of the fifth the holy ghost proceeding from the father and the son is of one substance majesty and glory with the father and the son very and eternal god  to all this i apprehend we may readily reply that if there be any real force in such objections it will operate much farther by necessary consequence than the objectors themselves can be supposed to desire it should for it will supply the perverse or idle caviller with pretenses and exceptions against all the divine properties and attributes as far as they are asserted in the first article there is no one passage in the scripture which literally tells us that there is but one living and true god everlasting without body parts or passions of infinite power wisdom and goodness the maker and preserver of all things both visible and invisible the divine superintendency etc usually called providence is justly reputed one of the capital doctrines of religion yet upon the principles of these objectors it should be no doctrine at all for we meet with no such term as providence in the sense demanded either in the old or new testament so that this doctrine must inevitably fall to the ground unless it be maintained and supported by natural inference or unless we are at liberty to make use of a proper term to express our sense of it he who objects to the term  trinity  as unscriptural should consider by what texts he will undertake to prove the unity of the divine nature which in the sense required by his argument is a term no more to be found in scripture than the other in fact upon the principle of our opponents we shall be under a necessity of expunging a great part of the apostles creed and even such parts of it as all christians whatever without the least scruple or hesitation have assented to for i desire to know by what express or literal authority of scripture any person believes in the holy catholic church or in the communion of saints or that our blessed lord was born of the virgin mary or suffered under pontius pilate etc in short if we are to be absolutely precluded the use and application of proper terms and expressions in the investigation and exposition of scripturemeaning it will i presume be impossible to frame the most simple system or formulary of christian faith and doctrine or any such thing as a creed of any kind in the church the holy scripture is the sole rule or measure of every form of confession etc it is the only test by which any doctrine or system is in all its branches even the most minute of them to be deliberately and ultimately tried but it is not the rule itself and indeed a little inquiry will show us why the capital points of religion are not systematically delivered in the sacred writings  the doctrine of the holy trinity as maintained by the church of england was the doctrine of the catholic church at and before the time of the publication of the scriptures of the new testament or it was not if it was the controversy is at an end if it was not we would fain know how to account for that great variety of passages and those numerous circumstances by which it is at least so plausibly countenanced not to say forcibly defended we would fain know how to reconcile with the character of the meek and the lowly jesus any one of his expressions which is capable of being construed into a claim to the divinity if this doctrine was the doctrine of the church previously to the publication of the holy writings they are sufficiently full and explicit for the satisfaction or confirmation of christians of all ages if otherwise here is more than enough said to perplex and misguide them and to lead them into errors of the first magnitude the great question therefore i take it is whether we have not all the reason in the world to infer from the very mode in which the doctrine of the trinity is inserted and inculcated in the sacred pages the question i say is whether we are not authorized by this circumstance to conclude that this doctrine was antecedently received in the christian world for instance supposing the doctrine of the trinity to have been the standing doctrine of the church when st john k wrote his gospel we have no kind of difficulty to encounter but are we not very much embarassed by the contrary supposition in the former case we may readily conceive the apostle to be asserting the divinity of jesus christ in the most express terms at the beginning of his gospel and in the course of it to record many particulars clearly declarative of the same not by way of formal answer to cerinthus or any other heretic that disputed or denied it but purely in flat contradiction to the novel and heterodox notions advanced and propagated by them and to encourage and stablish good christians in the faith as they had all along been taught what this great evangelist declares at the latter end of his gospel viz that these things were written or as we may say given under his own hand that the christians whom he addresses might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god is perfectly consistent with their preacquaintance with these matters agreably hereunto and indeed in direct confirmation of our hypothesis st luke and many it seems before him set in order a declaration of those things which most surely were believed among christians luke i   that the person he writes to might know the certainty of those things wherein he had been instructed in the same light we may regard those passages in the epistles which have often been produced in vindication of the doctrine before us some of these epistles were with respect to the main end and design of them entirely of a temporary nature being written with a view to the decision of controversies in the primitive church which for many centuries have been out of date and upon several occasions and subjects of little moment to succeeding generations not one of them however was professedly written in defense of the doctrine of the trinity according to our present hypothesis a vindication of this kind had been absolutely superfluous and though we cannot wonder to observe a point of this consequence frequently mentioned or alluded to in these writings yet it would be very unreasonable to expect to find it methodically or systematically taught  the grand principle of the leading oppugners of the doctrine under consideration is that the only thing required of christians to be believed with regard to the person of jesus christ is that he was the messiah the person promised and sent by god to redeem men from that death which they were inevitably appointed to as descendants of adam and that the messiah and the christ and the king of israel and the son of god are terms or titles in scripture absolutely denoting one and the same thing i need not tell you that this is the favorite tenet of mr lock in his treatise on the reasonableness of christianity as delivered in scripture  now we shall willingly admit that the apostles themselves were believers under this idea mostly during our saviors residence upon earth as it is certain they had not the whole mystery of the divine will the grand scheme of mans redemption clearly and fully made known to them before our lords ascension into heaven i have many things to say unto you he says to them but ye cannot bear them now john xvi    etc and in saying this he had most probably an eye to the mystery of the gospel for though he took frequent occasions to assert and presignify as i may say his truly divine nature either directly or by necessary implication and could not but have been understood so to have done by his disciples and by the jews who sought to stone him on that very account yet in the days of his flesh many circumstances concurred to shake or rather to overturn the faith of his followers with respect to this great article this is plain enough from the tenor of the evangelical history it would be ridiculous to suppose that the apostles could believe their master to be the son of god in the highest sense or even to be the redeemer of israel in any sense when they all forsook him and fled at the melancholy crisis i refer to they conceived no doubt very different notions of their lord from what they had once entertained of him and afterward did when he was declared to be the son of god with power or to full effect by his resurrection from the dead romans i     the fact is the scheme of human redemption by jesus christ the onlybegotten son of god in the strictest sense was opened gradually and propounded to the world as it were article by article at first it must necessarily have been sufficient to have believed that jesus was the christ the messiah or the son of god merely as executing a divine commission etc his resurrection ascension and exaltation to the right hand of the majesty on high being subsequent points of faith and accordingly we read of many that believed on him at different times and in different places long before the conversion of the three thousand on the day of pentecost whom we cannot but consider as believers in a much higher sense the faith of christians at that memorable period and ever since cannot with the least color of reason be ascertained or is to be measured by what is declared to be faith in particular instances recorded in the gospels the faith which made the woman whole who had an issue of blood luke viii    and the faith that saved i e restored to sight the blind man near jericho ibid xviii    could not be that faith the mystery of which st paul requires deacons to hold in a pure conscience   timothy iii   in short our saviors actual resurrection by virtue of his own as well as his fathers power as we shall presently see cleared up a thousand difficulties in a moment and amounted to a full demonstration of his divinity from a thorough conviction of this no doubt it was that his disciples worshipped him and st thomas in particular burst into that rapture of acknowlegement my lord and my god though therefore the messiah or the christ be not unfrequently called the son of god as a person sent from god as a teacher a prophet or deliverer etc as many even created beings angels etc and men in general are called sons of god in certain respects yet we insist that this appellation belongs peculiarly to jesus the author of our faith as a divine person likewise and that he is so called with reference to his nature as well as to his offices in some passages of scripture perhaps the precise import of this title may be controvertible as when devils and unclean spirits call our savior the son of god and the holy one of god and when peter styles him the son of the living god in answer to our lords question whom say ye that i am the disciples according to st mark replied by the mouth of peter thou art the christ in other places the significance of the title in question is discoverable by the context as when nathaniel addresses our savior in the character of the son of god the king of israel but why must all this affect the sense of any one passage wherein the appellation is given for reasons infinitely superior the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god luke i    l could stronger terms be devised to express the assumption of the human nature by the divine is it not perfectly reasonable to conclude that the sacred penmen often make mention of the son of god with an eye to this mysterious and ineffable incarnation and is it not certain that the person whom st john at the end of his gospel calls the christ the son of god is the same with him whom at the beginning of it he styles the word that was with god and was god and if so is not the sense of the latter passage determinable by the preceding nevertheless the great philosopher above mentioned leaves the introduction to this gospel and other passages in it of equal import entirely unnoticed as though it had no connection with his argument which is a piece of disingenuousness that one cannot avoid saying did little credit to his cause or to himself we shall be enabled by such considerations as these to put the true construction on the title of the son of god in most if not all the places where it occurs in the epistles naturally taking into the account the many clear and express proofs of our lords divinity which are cited from them of some of the most striking of these proofs among other particulars we shall for satisfactionsake take a review in proper time what mr lock has adduced on this subject with a purpose to invalidate these proofs in general will i am confident be utterly overthrown by the force of the following considerations viz that the epistles are a part of the new tesment and as essential a part as the gospels were like them as was observed written occasionally and after our saviors ascension etc that st paul e g was as much a teacher of the gospel an inspired apostle as st matthew or any other apostle who has historically recorded the actions words or doctrine of jesus christ and that a creed or system of faith should have its foundation in these epistles together with the other scriptures the truth is st john in his epistles asserts the same doctrine of our lords divinity as in his gospel by mr lockes way of proceeding viz arbitrarily admitting or rejecting scripture we may mould christianity into what form we please and to this way of proceeding among other causes we are to ascribe the various schisms and heresies which have so long and so deplorably divided the christian world  we may now i imagine fairly date the reception of the doctrine of our lords divinity from his resurrection and we will next see whether the subsequent accounts we have of the propagation of the gospel be not entirely uniform and consistent upon this hypothesis at the same time that they open to us the whole trinitarian system  let it be observed then that the first recorded prayer we meet with is that of the apostles after the ascension in which the address is made immediately to our lord himself that he would be pleased to show whether he had chosen joseph or matthias to supply the place vacated by judas the traitor whom he had originally chosen with the eleven apostles thou lord which know the hearts of all men show whether of these two thou have chosen acts i    it is i believe generally agreed that this address was made to jesus christ and if so this attribution of omniscience to him is sure as strong an argument of his divinity as any one thing which can be produced in demonstration of it the ascription is to me on any other foot unaccountable it is indeed true that the apostles had not yet a thorough insight into the evangelical mystery nor had got perfectly clear of the prejudices and notions respecting the messiah which they had imbibed in common with their countrymen in consequence of which we find them asking our lord even after his resurrection and after he had spoken to them more or less explicitly of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god whether he would at that time restore again the kingdom to israel but that they put this question to him as to one who was able to effect such restoration by his own inherent divine power or in other words essentially partook of the divine nature must surely be concluded from this consideration that they could not possibly now entertain the least doubt but that all his declarations and assurances to them would be verified to a tittle and that as he came forth from the father and was come into the world so he would soon leave the world and go to the father and be glorified with that glory which he had with the father before the world was the case appears plainly to have been this they did not yet comprehend the whole evangelical plan in the concurrence of three divine persons in glory equal in majesty coeternal they did not perfectly conceive all the things pertaining to christs spiritual kingdom the kingdom of god in the fullest and most exalted sense of which he had been speaking to them allusively forty days and with regard to which he may be supposed to have before promised them that the spirit of truth whom he would send unto them from the father should guide them into all truth and testify of him accordingly after the miraculous effusion of the holy ghost on the day of pentecost we find them discovering very different sentiments and animated with spiritual expectations we see them calling upon the people to save themselves from an untoward generation exhorting them to repent and to be baptized for the remission of sins m renouncing in an instant all honors profits and pleasures of this world rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of their divine master and in a word preaching the gospel of jesus christ the son of god through the inspiration of the spirit and in the truest sense of the expression on the memorable day just mentioned we are told that the apostles were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance what they spoke is not particularly specified but in general we are given to understand that they spoke in all languages the wonderful works of god on the credit of what has been advanced which will be strengthened by what will follow it is most reasonable to suppose that by the works here referred to the great work of redemption by the eternal son of god is principally intended the mystery of godliness exhibited in god manifest in the flesh and displayed in the wonderful effusion of the holy ghost  in the first address of the apostles to the jews and jewish proselytes by the mouth of peter on the same day both the humanity and divinity of our savior are plainly and distinctly asserted or implied and in such a manner as hardly to be liable to misconstruction the doctrine of the resurrection of jesus christ considered as the confirmation of a still greater doctrine that of his divinity is the chief cornerstone of our christian faith and as such is particularly insisted upon by the apostles who were ordained to be witnesses of it and because this most important of all events could not be accomplished by himself in his mere human capacity we find the holy writers frequently declaring that god raised him from the dead but let it be remembered that jesus whom god raised up is likewise as expressly said to have risen and is styled by these very witnesses the holy one and the just and the prince of life in different places which beyond all doubt are titles appertaining to the supreme god under the first of these characters god the creator is described in numberless passages of the old testament and he who is the prince or author of life according to the marginal reading must be the same in point of power and perogative with him to whom belong the issues from death who kills and makes alive and in whose hand is the life of every thing indeed the prince or author of life must have life in himself from all eternity must be emphatically the life and resurrection as our savior calls himself and therefore may as truly and properly be said to have raised the temple of his body by his own power to borrow his own phrase as to have been raised from the dead by the power of god the father we may say in short with equal truth and propriety christ was raised from the dead or christ rose from the dead according to the scriptures the latter assertion importing his divinity the former not superseding it and therefore when st peter told the men of israel that they had killed the prince of life i scarce know which strikes us most the force of the implied truth or the keenness of the sarcasm but to return to the address of the apostles peter standing up with the eleven says the sacred historian lift up his voice and said unto them ye men of judea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as ye suppose etc but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel and it shall come to pass in the last days says god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy etc and i will show wonders etc and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved acts ii    now let us compare the promulgation or delivery of this prophecy with the completion of it at this period observe the words of the apostle in the course of his harange this jesus says he whom with reference to his humanity he had just before called a man approved by god has god raised up whereof we all are witnesses therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he has shed forth this which ye now see and hear that the father and the son concurred in this wonderful dispensation of infinite wisdom and power on an equal foot it will scarce be possible for us to doubt when we recollect that the second person in the blessed trinity is often represented as the giver of spiritual gifts independently on any promise from or association with the first i will give you a mouth says he to his apostles just before his passion and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay i am with you always says he after his resurrection even unto the end of the world matt xxviii  0 without him he tells them they can do nothing and to produce only one passage more out of many that might be cited which has a manifest allusion to the effusion of the spirit on the day of pentecost st paul assures the ephesians that unto every one is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ wherefore he adds he says when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men ephesians iv     cor vii    it may be pertinent yet farther to remark that sometimes neither the father nor the son appear to be concerned in this matter the spirit being said of and by himself to divide his gifts and graces to every man severally as he will  but what shall we say to the invocation implied in the close of the prophecy we are considering whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved whom are we to understand by the lord here this i should think may be determined by the significance of the same words in other places they cannot be misunderstood in the original prophecy of joel and if we refer to the tenth chapter of st pauls epistle to the romans where they occur again they will amount to an irresistible though indirect proof of the point in question it is apparent that jesus christ is intended or included however in all these texts is accordingly to be worshipped and consequently is god  after what has been said we shall not be at a loss for the construction to be put upon the inference with which the apostle concludes this first discourse which we have been remarking on therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god has made that same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ just noting that in the phrase  that same jesus  abundance of reproach is conveyed i observe that these words sufficiently express the two natures united in our blessed savior the christ in his human character the lord in his divine but yet farther the apostle encourages his auditors who it seems were pricked in the heart by what he had preached to them to repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ with the comfortable assurance that the promise of the holy ghost was unto them and to their children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god should call agreably to which declaration we are told that the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved and are afterward informed that believers were added to the lord multitudes both of men and women now that according to the most natural and obvious interpretation we are by the lord to understand jesus christ in the two last quoted places i presume will be admitted by every candid enquirer and if so it is he who is described under the character of the lord our god in the text immediately before cited when therefore we are told at the   d verse of this chapter that the newlybaptized converts continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and afterward that the apostles taught and preached jesus christ and spoke to the people the words of this life etc we may justly conclude that doctrine to have been the doctrine of redemption as it has since been received in the christian church  when st peter and his colleagues were brought before the high priest and rulers etc in order to be examined concerning the cure of the impotent man at the beautiful gate of the temple we find them again insisting on the resurrection of their master as the fundamental article which was demonstrative of the truth of his mission and doctrine and by consequence of the divinity of his person this deceiver as they had blasphemously reputed him had said while he was yet alive that after three days he would rise again he had affirmed to them that as the father raises up the dead and quickens them even so the son quickens whom he will he had declared to them his existence before abraham in the most explicit terms before abraham was i am he had said that god was his father in the strictest sense making himself equal with god etc etc supposing then the lord to have risen indeed the truth of these several assertions must necessarily follow and in fact that he was risen these betrayers and murderers of the just one had they not been stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears could not but have been convinced by beholding the lame man who was healed standing before them and afterward by the many signs and wonders which were wrought among the people by the hands of the apostles who most undoubtedly must have been endowed with such power from on high or in other words by their now glorified master  i have already in effect considered the sin of ananias and sapphira who agreed together to tempt the spirit of the lord as a sin against the third person in the holy trinity and i think we may defy infidelity to put a fairer interpretation upon this portion of the apostolical history  i shall not dwell on the two invocations of the protomartyr at the hour of death lord jesus receive my spirit lord lay not this sin to their charge both which abundantly imply his faith in jesus christ as god but pass on to the account of the conversion of the ethiopian eunuch by philip the deacon acts viii    etc the angel of the lord spoke unto philip saying arise and go toward the south etc and he arose and went and behold a man of ethiopia an eunuch of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians etc who had come to jerusalem for to worship was returning and sitting in his chariot read esaias the prophet then the spirit said to philip go near etc and philip ran to him and heard him read etc and said understandest thou what thou read and he said how can i except some man should guide me and he desired philip that he would come up and sit with him the place etc which he read was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter etc and the eunuch said i pray thee of whom speaks the prophet this then philip began at the same scripture and preached unto him jesus and as they went on their way they came to a certain water and the eunuch said see here is water what does hinder me to be baptized and philip said if thou believe with all thy heart thou may and he answered and said i believe that jesus christ is the son of god and he baptized him the history is as succinct as possible but why is it not as reasonable to suppose that when philip preached unto the eunuch jesus he laid the whole mystery of christianity before him the grand scheme of human salvation and consequently that he believed jesus christ to be the eternal son of god as that when he baptized him he did so in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost there was no manner of occasion to be more circumstantial supposing the primitive readers of this history to have believed in our sense of the term  the next particular that meets us is the conversion of st paul it will be proper to lay it before you acts ix   etc saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the lord went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way he might bring them bound unto jerusalem and as he journeyed suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou lord and the lord said i am jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks and he trembling and astonished said lord what will thou have me to do and the lord said arise and go into the city and it shall be told thee and saul arose and when his eyes were opened he saw no man but they led him and brought him into damascus and there was a certain disciple at damascus named ananias and to him said the lord in a vision ananias and he said behold i am here lord and the lord said arise and go into the street which is called strait and enquire in the house of judas for one called saul of tarsus for behold he prays and has seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hands on him that he might receive his sight then ananias answered lord i have heard by many of this man how much evil he has done to thy saints at jerusalem and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name but the lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me and ananias went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother saul the lord even jesus that appeared unto thee has sent me that thou might receive thy sight and be filled with the holy ghost and he received sight forthwith and arose and was baptized then was saul certain days with the disciples which were at damascus and he preached christ in the synagogues that he is the son of god but all that heard him were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name but saul increased the more in strength and confounded the jews which dwelt at damascus proving that this is very christ upon this compendious narrative i remark first that throughout the whole we must understand by  the lord  jesus christ secondly that whether saul received the holy ghost by virtue of the imposition of the hands of ananias and previously to his baptism or after it in either case the whole mystery of the gospel must have been communicated to him by immediate irradiation and thirdly that therefore when he preached christ in the synagogues that he is the son of god he asserted him so to be by eternal generation occasionally indeed when he confounded the jews by proving that this is very christ his argument no doubt turned upon what he alleged to show that jesus christ was the true messiah the prophet that should come into the world and the king of israel in a spiritual sense whom they had and did expect under the idea of a temporal savior it seems after this saul spoke boldly in the name of the lord jesus at jerusalem and we are told that upon his being sent forth to tarsus that he might be out of the reach of the grecians who went about to slay him the churches had rest throughout all judea etc and were edified and walking in the fear of the lord and in the comfort of the holy ghost were multiplied i recommend the two last particulars of this passage to the attention of every candid and intelligent hearer i add too in corroboration of what has been offered under this portion of the history that as jesus christ here tells ananias that saul was a chosen vessel unto him so ananias tells paul according to the latters account of this transaction in another place that the god of their fathers had chosen him acts xxii    x   etc   the conversion of cornelius and his family presents itself next to our consideration and the short but important narrative of it is pregnant with matter to our purpose this proselyte of the gates for such doubtless he was saw evidently an angel of god coming unto him etc to the voice which called to peter to rise kill and eat he answered not so lord for i have never eaten any thing that is common etc while peter thought on the vision the spirit said unto him behold three men seek thee arise therefore and go with them nothing doubting for i have sent them god has showed me says he afterward to cornelius and his friends that i should not call any man common etc now if we only suppose as i think we can do no less than suppose that st peter addresses jesus christ in the words  not so lord we have plainly a distinction of three persons in the sacred story the same will be observable likewise in the harangue of the apostle upon this extraordinary occasion of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that fears him etc is accepted with him the word which god sent unto the children of israel preaching peace by jesus christ he is lord of all that word i say you know which was published throughout all judea how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power etc however if it be objected that it is by no means credible this devout proselyte and his family should be converted to the christian faith in the trinitarian sense by any thing asserted or intimated in st peters discourse to them we will admit the objection and leave our adversaries in possession of all the advantage they can make of it we may venture to do so without the least hesitation for i desire it may be remembered in what manner and by whom the apostle was interrupted in his sermon if it may be called one while peter yet spoke these words says the sacred writer the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word and they of the circumcision were astonished for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify god by this miraculous event therefore all farther endeavors of the apostle for the instruction of these people were happily superseded they were as st paul was instantaneously as it were guided into all truth and became believers in the same sense in which he was one agreeably hereunto when st peter rehearsed this matter and expounded it by order to those of the circumcision who contended with him he tells them in the course of his narration that as he began to speak the holy ghost fell on them that heard him after this would it not be idle to insist upon the inadequateness of st peters address to the purpose of conversion in its utmost extent  we read in the sequel of this and in the following chapters that the word was preached that the hand of the lord was with these preachers that a great number believed and turned unto the lord and that the word of god grew and multiplied if these expressions are compared with others similar to them in this history and with several already cited they will be found i presume abundantly to coincide with our hypothesis or more properly to confirm it  but the time admonishes me to bespeak your attention to the continuation of my argument at the next opportunity  discourse iv acts i   by many infallible proofs in prosecution of the subject which engaged us last sunday i proceed to the account of st peters imprisonment and what followed upon it which the sacred historian gives us in the   th chapter of the acts of the apostles  when peter was put in prison by herod it seems prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto god for him acts xii    and on the night before his intended execution the lord we find sent his angel and delivered him out of the hand of herod etc now that jesus christ was the lord that sent his angel appears evident enough from these considerations jesus christ is manifestly designed by this title for the most part at least through this whole history the lord who delivered peter by his angel was certainly the same lord who afterward spoke to paul in the night by a vision and who upon another occasion stood by the same apostle and encouraged him etc now we should be glad to know why these particulars are not to be regarded as equivalent to the appearances and visions and deliverances see dan iii    and chap vi     which are so frequent in the old testament and in that case i need not point out the consequences they lead to  in the following chapter we see barnabas and saul sent forth by an immediate commission from the holy ghost the holy ghost said separate me barnabas and saul for the work whereunto i have called them acts xiii    so they being sent forth by the holy ghost departed unto seleucia etc the passage has been introduced before and i leave it to the consideration of every attentive and impartial hearer  the next occurrence is the conversion of the deputy s paulus who we are informed was a prudent man and called for barnabas and saul and desired to hear the word of god and we may reasonably suppose that our apostles preached it to him at large and laid before him the great mysteries of the gospel and that he believed in the most extensive sense and was confirmed in his faith by the judgment which he saw miraculously inflicted by the hand of the lord upon elymas the sorcerer being as the sacred text expresses it astonished at the doctrine of the lord the doctrine just above styled the word of god  after this we find st paul preaching in the synagogue of the jews at antioch in pisidia acts xiii    etc now these jews though they were not immediately concerned with them that dwelt at jerusalem in the proceedings against our blessed lord were yet in all probability consenting unto his death as they could not all this while be unacquainted with his story or strangers to his pretensions the apostle therefore adopts the same mode of argumentation which st peter had used before in his speech to the council and lays the main stress on the fundamental article of the resurrection of our lord from the dead from the admission of this the truth of the other great points of christianity must necessarily follow and it should seem that this discourse of our apostle had a considerable effect upon some of his audience and indeed that others conceived the full force and import of the most striking particulars in it for we read that when the congregation was broken up many of the jews and religious proselytes followed paul and barnabas who speaking to them persuaded them to continue in the grace of god and by the way this circumstance may well be thought to imply that the spirit of grace had previously operated in their hearts to their entire conversion but the next sabbath day we are farther told almost the whole city came together to hear the word of god and the result was that the jews filled with envy spoke against those things which were spoken by paul contradicting and blaspheming i would just ask then whether this blasphemy does not help us to a very strong presumptive proof of the sense in which these jews understood the things which were spoken by the apostle  let us now attend paul and barnabas to iconium and see whether we may not readily infer the nature of their doctrine from the success of it there in this place we are informed they abode long time speaking boldly in the lord which gave testimony to the word of his grace and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands acts xiv   etc etc  i would desire you to compare the last clause of this passage with the conclusion of st mark s gospel so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven etc and they went forth and preached the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following and with the twelfth verse of the next chapter all the multitude kept silence and gave audience to barnabas and paul declaring what miracles and wonders god had wrought amongst the gentiles by them and with the following passage in the epistle to the hebrews how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will heb ii   etc  i say i could wish you to compare these several places and i believe i might venture to abide by the conclusions you will draw from them  we find our apostles next at lystra where paul cured the man that was impotent in his feet etc acts xiv   etc on the sight of which miracle the people lift up their voices saying the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men possessed with this notion the priests of jupiter brought oxen and would have done sacrifice etc this no sooner came to the ears of barnabas and paul than they rent their clothes and ran in among the people crying out sirs why do ye these things we also are men of like passions with you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living god which made heaven and earth etc etc now this was precisely the expostulation which the occasion demanded the existence of the one living and true god was to be asserted to these idolatrous believers in a plurality of deities at that time to have opposed to their persuasions doctrines peculiarly christian would have been altogether premature and unseasonable it appears however that our apostles had before and after this preached these doctrines at lystra and in the neighborhood with success though most probably for obvious reasons not in the hearing of those that would have done sacrifice for we read at the sixth verse of this chapter that being ware of the design of the jews and gentiles at iconium to use them despitefully etc they fled unto lystra and derbe etc and there they preached the gospel and after the affair of the sacrifice we are told that there came to lystra certain jews from antioch who persuaded the people and having stoned paul drew him out of the city etc that nevertheless he revived and soon after preached the gospel at derbe and taught many and returned again to lystra etc confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the says acts xvi     we meet with nothing now that has particular connection with our argument before the conversions related in the sixteenth chapter let us proceed then to these at troas says the history a vision appeared to paul in the night from which he and silas assuredly gathered that the lord had called them to preach the gospel in macedonia observe then the account of the conversion of lydia at philippi a certain woman named lydia which worshipped god heard us whose heart the lord opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken of paul and when she was baptized she besought us saying if ye have judged me to be faithful to the lord come into my house etc now i would ask whether we may not reasonably suppose the lord opened this womans heart for the reception of all evangelical truths almost in an instant whether her case is not at least similar to that of cornelius and whether we are not as much authorized to take it for granted that the things which were spoken of paul were the things pertaining to the kingdom of god agreeably to our system as that this convert was baptized according to the form in st matthews gospel i would just remark here that this system is in no wise prejudiced either by the declaration of the damsel possessed with a spirit of diviniation who followed paul and his companions and cried saying these men are the servants of the most high god which show unto us the way of salvation or by the apostles exorcism of that spirit in the following words i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her  but let us turn to the conversion of the jailor to whose custody paul and silas were committed at philippi sirs what must i do to be saved acts xvi  0 is the question which the former in a fit of astonishment and terror put to the latter and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shall be saved and thy house and they spoke unto him the word of the lord etc and he was baptized he and all his and he rejoiced believing in god with all his house to believe in god and to believe on the lord jesus christ appear here to be convertible expressions in short i affirm that in this as well as in preceding instances we have good reason to suppose the persons preached to were made acquainted by the apostle and his companion with the capital truths of christianity as they are taught in the church  not long after this our apostle and his fellowtravellers came to thessalonica where was a synagogue of the jews acts xvii   etc and paul as the narrative proceeds went in unto them and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures opening and alleging that christ must needs have suffered and risen again and that this jesus whom i preach unto you is christ and some of them believed it will be sufficient to observe here that our apostle dealt no doubt with these jews and jewish proselytes as he had before done with others on like occasions but the gross misrepresentation and scandalous calumny of the unbelieving jews in the city just mentioned is extremely worth notice they drew jason as we are informed and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city crying these men that have turned the world upside down are come hither also ibid xvii   and these all do contrary to the decrees of caesar saying that there is another king one jesus now it is perfectly reasonable to suppose that jason and these brethren proclaimed their crucified master king in a spiritual sense nay that they proclaimed him the sovereign of the universe king of kings and lord of lords but it is clear beyond a possibility of doubt that they asserted no temporal jurisdiction of jesus christ or said or did any thing contrary to the decrees or against the government of caesar  we have next an account of paul and silass preaching the gospel at berea acts xvii  0  but there is nothing in it which discriminates it from parallel ones already spoken to except the candid reception the gospel met with at that place  we will therefore follow our apostle to athens where we find him disputing in the synagogue with the jews and others that met with him among these were certain philosophers of the epicureans and the stoics who encountered him some calling him a babbler others a setter forth of strange gods because he preached unto them jesus and the resurrection acts xvii    etc  i mean not to insinuate from this passage that the apostle is maintaining the divinity of jesus christ as it is evident from the tenor of his ensuing discourse to those heathen philosophers which is set down at large that he has here only an eye to the prophetic character or office of our blessed lord if you will turn to the discourse you will find the great points insisted on to be the unity and the spirituality of the godhead together with the doctrine of a future state and the resurrection of all men from the dead in consequence of his whom god had ordained to be the judge of the world this was a proper beginning with heathens but what effect had this discourse upon these idolatrous philosophers when they heard of the resurrection continues the sacred story some mocked and others said we will hear thee again howbeit certain men clave unto him and believed etc our apostle appears then to have made converts at athens though we do not read that they were baptized or indeed believed in the fundamental articles of christianity according to our hypothesis without doubt these articles the great mysteries of faith were gradually opened to them afterward and previously to their admission into the church by baptism for we shall see presently that these converts are not the only instances of persons who were disciples or believers in a certain sense though they were uninstructed in the first principles of christianity and this too even since the propagation of it by the apostles  after these things we are told paul and silas  came to corinth acts xviii   etc  and paul reasoned in the synagogue  and persuaded the jews and greeks  and was pressed in spirit and testified to the jews that jesus was christ and when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook his raiment and said unto them your blood be upon your own heads etc you will be pleased to compare this relation with that of the perverse and unbelieving jews at antioch in pisidia already taken notice of  we have next an account of the conversion of justus though it is not particularly set down and of crispus and of many of the corinthians which contains nothing material to our argument  but after this we readof an insurrection made by the jews against paul and of a charge brought against him before gallio which has a particular worth our notice this fellow say they persuadeth men to worship god contrary to the law acts xviii     now when we recollect that our blessed savior was circumcised and obedient to the law for man that himself and his apostles conformed to the religion of their country in all points and attended divine service in the temple and in the synagogues that our apostle circumcised timothy in pure condescension to the jews that in vindication of his innocence he declared to festus as he had done before in substance to felix that neither against the law of the jews neither against the temple he had offended any thing at all that the mosaic economy totally ceased not before the final destruction of jerusalem when all disputes concerning circumcision and the legal rites and observances were happily terminated when we recollect all this to which more might be subjoined it will i conceive be impossible to make tolerable sense of the accusation just mentioned without supposing something to have been superadded to the jewish worship by the apostles and first christians which gave this great offense and what should this be but the worship of christians as such or in other words the adoration of christ as god  we will now proceed to the account which the sacred historian gives us of apollos in the same chapter acts xviii    a certain jew named apollos an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures came to ephesus this man was instructed in the way of the lord and being fervent in the spirit he spoke and taught diligently the things of the lord knowing only the baptism of john and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when aquila and priscilla had heard they expounded unto him the way of god more perfectly and when he was disposed to pass into achaia the brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come helped them much which had believed through grace for he mightily convinced the jews and that publicly showing by the scriptures that jesus was christ this portion of scripture though a little abstruse is replete with matter for our observation apollos is here said to have been mighty in the scriptures to have been instructed in the way of the lord and to have spoken and taught diligently the things of the lord i e beyond all controversy the things of the lord jesus christ nevertheless he is only called a jew and why but because he was not baptized in the name of jesus christ he was not a christian in the full sense of the term as we understand it he knew only the baptism of john he knew as we cannot but suppose from this account of him he knew jesus christ to be the prophet the messiah that was to come whose way john had prepared by preaching the baptism of repentance etc but he knew not the whole mystery of godliness the grand secret of human redemption by the son of god coexistent with his father before the foundation of the world and accordingly we may safely conclude that it was with respect to this great mystery that aquila and priscilla expounded to him the way of god more perfectly if we do not infer from hence that he expressly and directly preached the great mystery in question to those jews whom he mightily convinced etc every difficulty under this head is fairly solved by preceding considerations  the case of the disciples whom st paul found at ephesus is very similar to that we have just dispatched have ye received the holy ghost says he since ye believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost acts xix   etc and he said unto them what then were ye baptized and they said unto johns baptism then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied the passage is not wholly free from obscurity but we cannot do less than collect from it that these disciples knew as much of christ jesus antecedently to this interview as apollos did before his acquaintance with aquila and priscilla and consequently that when they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus they were baptized in the name of a greater person than a prophet and when the holy ghost came on them and they spoke with tongues and prophesied had like cornelius and his household an immediate insight into the profound mystery of the christian faith i just add that in the chapter before us the name of the lord jesus is said to have been magnified and that the word of the lord jesus and the word of god are different modes of expression which at first sight will be found to import one and the same thing  but to proceed i see nothing of consequence enough to our argument to detain us till we find st paul at miletus from whence he sent to ephesus and called the elders of the church and when they were come to him says the history he said unto them ye know from the first day that i came into asia after what manner i have been with you serving the lord with all humility and how i kept back nothing that was profitable unto you testifying both to jews and greeks repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus christ and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me save that the holy ghost witnesses in every city saying that afflictions abide me but none of these things move me so that i might finish my course and the ministry which i have received of the lord  acts xx    etc jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god and now i know that ye all among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god shall see my face no more wherefore i take you to record that i am pure from the blood of all men for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the holy ghost has made you overseers to feed the church of god which he has purchased with his own blood for i know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them now if we suppose this apostolical charge to have been delivered to persons preinstructed in the mystery of the gospel agreeably to our representation of it i e to have been believers in the holy trinity it must be acknowleged to contain words of perspicuity truth and soberness but on every other supposition must not st paul have been thought by his audience to have been indeed beside himself i would recommend the whole of this passage to every judicious and impartial readers thorough consideration  we will now attend this great apostle to jerusalem where we find him violently attacked by the jews which were of asia who stirred up all the people and laid hands on him crying out men of israel help this is the man that teaches all men every where against the people and the law etc the accusation brought here against our apostle is plainly in substance the same with that alleged by the jews of achaia who accused him of persuading men to worship god contrary to the law i shall therefore refer you to what was said on that occasion only i will add here that the observation then made is much confirmed by the circumstance of st pauls purifying himself at jerusalem with the four men who had a vow on them agreeably to the advice before given by the judaizing christians and in exact conformity to the mosaic constitution but if we turn to what the apostle has to say in his own defense we shall find  acts xxi    etc his apology to contain an account of his conversion and of his apostolical commission in consequence of it which strengthens much what has been remarked relative to the charge brought against him it is observable that st paul calls himself here a jew in the very same breath almost in which he avows himself a christian he admits his hearers to be zealous toward god according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers acts xxii   etc though he plainly intimates all the while that they were erroneously or blindly zealous or as he elsewhere expresses it that their zeal of god was not according to knowledge he does not undervalue or vilify the law and much less pronounce it to be void and of none effect though he professes himself a preacher of the gospel neither the jews of jerusalem nor those of asia could possibly be strangers to the new doctrine which he taught under that character so that we are not at a loss to know the nature and import of the testimony which he bore concerning his divine master beside we are to remember that he was interrupted in the course of his harangue and precluded from enlarging his speech or expatiating on his doctrine which otherwise perhaps he might have done by the clamours and outrage of a giddy and incensed multitude  we see him next before the chief priests and council in which situation he politicly takes advantage of the difference of sentiment between them that composed it the one part being sadducees and the other pharisees the apostle openly declares himself a pharisee in which plea his immediate view was manifestly to his own preservation though ultimately he had doubtless an eye to the conversion of the most considerable and respectable part of his audience by tacitly at least referring to the resurrection of jesus christ and the important consequences necessarily resulting from it  in much the same light we may regard his apology for himself before felix in the acts xxiii   etc following chapter under one article of his accusation he is charged with being a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes acts xxiv   etc or as the asiatic jews had expressed themselves with teaching men every where against the law or in the words of the jews of achaia with persuading men to worship god contrary to the law and under another article he is traduced as a mover of sedition and a disturber of the public peace now there is something observably dexterous in our apostles reply to all this in which he partly denies the charge professes his innocence and defies them to prove the things whereof they accuse him and partly asserts the cause he had espoused and in general terms acknowleges his christian principles in this as in the preceding case there is fine address in the apostles endeavor to interest his auditors on the side of christianity by representing its professors as holding one common tenet with the straitest and most popular sect of the jewish religion while at the same time he was indirectly preaching through jesus the resurrection from the dead and by necessary implication maintaining the great mystery of the christian faith felix we find was far from being unacquainted with at least some of the doctrines of christianity and reserved the matter for a farther hearing but in the interim he with his wife drusilla which was a jewess sent for paul privately and heard him concerning the faith in christ acts xxiv    etc it does not appear that our apostle on this occasion discoursed on any one article of faith strictly and peculiarly christian he reasoned of righteousness temperance and judgment to come till this iniquitous governor trembled and probably had proceeded to the full display of all evangelical truth had he not been abruptly dismissed however if there be any difficulty here it is such as affects not our argument in particular because the very same difficulty will subsist whether we suppose that jesus whom paul preached to be very god of very god or to be the son of god in a secondary sense only or indeed barely the prophet that was to come into the world  many of the foregoing remarks may be applied to the defense made afterward by our apostle before king agrippa and festus acts xxvi   etc  i think it unnecessary therefore to cite it it will suffice to observe or rather to repeat that asserting the doctrine of the resurrection in general and particularly that of jesus christ st paul at one and the same time insinuates himself into the good graces of such as were pharisaically disposed and points to a fact the admission of which upon full and dispassionate enquiry must lead all that heard him all the jews at least into a train of conclusions necessarily comprehending the great truths of the gospel and that this was a much more judicious mode of conviction than the direct or positive assertion of all or any of those truths could have been i presume i need not stay to prove  when st paul some time after this expounded and testified the kingdom of god to the jews at rome persuading them concerning jesus both out of the law of moses and out of the prophets acts xxviii       we cannot say with any precision how much of the whole scheme of christianity he laid before them most probably his usual discretion directed him to deal tenderly with them at first though when he declared to the unbelieving part of them that the salvation of god was sent unto the gentiles the expression has evident reference to that scheme as suitably hereto the history of the apostolical acts concludes with an account of his receiving all that came in unto him for two whole years and preaching the kingdom of god and teaching those things which concern the lord jesus christ  this minute and circumstantial survey of the history of the acts of the apostles so far as it is connected with our present subject will i apprehend throw much light upon the same and it will receive additional luster from the following consideration that as in the holy scriptures so in the writings of the apostolical fathers the leading truths of christianity are incidentally mentioned or alluded to and not systematically but uniformly taught the doctrine of these fathers is delivered in the spirit of simplicity it appears plainly to have been the standing doctrine of the church nor is there a single circumstance that will incline us to suspect them of a design to obtrude their own private opinions or conceits upon the christian world this to me seems demonstrable from a very observable particular which is that in their writings they do not cite all or the principal texts which are adduced in maintenance of the doctrine of the trinity but assert the same in other terms and in language fully equivalent they evidently considered it not as requiring proof but deserving illustration ignatius in the introduction to his epistle to the ephesians salutes them according to the will of the father and jesus christ our god the same father wishes the romans to permit him to imitate the passion of his god or of christ his god as it stands in the original in the abovementioned epistle to the ephesians he takes occasion thus to express himself there is one physician both fleshly and spiritual made and not made god incarnate true life in death both of mary and of god first passible then impassible even jesus christ our lord n in the conclusion of his epistle to the magnesians he injoins them to be subject to their bishop as jesus christ to the father according to the flesh romans i   and the apostles both to christ and to the father and to the holy ghost this inversion is a very remarkable one in his epistle to polycarp he exhorts him to consider the times and expect him who is above all time eternal invisible etc were there occasion much more to the same purpose might be extracted from this venerable father  polycarp in his epistle to the philipians wishes them to be subject to the priests etc as unto god and christ  in st clements first epistle to the corinthians these passages occur the scepter of the majesty of god our lord jesus christ came not in the show of pride etc etc the second section of the same epistle proceeds in the terms following ye were all of you humbleminded etc desiring rather to be subject than to govern etc being content with the portion god had dispensed to you and hearkening diligently to his word ye were enlarged in your bowels having his sufferings always before your eyes this passage is not unsimilar to part of st pauls discourse at miletus to the elders of the church of ephesus before submitted to your consideration let us see now what this father says in his other epistle to the corinthians the exordium of it is this  brethren we ought so to think of jesus christ as of god etc in the third paragraph he quotes these words of our blessed savior whosoever shall confess me before men him will i confess before my father but continues he wherein must we confess him namely in doing those things which he says etc by worshipping him not with our lips only but with all our heart etc for he says in isaiah this people honors me with their lips but etc in conformity with this good fathers idea we may ask after the manner of st paul is jesus christ the god of the new testament only is he not also of the old yea of the old also in the conclusion of the epistle st clement exhorts the corinthians to be vigilant etc because we know not the day of god s appearing i e undoubtedly the day when we must appear before the judgmentseat of christ  it is true as the learned translator acknowledges this second epistle was neither held in so much reverence by the ancients nor is so generally received among the moderns as the first and it is certain st jerome photius and archbishop usher after them concur in endeavoring to represent it as a spurious production but i am apt to think every reader will be satisfied with what the learned prelate has advanced in its defense though were the point still really controvertible as the ground of the objections raised by these illustrious personages does not lie in the doctrine so explicitly contained in it and at the same time so consonant to the sentiments of the apostolical fathers i see no manner of necessity for retracting these quotations whoever the author might be we have his clear sense of the matter  the charge of credulity brought against many of the fathers by a late celebrated author with vehemence of zeal and in the dialect of virulence even admitting it to be well founded cannot justly be thought to affect in the least the validity of these primitive and plain testimonies to the great truths of the gospel as they are most surely believed among us there is not i am confident one circumstance to color a charge of this nature against the fathers from whom we have been drawing our evidence except that of the phoenix by which as we shall see st clement illustrates the doctrine of the resurrection and ample satisfaction will be given on that head in its proper place o  to these testimonies we might subjoin those of justin martyr athenagoras irenaeus and a number of others the weight of whose collected evidence will be found infinitely to preponderate all that has perversely been alleged to its discredit from writers of a subsequent date and minor authority p this in due time will fully appear  now if in all this doctrine we can see nothing like a formulary or system we see however from whence confessions of faith may reasonably be supposed to have originated and by what at this day they may be most justly defended supposing the first rule of faith to have been purely the baptismal form or agreeing with dr sykes that the very short creed which at first was deemed sufficient to entitle men to baptism was no other than a faith in god the father almighty maker of heaven and earth and in jesus christ his son our lord and in the holy ghost even admitting this we cannot surely have recourse to better or sounder authority than that which has been laid before you in order to know exactly what this faith implies it will be hard indeed if the apostles and these apostolical fathers should be all along teaching heresy while they perpetually and earnestly though not formally or methodically complain of and expatiate against it  but i have yet farther to observe that the sense of antiquity and the faith of the primitive church may be inferred from such circumstantial evidence as has never that i know of been professedly produced but yet i trust will be allowed to come little if at all short of demonstration  the infamous reproach which was cast upon the whole christian name by its first enemies is a circumstance of a particular aspect to our purpose christianity was called emphatically the atheism q now i own i cannot help considering this equally horrid and ridiculous imputation as necessarily importing the primitive christians to have worshipped jesus christ as one with the father or as very god of very god from all eternity for nothing less than such worship will account for the charge either from jews or gentiles it might naturally be considered by both as a kind of dethroning of the one supreme god but every modern unbeliever will readily agree with me that the idea of inferiority and delegation etc is far from being irreconcilable with jewish tenets or with known principles of polytheism r  according to the apostolical constitutions as we learn from an eminent author it was customary for the priest after amen solemnly pronounced by the communicants in the holy sacrament to cry out with a loud voice   holy things belong to holy persons upon which the people answered there is one holy one lord jesus christ  the same writer acquaints us from vegetius an heathen author who flourished in the time of the younger valentinian that christians in a military capacity were used to swear by god christ and the holy spirit and the majesty of the emperor which next to god is to be honored etc caves prim christ p    echards roman history vol iii p     in his dissertation on epictetus arrian as bishop wilkins observes assures us that in his time which was about an hundred and tweny years after christ it was an usual form in the prayers of the heathen to say   lord have mercy upon us whereby they did acknowledge the unity of god says his lordship which clause he adds is thought to have been from that usage taken into the liturgy of christians  now if this be admitted i would remark that as the title of lord confessedly belongs to our savior the christians may fairly be supposed in their triple form of ejaculatory address  lord have mercy upon us christ have mercy upon us lord have mercy us to invoke christ the lord as supreme god or if by lord we are in the first and third petition to understand god the father still we must be presumed in the intermediate one to address the son as equal to the father because we shall else be absurd enough to invoke the supreme god and a subordinate being with the same fervor and as it were in the same instant you will see the argument these pious ejaculations furnish us with whether we do or do not credit the account of arrian see wilkins on not relig b i chapter   p      in confirmation of what has been offered i desire to add one or two more facts which if i mistake not have more weight in them than is commonly apprehended as for instance the appointment of the lords day and the style or title  by which churches were in the primitive times distinguished for can we do less in common reason than worship him with the supreme god and as the supreme god to whose particular honor one day in the week is for ever to be kept holy on whose particular account the most sacred observances of religion were transferred from the seventh day of the week to the first and whose peculiar house is now the only house of prayer for all people  i shall conclude this discourse with reminding you of a circumstance if possible still more decisive i mean the unitarian doctrine which is so copiously and so emphatically inculcated in the koran of mahomet see passim of the person of jesus christ in his prophetical character this arch impostor speaks in terms the most respectable god says he gave miracles to jesus the son of mary and strengthened him with the holy spirit etc jesus said in the cradle verily i am the servant of god this was jesus the son of mary s the word of truth etc verily god promises thee a son named john says the angel gabriel to zechariah according to the koran who shall bear witness to the word which comes from god an honorable person chaste and one of the righteous prophets to do honor to the author of christianity in this capacity mahomet positively asserts that they the jews slew him not neither crucified him but that he was represented by one in his likeness they did not really kill him says he but god took him up unto himself  but with respect to our lords divinity or equality with the father you have among a thousand parallel ones the sentiments following they viz the christians say god has begotten children god forbid it is not meet for god that he should have any son god forbid blessed be he that has revealed the forkan koran to whom belongs the kingdom of heaven and earth who has begotten no issue and has no partner in his kingdom etc yet have they taken other gods besides him which have created nothing but are themselves created etc jesus is no other than a servant whom we favored with the gift of prophecy etc when jesus came with evident miracles he said now am i come unto you with wisdom and to explain unto you part of those things concerning which ye disagree wherefore fear god and obey me verily god is my lord and your lord wherefore worship him he is god besides whom there is no god etc far be god exalted above the idols which they associate with him the    th chapter of the koran is entitled the declaration of gods unity and the whole runs thus say god is one god t the eternal god he begets not neither is he begotten and there is not any like unto him in the  th chapter is the following question how should he have issue since he has no consort  that these carnal sentiments this gross language the language of infidels and scoffers every day is directly levelled not at a new or strange thing not at a peculiar tenet of a few enthusiasts or a particular sect of christians but at the leading article the fundamental principle of our religion may be affirmed in utter defiance of the united powers of effrontery and equivocation the doctrine of the trinity was most indisputably the standing doctrine of the christian church at the time this false prophet broached his imposture in the beginning of the seventh century all these considerations combined demolish in a moment the several forts of infidelity in early corruptions in monastic superstition in gothic barbarism scholastic subtilty and papal innovation v  discourse v   john v part of verse  0 this he is the true god  according to some versions and perhaps defensible ones see webster and scots christian life vol ii p     see whitby in loc is the true god having i trust already beyond all reasonable doubt ascertained the absolute divinity of jesus christ by many infallible proofs from holy writ and by other arguments of a nature little less demonstrative i scruple not to set the words just read to you in the front of the present discourse as plainly declarative of this great doctrine though singly and separately considered they may not on a critical review of the whole verse be altogether unliable to cavil or if you please to exception and i hope very much to strengthen what has been advanced by showing the repugnancy of antitrinitarian principles to the genius and design of the christian dispensation or in other words by proving that if we solely or chiefly regard our blessed savior under any character inferior to that of the true god our highest ideas will come infinitely short both of the dignity of his person and the nature and end of his commission  by affecting the common appellation of unitarians modern unbelievers as well the followers of socinus as the disciples of arius who again may be ranged under many more classes than one appear in some sort to be ashamed of the leaders of their respective heresies and to desert the captains under whose banners they fight but be their several motives hereunto what they may though indeed they are obvious enough it will suffice without concerning myself with particular conceits to take into consideration the two following general persuasions  first that of those who regard our savior merely as a legislator or teacher of morality by divine commission and  secondly that of those who profess themselves both almost and altogether such as we are his coequality with the father excepted  with a view to the confutation of socinian principles i would observe in the first place that the title of legislator or lawgiver is by no means that by which jesus christ is distinguished or particularly described either in the old or new testament the great characters of wonderful counselor prince of peace the sun of righteousness mal iv   the lord our righteousness jer xxiii   the messiah the chosen of god luke xxiii    the christ of god of mediator and advocate of savior redeemer and high priest of son of david son of god son of the blessed mar xiv    lamb of god lord of glory   cor ii   prince of life author and captain of our salvation heb ii  0 v   these characters and more that might be enumerated import little or nothing of legislation but are almost wholly significative of the personal quality of our savior and of his own moral excellence and of the value and efficacy of his sacrifice he was it is true a teacher sent from god but he was not sent primarily in the capacity of a teacher to instruct the world in righteousness was not the grand and ultimate but merely a subordinate end of his appearance and indeed a necessary consequence of it  let us see then in the second place what the scripture and he himself declares to have been the more immediate purpose for which he was made flesh and dwelt among us to this end was i born john xviii    says he and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness to the truth again god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life ibid iii    again i must work the work of him that sent me matt ix    i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance john ix   he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and to set at liberty those that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord once more i must preach the kingdom of god for therefore am i sent luke iv       what the sum and substance of our saviors preaching was will be remembered presently and mean time we shall find his apostles delivering themselves in language corresponsive to the above the law was given by moses says st john but grace and peace came by jesus christ john i    in this was manifested the love of god toward us says the same apostle because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins john iv    0 again when the fullness of time was come says st paul god sent forth his son made of a woman that we might receive the adoption of sons gal iv   this is a faithful saying says the same apostle and worthy of all acceptance that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners   timothy i    and to adduce only one passage more the grace of god that brings salvation has appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world tit ii    etc the question then will be how or in what manner we are taught to live thus or in other words what we are to understand by christs religion regarding it as a system of morality  i must beg leave then in the third place to put you in mind that christianity is not a new law properly speaking but a new edition if i may so say or promulgation of the old agreeably to the express declaration of its divine author who assures us that he came not to destroy the moral law or the prophets but to fulfill both matt v    the fact is christ blotted out the hand writing of carnal ordinances col ii    and took out of the way the whole ceremonial of judaism but left every thing which was intrinsically holy and just and good in the law in its full force and obligation he was the mediator of a better covenant he laid the foundation of a new system of faith and a purer mode of worship but he repealed not a single law of moses that had any thing in it properly of a moral and binding nature a religion of this sort supposed and required reformation in the lives of its professors and accordingly our blessed lord in his excellent discourse on the mount and in other places enforces the import and explains the obligation of many of the precepts of the jewish lawgiver the full sense and genuine meaning of which had been perverted by the false glosses and misconstructions of later ages and particularly of the scribes and pharisees we find him perpetually upbraiding these with their substitutions of oral tradition in the room of the written word of god and with absurdly and impiously teaching for doctrines the commandments of men matt xv   in these instances he nobly rescues the scripture from human corruptions and faithfully discharges the important office not of a maker or prescriber of law but of a doctor or expounder of it  suitably to all this our lord cites and refers to the law of moses upon all occasions if thou will enter into life keep the commandments matt xix    viz the commandments contained in the mosaic decalogue was his answer to the person who had asked him what he should do that he might have eternal lise when the lawyer by way of tempting him put this question to him which is the great commandment in the law ibid xxii    he mentions those two capital ones which though not literally to be found among the ten virtually comprehended them all namely the love of god and of our neighbor at once satisfying and confounding his insidious querist with this apposite and decisive reply accordingly when he told his disciples that he gave them a new commandment john xiii    in his particular injunction to them to love one another he was not teaching a new doctrine or bringing strange things to their ears this duty being evidently implied in the love of our neighbor but only injoining a duty by the practice of which his followers ought to be more especially distinguished to which they had inducements of an extraordinary nature to which they were bound by ties and considerations peculiarly christian and by reverence for his astonishingly great example who so loved them and washed them from their sins in his own blood rev i     in perfect consistence with this the apostles preached the gospel after their lord and master had left the world and was gone to his father they taught gospel truths they insisted on st paul more especially they rejoiced they gloried in their deliverance from bondage under weak and beggarly elements gal iv   they exulted in the abolition of the ceremonial law as a mere temporary establishment and shadowy institution but at the same time they regarded the moral law as of inviolable authority and a complete standard of conduct still when the apostle just now named exposes the extreme folly of such transgressors of the law as stood selfcondemned or complains of the rigor of its requisitions or declares the impossibility of yielding meritorious obedience to it and consequently of obtaining salvation under it its subsistence and obligation are supposed beyond all possible contradiction that it could not make the comers thereunto perfect was an argument of its own intrinsic perfection the same great apostle pressing upon his roman converts the duties of brotherly love and universal charity recites almost all the commandments of the second table and subjoins that comprehensive precept of moses just now mentioned which he no doubt considered as inclusive of every evangelical precept even that of loving our enemies thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself st james calls this very precept this great social principle the royal law james ii   and when he argues against the folly and presumption of a partial obedience to the divine commandments and a commuting as it were for iniquities rests his argument wholly in that supreme authority by which the law of moses was enacted he that said do not commit adultery said also do not kill james ii    in short both our lord and his apostles inculcated and enlarged upon many things of practical importance as circumstances admitted and occasions required but they taught nothing of this kind but what was reducible to the mosaic institutions or to some general head of jewish or natural morality i add of natural morality because the law of nature the law of moses and the law of christ are in point of morality one and the same the latter illustrating explaining enforcing and recommending the two former but neither adding to nor diminishing from them for the reason or fitness of things is absolutely unalterable and whatever is in its own nature morally good or evil has always been so and will for ever continue so to be the moral law which was once written upon tables of stone was originally engraved upon the fleshly tables of mans heart u to maintain or to imagine otherwise is to charge god foolishly and to suppose both the law and the gospel to prescribe a practice in some instances unnatural and unreasonable st pauls descriptions of the gross ignorance and depravity of the heathen world are equally animated and just romans i    etc but notwithstanding this the irradiations of reason and conscience are sometimes beautifully visible amidst this blackness of spiritual darkness we might extract from the writings of pagan authors philosophers and others of different times and in different places a moral system against which collectively taken should lie no fair exception and produce from them sentiments finely coinciding with the most exalted principles and most refined doctrines of christianity  in these writings we find the purest piety the exactest justice the truest benevolence the firmest fortitude the noblest disinterestedness and the meekest patience most explicitly taught and earnestly inculcated w tully divides the duty of man as we do at this day viz into that which is due first to god secondly to our neighbor and thirdly to ourselves haec philosophia nos primum ad deorum cultum deinde ad jus hominum quod situm est in generis humani societate tum ad modestiam magnitudinemque animi erudivit tusc q l i      the golden rule of equity whatsoever ye would that men should do to you etc matt vii    see whitby in loc obtained as many have observed both among jews and gentiles and was delivered by them as well negatively as positively and under various modes of expression that to intend wickedness is to commit it is the express doctrine of seneca as quoted by leclerc in his note on the   th chapter of the  th book of grotius and which is still more remarkable he instances in cases of lust and sensuality incesta est etiam sine stupro quae cupit stuprum even so great a debauchee as ovid speculates well upon this subject  quae quia non licuit non facit illa facit ut jam servaris been corpus adultera mens est omnibus exclusis intus adulter erit ibid this is precisely the morality of our divine legislator forgiveness of enemies etc is a great point of morality which the heathens were far from being unacquainted with according to plutarch it was a prayer of the lacedaemonians that the gods would enable them to bear injuries and we are informed by the same great biographer that dion maintained true philosophy to consist not in showing kindness to friends but in forgiving injuries and pardoning offenses menander is clearly of the same opinion in the following fine passage   see le clercs note above referred to  some of the philosophers argued against present solicitude and the taking too much thought for the morrow precisely as our savior does in his discourse on the mount a philosopher or wise man ought not to be anxious about these things viz food etc etc   is a sentence quoted by dr whitby in his note on v    chapter   of st matthew the following sentiment of plato  see plato de leg l   is almost a counterpart to our saviors  of every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account at the day of judgment tullys notion of the servitude of a sinner quadrates exactly with the doctrine of our blessed lord and of st paul after him whosoever commits sin is the servant of sin john viii    says the former his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness romans vi    says the latter and says cicero si servitus sit obedientia fracti animi et arbitrio carentis suo quis neget omnes imbrobos esse servos tullys par   on the other hand deo parere libertas est says seneca in the spirit of a christian and the language of the church in one of the collects of which gods service is called perfect freedom the same philosopher represents the deity as a most beneficent being who makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and on the unjust ecce sceleratis says he sol oritur et piratis patent maria sen de ira l   c    de vit beat    and to mention only one particular more he directs us in another place to consider human afflictions as the corrections of a father for our spiritual benefit god he says sicut severus pater durius educat see wilkins b   c    which is almost literally the sentiment of the apostle heb xii   etc the frailty of human nature our radical disinclination to virtue the necessity of propitiation and our want of extraneous assistance as well as of personal resolution for the purpose of a good life are points often intimated and as often insisted upon by pagan writers the nitimur in vetitum  of the poet was a sort of standing thesis with many the multitude of heathen sacrifices shows a consciousness of guilt and a solicitude for atonement their sense of the need of a divine blessing on their endeavors in general appears sufficiently from their undertaking nothing of moment whether of a public or private concern without the previous observance of certain rites and ceremonies or as pliny expresses himself in the introduction to his panegyric on trajan sine deorum immortalium open consilio et honor it may not be easy to ascertain what we are to understand by the demon or the genius which by his own account attended socrates but it is certain the notion of good and evil genii prevailed much in the heathen world in the following lines the warmth of divine infusion in the human breast is beautifully expressed by ovid est deus in nobis agitante calescimus illo impetus hic sacrae semina mentis habet sententiae illus ex ovid see cumberland on the defects of heathen deism p     the necessity of supernatural impulse to the regulation of human conduct has always been acknowleged tully says somewhere nemo unquam vir magnus sine divino afflatu fuit and homer affirms by the mouth of polydamas that god is the dispenser of all our talents or endowments whatsoever   etc etc il lib xiii v   0 et seq correspondently with all this philosophers have represented the difficulty of persevering in a virtuous course under the very same metaphor which is used by our blessed savior himself cebes affirms that there is a little gate  see whitby on matt      at the entrance of the path that leads to happiness etc and that it is a path which few walk in in which   when we consider these sentiments and principles independently and separately from whatever is erroneous inconsistent or extravagant in heathen authors we can do no less than reverence them as doing credit to human nature in its most depraved state as so many efforts of reason nobly struggling to emerge from a vast abyss of ignorance and impurity the grand use and advantage of the gospel regarded as a moral scheme is not so much that things are uniformly taught therein and delivered in consummate purity as that they are taught with proper authority by a legislator see lockes reasonab of christian p     from heaven and under sanctions the most efficacious imaginable in short the christian religion stands particularly discriminated from all other institutions by the personal preeminence of its author and by the transcendent graciousness importance and splendour of the dispensation  if we regard our savior under any character inferior to that of the true god at least if we regard him merely as a man or as a lawgiver we shall find few or no marks of that originality by which the founders of all persuasions religious or philosophical are distinguished as a prophet he was like unto moses according to the express prediction of the latter as a worker of miracles he stood supereminent but not single as a teacher or instructor he followed precedents his apologues and allegories were agreeable to the oriental mode and many of his parables were borrowed from the jews see whitby on matt   v       v  0 even that excellent form of prayer which he taught his disciples was almost entirely taken out of the jewish liturgies and the sacraments which he ordained in his church were graffed upon a jewish stock baptism being a rite which the jews observed with the exactness of superstition and that of the lords supper being transferred from their practice of eating bread and drinking wine in an eucharistical way at the celebration of the passover see patricks disc on baptism p   allixs reflect v   p     potters chapter government the great apostle to the hebrews seems to set the matter before us in the clearest light he says he that despised mosess law died without mercy under two or three witnesses of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy  not who has broken the law of the gospel but who has trodden under foot the son of god and has accounted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and has done despite to the spirit of grace heb x    immoralities it is true and those of the grossest kind are implied in these words but they are such as are most provokingly aggravated by singular contemptuousness and the least that can be inferred from this passage is that a greater than moses is here how does socinianism shrink before such considerations as these  but it is little material which of two errors may be most plausible when both are equidistant from the center of truth our blessed savior is no more halfgod than he is all man if i have leave so to express myself nor will arianism fix a firmer basis of faith by its chimerical expedient of a secondary worship and a gradation of deity for this at best will be found to be neither more nor less than paganism improved and contracted within a smaller circle it must be equally idolatrous equally injurious to the honor of the supreme being to acknowledge gods many or gods few or only one god besides him infinite almost as the number of subaltern deities was among the heathens there is no doubt but the wisest of them at least acted nearly upon arian principles viz under a persuasion of the existence and properties and with a reservation of the prerogatives of the one supreme god according to universal tradition the notion of a supreme power a selfexistent independent being a first cause of all things prevailed more or less every where in the world see shuckfords sac and prof hist connec vol   b   the doctrine of divine supremacy was no secret even among people whose religious rites and usages were silly and extravagant enough to render them obnoxious to the scorn and laughter of mankind through all ages the superstitions of the egyptians were gross and numberless and their worship of the meanest animals and indeed of things inanimate was beyond measure contemptible and yet they had an opinion with respect to god that erred even on the side of spirituality for they held that he is not to be addressed by mortals so much as in vocal prayer see parker on idolatry p    this is at once an instance of strong belief and mistaken veneration the great attributes of the deity are asserted by writers of all sorts by philosophers and by poets and in terms of the fullest significancy his spirituality omnipotence omnipresence independence invisibility and incomprehensible nature are set in a very strong light by pagan authors particularly by pythagoras plato anaxagoras cicero porphyry seneca homer and the greek dramatists x i have not time or occasion to produce my authorities here the truth is many goodly pearls of speculative doctrine are to be found amongst the rubbish of pagan antiquity and they strikingly contrast an enormous farrago of traditionary error radical prejudice vulgar folly and popular superstition they are the sentiments of minds that seem to have been enlightened beyond the conceptions of the bulk of mankind if we separate the carnal dross from the spiritual bullion of heathenism we shall be able to extract a body of theoretic divinity from the old pagans little if at all inferior to the finest unitarian system in short if arianism be not strictly polytheism it is not much better it is maintainable only on much the same ground and by a similar mode of reasoning  surely a tully or a plato had as admissible an apology for his conformity to idolatrous services in general prepossession and national establishment as the modern unbeliever has for his secondary worship in any distiction he may affect to make between pagan and arian theology for unless the holy scriptures direct us in the plainest manner and with all possible cautiousness of expression not to honor the son even as we honor the father if they do not clearly and uniformly distinguish between jesus christ and the holy ghost and the supreme god in point of nature or essence or in other words if arianism has not a most firm foundation in the sacred pages and in apostolical and primitive worship we cannot honestly resolve it into any thing but the pride of human reason fabricating its own theory and resisting the holy ghost now the invalidity of its pretenses has i persuade myself been sufficiently shown already and therefore we are to reject its hypothesis together with that of socinianism as respectively aiming to establish another doctrine than that we have received as fundamentally erroneous and absolutely repugnant to the genius and spirit of christianity  but because the strength of true believers may be said in some sense to be made perfect in the weakness of their antagonists as a giant appears to most advantage when confronted with a pigmy i shall take my next opportunity for your conviction that the antitrinitarian cause has its chief support in disingenuous evasion flimsy sophistry or wilful misconstruction and neither is nor can be defended from the strong holds of reason or by weapons from the armory of sacred writ  discourse vi gal chap   part of verse   there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ the apostle as appears from the argument he prosecutes throughout this epistle had in the words just read an eye to those jewish converts who were so zealously attached to the mosaic ritual the law of their fathers that they could not endure to see it superseded by the more liberal the more pure the more sublime principles of the gospel but i shall avail myself of the latitude my text admits not hesitating to regard as perverters of the gospel those heretics of different sorts whose unfairness or imbecility of allegation construction and exception on the part of infidelity i stand engaged to make appear in the following discourse  that pride or prepossession should be tenacious of any opinion however strange or however extravagant will be no matter of surprise to us when we recollect that almost every thing which we see not by immediate intuition or which is not capable of a strictly mathematical demonstration may be started and upheld for a subject of dispute it is possible indeed and it sometimes happens that men shall reason injudiciously and inconclusively even in a righteous cause and truth may suffer or rather be supposed to suffer by precipitance of passion or inadvertency of zeal this before now has been the case with the cause before us a pious wish to confirm the doctrine of the trinity by producing multifarious evidence and heaping proof upon proof y or an earnest endeavor to elucidate a point the knowledge of which is too wonderful and excellent for the attainment of human wisdom by metaphysical nicety and the sagacity of abstract speculation z or by studied similitudes and artificial allusions to bring it nearer to our conceptions all this has been hurtful to the interest of religion and given occasion to the enemy to ridicule if not to blaspheme erroneous constructions and misapplication of particular passages betray too often a want of moderation or of skill in interpreters but all this while a charge of unskilfulness or of prevarication or of perverseness or of presumption or of insincerity or of intemperance will come with a very ill grace from our adversaries and we are to look on the side of infidelity for the most visible signs of weakness and the surest tokens of conscious distress i am apt to believe you will soon be convinced by a few select particulars that this is not arbitarily or groundlessly said  i shall hardly be called upon to apologize for freedoms i shall be obliged to take with authors who are no more it will be acknowleged with respect to every arian etc of note that to mischievous purpose he being dead yet speaks to proceed then  that when we are baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost we are baptized in the name of three persons and of three divine persons and of three equally divine persons see lightfoots harm of the n test sect    p     seems not to be more evident from scripture than from the reason of the thing for else we are baptized in the name of two persons and one virtue or quality etc which is a notion palpably ridiculous or we are baptized in the name of three persons betwixt the first and two latter of which there is an infinite disparity there being no medium between god and a creature which is a supposition not less ridiculous and in fact the baptismal form is so strong that heretics have found themselves under a necessity of changing it or of explaining it away some baptizing into the death of christ some in the name of the uncreated god and in the name of the created son and in the name of the sanctifying spirit created by the created son dr clarke to whom arianism is under great obligations writes as follows we are baptized says he into the profession of that belief and an obligation to the practice of that religion which god the father has revealed and taught by the son and confirmed and established by the holy ghost if this is extrication what is difficulty see a late work entitled an elucidation of the unity etc p    where this form is treated with equal freedom   the same learned author paraphrases the introduction to st johns gospel in the following words with god the father the first the supreme cause and original of all things there existed before all ages that divine person whose name is called the word of god the only begotten of the father the brightness of his glory and by ineffable communication of divine power and perfections the express image of his person the fine artifice of this paraphrase will escape a common or a cursory reader i guess dr c  would never have consented to the least alteration in this passage or have permitted us only for ineffable to read eternal the phrase  before all ages  is designedly ambiguous and imports merely an acknowlegement of the impossibility of fixing the date of the generation of the son of god  in the beginning was the word john i   says st john i e if we will hearken to the socinians jesus christ existed when the gospel was first preached by john the baptist or if you please by himself the word was with god i e was known to god and to god only or was with god by being taken up into heaven to receive his prophetic commission agreeably to a parallel exposition of another passage which will be presently noticed and both by the same interpreters the word was god viz in a secondary or derivative sense in a sense implying christs priority and superiority to all other creatures so that if we take this whole sentence together the word was with god and the word was god the term god is to be understood in the proper sense in the first clause and in an improper and inferior sense in the second as dr c and others according to a judicious writers remark ingeniously expound this passage  no man has ascended into heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man who is in heaven john iii    are the words of our lord himself in the same gospel perhaps the socinian construction of this text which was just now laid before you is little less romantic than grotiuss exposition of the words  he that came down from heaven i e says this famous commentator he that was sent or given to us by the special grace of god  as some interpreters make or more properly invent a distinction between primary and secondary worship and would fain have us believe in a created creator or a deity by delegation so others of a very different stamp think of the savior of the world as meanly as they can possibly think and divest him of almost every ray of glory the word was made flesh and dwelt among us says st john john i    christ was born mortal subject to infirmities and sufferings etc say some socinian expositors the word was flesh simply and absolutely say others the word was made or converted into flesh says the flandrian anabaptist  st paul assures the colossians that in jesus christ dwells all the fullness col ii   of the godhead bodily viz all the will of god as we are given to understand by socinus before abraham was i am john viii    says our lord expressly to the jews by which he means only to affirm according to some interpreters that he was the messiah before abraham was the father of many nations or as others expound shall i say or wrest this scripture that he existed or was before abraham in the purpose and decree of god how far the name of grotius dignifies this exposition let every intelligent hearer judge or let us see whether we are like to derive more satisfaction from the following explanation or rather evacuation of this text by the celebrated author of the scripture doctrine of the trinity before abraham was and before all generations i had a being with him of whom moses told the isralites that his name was i am  that often justly cited passage in the  th chapter of the epistle to the romans of whom as concerning the flesh christ came who is over all god blessed for ever is a rankling thorn in the eyes of unbelievers which dr c wished to extract with the poultice of a devised ambiguity he would have us believe that the original greek is of a doubtful construction and may signify either of whom christ came god who is over all be blessed for ever or of whom christ came who is over all god be blessed for ever to this text we shall have occasion to turn again  the arians in general confess that the divine personage who so often and sometimes so magnificently makes his appearance under the old testament is jesus christ the son of god yet when this transcendent being expressly says  i am the god of bethel  we are to understand him as in effect saying only my father whom i represent is god of bethel such is the sense of these expositors who however kindly and logically grant that the word was with god or in plain terms existed from all eternity though not actually yet potentially one is tempted to speak ludicrously by the extravagance of these conceits is not this making the word of god of none effect through wantonness of interpretation is not this turning holy scripture which should be the rule of faith into a mere plaything of fancy  let us take a view of another famous writers sentiments on this important subject  mr whiston after acknowleging jesus christ whom he calls  to have given the law upon mount sinai to have appeared to the patriarchs etc and to have taken the peculiar style titles attributes adoration and incommunicable name of the god of israel supposes him to have been truly and really concerned in the creation of the world but observe he was a creator merely by commission etc it being according to this author unfit and impossible for the divine nature itself or at least that of the father to be so much and in such a manner concerned with the corporeal world and the sinful race of mankind as we every where find this divine person our blessed mediator to have been whistons solution etc p     and so we are obliged to this philosopher for his wonderful discovery that jesus christ though a divine person with all the attributes etc and the incommunicable name of the god of israel was yet without the divine nature because it is impossible for the divine nature to act in the abstract or at least for that of the father to do so which it seems is something distinct from or superior to the divine if this is not christianity it is tolerable platonism  but the grand expedient to which a latementioned divine and indeed the arian fraternity have usually recourse is yet behind unable to with stand the united force of the several texts by which the full divinity of our savior is evinced they contrive to resolve the whole of his deity into that absolute authority which they say he derives from his father and exercises jointly with him in the government of the universe dr clarke not unartfully tells us that the reason why the scripture though it styles the father god and also styles the son god yet at the same time always declares that there is but one god is because in the monarchy of the universe there is but one authority original in the father derivative in the son the power of the son being not another power opposite to that of the father nor another power coordinate to that of the father but itself the power and authority of the father communicated to manifested in and exercised by the son scrip doc of the trin prop    see stephenss sermon on the eternal generation etc   but did not or would not this able writer recollect that something besides power was communicated when the father gave to the son to have life in himself john   v    from which passage i take occasion to observe that when an ambiguous word occurs in any passage of scripture or a term which independently considered appears to denote communication from the father and inferiority in the son its signification is generally qualified and restrained by the plain tenor and importance of the whole sentence this is eminently the case with the text last quoted as the father has life himself says our blessed lord so has he given to the son to have life in himself in this phrase  having life in himself which is a periphrasis of jehovah the first and most essential name of the deity the selfexistence both of father and son from all eternity is necessarily implied because though the word given imports communication of an incomprehensible kind yet such communication must have been from eternity to assert that the father gave selfexistence to the son from all eternity at any supposed period of time would be neither more nor less than a contradiction in terms see this text miserably distorted in lockes reasonab of christian p    it may be worth while to adduce two or three instances more by him viz by jesus christ says st paul to the colossians were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible etc all things were created by him and for him chapter      does not all this imply unoriginateness is not christ represented here as absolutely the creator yet in this very chapter reference is had to the gospel dispensation and in that reference terms must necessarily be used importing subordination and inferiority so in the  st chap of the revelation where christ is styled alpha and omega the beginning and the ending etc the same reference is made i am he that lives and was dead so again the word was with god says st john and this expression does not necessarily imply equality or coexistence but what follows  the word was god  we not unfrequently meet with interpreters who agree in opposition to the catholic sense of a passage but differ in the mode of it who like contrary qualities in bodies counteracting each other mutually defeat their respective ends by repugnancy of construction we will turn to one or two singular instances of this  by whom also heb     he made the worlds says the apostle to the hebrews speaking of jesus christ one should hardly think these words liable to be misunderstood but grotius unwilling as it should seem that jesus christ should be supposed to have any concern in the creation even as an agent or minister gives us to know that the worlds were made not by him but for him or for his sake agreeably enough to part of a text just now cited and agreably to the notion of the jewish rabbis that the world was made for the messiah now in the first place not to insist with dr whitby that this construction manifestly wrests the preposition  with a genitive case annexed to it from its proper import i wish to observe that there is no admitting this learned writers exposition of the place before us and of that other passage of the epistle to the romans christ was raised from the dead romans     by the glory of the father the single one with which he supports his interpretation without obscuring or confounding our ideas of the divine operations for according to our author god the father made the worlds for the glory of his son but raised up that son from the dead for his own glory  christ was raised from the dead for the glory of the father says our commentator so that by this interpretation the apostle in effect affirms that christ was raised from the dead by the father for the glory of the father which at best is uncouth phraseology but let us see how the passage will fare under the management of socinus and his followers these gentlemen are sensible of the powers of the preposition in question but are equally reluctant to believe jesus christ to have been the maker of the universe  by whom he made the worlds i e say they by whose agency or ministry god established a spiritual kingdom and reconciled the world unto himself by the gospel dispensation are not these several expositions as irreconcilable as light and darkness and have we not reason in abundance rather to reject both than to subscribe to either i just observe farther that grotius had been more consistent had he done no violence to the preposition aforesaid and adopted the socinian interpretation for he is entirely of one mind with the socinians in his explication of the above cited parallel in the first chapter of the epistle to the colossians  but this is not the only instance of this great writers inconsistency with others and with himself convinced by ocular demonstration of the resurrection of his master thomas answered and said that is say some very gravely in effect cried out or exclaimed my lord and my god for it seems this is not the language of confession but of astonishment grotius however sees this matter in a very different light hic primum says he ea vox in narratione evangelica reperitur ab apostolis jesu tributa postquam scilicet sua resurrectione probaverat se esse a quo vita et quidem aeterna expectari deberet mansit deinde ille mos in ecclesia ut apparet non tantum in scriptis apostolicis ut in nono capite epistolae ad romanos commate quinto et veterum christianorum ut videre est apud justinum martyrem contra tryphonem sed et in plinii ad trajanum epistola ubi ait christianos christo ut deo carmina cecinisse see grotius in loc   and yet we are not much obliged to this eminent commentator for an acknowlegement which appears to have been forced from him in the first place it is not true that christ is styled god purely because he is the resurrection and the life as is here more than intimated it is not true that he is so called by the apostles and first christians merely on the strength of the passage before us for though the terms in which st thomas declares his conviction my lord and my god occur not before nor possibly could christ is not only in effect in many places but also expressly styled god in this gospel in the next place it is worth remarking that this author in some sort at least asserts the divinity of christ from a text of which when he takes it separately in hand he questions the authenticity see grotius on romans ix     the truth is we find too many among us perpetually leaning to the side of infidelity by softening and qualifying as much as possible the sense of texts which are quoted every day on the part of the orthodox an eminent commentator supposes the first prayer of the apostles thou lord who know the hearts of all men show whether of these two thou have chosen to be addressed not to jesus christ but simply to god whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved says st peter in his discourse on the day of pentecost i e says dr pyle whosoever shall believe and embrace his religion which paraphrase plainly reprobates the idea of invocation on christ the reference of the words he is lord of all in st peters address to cornelius either to god the father or to jesus christ is at best perversely singular and surely neither just nor natural to this end says st paul to the romans christ both died and rose etc that he might be lord both of the dead and living romans xiv   i e according to our authors inadequate illustration that he might be the savior and rewarder of all good christians st paul wishes grace and peace to the church at corinth etc to them that are called to be saints   cor i   with all that in every place call upon the name of jesus christ our lord etc viz as the same writer interprets the passage to all who worship god through jesus christ the lord and savior of all that profess his religion in the second chapter of this epistle the apostle calls our savior the lord of glory meaning it seems thereby simply the messiah god was manifest in the flesh says the same apostle to timothy which being interpreted by this writer is only equivalent to the son of god took upon him our nature in short our authors notion of the whole mystery of the gospel seems to be lamentably insufficient when he tells and in more places than one tells us that it signifies only the admission of gentiles as well as jews into the christian covenant  but a very recent instance of perverse interpretation in the work of a sensible and specious author mr tailor see his key to the apostolical writings out of our church is fit to be taken into particular consideration in his note on that famous passage in the epistle to the romans which the antitrinitarians are ever attempting to press into the service of arianism as has already been in effect seen viz of whom as concerning the flesh christ came who is over all god blessed for ever this author admits the justness of the application to our blessed lord who says he is god over all as he is by the father appointed lord king and governor of all and then he refers to several texts as declarative of such appointment  the father judges no man but has committed all judgment unto the son john v    jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god etc john xiii    all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth matt xxviii     the word which god sent unto the children of israel preaching peace by jesus christ he is lord of all etc acts x     god also has highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name phil ii   and set him at is own right hand in the heavenly places far above all principality and power etc and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come etc ephesians i    etc he has put all things under his feet etc   cor xv    this says our author is our lords supreme godhead and that he is blessed for ever or the object of everlasting blessing is evident from revelation v       worthy is the lamb etc to receive blessing etc and every creature etc heard i saying blessing and honor etc be unto him that sits upon the throne and to the lamb for ever etc now it is very observable that in some of the places here referred to there is not any intimation of an appointment the annotator seems to be aware of this when it is too late he grows jealous of the passage he had admitted and like one conscious of having allowed more than his hypothesis could conveniently afford to all intents and purposes revokes his grant by a counter construction and so at one dash deprives our lord both of his blessedness and supremacy for thus he proceeds but what this part of his character in which he is more nearly related to believing gentiles than to infidel jews has to do with privileges belonging to the latter does not seem to me very clear much less can i conceive why the apostle in this particular enumeration of jewish privileges should not mention their relation to god as their god in which they particularly gloried chapter ii    and which was indeed the glory of all their glories being the first and grand article in the covenant with abraham and which he fails not to assert among the singular privileges of christians chapter v    when he is showing that the subjects of their glorying were not inferior to those of the jews how could he overlook the main article of this list or what if there should be a transposition of a single letter in the text  for  this will remove every difficulty then the english will be of whom as concerning the flesh christ came whose is the god over all blessed for ever thus the grand privilege will be inserted to advantage and stand at the top of a lofty climax rising from the father to christ and to god we have indeed no copy to justify this reading but the aforesaid considerations seem to make it probable the article  might be very easily transposed this is only my conjecture  now i beg leave to ask whether our annotator was under an absolute necessity of conjecturing conjectures i presume are never admissible in criticism but when they clear the sense of an author from obscurity or when direct absurdities or considerable difficulties are removed by them is either of these cases the case at present so far from it that unless we are to sacrifice sense to figure and real truth to ideal climax i affirm without ceremony the old and universal reading to be the only right one and that this passage abundantly plain and consistent in itself is here obscured by elucidation and marred by amendment mr t in fact smothers himself in a dust of his own raising for though in a spirit of true compassion and in the tenderest affection to his brethren etc the apostle calls to mind their national character and many of the privileges they had enjoyed yet at the time of his writing this epistle it should be remembered that their grand privilege of all as our author justly terms it that which the jews constantly made their boast of and which was indeed the glory of all their glories was absolutely lost and irrecoverably done away for ever god was no longer their god in any sense favorable to them they were disowned they were cut off by him to use st pauls words in another place the believing gentiles were now more nearly related to him they were purified to be a peculiar people and jews as jews had no manner of interest in the new dispensation so that according to this authors construction the apostle falsifies fact and insults his kinsmen by way of commiseration  there is another text which the same author handles not less to his own disadvantage every house is builded by some man says the writer of the epistle to the hebrews chapter iii   but he that built all things is god mr ts paraphrase is as follows when he says every house is builded by some person but he who built all things is god he evidently distinguishes between a subordinate and supreme builder but this distinction he needed not to have mentioned had he not spoke of a subordinate builder before for if in the case under consideration there be no subordinate builder at all this distinction is nothing to his purpose then his argument would have been christ must build the house because no one could build it but he seeing no house is built by any but god whereas contrariwise he asserts a subordinate builder and tells us such a one is consistent with gods being the supreme original builder  now i take it this is a mere fanciful distinction of mr taylors own brain the context runs thus this man was counted worthy of more glory than moses inasmuch as he who has builded the house has more honor than the house for every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is god surely he that built all things he who made the world was the very person or being that built the house as the apostle expresses it i e who founded the whole jewish economy ecclesiastical and civil and consequently though every house is builded by some man though every institution etc has some author and moses in particular may be said to be a founder in a secondary sense jesus christ is strictly and properly the supreme architect as we may say as well in the one as the other of the above instances to the total exclusion of every idea of subordination and so this very passage in effect plainly asserts our saviors divinity and confirms the supremacy this gentleman appears to be extremely forward to destroy by it it is remarkable enough that the texts under consideration have been before now a snare to unbelievers for the socinian gloss on them is that christ is as much more excellent than moses as god is more excellent than his own people and this superexcellence is on all hands allowed not to come one jot short of absolute infinity  in consequence of the shifts to which infidelity is reduced it will add omit affirm and suggest sometimes arbitrarily sometimes imprudently and sometimes on weak and incompetent authority that passage in st pauls first epistle to timothy without controversy great is the mystery of godliness   timothy iii    god was manifest in the flesh etc makes so clearly for us that the socinians and they who patronise them struggle to get rid of it at all events and that they do so purely by the help of a supposititious reading which can be supported only by a strained incoherent and ridiculous construction according to which the mystery of godliness was manifest in the flesh and received up into glory etc instead of jesus christ has been abundantly shown by many and especially by the learned bishop pearson in his exposition of the creed  with a view to the elusion of certain passages in the revelation which we have already produced as plainly expressive of the sons coequal majesty with the father grotius has most unwarrantably assigned them their proper and respective thrones in heaven he that sat on the throne etc in primo solio id est deus says he in his paraphrase of rev xxi    supposing for arguments sake the merit of the trinitarian controversy to depend chiefly on the authenticity of the seventh verse in st johns  st epistle there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one see mr jones on this verse i would gladly ask whether it is not in the nature of things at least as reasonable to suppose in general that this text was omitted by the enemies of the doctrine of the trinity as that it was inserted by its friends and if so infidelity would appear at best to stand upon a precarious foundation as far as it depends on the spuriousness of this text and we should surely err with more prudence and modesty on the side of the catholic church than against her but an excellent writer mr travis has in his letters to mr gibbon on this subject evinced the genuineness of this text to the entire satisfaction of every candid and impartial inquirer and particularly makes it appear that the context of the apostle is so far from receiving any injury by the retention of the verse in question that it would lose all its genuine spirit would become unapt and feeble in its application and therefore could hardly be said to subsist without it to this performance i refer you with pleasure  it has been urged and with an air of confidence that jesus christ cannot be an object of divine worship because in that excellent form of address to the deity which he recommended to his disciples there is not the least mention made of himself nor the most distant allusion to his office and character a circumstance which has been considered as decisive in favor of unitarianism some persons have as little of knowledge as they have of faith in these matters at the time of his dictating this mode of prayer our blessed lord was not properly speaking either the mediator between god and man or a sacrifice for the sins of the whole world though therefore this form of devotion is used at this day with the greatest propriety imaginable yet it was originally delivered to the disciples for their own more immediate use as is manifest from the nature of the thing and from st lukes account of this matter it came to pass says that evangelist that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him lord teach us to pray as john also taught his disciples luke xi   and he said unto them when ye pray say our father etc it was not till after his ascension and return to his father that they could properly pray to or through him that they were to ask in his name and to receive it was not till after he had offered one sacrifice for sin heb x    vii    and sat down at the right hand of god that his mediatorial character commenced in which he ever lives to make intercession for us  there are two remarkable passages in st pauls epistles which as they are claimed by our adversaries with more appearance of right than the foregoing it will be proper to take into consideration who i e jesus christ being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation etc phil ii   etc this text is often quoted as asserting the true divinity of our savior i am therefore concerned to deliver it from the construction which the arians with much assurance put upon it and which many amongst ourselves have i think very unwarily admitted subjecting themselves thereby to the necessity of having recourse to a hackneyed and after all mere verbal distinction between selfexistence and necessary existence in order to reconcile their admission with orthodox principles thought it not robbery etc  i e says novatian and many with him he never compared himself with god the father nunquam se deo patri aut comparavit aut contulit the reason follows memor se esse ex suo patre every arian will abide by this explication and how do the advocates for novatian get clear of the imputed consequences why says dr waterland this interpretation of the text supposing it just implies no more than this that jesus christ never pretended to an equality with the father in respect of his original knowing himself to be second only in order not the first person of the everblessed trinity dr w observes that the whole passage in novatian rightly understood affords a strong proof of the coequality of the two persons and that it is quoted accordingly by dr whitby in his treatise de vera christi deitate but as this can only be done by help of the above distinction i must ask why novatians sense of this text must be admitted as the true one he did not affect say some did not claim did not take upon him etc to be honored as god notwithstanding the great authorities of grotius tillotson and clarke etc see mr parkhursts note at p    of his treatise on the divinity and preexistence of our savior with which this interpretation is fortified i cannot help thinking the reading in use thought it not robbery to be equal with god not barely to be the more eligible but indeed the proper reading for not to insist on one circumstance in its favor which is the nonagreement of the several interpretations of the learned gentlemen abovementioned it deserves to be noted that though the phrase  would admit the construction contended for yet the context will be found absolutely to revolt against it granting the phrase being in the form of god to be in itself of undeterminate signification yet when predicated of him who is one with the father who was in the beginning with god and really and truly was god it certainly is to be regarded as synonymous with those expressions and consequently as importing an entire equality with god but herewith the construction of novation and of the arians not to say of dr w himself is totally incompatible the reading in use therefore must be allowed to be not only natural but necessary he thought it not robbery i e to be no violation of right or justice  the other passage is the following there is one body says the apostle to the ephesians and one spirit one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all chap iv   etc the socinian and the arian inference from these texts is obvious but in proof that it is an unfair one i would remark that had st paul intended here to have distinguished the father from the son and the spirit by this ascription of supremacy he would certainly have named the two latter with their severally discriminating inferior titles and this without a needless and i might say impertinent combination of unities if i may so call them besides had this been the apostles design how comes it to pass that supremacy is in almost the same terms ascribed in the new testament to jesus christ whose throne is for ever and ever who is lord of all who is over all god blessed for ever or how are we to account for its being so frequently said that both christ and the spirit as well as the father is in us if the manifest attribution of supremacy in the texts just now cited does not exclude the father why must it be understood in the place under consideration to exclude the son the same question may be asked with the same propriety and with the same success with regard to the following wellknown passages in the first epistle to tim which i believe the antitrinitarians in general set with much assurance at the head of their authorities  now unto the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise god be honor and glory for ever and ever   timothy i    vi    etc who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and lord of lords who only has immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man has seen or can see to whom be honor and power everlasting surely all this is briefly but fully comprehended in the above descriptions of jesus christ to whom by the way independently on the father st peter ascribes glory both now and for ever we shall now be able to despatch with no difficulty certain passages which at first sight have an humiliating tendency and seem to import the inferiority of the son to the father and the impersonality of the holy ghost it may be of use to expose pretenses  with respect to his human character or his legation christ is confessedly gods and the head of christ is god and says he my father is greater than i we have already seen that the absolute godhead of jesus christ though it had been on certain occasions not barely intimated but in plain terms asserted by him was not uniformly manifested to his disciples during his residence upon earth it was a truth which he was in due time fully to authenticate to them but which at present for obvious reasons they could not bear see parkhursts divin etc of christ p  0  etc     etc accordingly as in many other places so in the words last quoted which were calculated to sooth them under the loss they were about to sustain by his going away my father is greater than i the blessed jesus with particular propriety alludes to the commission he had undertaken and adapts himself to their imperfect and unsettled conceptions see disc   and   see john xiv    xv    on pretty much the same ground he had at another time declared to the ruler who addressed him under the character of good master see luke xviii    that there is none good but one that is god the full manifestation of the great mystery of the gospel was reserved for the day of pentecost before which consideration a thousand difficulties will crumble into atoms and by which an answer is given in full to the substance of what dr priestly has advanced in the first sect of the introd to his history of early opinions with respect to the silence of the old testament and the incompetency of a great part of the new  this is life eternal says our blessed lord that they may know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou have sent john xvii   our lord speaking here in his human capacity and with reference to his mission very naturally avows his father to be the only true god in contradistinction to all false gods but cannot be supposed to exclude himself and the holy ghost who are partakers of one essence with the true  so again who is the first born of every creature and the beginning of the creation of god col i    rev iii    as to the latter of these expressions it implies no more according to some interpretations than the father of the christian church etc or if the original word had been rendered the cause or the origin instead of the beginning as with very sufficient warrant it might have been this text is so far from affirming christ to be a creature that in effect it avers him to be the creator or if it be precisely equivalent to the former expression it will in course be reducible to the same signification now literally and in his human character jesus christ was not the firstborn of every creature and in his divine character he was not born or begotten at all except in a transcendent and incomprehensible sense but he was and is styled in a few verses below the firstborn from the dead and in his own resurrection ascertained ours etc and in this just sense he is the firstborn of every creature the beginning of the creation of god or of the new creation and constitution of things not only without disparagement to his divine nature but in direct confirmation of it  so again of that day and hour knows no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father mark xiii    in our saviors human capacity or in his mediatorial character the final and general judgment was a matter that did not concern him but in his divine character he cannot but know the time of his own visitations  so again go to my brethren and say unto them i ascend unto my father and your father and to my god and your god john xx    these words contain a proper and natural commission given to mary magdalen by our blessed lord in consequence of his resurrection and agreeably to what he had spoken unto his disciples when he was yet in galilee luke xxiv   it was his intention to signify by her the speedy accomplishment of what he had frequently foretold and promised them under the character of the messiah but it was neither necessary nor expedient to discover to her singly the fullness of his godhead  so once more when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him that god may be all in all   co xv    in other words when the great scheme of mans redemption shall be completed christ shall resign his commission into his hands from whom he received it and his mediatorial kingdom be succeeded by the eternal kingdom of god the father son and holy ghost with whom the saints and spirits of just men made perfect shall live in fullness of bliss and glory this is the obvious and indeed necessary construction for if we attend to the letter of this passage and not to the spirit and scope of it when all things shall be subdued etc then shall the son be subject etc we shall assert that jesus christ will be subject to the father after the consummation of all things but was not so before or that he was greater in his human character than in his divine which is absurd he must reign says the apostle just before till he has put all things under his feet now it is not literally true that he shall reign so long and no longer than this as the words import for though his reign over the church militant shall cease of his reign over the church triumphant there shall be no end the truth is with the evangelical plan with the commission of jesus christ the idea of subordination or subjection is connected but with regard to absolute perfection of essence and attribute the complement of the godhead the trinity in unity ever was and for ever will be all in all  lastly with respect to such expressions as the following which appear inconsistent with personality be filled with the spirit ephesians v    quench not the spirit   thessalonians v    the spirit which he has given us   john iii    receive ye the holy ghost john xx    etc it is obvious to remark that agreeably to a common figure the cause and its effects are promiscuously used and accordingly by the spirit in all these places and in all parallel ones we are to understand the gifts and graces of which the holy spirit or holy ghost is the dispenser if this interpretation be not admitted we may with equal propriety and justice call in question the personality of jesus christ in his human character and even that of god the father himself for if christ be in us the body is dead romans viii  0 and god is a consuming fire heb xii    god is love   john iv   and god is in you of a truth   cor xiv      on the whole then i may fairly conclude with remarking that for the most part in the arguments of socinians we may be said to have premises without conclusions and in those of arians conclusions without premises and that there is nothing in the feeble attempts the bold assertions or the perverse disputings of our adversaries i do not say to terrify but in any degree to discourage us from striving together for the faith of the gospel even that faith which stands not in the wisdom of men but in the power of god   cor ii     discourse vii   cor chapter    verse    if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead that important article of our creeds the resurrection of the body is the other great mystery which has all along been foolishness to infidels and a stumbling block to many christians under this article then i am to endeavor agreeably to my engagements to give all the satisfaction which the sensible the candid and the welldisposed can require  i might insist that the great doctrine before us is virtually at least contained in my text but as there is a strong propensity in human pride to consider what is propounded to our faith as insulting our understandings it will be necessary to enter into a full and even minute discussion of the subject  a late ingenious author dr sykes very confidently asserts that this doctrine has no manner of warrant from scriptural authority he observes as mr lock has done before him that there is not any such expression in the new testament as the resurrection of the flesh that the scriptures often speak of a resurrection and of the resurrection of the dead but as to the resurrection of the body or of the flesh there is not one word and therefore that such an article was required at first to be professed in order to baptism can never be proved see enquiry when the resurrection of the body was first inserted in the creeds sub init   i have already apologized for freedoms taken with the dead the names i just now mentioned are of the first authority with unbelievers at this day and i take a part in the controversy with a hope to conduct it to your content if not by recency of argument or reply at least by the mode of their enforcement  now that the above expressions or phrases  the resurrection of the body or the flesh never occur in the new testament that this article together with some others which dr s mentions did not make a part of the baptismal creed before the middle of the fourth century may without difficulty be admitted because if it will appear that the resurrection of the body or of the flesh is most unquestionably the doctrine of scripture and of the apostolical and primitive church we are bound by all means to retain it and its insertion into the creed at any time was both proper and necessary the original creed whatever it precisely was having been reasonably enlarged by dr ss own confession as circumstances demanded and heresies multiplied  let us enquire then whether the doctrine of the resurrection as it is delivered in our creeds be not founded in evidence rational scriptural and irresistible  if we consider this doctrine as a matter of opinion and not of faith we shall find it to have countenance in no contemptible authority though the heathens saw spiritual things in general through a dim glass indeed though the prospect of futurity was greatly clouded to a world almost wholly corrupt in principle and abandoned in practice yet the notion of another state and even of a resurrection or of a renovation of all things which is a resurrection in effect was far from being universally exploded as absolutely ridiculous or chimerical we are assured zoroustres taught the doctrine of the resurrection among the ancient persians as he himself derived it most probably from the jews with whom he had communications grotius who with respect to this article at least was not of doubtful mind in proof of the admissible possibility of the thing cites the authorities both of historians and philosophers and affirms it to have been the tenet of almost the whole sect of the stoics see grotius de vent l   and  0 le clercs notes prideaux connect v   p  0  etc the grecian custom of burying the dead with their faces upwards and looking toward the rising sun which is exactly the christian mode has a very strong smatch of this sentiment aa it is observable mahomet speaks in his koran of the resurrection as of a doctrine known and received in the world from the beginning and far antecedently to the mosaic dispensation this appears from the following passage that this i e the doctrine of the resurrection is no other than fables of the ancients is says he the pretense of unbelievers and indeed his learned translator remarks in his preliminary discourse that some of the pagan arabs believed neither a creation nor resurrection but that others believed both we are given to understand by a sensible writer that the first europeans who visited china found many christian truths intermingled with the trash of fable and tradition that the gentiles of indostan have confused notions of the trinity and in particular that the people of ceylon believe the resurrection of the body jenkinss reasonab etc v   p  0  p on the cr p       in his note at the   th verse of the   th chapter of isaiah  thy dead men shall live together with my dead body shall they arise etc the learned bp lowth observes that the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead must have been a popular and common doctrine among the jews at the time of the delivery of this prophecy and we may reasonably make the same inference from a parallel passage in daniel  many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake etc many as i find it noted by the judicious commentator being here and elsewhere manifestly equivalent to all  that the notion of a resurrection according to the common acceptance of the term prevailed among the jews in our saviors time will be soon manifest from certain occurrences and passages in the evangelical writings st paul in his apology before king agrippa affirms it to have its foundation in the hope of the promise made unto the fathers though when where or in what manner he mentions not and certain it is that the pharisees the straitest and most considerable sect among them not only entertained this notion with seriousness but contended for it with vehemence as appears from the violence of opposition between them and the sadducees who as strenuously denied it what then did both parties understand by it let us for a resolution of this question turn first to the account which the evangelists give us of a discourse held by the sadducees with our savior on the subject of the resurrection the same day says st matthew and much in the same words st mark and st luke after him came to him the sadducees who say that there is no resurrection and asked him saying master moses said if a man die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother now there were with us seven brethren and the first when he had married a wife deceased and having no issue left his wife to his brother likewise the second also and the third to the seventh and last of all the woman died also therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven for they all had her matt       etc the argument herein implied is indeed perfectly ridiculous and grossly carnal and is exposed accordingly by our blessed lord in his reply to it but it undeniably supposes the resurrection of the bodies of these same brethren and their wife agreably to the pharisaical hypothesis indeed that very reply plainly supposes the same thing ye do err not knowing the scriptures nor the power of god for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels of god in heaven all this is abundantly confirmed by our saviors own argument immediately following as touching the resurrection of the dead have you not read that which was spoken to you by god saying i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob god is not the god of the dead but of the living there is neither connection nor indeed sense in this portion of scripturehistory unless we suppose the reunion of the souls and bodies of abraham and isaac etc in the resurrection and that our savior meant by implication to assert it for his argument directly proves nothing more than the immortality of the soul and its consequential existence in a future state but had this proof been the sole object of his discourse he would most assuredly have expressed himself in a very different manner upon the occasion our lords meaning is yet more fully discovered by st lukes account of this matter now that the dead are raised says he according to that evangelist even moses showed at the bush saying etc  again when our lord told martha that her brother newly deceased should rise again she said unto him says the sacred text i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day john xi    now that martha believed her brother should rise again at the last day with that body which was laid in the grave and had been dead four days is evident enough from this consideration that though she appears to have been doubtful of the possibility of his resurrection at that time and in so extraordinary a way lord says she by this time he stinketh and this notwithstanding her avowed belief that whatsoever our savior would ask of god god would give it him and his declaration that he was himself the resurrection and the life yet when lazarus actually came forth neither she nor the many jews who were present showed the least sign of amazement it does not appear that they were in any degree astonished at this mode of his restoration to life and therefore we may justly presume they were persuaded that in the resurrection at the last day all men shall rise again with their bodies through the operation of that omnipotent power which in the twinkling of an eye is able to inspire life and vigor into dust and ashes and animate corruption itself  the supposed resurrection of john the baptist may be considered in the same point of view herod hearing of the fame of jesus said unto his servants as the evangelist acquaints us this is john the baptist he is risen from the dead and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him herod hardly thought these works were done by the spirit or apparition of the baptist and if not we must conclude that he believed him to be risen indeed according to the notions entertained by the jews the sacred history informs us the sadducees were grieved that the apostles preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead and is it not as plain as implication can make it that their doctrine was that the followers of jesus and indeed all men should be raised in like manner as he was  the truth is of this kind of implied evidence we have plenty in the sacred volume i will only produce one piece more of gospelhistory in presumptive proof that gentiles as well as jews understood by a resurrection what we do at this day st paul concludes his discourse to the athenians with insisting on the certainty of a future judgment from the assurance which god had given to all men of it by his having raised that man whom he had ordained to be their judge from the dead and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead says the historian some mocked but others said we will hear thee again of this matter acts xvii    now st pauls audience consisted chiefly of stoics and epicureans and the latter most undoubtedly were the party that derided the doctrine which the former did not conceive to be altogether extravagant or ridiculous but had the apostle meant only to inculcate the general doctrine of a future state the stoics in all probability would have been satisfied as to that point without a farther hearing and the epicureans would have no more mocked or insulted than if a stoic had preached it  indeed there is one circumstance in the evangelical history which at first glance may be thought to militate against what has been laid before you when our savior came down from the mountain after his transfiguration with peter james and john and charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen till the son of man were risen from the dead they kept that saying with themselves questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean mark ix  0 but that they could not possibly doubt what was to be understood by the expression or the thing itself is demonstrable from preceding considerations and therefore the case must have been this they were perplexed with the account our lord had given of himself they could not conceive how their master whom they still regarded as a temporal deliverer should suffer and be put to an ignominious death as he had assured them he should in the   st v of the last chapter or how the expected deliverance would be effected by or after such resurrection this was probably the subject of their enquiry they questioned one with another not what the but what his rising from the dead should mean all this is perfectly consistent with a parallel passage in st luke he took unto him the twelve and said unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished for he shall be delivered unto the gentiles and shall be mocked and spitefully entreated and spitted on and they shall scourge him and put him to death and the third day he shall rise again and they understood none of these things and this saying was hid from them neither knew they the things which were spoken luke xviii     what has already been advanced will obviate a common assertion or insinuation that there is a very material difference between the case of a body which has been dead a few days or months or even years and of one which has been buried in the earth many centuries since and that the same power which is able to effect a resurrection in the former case cannot be conceived adequate to the like operation in the latter and indeed it deserves to be remarked that to maintain or to intimate this is at best to make extremely free with omnipotence and in fact only begs a question instead of satisfying it besides this expedient will appear to be heavily encumbered with strange inconveniences to speak much less harshly of it than perhaps in justice i should when a finite understanding has laid the line which infinite power cannot pass it will have a fair claim to our attention although even were this done the number of instances we meet with in holy writ of the same identical bodys being raised from the grave or restored to life which had actually deceased will however justify our supposition that the bodies of such as shall die within a reasonable time before the last day shall be raised after this modus or manner and agreeably to the common and natural ideas of a resurrection it will be hard indeed if our adversaries will not allow us to take this for granted and if they will the same understanding which is able to measure infinity can readily inform us how or whether with a body or without one the bulk of mankind shall appear at the great day of final retribution  i come now to revelation more clear and explicit to plain intelligible scripture with respect to which it pains one to see so great a man as mr lock taking refuge in the above distinction and indeed in the most pitiful evasions observe then how this justly celebrated philosopher expresses himself in the passage following in the new testament wherein i think are contained all the articles of the christian faith i find our savior and his apostles to preach the resurrection from the dead and the resurrection of the dead in many places but i do not remember any place where the resurrection of the same body is so much as mentioned nay which is very remarkable in the case i do not remember in any place of the new testament where the general resurrection at the last day is spoken of any such expression as the resurrection of the body much less of the same body i say the general resurrection etc because where the resurrection of some particular persons presently upon our saviors resurrection is mentioned the words are the graves were opened and many bodies of saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many of which peculiar way of speaking of this resurrection the passage itself gives a reason in these words appeared to many i e those who slept appeared so as to be risen but this could not be known unless they brought with them the evidence that they were those who had been dead etc and it is probable they were such as were newly dead whose bodies were not yet dissolved etc see essay on the human underst and chapter on identity   there is i persuade myself little or nothing in this passage but has its answer in the foregoing considerations unless we should be kind enough to acknowledge for argument the triumphant sneer of that parenthesis wherein i think are contained all the articles of the christian faith it might therefore be sufficient to remark that mr l seems to admit mysteries as some people dispense alms viz grudgingly or of necessity and at the same time to express our obligations to him for his indulgent concession that bodies have been raised from the dead upon particular occasions but because this great writer may possibly be still thought by some to have hit upon an expedient which happily helps him out of embarassment in the stale distinction between a particular and the general resurrection let us see whether this distinction will not vanish before the ensuing argumentation  i venture to aver then that the resurrection of the body of jesus christ is an especial earnest or sure token of the resurrection of our bodies from the dead i desire your impartial judgment of the texts which follow now is christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept   cor xv  0 vi    god has both raised up the lord and will also raise up us by his own power if we have been romans vi   planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection he who raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus   cor iv    as the father raises up the dead and quickens them even so the son quickens whom he will john v    these texts will be sufficient for my present purpose let us consider them separately a little now is christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept i need not enlarge upon the jewish practice alluded to under this figurative expression and shall only observe that as the first fruits were offerings of that identical grain of which the harvest was to follow the resurrection of our bodies after that of christ could not have been signified by a finer emblem god has both raised up the lord and will also raise up us by his own power i e most undoubtedly he will raise up us in like manner if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection the former part of this verse has some obscurity in it which may be liable to various construction but the latter ascertains almost as fully as words can do the great article before us he who raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus this text is exactly parallel with that just quoted from the other epistle to the corinthians as the father raises up the dead and quickens them even so the son quickens whom he will this proof runs rather in another line but however will terminate in the same point for we may safely conclude that the son will raise the dead and quicken them hereafter in the same manner in which himself and many dead persons have been already raised we have by this time i hope sufficient grounds for this conclusion and indeed st paul assures us that the lord jesus christ shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body phil iii    for how or when shall he do this if not in the general resurrection at the last day and by a change of that body which was deposited in the ground our vile body is not to be changed for another body but is itself to be fashioned like unto christs glorious body would it not be prima facie ridiculous to attempt torturing the passage to any other sense  though what has been here offered can i think scarcely fall short of bringing conviction to a mind open to it yet it will be greatly corroborated by other passages and particulars and especially by the doctrine contained in the fifteenth chapter of the first epistle to the corinthians which is almost totally spent upon this subject in truth there are more reasons than one for our not passing by that chapter if we read this portion of scripture with due attention and impartiality we shall be led i presume to this unavoidable conclusion that the bodies of all men shall be raised if not absolutely totally or numerically yet really and truly the same as they died or in other words that the bodies which shall be raised shall with their respective souls constitute the same persons that lived before in the world nor can this doctrine be invalidated by metaphysical subtilties and oppositions of science falsely so called which are much less calculated to satisfy than to perplex and confound us if the import of such passages as the following it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory v    etc    etc it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality if the manifest import of these texts can be evaded so may the most studied paraphrase or the most careful illustration of them there will be no such thing as intelligible language to be found the case is the human body undergoes many changes in a course of years e g from infancy to old age which i suppose it will be granted are the changes of the same body properly speaking still for though it may not be easy to say precisely in what the ratio of identity consists we may safely say than an almost infinite number of changes and modifications which might be supposed do not affect it there are very few names which have a stronger claim to deference than that of mr boil and it is an observation of his that there is no saying what the utmost human art or contrivance may be able to effect much less what means even physical ones god is able to use for the reproduction of bodies of which the necessary constituent parts may be preserved consistently with numberless changes from the cradle to the grave and after death our great creator at least knows what properly constitutes identity much better than we can tell him and therefore without entering fully into the state of the controversy as maintained long ago by dr stilling fleet and mr lock which would be little better than continuing a game of words i shall content myself with pointing out to you one or two instances of cavil and quibble and captiousness in the latter which plainly enough indicate him to have been galled in many places and are indeed altogether unworthy both of himself and his argument  the bishop in vindication of his own and the catholic tenet cites these words of our blessed savior all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth from hence says mr l your lordship argues that these words all that are in the graves relate to no other substance than what was united to the soul in life because a different substance cannot be said to be in the graves and to come out of them which words of your lordship if they prove any thing prove that the soul too is lodged in the grave and raised out of it at the last day for your lordship says can a different substance be said to be in the graves and come out of them so that according to this interpretation of these words of our savior no other substance being raised but what hears his voice but what being called comes out of the grave and no other substance coming out of the grave but what was in the grave any one must conclude that the soul unless it be in the grave will make no part of the person that is raised unless as your lordship argues against me you can make it out that a substance which never was in the grave may come out of it or that the soul is no substance ibid but will not this sophistical bubble burst in an instant before a most simple consideration pursued through its necessary consequences by a common figure and agreeably to the customary license of speech we talk of the acts or operations of one of the two constituent parts of man as of the acts or operations of the whole e g no soul sees me or no body sees me every soul heard him or no body heard him are expressions used indiscriminately not only in ordinary discourse but in correct composition the soul perceives the voice the body is raised by divine power and reunited to it bb  again the learned prelate quotes the following words of the apostle in support of the doctrine of the resurrection as it is held in the church we must all appear before the judgmentseat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he has done whether it be good or bad to which his lordship subjoins this question can these words be understood of any other material substance but that body in which these things were done a man mr l answers may suspend his determining the meaning of the apostle to be that a sinner shall suffer for his sins in the very same body in which he committed them because st paul does not say he shall have the very same body when he suffers that he had when he sinned the apostle says indeed done in his body the body he had and did things in at five or fifteen was no doubt his body as much as that which he did things in at fifty was his body though his body were not the very same body at those different ages and so will the body which he shall have after the resurrection be his body though it be not the very same with that which he had at five at fifteen or fifty ibid now agreeing with mr l and the admirers of his doctrine upon this head that the body which a man shall have after the resurrection according to their scheme for what shall be done in or at it we are left to conjecture i say agreeing with them that this body will be his body yet we would fain know in what sense he could be said to receive the things done in it or by it according to another reading a man has his body truly if not numerically the same through life under a greater or less variety of changes and modifications but by mr ls train of reasoning it should seem that a man may have his body before he is in possession of it had the apostle said as a man sins in a body so he shall suffer in a body mr ls mode of arguing might have been admitted but as matters stand at present it has evidently no logic to support it  once more the next text of scripture you bring for the same body says mr l is if there be no resurrection of the dead then is not christ raised from which your lordship argues it seems then other bodies are to be raised as his was i grant other dead as certainly raised as christ was for else his resurrection would be of no use to mankind but i do not see how it follows that they shall be raised with the same body as your lordship infers in these words annexed and can there be any doubt whether his body was the same material substance which was united to his soul before i answer none at all nor that it had just the same distinguished lineaments and marks yea and the same wounds that it had at the time of his death if therefore your lordship will argue from other bodies being raised as his was that they must have proportion with his in sameness then we must believe that every man shall be raised with the same lineaments and other notes of distinction he had at the time of his death even with his wounds yet open if he had any because our savior was so raised which seems to be scarce reconcilable with what your lordship says of a fat man falling into a consumption and dying ibid   the wit here is not worth answering and the fallacy of the paragraph was obviated in some of the foregoing observations suffice it to remark that the addition of one word in its proper place would have demolished all this fine fabric of reasoning mr l should have granted that other dead and buried shall as certainly be raised as christ was in short we affirm on scriptural authority that at the last day the bodies of men shall really be raised the article of the resurrection in our creeds requires only this belief we are neither concerned in niceties of conjecture nor obliged to adopt mr ls notion of identity cc  but to return to dr s i admit that this learned writer has speciously enough reconciled a text or two see particularly romans viii    to his favorite tenet which have been generally referred to the received doctrine but shall plausibility be obtruded upon us for demonstration shall it overturn the credit of other interpretations of the same passages more solid perhaps or at least equally ingenious shall it supersede the authority of a very great number of texts too clear and explicit to be opposed by any thing but general assertions bold denials flat contradictions and the artifice of subtilization shall it shake the faith of ages and nullify the doctrine of the catholic church  and after all in this as in the case of the trinity we are in effect only called upon to exchange one creed for another these squeamish gentlemen who know not how to digest the wholesome doctrines of the gospel expect us to swallow with greediness a kind of spiritual nostrum prepared by human imagination it is true dr s with all the effrontery of quackery would make us believe his dose may be taken without any sort of inconvenience for he roundly asserts that the resurrection of the dead is no ways liable to any of the difficulties which the other notion may be liable to now whatever difficulties our notion may be liable to i ask whether that of the doctor has not at first sight its peculiar difficulties indeed it will stand clear of all if we answer the following queries suitably to the confidence with which he proposes them may there not be a resurrection of the dead says he without the resurrection of flesh may not the dead person be raised to life and have a body given to him suitable to the place he is to have may not the thinking conscious person be restored though he has not that restored which has no thought nor consciousness belonging to it to the first of these three questions i answer absolutely  no  a resurrection of the dead supposes a resurrection of flesh to the second and third i make free to reply with a few questions in my turn and desire to ask whether when the graves and the sea shall give up the dead they will not give up what was put into them was this the body or was it the soul or if by a resurrection of the dead we are only to understand our being invested with a new body with what shadow of sense is this styled a resurrection or if there is sense and propriety in the term may we not fairly ask from whence is this body to come dd if thought or consciousness constitutes person can thought or consciousness die if not what are we to understand by a thinking conscious persons being restored restored from whence or to what ee in short whatever becomes of man after death whatever may be the nature of the intermediate state what notion can we form of thoughts rising from the dead or the resurrection of consciousness men will advance inconsistences and assert paradoxes sooner than believe as the church would have them ff  this notion of a thinking persons being restored does indeed correspond well enough with an opinion maintained with much earnestness some years since by certain divines dr law mr peckard etc who held that during the state between death and the last day the soul will sleep as it were and all the rational powers be suspended i shall not enter into the merits of their arguments it will be sufficient to say that these writers supposed the reunion of the soul to the body at the day of judgment and consequently according to their notion for arguments sake admitting it the restoration of the soul to its powers etc and the resurrection of the dead are very different things  again if we believe the apostles account the instantaneous change which is to be effected in us at the resurrection will be from natural to spiritual from corruptible to incorruptible but we shall look in vain for such a change under any other hypothesis they who insist that our souls shall be united to new bodies may be allowed to suppose such bodies will be spiritual as st paul speaks and incorruptible but will they not be hard put to it to prove that these ever were natural or corruptible or does this apostles illustration of the doctrine before us by the similitude of seed sown which is not quickened except it die convey the least idea of a souls awaking from sleep and in a moment as it were recovering the use of all its faculties surely this cannot be the mystery which the inspired writer shows us in this chapter but according to our sense the apostolical comparison is as apt and happy as possible the bare grain is sown dissolves and appears again under a new modification so also is the resurrection of the dead the body is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body a body subtilized and purified a body disencumbered from that flesh and blood which cannot inherit the kingdom of god and to adopt the high figuring of st paul clothed upon with an house from heaven and arrayed with immortality and all this while in both cases god gives a body as it pleases him and to every seed and to every individual his own body  the learned authors we are concerned with and their numerous admirers seem to have forgot or to wish us to forget that they hold opinions declared to be heretical and condemned as such by an inspired apostle the author of the epistle to the hebrews numbers the resurrection of the dead among the principles of the doctrine of christ heb vi     what was the precise tenet of hymeneus and philetus who asserted that the resurrection is past already we cannot learn from the apostle who so severely censures them but he describes them to be persons who concerning the truth had erred and overthrown the faith of some it is reasonably to be presumed that they as well as the old heretics basilides carpocrates menander valentinus etc and the anabaptists and libertines of later ages as i find them called denied the resurrection of the body on much the same grounds as their successors in this heterodoxy it has been boldly maintained that by the resurrection of the dead we are only to understand a resurrection from sin to a state of grace or a kind of resurrection from ignorance to a knowledge of truth or in general the immortality of the soul libertini says calvin as quoted by archbishop laud rident spem omnem quam de resurrectione habemus idque jam nobis evenisse dicunt quod adhuc expectamus etc ut homo sciat animam suam spiritum immortalem esse viventem in caelis and says peter martyr as cited by the same prelate sunt etiam hodie libertini qui eam irrident et resurrectionem quae tractatur in scripturis tantum ad animas referunt the gnostics and valentinians affirmed the flesh to be incapable of incorruption carnis salutem negant says irenaeus dicentes non eam esse capacem incorruptibilitatis menander had the impudence to annex the privilege of immortality to his baptism and among others probably the corinthian converts affirmed the resurrection of the dead imported no more than a renovation of life and manners a newness of life as st paul expresses it and thus they absurdly confounded figure with letter or a type with its antitype  we should now see for full satisfactions sake what the sense of the primitive church was with respect to the doctrine before us but this enquiry affording ample matter for distinct consideration must be reserved accordingly  discourse viii   cor chapter    verse    if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead that the doctrine of the resurrection of the body was taught by the apostles and by our lord we have already seen and that the apostolical fathers maintained it with the same precision will presently appear  let us consider says st clement in his first epistle to the corinthians how the lord does continually show us that there shall be a future resurrection of which he has made our lord jesus christ the first fruits raising him from the dead let us contemplate beloved the resurrection that is continually made before our eyes let us behold the fruits of the earth every one sees how the seed is sown the sower goes forth and casts it upon the earth and the seed which when it was sown fell upon the earth dry and naked in time dissolves and from the dissolution the great power of the providence of the lord raises it again and of one seed many arise and bring forth fruit this passage is almost a direct comment on the   th and two following verses of the   th chapter of st pauls first epistle to the corinthians st clement it must be confessed is not so happy in his elucidation of the doctrine of the resurrection of the body from the supposed death and reviviscence of the phoenix from his own ashes according to a current opinion in those days the enlargement on which fabulous wonder has drawn a charge of ungenuineness on the epistle itself but the judicious editor and translator in his preliminary discourse vindicates the good father and rescues the work from this imputation in a most satisfactory manner so that with serious and ingenuous minds to borrow his own words this is a matter which will reflect no discredit on st clements doctrine or on the pious zeal with which he maintained it the reality of the doctrine is in no wise affected by the whimsicalness or the weakness of the illustration  he that raised up christ from the dead shall also raise up us in like manner if we do his will says polycarp to the philippians  ignatius assures the trallians in the most positive terms that as jesus christ was truly crucified and dead so he was also truly raised from the dead by his father after the same manner as he will also raise up us who believe in him gg  the following extract from st clements second epistle to the corinthians is at least as full and express as the passage a little above quoted from the first let not any one among you say that this very flesh is not judged neither raised up consider in what were ye saved in what did ye look up if not whilst you were in this flesh we must therefore keep our flesh as the temple of god for in like manner as ye were called in the flesh ye shall also come to judgment in the flesh hh  and yet all this evidence shall shrink into nothing before a little ready confidence and unceremonious decision for thus says the author of the inquiry if we pass from the new testament barnabas and clemens of rome mention no more than the resurrection and not any particular modus of it or the resurrection of the flesh vide barnabas chapter xxi clemens chapter xxiv clemens indeed in his second epistle mentions the resurrection of the flesh but that is allowed not to be genuine ignatius too speaks as the scriptures do ep ad trall and in the larger epistle to the ephesians he speaks of the resurrection  from the dead but he never mentions any thing of a resurrection of the flesh  now if the passages i produced from st clements first epistle and from ignatius do not to all intents and purposes assert the resurrection of the body or of the flesh if st clements second epistle must absolutely be pronounced spurious because the learned world is divided in its sentiments relative to it if the doctrine contained in this epistle cannot possibly be agreeable to that of the other or to that of ignatius or to that of the apostolical and primitive church because it is a matter of some doubt who the author might be if these reverend fathers speak in no place of the resurrection of the body because in some places they speak of the resurrection of the dead or of the resurrection in general as the holy scripture itself occasionally does if this be the case equivocation shall hereafter pass for argument and dogmaticalness for demonstration  one should be apt to think that the nearer the fountain the clearer the stream or in plain terms that the most ancient christians are the most orthodox that those who lived in or nearest to the times of the apostles and apostolical men were like to understand their doctrine with readiness to embrace it with veneration and to transmit it in purity what can be more clear than the language of justin martyr as it is quoted by dr s himself christ shall come a second time when  he shall raise the bodies of all men that have been well but says our author this was justins opinion but it was not in any baptismal creed he takes no notice of any article of any creed as containing the notion of the resurrection of the flesh whatsoever his own philosophical notion of the resurrection might be  will it follow then that the doctrine of the resurrection of the flesh was purely the personal or philosophical notion of justin martyr because it was not in his time an article in any creed if so it will follow by parity of arguing that almost all the other articles of our present creeds were the private tenets or opinions of particular persons and not the common doctrine or belief of the catholic church this must follow upon dr ss own principles for he has himself remarked in his preface that it is highly probable these referring to doctrines he had been mentioning and other doctrines were taught viz after baptism as circumstances arose either to explain some things inculcated in the gospels or to avoid something erroneous and hence it was that the original creed was enlarged and more things inserted into it and indeed all that has been added to it seems to have been owing to these causes the just now cited declaration of justin martyr is therefore to be regarded as exactly coincident with a doctrine publicly received and not as the bare result of his own judgment for any thing dr s has said or proved to the contrary but if so the doctrine of the resurrection of the body or of the flesh was an article of faith from the beginning and its subsequent date as an article of any creed is a circumstance of very inferior consideration what matters it to us when it was thought necessary to be required of the members of the church of christ openly to profess they believed as the apostles and primitive christians did  but let me show you how unfairly the author of the enquiry deals by polycarp of the two places in this fathers epistle to the philippians in which mention is made of the resurrection the principal i think is that i not long since quoted and will here lay again before you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also raise up us in like manner the words in like manner are by the no less faithful than judicious translator printed in italics as not been literally contained though necessarily implied in the original this passage then like many more parallel ones which i have had occasion to produce i mean from the scripture itself manifestly imports the resurrection of the body though should any person affect to doubt what the good fathers meaning may be here they may soon learn what his idea of the resurrection was from a part of the prayer he preferred to god in the hour of his martyrdom according to the account we have of it in the circular epistle of the church of smyrna he there makes mention of the resurrection both of soul and body for though the soul cannot properly speaking be said to rise again yet as the soul and body constitute the same man as these constituent parts are separated by death and reunited at the resurrection this reunion is not unfitly expressed by a term that may be truly predicated of one of the constituent parts  dr s admits the genuineness of the abovementioned narrative and yet will not suffer us to consider the letter in one place to be an explanation of the sense in the other there is more of art than honesty in an attempt to slip out of this difficulty by saying as the enquirer does in the following words that by the time this letter was wrote the notion seems to have prevailed among christians that the body was to be raised though it was not yet got into any of their creeds this is a sort of spiritual juggle which inverts truth and disguises it in the same instant it metamorphoses the real sentiment of polycarp into a whimsical notion which began to gain ground in the church  but this matter may be viewed in another light the force of truth has drawn from our author an involuntary cession of his own darling point for immediately after the sentence last cited from him he acquaints us that soon after the middle of the second century disputes arose about the resurrection the heathens objecting to the possibility of it and the christians endeavoring to answer the objections they met with the enquiry says he was whether there was to be a resurrection of the soul alone or of the whole man consisting of body and soul and then a second question was whether the flesh the very flesh which we now bear about us was to be raised up again the writers of that time still extant contended for the resurrection of the flesh together with the soul but there does not appear to be any creed which established such a doctrine for whatever private persons might imagine to be true was not instantly to be professed as an article of faith necessary to be believed in order to baptism and afterward he tells us that the controversy about the resurrection of the flesh did not begin till the middle or near the end of the second century and then as philosophers objected to the resurrection itself from the common topics how could flesh devoured by beasts or fishes and thus become parts of those animals or perhaps reduced by fire to ashes or dispersed by seas and rivers be restored athenagoras theophilus and tertullian undertook a defense of this notion and taught that it was no ways beyond the power of almighty god to restore to every one the flesh he once had enquiry etc p    ii  now i desire to observe in the first place that these philosophers objected to the resurrection from the common topics just mentioned because they were the strongest that occurred to them and because when they objected to the resurrection of the body they most unquestionably meant to object to the resurrection itself in the next place i would remark that if by the christians who endeavored to answer the objections of heathens and by the writers of that time we are to understand only a few private persons who maintained an extraordinary opinion if athenagoras and theophilus and tertullian did no more than defend their own personal tenets it is passing strange these same heathen philosophers should set their wits against them at all and stranger still that the whole body of christians had not joined the outcry in their own vindication and in public disavowal of an enthusiastic and ridiculous principle nay this is not all the doctrine of the resurrection of the body if it was a mere private or personal opinion was in fact contrary to the gospel of christ and the sense of the church and therefore must have been regarded as a most gross if not dangerous heresy but as it most undoubtedly was never represented so to be we are to conclude i presume that it was true and catholic doctrine notwithstanding its nonappearance in any creed in the early ages and though the acknowlegement of it was not a qualification for baptism we therefore insist that whenever it became an article of a baptismal creed it was inserted with the most admissible pretensions  it is farther very observable that the doctrine of the resurrection of the body is most expressly taught in many places of the koran of mahomet let us turn to a few man says says mahomet after i have been dead shall i really be brought forth alive from the grave does not man remember that we created him heretofore when he was nothing the unbelievers say when we and our fathers shall have been reduced to dust shall we be taken from the grave man says who shall restore bones to life when they are rotten answer he shall restore them to life who produced them the first time kk the whole system of mahometism is you well know a superstructure raised upon the foundations of judaism and christianity the grand aim of the impostor seems to have been to concentre both in one faith with which view and that no romantic one he in part adopted and partly rejected the respective theories in order to ingratiate himself with the jews he asserted as we have seen even to an extremity of zeal the unity of the godhead and at the same time not to put the christians out of all temper as he frequently takes occasion to speak respectfully of jesus christ so he declares probably in the most explicit terms for the great article we have been discussing ll we may therefore fairly conclude from this circumstance only that the doctrine of the resurrection of the body was not the sentiment of a few individuals but the profession of the universal church at the beginning of the seventh century and after all supposing it to be questionable whether this were really the plan of mahomet the least that can be inferred from the perspicuity with which the doctrine of the resurrection is taught and enforced in the koran is that he conceived it to be sufficiently reconcilable with the common reason and apprehension of mankind at the same time that from this among other particulars we must see and must desire its adversaries to take notice that it is not a doctrine peculiar to christianity  to come now to the conclusion of the whole matter if these things are so if the great doctrines we have been handling are defensible upon sound principles and have a most firm foundation in scripture and in primitive authority abundant reason have we to hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering in nothing dismayed by adversaries who trifle with us upon the most serious subjects who render the word of god of none effect by perverse interpretation who cannot or will not see the plain sense of the plainest expressions who will not acknowledge jesus christ to be the creator of the world though all things were made by him or that he made satisfaction for sin though he was sacrificed for us and gave his life a ransom for all i know not any thing that can equal this stubbornness and slowness of heart except the insolence of such as gravely tell us we must not hope to propagate the gospel among jews mahometans or heathens while the strange doctrines contained in our creeds are retained in the church is not this to all intents and purposes saying we must not hope to eradicate infidelity till we have renounced the capital articles of our belief or in other words must not expect to make converts to christianity till we cease to be christians and indeed so inconsiderable are the impediments to a spiritual coalition between the followers of socinus and the disciples of mahomet that according to information given us by writers of credit terms of union and amity were actually proposed by the former to the latter in the last century see mr joness introduc disc p   note that men should admit the mysterious truths of holy writ upon rational grounds or that they should reject them upon what they call rational grounds we may readily enough comprehend but there seems to be something unaccountably romantic in an attempt to compromise matters as it were with the author of our faith by accommodating these truths to the human understanding  but whatever may be the views or whatever the claims or whatever the pretenses of latitudinarians in general the notion of a creed or a system or an establishment respecting the great doctrines we have been considering occurs to us in a manner spontaneously in the church of christ the only question ought to be not whether a confession a formulary or a series of articles be long or short simple or circumstantial ancient or modern but whether it has its grounds in competent authority mm if the doctrines of the trinity and of the resurrection as they are held in the church be scriptural doctrines no more objection can justly lie against the nicene or the athanasian creed than against that of dr s this author not only admits but refers to an original creed which he observes has been enlarged as circumstances arose or occasions called though that it has been enlarged in some instances beyond all reason he strongly insists with many others with him but be this as it may and even if these things were not so as we have represented them it is abundantly sufficient that they appear to be so to us no rule no system no establishment whatsoever can in any tolerable sense be said to invade the right of private judgment in matters of religion because creeds formularies institutions and appointments in general must be incompatible with the exercise of this right at all periods of the christian church or at none it is pleasant enough to remark how zealously some will be affected in a ridiculous thing and how vehemently they will beat the air in their contention for that right of private judgment which is indeed unalienable and in fact is exercised by those who submit to what may be called public by men of all persuasions by jews turks infidels and heretics by the sectaries of all religions and by people of no religion at all nn not heretics only says the great chillingworth but romish catholics also set up as many judges as there are men and women in the christian world for do not your men and women judge your religion to be true before they believe it as well as the men and women of other religions oh but you say they receive it not because they think it agreeable to scripture but because the church tells them so but then i hope they believe the church because their own reason tells them they are to do so so that the difference between a papist and a protestant is this not that the one judges and the other does not judge but that the one judges his guide to be infallible the other his way to be manifest the fact is every mans attachment to any thing to this or that church to this party or to that principle etc is ultimately resolvible into his opinion of its excellence its truth its propriety or its expedience or of its conduciveness on the whole to his welfare comfort and satisfaction etc i e it is resolvible into his own private judgment this judgment it is true may be warped by passion biassed by prejudice clouded by ignorance and blinded by perverseness it may be intoxicated by voluptuousness enervated by indolence or inverted by frenzy or it may be influenced by wisdom by folly or by caprice but at the same time whether we judge well or ill or of whatever differences or degrees human judgment may admit we shall strictly and properly be found in all cases and instances to judge for ourselves   it was the concurrence of private judgment which first formed the christian church it was the same concurrence which gradually compounded the enormous mass of popery it was the same that effected the reformation and it was the same that constituted the numerous sects and parties into which this reformation has been most deplorably split and subdivided it is to nothing more or less than this that the church of england owes her existence and upon this ground it is certain her requisition of assent to her public offices and of subscription to her articles the measure of just policy and common prudence for her security are no more to be regarded as invasions of the right of private judgment than the open attempts or the secret machinations of her enemies for her destruction upon this ground in short her declarations of faith in what she holds to be evangelical truth and indeed the whole scheme of her doctrine discipline and polity are perfectly intelligible and manifestly consistent but is not the inference drawn from the acknowleged right of private judgment by a late famous author and his associates altogether chimerical and totally incomprehensible their inference is that every individual christian may if he thinks fit withdraw himself from all the churches upon the face of the earth stand absolutely single in the profession of his faith or as this author expresses it be a church to himself see confessional chapter   p    note and is not this in effect to assert that a church may be formed without a communion without government or ministry without a possibility of being infected with heresy or divided by schism is it not to all intents and purposes to aver that a society may subsist without members without establishment or constitution we deny not that a man may judge he has a claim to this spiritual independence and indeed our principle supposes him so to judge but then we must beg leave to think in our turn that he is grossly mistaken in that judgment pp  i wish to remark that if the capital truths of the gospel are discoverable any where they are most indisputably to be found in the catholic church the great repository of christian doctrine our blessed lords assurances of superintendency support and protection are out of all question given to his disciples and to believers in general as to a body or society upon this rock says he i will build my church etc lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world when he promised his apostles that he would send the holy spirit to them who should guide them into all truth he must necessarily mean that truth which they were to communicate to their successors and these to others and so on through all generations when the sacred penmen speak of the truth or the faith etc they undoubtedly speak of the truth embraced and the faith professed by all sound christians and when st paul exhorts the corinthians to examine themselves and to prove themselves whether they were in the faith he most certainly means the faith of the catholic church in a word we must look for spiritual truth in its native simplicity though we search for it as for hid treasures we must look for it within the pale of some communion or other which surely will be acknowleged by every man who does not in defiance of scripture and in contempt of all the world suppose that the infallibility which he justly denies to appertain to any church upon earth is really and truly lodged in himself  the principle of the confessional leads we apprehend to these absurd consequences but at the same time we assert no dominion over the faith or the consciences of others we leave every one to stand or fall to his own master we conceive that by the immutable constitution of things every one will think and act for himself though we imagine all men to be accountable to god as well for their opinions as for their practices we neither do nor wish to compel men to come in that our church may be filled persuaded as we are at the same time that this church is in respect of all essentials an apostolical one that she holds fast the things which become sound doctrine and teaches the words of eternal life  it may with great truth be affirmed that the church of england asserts the right of private judgment in the same sense and to the same latitude that every party or body of protestants does for how does the management of the several leaders and teachers of the sectaries accord with this universally avowed principle how do they leave men to their own judgments in matters of religion do they not find ways and means to become masters of the understandings and the consciences of their followers and accomplish that by indirect artifice which they load us with obloquy for doing under the sanction of lawful authority the fact is in case of superiority any sect that you may name would think itself not barely empowered but bound to strengthen and secure itself by legal fences and establishments and by authoritative constitutions i e by those very means and methods against which it now so vehemently exclaims experience will justify our supposition that such would be the case as we know the most considerable branch of the dissenters to have changed its language and its sentiments with its situation the first article of the memorable solemn league and covenant declares the intention of its framers to be to bring the churches of god in the three kingdoms to the nearest conjunction and uniformity in religion confession of faith form of church government and directory for worship and catechizing that they and their posterity after them might as brethren live in faith and love  it is pleasant enough to observe that notwithstanding the fine flourishes and colorings of certain authors who plausibly profess themselves to be advocates for the common rights and privileges of christians we find them sometimes driven out of their track by the irresistible force of truth and insensibly advancing or admitting ecclesiastical notions we find them after all their efforts and struggles to climb over the pale of the church unwarily or rather unavoidably slipping back as i may say into her fold and undermining their own principles the words of a late famous prelate bp hoadley upon this subject will verify the observation as it is absurd says he to suppose that any man can be saved by the faith of another or by any belief but what is truly his own so there is no possible method of having a faith of his own properly so called without building it entirely upon what appears right to his own judgment such as it is after his best endeavors for information that is to say in other words a man cannot properly be said to judge for himself till he has received information or instruction from others in short let privileges be as sacred or consciences as tender as you please i affirm that the erection and establishment of a national church whether the doctrines she teaches are in themselves orthodox or otherwise true or false is as fairly defensible upon rational and protestant grounds as the institution of any religious sect or society whatsoever  true it is that men inflamed with false zeal or misled by wrong judgment may depart both from protestant and christian principles and at their peril it will be the church of rome endeavored to extirpate what she called heresy by the very same means which in early days paganism employed for the overthrow of the christian faith itself and what was the consequence the inhumanity of persecution afforded to every thinking mind a very strong argument of the corruption of that church in which it was countenanced it frightened men into their senses it helped to open their understandings and popery may upon the matter be said to have been burnt out of the kingdom i undertake not to prove that in our own church zeal has always been sufficiently governed by prudence or tempered with charity there is no occasion to recur to a few disagreeable instances or the transactions of untoward times but i trust i shall be abundantly warranted in asserting that he who at this day shall charge the church of england or any considerable number of her members with a want of due moderation knows not of what manner of spirit we are of and yet if the author of the confessional is to be credited we are relapsing gradually into popery both in our doctrines and our practices we are given to understand in the seventh chap of that work that some competent observers have grounds for more than a suspicion that the church of england has been and still is though by degrees imperceptible to vulgar eyes edging back once more toward popery sure these observers are much more sharpsighted than their neighbors i do not well know what these gentlemen are afraid of but i know true christianity to be most in danger from the diametrically opposite quarter not so much from men of too great as from people of too little faith not so much from the triplemitre of the roman pontiff as from the manyheaded hydra of infidelity the truth of the matter is the author before us and his friends do not speak out as our open enemies have done and as themselves were called upon to do by every maxim of justice candor and generosity they are in no dread of fire and faggot they are offended not by the discipline but by certain doctrines of the church of rome which we hold in common with her even the doctrines i have been defending and which they most insidiously and industriously labor to confound with the absurdities which are justly had in derision or in abhorrence among us and of which the credit visibly diminishes every day errors may be grafted upon the stock of truth which in itself is not the less pure or the less amiable because it may be holden in folly as well as in unrighteousness to an ardent longing to see these common doctrines expunged from our articles and creeds we are unquestionably to ascribe that profusion of spleen malevolence and rancour with which so many pages of the consessional and of other treatises are shamefully defiled but for these doctrines i am thoroughly persuaded the reasonableness and utility not to say necessity of churchestablishments would generally be admitted and even contended for that nicety of human wisdom which strains at two or three of our articles could i am apt to think well enough digest the remainder of the thirty nine but as matters are circumstanced the principle i have been combating is far from being an unpopular one the privilege or right of private judgment in the sense of our adversaries reduces in some sort all men to an equality and is extremely soothing to vain and to weak minds the fact is there is no difficulty in declaiming from standing and specious topics either of eulogy or invective an affected zeal for reformation and an avowed anxiousness for the revival of gospel simplicity have a verv ingratiating tendency with the bulk of mankind liberty of conscience freedom of sentiment qq ecclesiastical tyranny violence of bigotry arbitrary injunctions spiritual impositions etc are i grant expressions sufficiently sonorous and amusing and may pass with many for argument though at the same time looseness of principle stubbornness of schism rankness of heresy arrogance of selfsufficiency perverseness of opposition and petulance of temper etc are phrases which must be allowed by competent judges to sound quite as well and to mean full as much  to conclude that there is nothing in the least exceptionable in our whole ecclesiastical system nothing that might reasonably be retrenched nothing that could possibly be amended even in our articles as well as worship rites and usages we by no means affirm but respectfully leaving these things to the consideration of them that are over us in the lord we utterly deny that there is any thing fundamentally wrong or essentially erroneous in our spiritual constitution rr men may be and we find them to be bigots in the cause of infidelity nor can it afford the least matter of wonder if no regard is paid to the complaints or rather the railing accusations of such as under fair shows and pretenses have manifestly evil will at sion and while they profess themselves to be actuated by the spirit of liberty appear to be really possessed with the demon of licentiousness i profess i see not what we can do for or with these determined enemies of our holy faith except praying in the spirit of fervent charity that god would be pleased to bring them into the way of truth the spirit speaks expressly says st paul that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils   timothy iv   this passage cannot possibly be considered as a dead letter and therefore it infinitely concerns all persons diligently to try and examine themselves in order to their moral assurance that it does not in any sense or degree touch their spiritual state in general however under a conviction that we are ourselves in the good and the right way it will be our duty as members of the church to wish and as christians to pray that god would have mercy upon all jews turks infidels and heretics that he would take from them all ignorance hardness of heart and contempt of his word and so fetch them home to his flock that they may be saved among the remnant of the true israelites and be made one fold under one shepherd jesus christ our lord  annotations page   a or misconstrued controversy in general may be said to subsist in a great measure by the pliancy of composition christopher davenport a franciscan in a paraphrase or exposition of the thirtynine articles makes them all capable of a romancatholic sense and raynardus a roman likewise by a perverse interpretation converts every article of the apostolic creed into heresy or blasphemy the design of the latter is obvious enough i do not recollect to whom i am indebted for these particulars in like manner dr waterland acquaints us that franciscus abbot of st clare contrived to reconcile our thirtynine articles to the doctrine of the council of trent by dint of great dexterity and most amazing subtilty as the learned doctor expresses it  with respect to religious questions the romanists in derision of the principles and pretensions of protestants and by way of proof of the necessity of ecclesiastical interposition have all along called the scriptures mortuum atramentum dumb judges etc and assimilate the same to a nose of wax to represent their susceptibleness of any sense it may suit us to put upon them though at the same time none more than themselves endeavor to make advantage of their versatility this is apparent in many instances e g in their constructions of those texts by which they pretend to prove the doctrine of extremeunction of a purgatory etc  the applications of scripture made by the roman canonists are serioridiculous if i may so say beyond all conception they will prove the twofold power of the pope from the two swords which the apostles had when christ was seized by judas christ said to peter feed my sheep in general not such or such a flock from whence it has been inferred that the pope as successor to that apostle is to be acknowledged the universal

proper work of the socinians for them i find the following extract from the racovian catechism made by the anonymous author of four treatises concerning the doctrine etc of the mahometans  sententia

manages this matter against his antagonist mr hardinge who in his pretended confutation of the apology for the church of england confidently asserts that the divinity of the holy ghost cannot be proved by any express authority from scripture we find that illustrious prelate taking the wisest method of putting his adversary to silence and confusion by producing testimonies and opinions and not barely concessions but strong asseverations of a directly contrary tendency from the writers of the roman church itself one quotation from nazianzen is extremely remarkable and runs as follows dicet

alienus a spiritu sancto in short the various methods which have been taken by papists to evince the necessity of admitting the infallibility of the church and to discredit the authority of the evangelical writings are equally scandalous and pitiful you have them particularly enumerated by an author just now quoted and it will be sufficient to select one of them as it is a flagrant one i mean that of the cardinal perron who in the last century in order to render the scriptures suspected and contemptible asserted that some things in them sound like fables others are apt to raise in the mind indecent and dishonest imaginations as some expressions in solomons song the history of balaams ass which spoke and the jaw bone of an ass with which sampson slew a thousand philistines

time and after the writing of scriptures these cannot be discovered condemned and avoided unless the church be infallible therefore there must be a church infallible to which mr chillingworth replies in these words i pray tell me why cannot heresies besufficiently discovered condemned and avoided by them which believe scripture to be the rule of faith if scripture be sufficient to inform us what is the faith it must of necessity be also sufficient to teach us what is heresy seeing heresy is nothing but a manifest deviation from and an opposition to the faith that which is straight will plainly teach us what is crooked and one contrary cannot but manifest the other if any one should deny that there is a god that this god is omnipotent omniscient good etc etc that jesus christ is the savior of the world and the son of god if any man should deny either his birth his passion or resurrection etc or sitting at the right hand of god his having all power given him etc that it is he whom god has appointed to be judge of the quick and the dead that all men shall rise again at the last day etc etc if a man should hold that either the keeping of the mosaical law is necessary to salvation or that good works are not necessary in a word if any man should obstinately contradict the truth of any thing plainly delivered in scripture who does not see that every one which believes the scripture has sufficient means to discover and condemn and avoid that heresy without any need of an infallible guide if you say that the obscure places of scripture contain matters of faith i answer that it is a matter of faith to believe that the sense of them whatever it is which was intended by god is true for he that does not so calls gods truth into question but to believe this or that to be the true sense of them or to believe the true sense of them and to avoid the false is not necessary either to faith or salvation  it may be asked however whether this gives us satisfaction to the full do not our creeds and articles contain particulars which we shall look for in vain in m cs list of the objects of faith are not many whom we consider as heretics ready to subscribe to this list was mr c inadvertently or designedly silent with regard to these particulars or are we to consign them to the class of obscurity whatever might have been his motive to the wording of his paragraph in this manner or whatever was his personal persuasion in respect to the fundamental articles of the faith professed by the church of england the momentous import of the interrogatories i have just put must be visible to every reader  when mr c or any body else tells us that god does not require any more of any man than this to believe the scripture to be gods word and to endeavor to find the true sense of it and to live according to it or that he that believes the scripture sincerely and endeavors to believe it in the true sense cannot possibly be an heretic see relig of protest p     and end of preface he must be understood with qualification as asserting not absolutely that an honest man cannot possibly err concerning the faith but that error or heresy will not be imputed to involuntary ignorance or to sincerity of persuasion  heresy says bp tailor is not an error of the understanding but of the will and elsewhere it is not the opinion but the impiety that condemns and makes the heretic on this principle this sagacious and moderate writer condemns the heresiarch whose error commences upon pride and ambition etc and excuses those who follow him in simplicity of heart  agreably to all this dr potter author of the answer to charity mistaken whose cause chillingworth espouses and after him dr waterland quotes the following remarkable passage from salvian an ancient bishop of marseilles respecting the truly sincere of the arian persuasion they are heretics but do not know that they are so in short they are heretics in our judgment not so in their own for they esteem themselves such good catholics that they even throw upon us the infamous charge of heresy such therefore as they are to us we are to them we know assuredly that they are injurious to the divine generation of the son of god in making him inferior to the father they on the other hand think us injurious to the father in believing them both equal how they shall be punished at the day of judgment for this their error etc no one can know except the judge  it may be proper to take mr ks argument and mr cs answer into reconsideration heresies says the former would arise after the apostles time and after the writing of scriptures these cannot be discovered condemned and avoided unless the church be infallible therefore there must be a church infallible the substance of mr cs reply is that without any need of an infallible guide the great truths of the gospel are discoverable and consequently heresies avoidable by all such as believe scripture to be the rule of faith and that with respect to those obscure places of scripture which mr k tells us contain matters of faith we have nothing to do but believe that the sense of them whatsoever it is which was intended by god is true without being solicitous to avoid mistakes concerning them  by this answer it is certain this celebrated disputant seems to lay his own faith rather open to suspicion for does he not admit what he might and in fact ought to have contested take them in the gross the places of scripture which contain matters of faith are not by any means obscure but altogether plain and intelligible i speak concerning the faith of the church what the sense of these places is according to the established laws of interpretation and according to the belief of the christians of the first ages is a question to the determination of which we surely need not have recourse to infallibility though therefore with respect to passages really ambiguous or obscure it will be a safe and excellent rule to believe that the sense of them whatsoever it is which was intended by god is true yet it will be unfair unreasonable and unsafe to apply this rule to places which are no otherwise ambiguous or obscure than as they contain matters of faith especially when we remember how frequently and how earnestly we are required to strive for the faith to contend for the faith and to examine and prove our own selves whether we be in the faith truth is not less truth because it is held in a church that pretends not to be infallible god only knows the hearts of the children of men but at the same time it will be no breach of charity to intimate that every man should be fully persuaded in his own mind that if he errs his error is an error not of his will but of his understanding  chillingworth part   c   p  0

bring myself to recall these words by the high respect which on many accounts is due to the names of certain persons eminent for their ability and some of them for their piety too who have advanced notions not a whit less eccentric or extravagant than these the late worthy bishop of cloyne who denied or at least doubted the existence of matter is not without his numerous admirers in fact he seems to have confounded all though he has convinced none but whatever purpose was intended to be served by such a doctrine surely its real consequences must be detrimental to the cause of christianity if all about us is mere mockery and illusion the very foundations of all evidence all faith and all practice are undermined nor will it be possible to determine which position most contradicts my senses or offers most violence to my conceptions that which avers the nonexistence of matter or that which maintains the transubstantiation of it in the holy sacrament the followers of mr hobbes will be apt to laugh this notion to scorn under a persuasion that they deny or doubt the existence of spirit and consequently of god with a much better grace it may be observed with regard to both extremes that there is no such thing as demonstrating beyond a possibility of doubt or contradiction for to use the words of an author of the last century it is possible that mathematical evidence itself may be but a constant undiscoverable delusion which our nature is necessarily and perpetually obnoxious unto and that either fatally or fortuitously there has been in the world time out of mind such a being as we call man whose essential property it is to be then most of all mistaken when he conceives a thing most evidently true there is no shutting the door against skepticism we

criterion of truth pyrrho though not the first skeptic was famous enough to give an appellation to skepticism but notwithstanding all this a man of sense and of common prudence will listen to rational evidence and yield assent to moral certainty he will soon be convinced upon enquiry that both body and spirit exist and that mind is neither matter nor motion that if chance or nature if you please made the world it is that which preserves it too and may dissolve it and after its dissolution may restore it to its original state or reduce it to one infinitely worse than the present this sure is at best but uncomfortable philosophy not that i would hereby insinuate immorality to be necessarily connected with infidelity plato distinguished long ago between the ranting and sober atheist and observed that a man whose sentiments are impious may be virtuous from constitution accordingly he very justly resolves atheism into not barely depravity of manners but sometimes into an affectation of singular wisdom see letters on infidelity p    one source of atheism in his opinion is  which is almost literally translated in the following words of the apostle professing themselves to be wise they became fools  dr cudworth seems unwarily to give some advantage to the atheist where he says that when we affirm that god is incomprehensible we only mean that our imperfect minds cannot have such a conception of his nature as does perfectly master conquer and subdue that vast object under it etc the case is we comprehend by our reason that god is though not what he is in respect of his essence in the abstract but that he is selfexistent from all eternity that he is a spirit that he is the creator and governor of the universe that he is all perfect are certain truths notwithstanding the darkness which surrounds them sophocles may be imagined to have had these truths in his eye when speaking of the divine edicts and the immutable decrees of heaven he puts this fine sentiment in the mouth of antigone     and yet we have wits and philosophers of great name and recent date who seem desirous of reviving the old atomical physiology which as dr cudworth expresses it makes all things

the former of whom in his treatise entitled motives to the love of god thus expresses himself if i be not very much mistaken they are so who presume to give us satisfactory definitions of gods nature which we may perhaps more safely define by the impossibility of its being accurately defined nor will an assiduity and constancy of our speculations herein relieve us for too fixed a contemplation of gods essence does but the more confound us and then he refers us to the wellknown story of simonides agreably to these sentiments the great lord bacon says if any man shall think by view and enquiry into these sensible and material things to attain that light whereby he may reveal unto himself the nature and will of god then is he spoiled through vain philosophy and hence continues he it has proceeded that some of the chosen rank of the more learned have fallen into heresy whilst they have sought to fly up to the secrets of the deity by the waxen wings of the senses and again the prerogative of god comprehends the whole man and is extended as well to the reason as to the will of man i e that man renounce himself wholly and draw near unto god wherefore as we are to obey his law though we find a reluctation in our will so we are to believe his word though we find a reluctation in our reason for if we believe only that which is agreeable to our reason we give assent to the matter not to the author etc by how much therefore any divine mystery is more discordant and incredible by so much the more honor is given to god in believing etc etc how do these sentiments differ

it is ridiculous it is useless it is endless to start metaphysical questions which instead of clearing matters serve only to confound them it has been asked whether the deity be naturally or morally good or whether he is necessarily good and just in the same sense as he is eternal and omniscient all speculations on such points as these are covered by the general idea of absolute inherent perfection perhaps seneca may be allowed to discharge this difficulty not unhappily when speaking of the deity he says ipse est necessitas sua the ingenious editor of puffendorfs treatise de officio hominis et civis speaks much the same language in the following note deus intelligitur ad suarum perfectionum normam actiones componere ipse sibi lex est ens natura perfectissimum cum deus sit ideo quodcunque agit vel eligit non potest non esse optimum itaque nugas agunt vel quiddam pejus qui deum ens primum et summum virtutis et obligationis capacem esse docent see johnsons note at sect   book   but these last words seem rather obscure  to avoid making god the author of evil the doctrine of zoroastres was that god originally and directly created only light or good and that darkness or evil followed it by consequence as the shadow does the person that light or good has only a real production from god and the other afterward resulted from it as the defect thereof an ingenious writer gives us the sentiments of plato on this perplexing subject in the following translation god is good he is not as many say the cause of every thing the good things we enjoy are to be solely ascribed to him but we are to search for another cause than god for our evils or if we will say they come from god plato quotes here the famous passage in homer where mention is made of jupiters two vessels the one containing good and the other evil etc see plato de repub b   and popes note at v     of   th book of the iliad some such reason as this is to be assigned we may say god does always what is just and good and the persons punished receive benefit by it but the poet must not say the sufferers are miserable and god inflicts that misery on them if indeed he say the wicked as miserable stand in need of punishment and when punished by god receive benefit from it this may be permitted but we are strenuously to oppose any man who says god is the author of evil to a good man such language is at no rate to be tolerated in a state the judicious reader will see how little a way this theory goes toward clearing the difficulty but he will i presume acknowledge it goes far enough to convince us that plato had to speak modestly as precise ideas of the divine nature as any modern philosopher according to the translators expression but in his timaeus this famous philosopher imputes the origin of evil to the necessity of imperfect beings as dr cudworth expresses it wherefore says he though according to plato god be properly and directly the cause of nothing else but good yet the necessity of these lower imperfect things does unavoidably give birth and being to evils this is conformable enough to modern notions aristotle seems to have thought the deity to have been the cause or principle of all things without exception though in the following sentence he expresses himself in terms general modest and unperemptory    it is further observable that not only many heathens and among others platonists but what is more extraordinary christians also have asserted the selfexistence and eternity of matter in order to account for the origin of evil and effectually salve the honor of the deity god would have made nihil non optimum says hermogenes as tertullian represents his and his followers reasonings these heretics were called materiarii it has been the opinion of some that god permitted the fall of man purely with a view to his redemption see catcotts sermon   p           the author of deism revealed remarks that there are two opposite and supreme principles according to the belief of almost all the pagans now in the world we are further given to understand by other authors that gods absolute decrees and predetermination of good and evil is the doctrine of the koran in general though the mahometans are divided in their opinions upon this article the sect of the hashemians were it seems so afraid of making god the author of evil that they would not allow him to have created an infidel which was adopting something like the old magian theory according to which there are two principles or a good and evil god who are in a state of perpetual enmity and opposition on the other hand the mozdarians thought it possible for god to be a liar unjust etc as the basharians taught that god is not obliged to do what is best and that had it pleased him he might have made all men true believers the english translation of a latin version of an arabic manuscript which contains a short system of mohammedan theology gives us a distinction upon the subject of the divine decrees as whimsical as it is unsatisfactory in the sixth section we have the following passage  god has so decreed good obedience and faith that he ordains and wills them and that they may be under his decree his salutary direction his good pleasure and command on the contrary god has decreed does ordain will and determine evil disobedience and infidelity yet without his salutary direction his good pleasure or command it being only by way of seduction indignation and prohibition but whosoever shall say that god is not delighted with good and faith or that god has not an indignation against evil and infidelity or that good and evil are from god so that god has decreed and willed both with complacency in them he is certainly an infidel then follows in another character  direct us o great god into the right way  a petition expressive of the authors perplexity  the general way both among jews and christians of accounting for the origin of evil is to derive it from the abuse of human liberty let us turn to the sentiments of the learned grotius upon this subject cum diximus deum omnium esse causam addidimus eorum quae vere subsistnnt nihil enim prohibet quo minus ipsa quae subsistunt deinde causae sint accidentium quorundam quales sunt actiones deus hominem et mentes sublimiores homine creavit cum agendi liberate quae agendi libertas vitiosa non est sed potest sua vi aliquid vitiosum producere still will not this elastic difficulty return with full force upon us for may it not be asked who created men and angels and endowed them with this liberty or could either have abused a privilege they never enjoyed is there nothing of apparent causality in all this indeed the learned author seems to me to be sensible of his distressed situation he observes very justly in the words immediately following those just cited that it would be impious to call god the author of evil hujus quidem generis malis quae moraliter mala dicuntur omnino deum adscribere auctorem nefas est but what does he say in the leading sentence of this very section neque ab eo quod diximus dimovere nos debet quod mala multa evenire cernimus quorum videtur origo deo adscribi non posse ut qui perfectissime sicut ante dictum est bonus sit surely that same videtur betrays entanglement let us just see now in what manner mr leclerc the ingenious editor of this work of grotius illustrates this delicate passage praevidit quidem etiam deus fore ut naturae liberae liberate sua abuterentur indeque multa mala et physica et moralia eventura nihilo secius abusum illum consectariaque ejus pati maluit quam naturas liberate praeditas non creare quid ita quia cum natura libera sit praestantissima creatura quaeque summam opificis potentiam quam maxim ostendit deus noluit incommoda ex naturae mutabilitate promanantia antevertere quia ea potest cum visum erit per totam aeternitatem emendare iis modis qui non nisi bonitati ejus convenientissimi esse possunt quamvis eos nondum revelarit  the very learned and equally pious dr barrow expresses himself on this subject in the following words as for those real imperfections and evils moral evils habitual distempers irregular actions etc we need not seek any one eternal cause for them though order and uniformity do disorder and confusion do not argue any unity of cause whence they should proceed the true causes of them are notorious enough the voluntary declining of men etc from the way god does prescribe them their abusing their own faculties etc etc as for other evils of griefs and pains incident to the nature or consequent upon the actions of any being they are such as god himself without any derogation to his goodness may in his wisdom or justice be author of for ends sometimes apparent to our understanding sometimes surpassing its reach it may suffice that god challenges to himself the being the cause of them shall there be any evil in the city and the lord has not done it does not evil and good proceed out of the mouth of the most high i am the lord and there is none else i form the light and create darkness i make peace and create evil see amos   v   lamen   v    isa    v   we derive rather distress than

our doctrines from the pulpit or the press respecting the holy trinity or the particular divinity of our savior infidelity is always on the watch and will take advantage in a moment of the least ambiguous or inaccurate or obscure expression which may fall from our lips or our pens some of the fathers themselves and indeed of our own most able writers sometimes speak unguardedly and inconsistently on these subjects for the sake of perspicuity and distinction as it should seem it has been said the father is selfexistent and the son or holy ghost necessarily existent which is in fact a distinction without a difference the three persons as constituting one god are equally selfexistent the father the son and the holy ghost are the deity and every idea of originality derivation etc evaporates in the consideration of a trinity in unity though it has pleased god to represent the relation which the second person in the trinity bears to the first under the analogy of that of a son to a father yet we must not think that this analogy holds in every respect or that every circumstance of human paternity and filiation is applicable to the divine these are the words of a late worthy and learned writer who expresses himself still more happily in the following passage it is impossible for god himself to reveal these things to such kind of beings as we are any other way than by accommodating himself to our conceptions and using such terms as bear some analogy to things known and understood by us the father says another able advocate for the doctrine of the trinity is first in our conception of god and therefore when we speak of the almighty or the eternal god and the reason is the same for the only god we primarily and principally mean the father tacitly including the other two persons it is well observed by mr parkhurst that the first second and third persons in the trinity are merely theological not scriptural terms divin etc of christ p      but is the language of the author last quoted of a piece with this sentence when he talks of selfexistence or unoriginateness as the peculiar mode of the existence of the first person or is the writer first quoted perfectly consistent with himself when he concurs in sentiment with those whom he calls the most zealous defenders of the nicene faith and agrees with all the ancient writes who he tells us hold the son to be in some sense inferior to the father and that even with regard to his divine nature the father says he is the first person the son the second the father they all represent as unbegotten receiving his being and attributes from none but himself the son they teach to be god of god begotten of the father and receiving his nature etc from the father but yet coeternal and coequal with the father receiving from him from all eternity the same entire and individed essence is not this language inaccurate incongruous and selfcontradictory many passages both in ancient and modern writers are exceptionable on the same grounds to select a few the learned bp bull gives in his own words the following sentiment of petavius nam ut recte petavius non potest filius a patre gigni nisi ab eo naturam ac deitatem accipit etc st hillary as quoted by the same author says in libro de synodis patri subjectus est filius ut auctori russinus in his treatise on the creed calls the father the head of the son cum ipse filius sit omnium caput ipsius tamen caput est pater and damascenus in his tract de fide orthodoxa has the following words  and st austin argute pro more suo according to bp bulls remark observes in a discourse on a passage in st matthews gospel if i mistake not as follows insinuatur nobis in patre auctoritas in filio nativitas in spiritu sancto communitas in tribus aequalitas it is bp bulls own remark unicum esse in trinitate principium principii expers nempe patrem dogma fuisse in primaeva ecclesia tam fixum  ut in quadrigesimo nono canonum qui dicuntur apostolorum damnetur quisquis baptizaverit in tres principii expertes  under the same article the learned prelate observes that the ancient fathers and those of the nicene council and athanasius himself never scrupled to give the appellation or title of the one only god to the father let the reader take his own words denique veteres deum patrem eo quod principium causa auctor et fons filii sit unum illum et solum deum appellare non sunt veriti sic enim ipsi patres nicaeni exordiuntur suum symbolum q v et magnus athanasius quo nemo melius intellexit synodi nicaenae mentem etc concedit patrem jure dici  quod solus ingenitus sit etc propter patrem vivit filius says st ambrose as quoted by bishop pearson quod ex patre filius est propter patrem quod eructatum est verbum ex patris cord quod a patre processit quod ex paterno generatus est utero etc dr fiddes gives us a passage from st hilary in which that father asserts that our making the son god is no objection against the fathers being the one god he is the one god says he because the only underived god surely bp pearson himself who in the main is wonderfully exact does not speak in the most proper terms when he tells us that the father of our lord jesus christ is originally god as not receiving his eternal being from any other that therefore it necessarily follows that jesus christ who is certainly not the father cannot be a person subsisting in the divine nature originally of himself and consequently it having been already proved that he is truly and properly the eternal god that he must be understood to have the godhead communicated to him by the father who is not only eternally but originally god that in him christ is the same fullness of the godhead more than which the father cannot have but yet that in that perfect and absolute equality there is notwithstanding this disparity etc etc to adduce only one example more even the judicious hooker is off his guard in the following passage seeing therefore the father alone is originally that deity which christ originally is not for christ is god by being of god light by issuing out of light it follows hereupon that whatsoever christ has common unto him with his heavenly father the same of necessity must be given him but naturally and eternally given him not bestowed by way of benevolence etc  the priority implied in the term father in its common acceptance accounts for all this incoherency but where i would gladly know do the terms auctor fons origo principium etc occur in the scriptures or in the writings of the apostolical fathers clemens polycarp and ignatius or where are any terms to be found importing subordination and inferiority except such as evidently refer to the humanity of jesus christ and after all and all this put together notwithstanding the common resemblances by which the great mystery has been faintly illustrated by the fathers especially by justin martyr tertullian and origin as light from the sun or a stream from a fountain are produced to no purpose as proofs of a subordination etc for let light be supposed to have issued from the sun or a stream from a fountain from all eternity on this supposition it is plain causality and originality are merely nominal the fountain necessarily implies the stream and the sun light and in like manner in the case before us the existence of the father necessarily supposes the existence of the son and of the holy ghost the father can no more exist without the son than the son without the father  the truth is the fathers of the church whose sentiments bp bull lays before us apparently grant much but really yield nothing if athanasius e g asserting the eternity and divinity of the son of god meant not such an absolute coequality as entirely excludes all dependence and inferiority he flatly contradicts the creed which goes under his name in which it is expressly said that in the trinity none is before or after other none is greater or less than another and if he did mean this we cannot argue against his faith from the carelessness or the impropriety or even the absurdity of his expressions elucidation has before now been the parent of entanglement the arians themselves are sensible they cannot admit the eternity of the son of god without acknowleging at the same time his absolute coequality and therefore affect to understand every passage or phrase seemingly derogating from the dignity of jesus christ as a direct assertion or tacit concession that he is a creature through a most strange inadvertence the writers we have been extracting from appear to have confounded the idea of temporal with that of eternal generation  it has been frequently and well observed that most of the fathers before the council of nice speak sometimes of a temporal generation of the son by the operation of the holy ghost on the blessed virgin and sometimes by a sort of catachresis give the name of generation to the mission of the son from the father for the purpose of creating the world and that by directing our whole attention to the passages relative to both these the enemies of our faith have artfully attempted to prevent our notice or acknowlegment of other numberless places in the writings of these fathers wherein they plainly and unequivocally assert the eternal generation of the son of god  by help of these considerations and such as these we shall for the most part be enabled to reconcile exceptionable passages in the writings of the fathers in general with the purest faith and strictest orthodoxy and shall have no cause for resentment or complaint if in so large a bulk of human composition and amidst such a multiplicity of subjects and circumstances we are sometimes surprised by inaccurate diction or unsound sentiment  the supposed canon referred to by bp bull which forbad the baptizing  on pain of damnation really maintains only the doctrine of the athana cr viz that there is one father not three fathers tertullian says somewhere that there was a time quando filius dei non erat which is true in the second or third sense of sonship as there was a time when god was not a creator viz ante mundum conditum nay there is an expression in lactantius which more than insinuates that there was a time when even god the father or god absolutely considered was not for says he deus ipse se fecit and by the way they who talk of god the fathers receiving his being from himself alone do but paraphrase the words of lactantius i cannot think the catholic faith can be in the least affected by these early opinions concerning jesus christ  metaphysical subtleties technical terms and unscriptural definitions and distinctions have undoubtedly done no small disservice to the cause of christianity but as dr waterland repeatedly observes let the blame be laid at the right door these things were artfully and gradually introduced into the church by heretics for the purpose of confounding and perplexing matters the ancient christians rested solely on the authority of scripture and the concurrent voice of tradition see barrow on the popes supremacy p     the church believed in the trinity believed in the father and in the son and in the holy ghost and worshipped all three as one god before the distinction was expressed by the term persons or the word substance was made use of it does not appear says dr w that the word trinity was yet applied to this case viz in justin martyrs time in the middle of the second century the orthodox were necessitated to contend against their adversaries with their own weapons and what is worse terms of art have been the fuel of strife amongst the orthodox themselves it was a mere dispute of words which had like to have occasioned an irreparable breach between the eastern and western churches take the following account of it in the words of dr potter the orientals says he professing to believe three hypostases in the glorious trinity would not admit three persons and were therefore thought to be arians on the contrary the western believing three persons could not be induced to confess three hypostases and thereupon were taken to be sabellians here was a great jealousy grounded upon a great error which athanasius easily discovered and restored again their good amity and intelligence showing that they differed not in

puerile illustrations and playfulness of distinction according to t aquinas trinitas est quasi trium unitas it is somewhere observed likewise by this famous doctor that the father is the beginning but

worth observing that this translation by no means does justice to the original or any thing like so forcibly imports the equality in question  he called god his own father as dr whitby and dr hammond

is the more remarkable as our translators attended to the same emphatical word in the only place besides where it occurs and where its significance is not so obvious he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things romans viii    the socinian evasion of the passage in st john is inexpressibly ridiculous and reduces it almost to

spirits says this very sensible writer are intended the holy spirit of god who is one in his person but his gifts and graces are various and therefore he is signified by this number because of the fullness and perfection of them and with respect to the seven churches over whom he presided whom he influenced and sanctified etc  the ethiopic version this author observes reads from the seven spirits which are before the throne of jesus christ  it is farther a remark of the same author that the second person is last mentioned in the benediction before us because many things were to be said

cannot easily conceive how the production of angels should be so much inferior to our saviors temporal generation supposing he had no other  it will corroborate what has already been advanced to remark farther that if jesus christ be any thing less than very god by eternal generation he was abundantly over paid for all he did and suffered for our sakes he was recompensed beyond all measure by his exaltation to the right hand of the majesty on high and by the divine honor and worship which has been universally ascribed and paid to him under this view of the matter the assumption of humanity deserves not the name of a condescension in his human capacity indeed jesus christ for the joy that was set before him endured the cross and despised the shame but in his divine he could have no respect to the recompense of a reward this is a thought which has been started and pursued by several writers equidem rem attentius perpendenti says bp bull liquebit ex hypothesi sive sociniana sive

presumption which is greatly confirmed by the strictness of the apostolical canons which as dr cave acquaints us order him bishop or priest that neglects the trine immersion to be deposed afterward says the same learned author to obviate the pretenses of the arians who used the trine immersion to denote the persons in the trinity to be three distinct substances the fourth council of toledo in their fifth canon decreed that a single immersion would be sufficient that the dipping under water would express christs death and burial or descent into hell and the coming out his resurrection the single immersion expressing the unity while the trinity of persons would be sufficiently noted by the form of words in baptism to this effect dr cave  it is but reasonable to make allowances for the zeal or if you will the simplicity of the devout christians of the first ages in process of time and as the christian world grew darker and more corrupt many ceremonies and customs became acts of

on the epist of ignatius which strongly mark the human nature of jesus christ might one should think direct us to the sense we are to put upon such as are relative to his divine the perfect godhead and perfect manhood of our savior seem to me to be forcibly contrasted in this discrimination it had been better perhaps if divines had rested wholly in this one general distinction we can hardly be copious without being obscure at best on the subject of the hypostatic union but we must not yet dismiss the passage before us  in the first dialogue of theodoret which vossius refers to in his note at this place there is a remarkable variation of reading instead of made and not made or born and unborn  see note at p     of parkhursts divin of jesus christ it there runs  it seems athanasius and gelasius in his treatise de duabus naturis defend the first reading but both come to the same point jesus christ was made and not made born and unborn except in a mysterious and transcendent sense he was the eternal son of god or he was made or born of a woman through the operation of the holy ghost who came upon her who was unmade and unborn he was both of mary and of god the latter clause being a kind of paraphrase on the former and so in effect ignatius asserts here both the personality and the eternal existence of the spirit  there is another paragraph in this epistle to the ephesians wherein omniscience an essential property of the godhead appears to be attributed in the fullest terms to jesus christ   jesus christ is signified by the word  wherever it occurs in the epistles of this father i believe without exception and the context evidently patronises this application arch bp wake seems to have overlooked the plain scope of this passage his translation runs there is nothing hid from god etc  i had the satisfaction to find my sentiments exactly coinciding with those of bp bull upon this very paragraph his words are these de christo loqui ignatium indubium est non modo ex voce  qua christum ubique designat sed etiam ex toto sermonis contextu de jesu servatore duntaxat agente  and it is yet farther observable that the introductory part of this epistle as vossius has remarked is rather obscure and that however it happened the most rev translator has not done full justice to the plainest expression in it the blood of christ in the translation is in the original simply the blood of god   bulls defen fid nicae cap   sect   igna epis to the ephesians sect   and    barrow on the cr p     see john   v     page     o in it proper place in matters not of faith but merely of opinion these venerable fathers in general are not altogether without peculiarities which are tinctured a little with the pious fancifulness of superstition this is more especially apparent in their notion of spiritual references and emblematical representations  the scarletline which the spies directed rahab to fix to her window etc is specified by st clement himself epist to the corin sect    and by some others as typical of the redemption of mankind by the blood of jesus christ but of all of them except st barnabas origin is perhaps the largest dealer in symbol and allegory as has often been pointed out in numerous instances although it would be as unreasonable to object this in order to disparage the grounds of our common faith as it would be to except with the same view against the eccentricity of some of this fathers tenets or those of any others in any other respects as e g that helltorments will not be eternal for which assertion he had certainly no scriptural warrant or that the angel with whom jacob wrested was an evil one which was likewise a notion of origens or that souls after their separation from bodies retain many corporeal properties as irenaeus and tertullian imagined etc etc in truth orthodoxy may be said to be built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone and has no concern with these particularities and much less with the conceits which the luxuriance of piety itself has sometimes given birth to the father i last named whimsically asserted that the devil invented buskins that a man might add to his stature notwithstanding what our savior says to the contrary and gravely informs us in another place that this prince of darkness or one of his infernal ministers upon being exorcised out of a certain woman who was a frequenter of stageentertainments complained loudly that he was dispossessed of his property the theater being his own ground clemens of alexandria advises us to lay our heads upon stone as jacob did in order to our having visions etc etc but of such harmless extravagance infidelity strives in vain to avail itself  whether st barnabas who was st pauls companion and fellow laborer was the author of the catholic epistle to which his name is prefixed is a question undecided at this day much has been urged on this subject pro and con by learned men nor am i concerned to inquire on which side the arguments preponderate it will suffice to say that many have thought the allegorical interpretation of scripture with which the performance abounds by far too imaginary or indeed too trifling for the pen of one of the minor apostles as vossius calls him this able critic is however a strong advocate for him and the primitive fathers in general and gives it as his clear opinion that nothing of this kind in him or in st clement from whom he extracts the particulars above noticed ought in reason to be alleged to the discredit of their writings his words are these quis a primis illis christianis omnigenam scientiam et doctrinam expostulet quis illos non aeque hallucinatos existimet atque eorum nepotes praesertim in rebus nihil ad fidem pertinentibus nunquid et in epistola clementis similia occurrunt quis enim bono animo concoquere possit fabellam illam quam de phoenice narrat etc non puto etiam quemquam velle admittere expositionem istam ut linteum coccineum rahab meretricis n b many are of opinion that rahab was no harlot signum fuerit sanguinis christi etc atqui tamen iste clemens pari jure atque barnabas dictus est apostolus non debent itaque in hoc reprehendere quod in altero excusant vossii notae ad barnabae epist cathol but it should be remembered all this while that vossius vindicates the authenticity of st barnabass epistle so called by a very unequal comparison the epistle of st clement and those of other fathers are interspersed more or less with typical application but they are not distinguished by it see st barnabass epist particularly sect                i would take this opportunity to observe that the doctrine of types and symbols as it has been revived by many moderns so has it by some been upheld with a zeal which in going beyond the bounds of judgment has it may be done disservice to christianity let me ask the most sanguin advocates for symbols and prefigurations how they relish this mode of speculation in the romanists when among the arguments which they adduce in pretended proof of st peters primacy they tell us his ship out of which the lord taught the people was an emblem or type of the christian church in short the doctrine of types in general is in my opinion too often at best more ingenious than solid and has a stronger foundation in fancy than in fact perhaps the reader may be entertained as well as convinced by two or three select instances the coat of the jewish high priest says dr lightfoot fitly resembled christs human nature first as this was of one stuff without mixture so that without sin etc secondly as this was put on after an extraordinary manner so christ put on humanity by an extraordinary conception thirdly as was the edge about the hole to keep it from rending such was the unseparable union of christs two natures fourthly as were the bells and pomegranates such were his life and doctrine another learned writer mr mede speaking of the manna and the rock in the wilderness which are mentioned by st paul as types of christ   cor  0 v     expatiates in the following words as manna came from heaven beside the ordinary course of nature so christs birth was wonderful etc as manna was of a most sweet taste so is christ unto the soul etc as manna was of a white color so our savior was white and pure as manna before it was eaten was brayed in a mortar etc so was christ our heavenly manna broken upon the cross etc as the rock gave no water before it was smitten with the rod of moses so was christ smitten upon the cross that out of him might flow that sovereign stream which he who drinks shall never thirst as the rock was smitten with the rod of moses so was christ our redeemer with the rod of the law etc with much more to this effect according to a modern author mr calcott the jewish tabernacle or temple was a type of the body of christ the table the shewbread etc were all emblematical and significative of the properties etc of jesus christ dwelling in a tabernacle of flesh the table e g was compounded of two sorts of materials wood and gold and it was a piece of furniture which exhibited a compound person etc it was a type of that person who should be compounded of jehovah and adam god and man in mr batess faith of the ancient jews the right ear is made to stand for obedience the thumb of the right hand for actions the

p minor authority the epistles from which the extracts are made if we except the last have ever been held by the church in general in the highest estimation they were written by men who it is well known were intimately acquainted with the apostles polycarp was a disciple of st john and his epistle to the philippians with the first of st clement to the corinthians were for several centuries publicly read in the churches of asia see chapter  0 of wakes discourse prefixed to his translation of these epistles their authority therefore is little inferior to apostolical  i will transcribe a

this doctrine by a multitude of testimonies from p    to p  0 and according to him jesus christ is filius dei existens semper apud patrem  it may be proper to take notice in this place that the equality we are contending for is not in the lest disturbed by the disagreement betwixt the greek and latin church with respect to the procession of the holy ghost the doctrine of the former was that the holy ghost proceeds from the father by the son and is the spirit of the son non ex filio sed spiritum filii esse dicimus et patris per filium this doctrine is erroneous indeed but innocently so for as archbp laud see laud against fisher p    and many others have observed the question whether the holy ghost proceeds a filio or per filium is but a question in modo loquendi a mere difference in words and affects not the faith and therefore i cannot think bp tailor argues heartily or logically in the following passage the procession of the holy ghost from the son which is an article the greek church disavows derives from the tradition apostolical as it is pretended and yet before st austin we hear nothing of it very clearly or certainly forasmuch as that whole mystery concerning the blessed spirit was so little explicated in scripture and so little derived to them by tradition that till the council of nice you shall hardly find any form of worship or personal address of devotion to the holy spirit as erasmus observes and i think the contrary will very hardly be verified bp tailor on lib of pro sect   p  0 the holy ghost is expressly styled by st peter the spirit of christ which in the next sentence is said to have been sent down from heaven   pet   v  0    and i take it to be fully as presumeable that the article of the procession in question was grounded in the construction which this passage naturally admits as that it derived from tradition apostolical notwithstanding the immaterial disagreement abovementioned but whether this difference with respect to the mode of procession took its rise from different construction or from diferent tradition the faith both of the greek and latin church in the third person of the trinity was still built on a sure foundation eternity of generation and procession and existence is equally inexplicable and though nothing was or in the nature of things could be explicated in scripture in respect of the whole mystery yet i apprehend enough was revealed even if the first christians had not addressed the blessed spirit in any form of devotion at all this could not have been owing to their want of comprehension of the mode of procession but to their disbelief of his personality and eternal existence but that the primitive christians and the antenicene fathers believed the personality and eternal existence of the spirit and consequently his coequality with the father and the son sufficiently i trust appears from the testimonies produced and therefore admitting that most of the prayers of the church were addressed to the father and few only to the son and fewer to the holy ghost which is far from being a matter unaccountable we have ample proofs that christians worshipped one god in trinity and trinity in unity erasmus does not venture to assert that no addresses were made to the holy ghost and if he had we might confront him with the above cited declaration of justin martyr which at least supposes this divine person to have been included and frequently named in the supplications of the first christians  etc  but we are by no means destitute of ancient testimonies to the same effect the accounts of the martyrdom of ignatius and polycarp conclude with ascriptions of glory etc to the father and the son and the holy ghost see wake s relation of these martyrdoms p         the relation of the sufferings of the former closes with these words who trod under foot the devil and perfected the course he had piously desired in christ jesus our lord by whom and with whom all glory and power be to the father with the blessed spirit for ever and ever the epistle of the church of smyrna to the church of philadelphia concerning the martyrdom of polycarp concludes as follows we wish you brethren all happiness by living according to the rule of the gospel of jesus christ with whom glory be to god the father and the holy spirit etc in clemens of alexandria there is a prayer and doxology to the trinity in these words be merciful unto thy children o master o father etc o son and father both one o lord grant that we may pass the waves of this troublesome world continually praising and giving thanks to the only father and son to the son and father to the son our master and teacher together with the holy ghost altogether one in whom are all things etc etc add to this that the doxologies in the ancient liturgies were some of them expressed in fuller and stronger terms than that used in our daily services  it is affirmed by mr lindsey in his apology that the fathers of the three first centuries were all what we now call arians or socinians we might ask this gentleman in the words of dathan etc but on much better grounds will thou put out the eyes of christians the assertion has hardly its fellow in the whole circle of polemical divinity let these venerable fathers speak for themselves i take this opportunity to put the reader in mind of the same gentlemans very disingenuous translation of that passage in justin martyrs dialogue with trypho where he tells him that there were those who admitted christ to be the messiah though they believed him to be mere man the whole passage is perfectly scrutinized and a shameful omission of mr lindsey taken notice of in mr bingham s vindication of the doctrine etc of the church of england p          see also dr randolph s vindicat of the trinity part   p  0 and bp bull s judic eccles cathol cap  mo where he charges the remonstrants with mutilating and curtailing this very passage with what face will mr l lay socinianism or arianism at the door of justin martyr  the passage quoted from this father in the former part of this note is so strong and explicit that it probably gave occasion to some socinians to aver that he was the first who taught the doctrine of the trinity i said some socinians because as we have already noted most socinians and socinus himself fathers this doctrine upon the council of nice with an absurdity which is exposed at large by bp bull in his defense of that council this duplicity is no small argument of socinian distress  dr middleton in resentment i presume of that explicitness with which justin martyr in the place referred to and in many other asserts the doctrine of the trinity and with a view to counteract it takes much pains to represent his interpretation of scripture as frequently absurd and his doctrine as neither more nor less than refined platonism but the unfairness or rather the falsity of both imputations has often been shown the triad of plato whose admirer etc this holy father it is well known before his conversion was the mundane animative and intelligent nature of god although it has been mentioned by some improperly but honestly enough to illustrate the doctrine in question with an intention to adapt it in some degree to our apprehensions could not possibly give rise to it it is as clear as words can make it that justin the martyr was a trinitarian on principles very different from those of justin the philosopher dr m most uncandidly vilifies the typical and allegorical representations which occur often in this primitive writer and in which probably he gratified not so much his own taste as that of those early ages  dr whitby in his treatise entitled an endeavor to evince the certainty of christian faith etc cites historians of credit who acquaint us that when julians design of falsifying the predictions of our savior by rebuilding the temple of jerusalem was defeated by miraculous eruptions of balls of fire etc as the story is told by ammianus marcellinus and many others almost all the jews who were eyewitnesses of this wonderful scene were converted to the christian faith and acknowleged christ to be god the writers referred to are sozomen nazianzen and socrates and the following passage seems to be as plain and decisive as can be wished   it seems evident enough from these words that the jews who were converted on this occasion and consequently christians in general at that time acknowledged jesus christ to be absolutely god  indeed the truth of this great doctrine is in some measure inferrible from the incredibility formerly objected to it by its adversaries  says celsus and trypho speaks rather resentingly in the following words to justin   agreably to this the same trypho declares that to assert christ to have been born of a virgin is  now i desire to ask whether the doctrine of a miraculous birth and bodily appearance of an inferior deity for any supposable purpose whatever be not sufficiently reconcilable both with jewish and pagan principles and with what we know to have been the sentiments of julian himself or whether we are not in all reason to look for the chief ground of difference between justin and trypho in the coequality we are asserting this will appear yet more clearly in a subsequent note it is in short this equality which constituted superstitionis novae genus as christianity is called by suetonius in the life of nero  dr wills in his first discourse prefixed to sir rog lestranges translation of josephus says that pilate wrote to tiberius de christo deo but where does he find this the acts of pilate so called are confessedly spurious  celsus apud orig l   justin s dial p     lactantius l   c    and     page     q the atheism the venom of this calumny soon spent itself and the honorable and oftennoted testimony of pliny in his letter to trajan that the christians were a simple and innocent people who worshipped christ as god at once vindicates their morals and declares their faith  the fact was the primitive christians like their immediate predecessors the apostles were reviled defamed and made as the filth of the world and the offscouring of all things they were charged with the most detestable vices with rebellion murder incest etc and to free them from these infamous reproaches was one main business of the fathers in general and especially of justin martyr athenagoras and tertullian  whitby s endeavor etc chapter   p      page     r principles of polytheism hesiod makes mention of many thousand deities and varro of three hundred jupiters but both with a reservation of the properties and prerogatives of the supreme god these subaltern deities were supposed to act as his instruments and under his direction some of the wiser heathens however were ashamed of this latitudinarian system and pretended to resolve their theology into allegory etc as zeno chrysippus and other stoics and philosophers of later date found it necessary to have recourse to the same expedient to elude the charge brought against the multitude of the heathen gods by christians with respect to the pagan notion of a subordination of deities we may affirm in the words of dr heylin that god is not only unus but unicus or in the phrase of mr hooker that our god is one or rather very oneness in which essential unity says he a trinity personal subsisteth  it will be well worth remarking that the doctrine of the trinity has often been represented as having no little color or countenance both from jewish and pagan principles a ross see note at no    in his view of all religions etc undertakes to show that the doctrine of the trinity was not unknown even by the light of nature to the gentile philosophers poets etc zoroastres says he speaks of the father who having perfected all things has delivered them to the second mind which mind has received from the father knowledge and power here is a plain testimony of the first and second person concerning the third zoroastres says that the divine love proceeded from the mind or intellect and what else is this divine love but the holy ghost he then proceeds to lay before the reader the principles of the chaldean magi who acknowleged three beginnings to wit ormases mitris and ariminis i e god the mind and soul he observes that pythagoras was not ignorant of this mystery when he placed all perfection in the number three and made love the original of all things he gives us the sentiments of zeno socrates numenius plotinus and many others who write very plainly of the hypostases etc so that no christian can write more fully  let us hear now what a much better known and an universally admired author has to offer upon the same argument from the three divine attributes of infinite goodness wisdom and power the pythagoreans and platonists seem to have framed their trinity of what dr cudworth calls archichal hypostases to which he supposes aristotle may be thought to allude in the following passage in his book de caelo l   c    the pythagoreans   in another place this learned author gives us to understand that zoroastres and the ancient magi acknowleged the supreme deity under the different names of mithras and oromasius which mithras was commonly called  or threefold this it seems j vossius would refer to the three hypostases in the deity agreeably to the christian theory but cudworth thinks it to be more conformable to the pythagoric or platonic hypothesis of three distinct substances subordinate to each other this writer observes elsewhere that pagan theology in general maintained a trinity of universal principles or divine hypostases subordinate the  or  en called  and  or intellect  the second god and the mundane soul or animated world  the third god according to the same author the crocodile was a symbol of the first god of the egyptians an animal which when in the water sees without being seen and among the same people a winged globe with a serpent springing out of it was the hieroglyphic of a triform deity or trinity of divine hypostases by the globe was signified the first incomprehensible deity without beginning or end selfexistent etc by the serpent the divine wisdom and creative virtue and by the wings that active spirit which quickens enlivens and cherishes all things  let us see now what was the theology of julian and the latter platonists this famous apostate maintained that the inferior gods were ministers of a supreme god he asserted that this supreme god or first deity and fountain of all things produced from himself an eternal mind and a corporeal or sensible animated sun as a great god in the visible world the latter platonists in opposition to christianity held that before the trinity there was another supreme and highest hypostasis existing and remaining in the solitude of his own unity as dr cudworth literally translates the words of jamblicus this must at least be allowed to be language somewhat more intelligible than that of those old platonists who taught that there is a substance a principle in the order of nature superior to intellect they suppose this first and highest principle of all to be by reason of its absolute and transcendent perfection not only above understanding knowledge and reason but above essence itself which by the way was the heresy of a joachim condemned by the fourth lateran council our author very justly calls this visionary doctrine mysterious atheism and it seems to have been adopted by that fantastic heretic valentinus whose thirty gods or aeons were the production or offspring of a selforiginated deity whom he calls bythus or  i e unfathomable profundity or according to some of profundity and silence even the theory of hesiod whether literally or physiologically understood is much more agreeable to truth and the mosaic history this old bard makes chaos and earth and tartarus and love the principles of all things theogon v     and seq in short the philosophy we have been just speaking of absolutely refines away all religion and the very belief of a god because divinity in the abstract can no more be said to produce to act or to govern etc than wisdom can be said to be wise or motion to move  at best little solid or consistent can be extracted from this medley of principles and if we understand by a trinity what in reason we ought to understand by it viz a trinity of three efficient living intelligent persons the sovereign causes and rulers of all things to use the words of a learned see extract from an anonymous author quoted by dr randolph in his vindica p    etc writer we shall look in vain for such a doctrine properly and precisely taught before the epoch of christianity it is certain the ancient pagan theology derived partly from tradition and partly from judaism in the doctrines of the latter we are to look for the rise and foundation of the principal tenets of the philosophers whose names have been mentioned of whom some are known to have had communications with the jews what then were the sentiments of these descendants of abraham heretofore with respect to the great doctrine before us the question is a material one and unless i greatly mistake the solution of it will terminate in a very satisfactory conclusion  christian writers differ but little in what they have advanced upon this head to take a few of them as they fall in our way wollebius lays down the following principle as an indubitable one etsi veteris testamenti tempore doctrina s s trinitatis obscurior fuerit non tamen plane ignota fuit he then quotes the first chap of genesis and other passages in the old testament in common with other authors in support of his position or his canon as he calls it and finishes the paragraph in the following words quae testimonia tametsi pertinaces judaei eludere satagunt christianae tamen menti satisfaciunt the learned dr lightfoots sentiments on this subject which mr parkhurst has adopted or rather with particular warmth espoused are as follows  the very first thing says he that is taught in all the bible see genesis         etc is this very mystery god created god i e the word said and the spirit i e the holy ghost moved so moses also when he is to teach concerning the creation of man he first teaches that it was the trinity that created him and god said let us make man after our image he says let us to show the trinity of persons and he says in our image not in our images to show the unity of essence the trinity is supposed by dr l to be declared in many places even at v   of deuteronomy   hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one dr l gives this as the true reading which says he teaches the trinity in unity and unity in trinity three words answer the three persons and the middle word our god deciphering fitly the second who assumed our nature this learned writer supposes the same mystery to be imported in the following among many other texts exo    v   isa   v   psalms  0 v       v        indeed jesus christ is by the almost unanimous suffrage of writers the jehovah of the old testament the angel of the covenant the angel who appeared to moses at the bush the chief of the angels who were entertained by abraham etc is generally supposed to have been the second person in the sea particularly allix bull justin martyr irenaeus and tertullian trinity a sensible writer endeavors to prove that the doctrine of the trinity is contained in the law and that it is in fact acknowleged and asserted by the jewish rabbis by philo and maimonides etc the jewish cabalists says he distinguish god into three lights and some of them call them by the same names as the christians of the father the word and the holy spirit and yet say that this does not at all break the unity of god your famous philo says he expresses the same in many places and he produces a considerable number of instances by which it appears that this celebrated rabbin at least lays himself open to the attacks of every christian adversary  to the same effect dr randolph quotes a remarkable passage from eusebius in which it is observed that according to the doctrine of the jews there is after the essence of god etc a principle begotten of no other but the father being firstbegotten etc being the image of god the power of god the wisdom of god and the word of god the true light the sun of righteousness etc etc  there are two striking passages the one in the book of proverbs and the other in the apocryphal book entitled the wisdom of solomon which have been pretty generally considered as designative of the second person in the christian trinity i was set up from everlasting or ever the earth was when he prepared the heavens i was there when he appointed the foundations of the earth then was i by him as one brought up with him etc prove   v    etc when all things were in quiet silence thine almighty word leapt down from heaven out of thy royal throne etc etc wisd    v    etc  the anonymous author of the testaments of the twelve patriarchs who as dr grabe supposes wrote at the latter end of the second century makes every one of them foretell the coming of the messiah and most of them in the plainest terms the incarnation of the son of god or rather simply of god  all this put together intricate or incoherent as it may appear will be thought most clearly to import a trinity of some kind in the godhead and we may accordingly discern in a moment wherein lies the precise difference between the pagan the jewish the arian and the true christian theory by the hypothesis of each of the three former the supreme god neither is nor can be more than one person by that of the latter the deity consists of three persons and one undivided essence this as manifestly resists the idea of dependence and inferiority as the other is compatible with it or rather under the notion of a trinity supposes it in short it will i presume be no easy matter to say what objection of weight jews and gentiles pythagoreans and platonists could have made to the gospel what obstacle there was to their becoming obedient to the faith without delay except that the universally adopted principle of subordination was superseded and effectually destroyed by the peculiarly christian doctrine of equality  perhaps i shall be thought to take upon me here the character of moderator in the dispute between mr parkhurst and dr priestly i had no such intention but if what has been offered does not exactly coincide with the notions of the former it will at least in the result be subversive of the principles of the latter the christian doctrine of an equal trinity will be established by the acknowlegement of a plurality of any kind respecting the godhead by jews ancient or modern or both with regard to the notions of philo etc see howes s remarks in vindication of the ancient fathers etc p       and seq  it is observable in conformity herewith that the fathers in general consider the doctrine of the trinity in the sense of the catholic church as that which characteristically discriminates christianity both from judaism and heathenism with respect to the former tertullian has these remarkable words judaicae fidei est res sic unum deum credere ut filium adnumera re ei nolis et post filium spiritum quid enim erit inter nos et illos nisi

one god it is the tenet of all true mussulmen says the author of mahometism explained that the most abandoned sinners that ever existed shall be saved provided they shall once during their lives have testified the unity of god by pronouncing that fundamental article of the mussulman belief there is no god but allah and mahomet is his apostle this i conceive must be understood with some restriction and supposes no apostasy subsequent to the attestation in question for the famous mohammedan doctor algazali in his comment on these two capital articles of their faith delivers himself in the following words he shall also believe that they that confess one god shall at length go out of the fire after they have underwent the punishment due to their sins so that by the favorable mercy of god no person shall remain in hell who acknowleged the unity of the godhead  the first mussulmen gloried in the title of unitarians upon every occasion some of them carried their zeal for the grand article of their religion to a degree of savage ferocity we have a notable example of this in the history of the saracens at the siege of damascus in the reign of omar the second caliph after mahomet abuobeidah the commander of the saracen army had granted quarter to certain citizens which was a piece of lenity so exasperating to derar an officer of very high rank as to draw from him a declaration seconded by the solemnity of an oath that for his part he would never have mercy upon any that said that god had a son and joined a partner with god  we learn from the anonymous author of four treatises etc who assures us he derives his authorities from writers of the first class that the mahometans carry this unitarian principle with them literally to their graves his account of their funeral solemnities is entertaining enough but the following are the only particulars with which we are at all concerned at the interment of a mussulman the muezzin or crier must go before the corpse reciting with a loud voice there is no god but very god at the close of the whole ceremony the defunct is addressed by the priest in these words be mindful of the covenant with which thou have gone out of this world bearing witness that there is no god but very god alone and that mahomet is his prophet and that paradise is for certain and fire for certain and the resurrection for certain etc etc  how shall we reconcile all this with mr lockes assertion that to the light which the messiah brought into the world with him we must ascribe the owning and profession of one god which the mohammedan religion has derived and borrowed from it strange assertion the mohammedan faith is this that there is one person in the godhead the catholic faith is this that there are three persons in one godhead

p    i cannot think bp tailor expresses himself with accuracy and much less with true casuistical precision in the following passage extracted by dr w lowth from the ductor dubitantium if we be sent to read the laws of nature in the tables of our own hearts where some things are disordered by passion many more are written by interest some are indicted by custom and others imprinted by education

our behavior in some of the weightiest concerns of life the inscriptions of passion interest and custom etc are not those original impressions which are still legible and sufficiently distinguishable by a candid and inquisitive mind the law of nature abstractedly considered is still what bp cumberland calls it  that obnoxiousness to error from which men of the brightest parts and the greatest professional abilities are not exempt is to writers in general at once an encouraging and an humbling circumstance  the corruption of human reason and the ignorance and error incident to our understandings has says a most excellent author given manifold occasion for the benign interposition of divine providence which in compassion to the frailty the imperfection and the blindness of human reason has been pleased at sundry times and in diverse manners to discover and enforce its laws by an immediate and direct revelation the doctrines thus delivered we call the revealed or divine law and they are to be found only in the scriptures these precepts when revealed are found upon comparison to be really a part of the original law of nature as they tend in all their consequences to mans felicity but we are not from hence to conclude that the knowledge of these truths was attainable by reason in its present corrupted state since we find that until they were revealed they were hid from the wisdom of ages as then the moral precepts of this law are indeed of the same original with those of the law of nature so their intrinsic obligation is of equal strength and perpetuity yet undoubtedly the revealed law is of infinitely more authenticity than that moral system which is framed by ethical writers and denominated the natural law because one is the law of nature expressly declared so to be by god himself the other is only what by the assistance of human reason we imagine to be that law if we could be as certain of the latter as we are of the former both would have an equal authority but till then they can never be put in any competition municipal law is a rule of civil conduct this distinguishes municipal law from the natural or revealed the former of which is the rule of moral conduct and the latter not only the rule of moral conduct but also the rule of faith see commen on the laws of england sect   p      these periods seem to have slipped from the pen the scriptures are the revelation of divine or supernatural truths but of the original law of nature they are only the revival or republication they plainly declare that to be the will of god which in the times of ignorance and corruption might rather be said to have been obtruded upon the world than recommended to it as the will of god by the philosophers they teach that by authority which before reason only dictated or opinion espoused so that now every species of immorality is totally without excuse properly speaking it is not the divine will but the divine nature which was hid from the wisdom of ages for though we have in scripture only the sure word of morality yet socrates plato and tully as far as they taught truly taught the morality of scripture in a word revelation is necessarily the rule of conduct but directly and immediately the rule of faith  the passages just cited interfered with the argument before me and i am happy in the opportunity hereby given me to

had the most exalted sentiments and as a learned author expresses it came nearest to the truth he was indeed conversant in the jewish law to such a degree as to be described under the character of

grotius    but it may be this eulogy is premature in the sacred commentary of the persian rites the following words says sir isaac newton are ascribed to zoroastres o   etc  this says he was the ancient god of the persian magi the same great author acquaints us that hystaspes father of darius was cofounder of the religion of the persian empire with zoroastres which religion says he was composed parley of the institutions of the chaldaeans in which zoroastres was well skilled and partly of the institutions of the ancient brachmans who are supposed to derive even their name from the abrahamans or sons of abraham born of his second wife keturah and instructed by their father in the worship of one god without images etc see newton s chronol chapter   p   0      one is almost afraid to say this consummate philosopher could himself be mistaken in this or in any matter could possibly be liable to the weakness of inadvertence or the littleness of prepossession yet the author of the essay on spirit makes use of sir is newtons words when he declares that god is a relative term which has reference to subjects surely it has been observed with great truth that of all terms the term god is perhaps the most absolute it is the name of the supreme selfexistent being independently on ten thousand creations we know not wherein the essential happiness of the deity consists but we know that the mere production of worlds contributes nothing to it it is true god is our creator our king our father etc but does he stand related to us under these characters by necessity or by bounty of grace we worship him as our maker we honor him as our sovereign we fear him as our judge we love him as our father etc etc but before the great day of universal manifestation we shall not see him and even then most probably shall but imperfectly see him as he is  page   0 y proof upon proof the refinements of learned men have disserved the cause they wished to promote according to the traditions of the chinese as european missionaries have represented them confucius their great philosopher who lived above five hundred years before christ used often to say it is in the west that the true saint is to be found and even before him it was a saying of laokun that eternal reason produced one one produced two two produced three and three produced all things how far the conclusion of simpliciuss comment upon epictetus may deserve more attention i will not determine it is to be found in dr cave s prim christian being a prayer in which mention is made of three persons the lord or father the savior or christ and the light of truth which even in scripture says dr c is a common periphrasis of the holy spirit if we may believe socrates in his ecclesiastical history as the same author refers to him ignatius heard the angels in a vision praising the trinity in alternate hymns etc which introduced alternate hymns into the church mr hooker seems inclined to suspect the authority of this story and it is certain nothing is said relative to such a vision in all the genuine epistles of this ancient father which are seven though in one of them viz that to the ephesians he talks of jesus christs being sung and of singing to the father by jesus christ sect   which makes the omission more extraordinary  the absolute divinity of jesus christ has with more haste than judgment been asserted by some from our saviors words to the leper i will be thou clean and by others from his power to forgive sins nothing in all this implying a selfinherent authority dr whitby quotes the following passage from a no less illustrious father than irenaeus with respect to the remitting power by remitting the sin etc he showed who he was for if none can remit sins but god and yet our lord did remit them etc it is manifest that he was both the word of god and the son of man receiving the power of remission from his father as god and man surely he could receive this power as man only  it is not my intention to derogate in the least from the merit of mr joness performance the catholic doctrine of a trinity which upon the whole is admirable and satisfactory his scriptural parallels are for the most part happy and his mode of reasoning is always ingenious and generally conclusive perhaps it rather fails in the application of the following text god was in christ reconciling the world to himself   cor       it is allowed on all hands says mr jones that the world was reconciled by christ jesus to the one only great and supreme god but this very same god for the word is but once used in the whole sentence was in christ manifest in the flesh and reconciling the world to himself and were there no other passage of scripture to be found this alone is sufficient to overthrow the whole doctrine of arianism which as far as the scripture is concerned depends upon this one assertion that the word god in scripture never signifies a complex notion of more persons than one but always means one person only viz either the person of the father singly or the person of the son singly which is absolutely false for here it signifies both the text considers god as agent and patient at the same time and upon the same occasion as the reconciler of the world in the person of the son and the object to whom the reconciliation was made in the person of the father yet there is but one word god to express them both so that the word god though of the singular number is of a plural comprehension and thus i find it to have been taken by some of the most eminent writers before the council of nice plasmatus in initio homo per manus dei id est filii et spiritus says irenaeus putting the singular name of god for the two persons of the son and spirit and the same word in the language of origin if we are allowed to take the version of ruffinus as genuine includes the whole three persons igitur de deo id est de patre et filio et spiritu sancto and our excellent church has used the word god in the same comprehensive sense as in the blessing after the communion service god almighty the father the son and the holy ghost i am afraid this is not so full an answer to the above assertion as was to be wished and that it is not absolutely sufficient for the overthrow of the whole doctrine of arianism in the first place dr clarkes proselytes will be apt to insist that the whole doctrine of arianism does not depend upon this one assertion and in the next place that if it did mr jones has advanced nothing here forcible enough to overthrow it it is true they will say god was in christ but in what sense why by his grace his influence and spiritual communications as he is likewise said to be in us and as christ is said to be in us and as we are said to be in god and to be in christ by the purity of our hearts and affections this they will tell us is plain simple theory without any wanton refinement or imaginary distinction of agent and patient etc and with regard to the authorities of irenaeus origin and the blessing in the communion service they will add that they cannot admit either a private sentiment or a public doctrine to be the standard of true chistianity  as this is specious enough it may be proper to disencumber ourselves from the weight of this same arian assertion by other considerations hac non successit alia progrediamur via  first then let it be observed that though the english word god be of the singular number yet the hebrew word elohim of which it is the translation is confessedly of a plural comprehension accordingly it has been demonstrated over and over again that the ancient jews held a plurality of some kind in the deity vid supr  but secondly we may recur to considerations still more internal and indisputable if it has been abundantly made to appear that the son is god and the holy ghost is god as properly and truly as the father is god the term god must unavoidably be acknowleged to include or to signify a complex notion of more persons than one in many places of holy writ it will suffice to produce a few instances the father is said to be in us   john      or to dwell in us or abide with us and the son is said to be in us etc romans   v  0 and the holy ghost is said to be in us and in a case which he mentions st paul tells the corinthians it would be reported that god was in them of a truth   cor       now can any man assign a tolerable reason why the word god in this passage should not be regarded as inclusive of the whole blessed trinity another scripture says every one of us shall give account of himself to god romans       but if in the term god jesus christ is not comprehended what will become of the text which assures us we must all appear before his judgment seat   cor    0 the great apostle of the gentiles puts the elders of the church of ephesus in mind that he had not shunned to declare unto them all the counsel of god and if he who purchased this church with his own blood and he who appointed overseers over it are to be considered as parties in this counsel and surely they are to be so considered the word god has manifestly a complex signification here and means more than one person only acts  0       the kingdom of god is a phrase which in most places where it occurs will i presume not barely admit but require the same latitude of application the word of god may be regarded in the same light lastly i shall close these examples with one which is the more eligible because it is contained in a text which has already undergone examination and to which our adversaries are for ever putting in their claim i mean v   th of the   th chapter of st pauls first epist to the cor see disc   sub fin when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god i e the complement of the deity the trinity in unity may be all in all every critical eye sees clearly that in this passage for the complex word  god  we must read the single term father before we can with any sort of propriety accommodate it to the purpose of the antitrinitarians in this case indeed there would be an obvious sense and a natural antithesis and both in their favor  the other text  i am in the father and the father in me john       which mr j produces as synonomising with the preceding may be explained away by similar means the arian has the following passages to oppose to them that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou in me etc john             i am far from saying or even insinuating that there is any real difficulty in all this or that the orthodox construction of the passages adduced by mr j does not fairly and properly belong to them i only take leave to observe and have an obvious view in observing that with regard to the defense of christian doctrine in general and particularly to the confutation of the assertion abovementioned this truly respectable author might have selected texts less equivocal less liable to prevarication  it is observable dr i watts makes the texts i am in the father and the father in me etc subservient to his doctrine of the inherency or indwelling of the father i e of the godhead in the man christ jesus  it has been remarked that by a small alteration in the punctuation the  d v of the   th chap of st john that they might know thee the only true god etc may be thus rendered that they might know thee and jesus christ whom thou have sent to be the only true god this reading is supported by the authorities of novatian st austin and st ambrose but it will be prudent i believe to wave these authorities these fathers seem to have been in great fear where no fear was we may safely abide by the sense of the text before us in its present state were we really in distress it might be worth our while to appeal to these early opinions in our

gravely affirm the moon to be an emblem of the church birds emblems of heretics and fish of antichrist we find in our nature says a celebrated writer which is said to be made after the image of god a very near resemblance of the holy trinity and of the different operations of each of the divine persons for example to know a thing present and to remember what is past and to love or hate are different operations of our mind and performed by different faculties of it of these the understanding is the father faculty and gives being to things as to us for what we know not is to us as if it were not this answers to creation from this faculty proceeds the second that of memory which is a preserving of that the understanding has created to us then the third faculty that of the will which loves or hates proceeds from both the other for we cannot love or hate what is not first created by the understanding and preserved to us by the memory  the plastic power of a warm imagination or a sanguine zeal will form emblems and adumbrations of the trinity in all countries and in all ages of the world we are told the old egyptians and modern americans worshipped the deity under the picture

it was by no means necessary he should be invested with a spiritual or heavenly body for that purpose the resurrection of that body which was crucified which rose from the dead and with which jesus

four different mountains and then call them and you shall see all those four birds will immediately come to you this story is told by mohammedan writers still more circumstantially these four birds they say were a pigeon a cock a crow and a peacock and that when abraham had cut them in pieces he made a perfect anatomy of them and minced them all together some add that he pounded them in a mortar and reduced them all to one mass which he divided into four parts and carried them to the top of four several mountains and that then holding up their heads which he retained in his hands he called

from the form of the first baptismal creed which ran in the following terms i believe in god the father son and holy ghost see cyprian epist    that this creed which implicitly declares the three

thereof returning to their former principles christs spirit only being in heaven this heretic lived says a ross about   0 years after christ in the reign of the emperor commodus  we have already exhibited to the reader many strange pagan notions relative to the nature etc of the deity but perhaps the most extraordinary the most eccentric of them all has not yet been remembered it is not properly a heresy indeed but it is an error which may fitly occupy this place the heathen mystical theologists often call god   male and female signifying thereby though grossly yet not unemphatically the creative power of the supreme being dr cudworth cites a passage from a hymn of synesius whom he calls a learned and pious bishop wherein the almighty is addressed under expressions precisely equivalent    agreeably hereunto varro quotes from soranus an eminent poet according to our author the verses following jupiter omnipotens regum rex ipse deumque progenitor genitrixque deum deus unus et omnis   methinks this sentiment becomes the heathen theologist or poet much better than the christian divine  far from meaning to rank a late very eminent writer dr i watts in the number of notorious heretics or in the least to detract from the excellence of his character i think myself bound in duty to my subject to take notice here of the singularity of his sentiments his idea of the divinity of christ was that the godhead the deity itself personally distinguished as the father was united to the man christ jesus in consequence of which union or indwelling of the godhead he became properly god it seems these were likewise dr dodderidges sentiments he conceived this union to have subsisted before the saviors appearance in the flesh and that the human soul of christ existed with the father from before the foundation of the world on which ground he maintains the real descent of christ from heaven to earth etc  in these sentiments there is not so much as a reference to the holy ghost but we are not to consider them as final we shall find the dr to have had more enlarged notions respecting the doctrine of the trinity  in his solemn address to the great and everblessed god on a review of what he had written in the trinitarian controversy he puts the following questions with all that humble reverence his own words and that holy awe which becomes a creature in the presence of his god  have thou not o lord god almighty have thou not transacted thy divine and important affairs among men by thy son jesus christ and by thy holy spirit and have thou not ordained that men should transact their highest and most momentous concerns with thee by thy son and and by thy spirit have thou not by the mouth of thy son jesus required all that profess his religion to be washed with water in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost is it not my duty then to enquire who or what are these sacred names and what they signify  have thou not ascribed divine names and titles and characters to thy son and thy holy spirit in thy word as well as assumed them to thyself and have thou not appointed to them such glorious offices as cannot be executed without something of divinity or true godhead in them and yet art not thou and thou alone the true god how shall a poor weak creature be able to adjust and reconcile these clashing ideas and to understand this mystery or must i believe and act blindfold without understanding  holy father he proceeds thou know how firmly i believe with all my soul whatsoever thou have plainly written and revealed in thy word i believe thee to be the only true god the supreme of beings selfsufficient for thine own existence and for all thy infinite affairs and transactions among creatures i believe thy only son jesus christ to be allsufficient for the glorious work of mediation between god and man to which thou have appointed him i believe he is a man in whom dwells all the fullness of the godhead bodily i believe he is one with god he is god manifested in the flesh and that the man jesus is so closely and inseparably united with the true and eternal godhead as to become one person even as the soul and body make one man  i believe also thy blessed spirit has almighty power and influence to do all thy will to instruct men effectually in divine truths etc i yield up myself joyfully and thankfully to this method of thy salvation as it is revealed in thy gospel but i acknowledge my darkness still i want to have this wonderful doctrine of the allsufficience of thy son and spirit for these divine works made a little plainer  had thou informed me gracious father in any place of thy word that this divine doctrine is not to be understood by men and yet they were required to believe it i would have subdued all my curiosity to faith etc but i cannot find thou have any where forbid me to understand it or to make these enquiries my conscience is the best natural light thou have put within me and since thou have given me the scriptures my own conscience bids me search the scriptures to find out truth etc i have therefore been long searching into this divine doctrine that i may pay thee due honor with understanding surely i ought to know the god whom i worship whether he be one pure and simple being or whether thou art a threefold deity consisting of the father the son and the holy spirit  dear and blessed god had thou been pleased in any one plain scripture to have informed me which of the different opinions about the holy trinity among the contending parties of christians had been true thou know with how much zeal satisfaction and joy my unbiassed heart would have opened itself to receive and embrace the discovery had thou told me plainly in any single text that the father son and holy spirit are three real distinct persons in thy divine nature i had never suffered myself to be bewildered in so many doubts nor embarrassed with so many strong fears of assenting to the mere inventions of men instead of divine doctrine but i should have humbly and immediately accepted thy words so far as it was possible for me to understand them as the only rule of my faith or had thou been pleased so to express and include this proposition in the several scattered parts of thy book from whence my reason and conscience might with ease find out and with certainty infer this doctrine i should have joyfully employed all my reasoning powers with their utmost skill and activity to have found out this inference and ingrafted it into my soul  thou have called the poor and the ignorant the mean and foolish things of this world to the knowledge of thyself and thy son and taught them to receive and partake of the salvation which thou have provided but how can such weak creatures ever take in so strange so difficult and so abstruse a doctrine as this in the explication and defense whereof multitudes of men even men of learning and piety have lost themselves in infinite subtilties of dispute and endless mazes of darkness and can this strange and perplexing notion of three real persons going to make up one true god be so necessary and so important a part of that christian doctrine which in the old testament and the new is represented as so plain and so easy even to the meanest understandings  o thou searcher of hearts who know all things i appeal to thee concerning the sincerity of my enquiries into these discoveries of thy word  i humbly call thee to witness o my god what a holy jealousy i ever wear about my heart lest i should do the slightest dishonor to thy supreme majesty in any of my enquiries or determinations thou see what a religious fear and what a tender solicitude i maintain on my soul lest i should think or speak any thing to diminish the grandeurs and honors of thy son jesus my dear mediator etc thou know how much i am afraid of speaking one word which may be construed into a neglect of thy blessed spirit from whom i hope i am daily receiving happy influences of light and strength guard all the motions of my mind o almighty god against every thing that borders upon these dangers forbid my thoughts to indulge and forbid my pen to write one word that should sink those grand ideas which belong to thyself or thy son or thy holy spirit forbid it o my god that ever i should be so unhappy as to unglorify my father my savior or my sanctifier in any of my sentiments or expressions concerning them  blessed and faithful god have thou not promised that the meek thou will guide in judgment the meek thou will teach thy way has not thy son our savior assured us that our heavenly father will give his holy spirit to them who ask him and is he not appointed to guide us into all truth have i not sought the gracious guidance of thy good spirit continually am i not truly sensible of my own darkness and weakness my dangerous prejudices on every side and my utter insufficiency for my own conduct will thou leave such a poor creature bewildered among a thousand perplexities which are raised by the various opinions and contrivances of men to explain thy divine truth  help me heavenly father for i am quite tired and weary of these human explainings so various and uncertain when will thou explain it to me thyself o my god by the secret and certain dictates of thy spirit according to the intimations of thy word now for truths sake i desire to ask any intelligent impartial and candid reader whether we have not in these passages strong indications of a wavering though pious mind whether such language as this does not rather tend to encourage specious skepticism than sound faith whether it is not chargeable with inconsistency between reverence and remonstrance between declarations of acquiescence and expostulations of discontent whether according to dr w  s ideas all ecclesiastical authority is not as such altogether odious or contemptible and whether for what appears to the contrary from these periods christianity might not flourish without the existence of church pastor or teacher whether we have not in this illustrious dissenter an extraordinary instance of the compatibility of radical and invincible prejudice with an honest and good heart and a solid understanding whether dr w had any thing like sufficient grounds for his suspicion that the orthodox received doctrines are resolvible into mere explainings inventions or contrivances of men whether he does not appear to be unreasonably though sincerely anxious to understand all mysteries while at the same time he could not but know that the capital doctrines of the gospel are delivered as mysterious and that christians are supposed and required to walk by faith and not by sight whether he does not most erroneously convert a particular promise into a general one not recollecting that though for obvious and very important purposes our heavenly father will give his holy spirit to them that ask him yet that spirit was by no means appointed to guide every individual christian into all spiritual truth whether had we been told plainly in so many words in any single text that the father son and holy spirit are three real and distinct persons in the divine nature it had been possible for d w to have misunderstood it or whether he or any body else could have been bewildered in any doubts with respect to this doctrine whether such a discovery of it would not have been received every where with unbiassed hearts and with universal zeal safaction and joy a few instances perhaps of obduracy etc excepted whether had it been so expressed and included in the several scattered parts of scripture that the doctors reason and conscience could with ease have found it out and with certainty inferred it there would have been the least occasion for the skill and activity of his rational powers whether after all the doctrine in question be not expressed or included in the sacred pages sufficiently to warrant any mans firm assent to it especially when we take into the account the whole weight of that evidence by which we prove its correspondency with the sense of antiquity and the belief of the primitive church whether the wisest and the weakest are not equally incapable of taking in so difficult and so abstruse a doctrine as that of the trinity whether the christian doctrine concerning things spiritual and mysterious is really represented either in the old testament or the new as plain and easy even to the meanest understanding whether granting that multitudes even of men of learning and piety have lost themselves in infinite subtilties of dispute etc in the explication and defense of the doctrine before us all this should not be principally attributed to antitrinitarian artifice and to a gradual departure from that simplicity in which it was originally taught and received in the world whether if this perplexing notion of three real persons going to make up one true god be a part of christian doctrine it is not prima facie the most necessary and the most important finally whether the doctrine of the trinity as held in the church has not at least as much countenance from scripture and even from reason as dr w  s notion of the indwelling of the deity in the man christ jesus and whether this is not in effect acknowleged by himself  as to the notion itself it is i trust to all intents and purposes refuted in the foregoing pages and i shall content myself with expressing my astonishment at the force of prejudice in one who so strongly recommends or more properly inculcates an indifference for every thing but truth see improvement of the mind p     and censures so severely all domestic national or party attachments for with all his gentleness benevolence charity and love of truth dr w appears to me to have been biassed by more than ordinary prepossessions he who has expressed himself in the manner we have seen he who has occasionally declared that he allowed the greatest distinction possible between the sacred three in the divine nature which does not arise to three distinct conscious minds or spirits and that he was fully established in the belief of the deity of the blessed three though he knew not the manner of explication must to my apprehension be considered as protesting against the doctrine of a trinity of persons chiefly because it was an established one because it was the doctrine of the church  i have dwelt the longer on this case as it is uncommon as it is the case of a great and good man whom to borrow dr johnsons words every christian church would rejoice to have adopted  dr watts last sentiments on the trinity p    solemn address p  0  etc see johnsons life of dr watts with notes etc cudworths intell syst chapter   p  0  a rosss view of all religions sect    p   0 oo to judge for ourselves it abundantly appears by a considerable number of extracts made by bp jewel from many fathers and doctors of the church of rome that anciently in that communion the holy scriptures were not barely indulged but recommended to every hand by what means the romanists have since qualified the sense of these passages or reconciled the same with principles of a later date i have no occasion to inquire but in one of them there is a singularity which i believe will pay any man for his trouble in the reading it is to be found in theodoret and is translated by the great prelate as follows ye may commonly see that our doctrine is known not only of them that are the doctors of the church and the masters of the people but also even of the tailors and smiths and weavers and of all artificers yea and farther also of women and that not only of them that be learned but also of laboring women and sempsters and servants and handmaids neither only the citizens but also the countryfolks do very well understand the same ye may find yea even the very ditchers and delvers and cowherds and gardiners disputing of the holytrinity and of the creation of all things  the same passage is referred to by dr potter in his answer to charity mistaken p  0   jewels defense etc part   p  0   page     pp mistaken in that judgment an eminent and learned writer of the last century whom i have quoted before observes and the observation has been also cited that heresy is not an error of the understanding but of the will and to this doctrine properly stated we can readily subscribe but in the excess of his moderation this right rev author sometimes questions in effect at least the authority not only of all ecclesiastical traditions and councils but of the scripture itself giving us sentiments wholly incongruous with every idea of faith system or establishment witness those contained in the following extract which to my imagination nothing but the zeal of adherency to a favorite principle could have drawn from the pen of so able a writer and so professed a casuist  since says he holy scripture is the repository of divine truths and the great rule of faith to which all sects of christians do appeal for probation of their several opinions and since all agree in the articles of the creed as things clearly and plainly set down and as containing all that which is of simple and prime necessity and since on the other side there are in scripture many other mysteries and matters of question upon which there is a vail since there are so many copies with infinite varieties of reading since a various interpunction a parenthesis a letter an accent may much alter the sense since some places have diverse literal senses many have spiritual mystical and allegorical meanings since there are so many tropes metonymies ironies hyperboles proprieties and improprieties of language whose understanding depends upon such circumstances that it is almost impossible to know its proper interpretation now that the knowledge of such circumstances and particular stories is irrecoverably lost since there are some mysteries which at the best advantage of expression are not easy to be apprehended and whose explication by reason of our imperfections must needs be dark sometimes weak sometimes unintelligible and lastly since those ordinary means of expounding scripture as searching the originals conference of places parity of reason and analogy of faith are all dubious uncertain and very fallible he that is the wisest and by consequence the likeliest to expound truest in all probability of reason will be very far from confidence because every one of these and many more are like so many degrees of improbability and incertainty all depressing our certainty of finding out truth in such mysteries and amidst so many difficulties and therefore a wise man that considers this would not willingly be prescribed to by others and therefore if he also be a just man he will not impose upon others for it is best every man should be left in that liberty from which no man can justly take him unless he could secure him from error so that here also there is a necessity to conserve the liberty of prophesying and interpreting scripture a necessity derived from the consideration of the difficulty of scripture in questions controverted and the uncertainty of any internal medium of interpretation now if this be the case we are but mocked when we are told the scriptures are the repository of divine truths or that any articles of faith can be clearly and plainly set down in any creed whatsoever under the above circumstances in what formulary or system shall we look for all that which is of simple and prime necessity is it not strange too that there should be many other mysteries in scripture distinct from those divine truths of which it is the repository and stranger still that matters of question should be put under a vail upon all matters of faith there is indeed a vail i mean upon all mysterious matters which cannot possibly be apprehended at the best advantage of expression the explication of these is absolutely impracticable and every attempt for that purpose by reason of our imperfections must needs be dark sometimes weak sometimes unintelligible perhaps he will bid as fair as any man to be an expounder of mysteries who shall disentangle the several clauses of this paragraph i know not whether any thing can be found surpassing this either in the style or in the spirit of present

observes well expressed by one of the advocates for infidelity in words to the following effect that if the opinions of a certain friend of his were established to day he would oppose them to morrow this the bp informs us is reported to have been said by a person i suppose of some consequence whose name he mentions not  bp gibsons past let p      page     rr spiritual constitution the author of a work published some years since under the title of free thoughts on the subject of a farther reformation speaks of our reformers in the following terms one no small disadvantage which they unhappily labored under and which from their time to this has been matter of just regret to true friends of divine revelation was their defect of knowledge in sacred matters above all in the true sense of scripture etc if says he in another place we would form our judgments of the abilities of our reformers to frame for us a system of doctrines which should remain a perpetual standard of belief and profession in the english church and by which all our clergy in all future ages should be summarily concluded we shall i suppose see just reason to wish that they had been more equal than they appear to be to so weighty an undertaking those who are well acquainted with their writings will see in a variety of instances evident marks of their insufficiency for such a task and be fully convinced of the truth of that observation of a learned and worthy doctor of our church that they were but bad interpreters of the scriptures  in support of all this derogation which is obligingly qualified with a few introductory commonplace compliments our author has given us a number of extracts relative to certain religious topics from archbishop cranmers catechism published in      and dedicated to king edward vi we may see it seems from these extracts how greatly disproportioned the abilities of this famous prelate and his colleagues were to the work of reformation etc to what conclusions this will lead i need not inform the reader but i take leave to offer a remark or two upon the occasion in the first place if the intellectual weakness of our reformers was really so great as is here represented protestants to a man have reason enough to be ashamed of themselves what answer shall they make to any sensible romancatholic who should teaze them with these mortifying truths to my thinking as none of the exceptionable contents of the passages cited from the archbishops catechism make a part of the doctrine of our church they might in reverence to his memory and for her credit have much better been suppressed had this gentleman contented himself with observing that the reformers of the church were fallible men and consequently that the forms and offices they have delivered down to us may be capable in some instances of alteration and improvement he had spoken more agreeably to truth though less adequately to his purpose for what he has alleged has a plain tendency to show the necessity rather of pulling down than repairing our spiritual building on the whole as he has conducted matters i know not any one person upon earth under so many obligations to him as the pope of rome  i shall take this opportunity to animadvert on certain dirty aspersions in a late performance from the hand of a rigid nonconformist and perhaps an avowed unbeliever and perhaps both  the anonymous editor of dr johnsons life of dr i watts with notes sacrifices to the virulence of his diposition every regard to decency charity and truth it will be proper to trace this calumny to it is source happy says the celebrated biographer will be that reader viz of the works of dr w whose mind is disposed by his verses or his prose to imitate him in all but his nonconformity to copy his benevolence to man and his reverence to god is there any thing in this to put a man of candor or a man of sense out of humor yet our editor asks is not this exception and even the mention of this circumstance a striking proof of dr johnsons bigoted attachment to the national established mode of worship it is really no proof at all how far dr j was in fact a bigot to establishments i undertake not to determine but the period just quoted by no means proves him to have been so the most moderate churchman breathing has not the better opinion of dr w for his nonconformity i cannot think such an one could have mentioned this circumstance more tenderly had he mentioned it at all and with what propriety dr w  s biographer could have left it unmentioned i must leave it to this gentleman to explain to us reverence to god he proceeds and benevolence to man are the two grand essentials of religion he that possesses these is a true christian whatever be the external mode of worship which he adopts neither his conformity nor his nonconformity will exclude him from the divine favor nor ought it to be matter of censure to his fellow creatures if a man in uniting with any christian community appears to follow the dictates of his own conscience etc he deserves the esteem of all parties and to object to his peculiarity of religious profession is the mark of a little mind  now this is partly true partly false but you see as far as dr johnson is concerned wholly impertinent there is as little as possible of censure or of objection in the sentence above quoted from him as to sincerity of persuasion no body denies the validity of it is pretensions but at the same time what will make an honest man will by no means constitute a true christian reverence to god and benevolence to man are indeed the two grand essentials of all religion and to borrow our authors term they may be possessed by jews turks infidels and heretics  that dr w was conscientious in his nonconformity will be readily admitted but surely this will not justify the unfairness or the duplicity or the malignity or the falsehood of the following paragraph considering what the terms of ministerial conformity are says our annotator it may be justly questioned whether if all the clergy were equally conscientious one half of them would not be dissenters to declare an assent and consent to all and every thing contained in the thirtynine articles the book of common prayer etc which comprehend such a prodigious number of particulars many of them very disputable some of them unintelligible and others exploded by the wisest and best of men is such a requisition as it is hard to be conceived the generality of the clergy can bona fide approve it is indeed well known that most of them and even of the bishops themselves disbelieve some of the doctrinal articles of the church as appears from the general strain of their preaching and of their writings and that they profess to subscribe them only as articles of peace if the terms of conformity were a declaration that they did not believe all and every thing etc it is undeniable that many not to say the most of those that conform might very conscientiously make it whether therefore their subscription to the present terms be consistent with simplicity and godly sincerity it behooves them seriously to enquire if others think that such a subscription would in them be a gross prevarication and rather than be chargeable with it willingly forego the advantages of being in the church they ought at least to be respected as honest men and if dr johnson had studied the grounds of nonconformity which he appears not to have done he might have entertained a better opinion of the understandings of protestant dissenters as well as their integrity but this is not the place for entering into that controversy  if these representations are just and these assertions true the controversy is absolutely decided with a vengeance and the bulk of the clergy of of the church of england are as great a set of sc  ndr  ls as can be produced in the annals of the human race i shall not waste a moment in vindicating them from imputations so palpably scandalous but content myself with declaring my firm belief that dr johnson would not have entertained a better opinion either of the understandings or integrity of protestant dissenters from these samples of both and that were dr w restored to life he would for visible reasons think himself under much greater obligations to the biographer than to the annotator  in short we are not to wonder at any thing which is advanced by one who maintains as this writer does in another page of this very performance that in the scriptureplan no traces of a national church or ecclesiastical authority are to be found  it may be pertinent to remark farther that exceedingly mad as the puritans and their friends in the last century were against the governors of the church and our whole ecclesiastical polity they appear to have been more than ordinarily solicitous to express their full assent and consent to the most material articles of our faith their quarrel was not against our doctrine but our discipline i have by me a just and literal translation of the confession of faith together with two catechisms a larger and a less drawn up by the assembly of divines at westminster in      under the authority and with the concurrence and approbation of parliament so called and of the kirk of scotland the  d clause in the chapter de deo et sacrosancta trinitate runs verbatim as follows in deitatis unitate personae tres sunt unius ejusdemque essentiae potentiae ac aeternitatis deus pater deus filius ac deus spiritus sanctus pater quidem a nullo est nec genitus nempe nec procedens filius autem a patre est aeterne genitus spiritus autem sanctus aeterne procedens a patre filioque in the   d chapter de statu hominum post mortem deque resurrectione mortuorum we find this clause novissimo illo die qui comperientur in vivis non morientur quidem sed mutabuntur qui mortui fuerint resuscitabuntur omnes ipsissimis iis corporibus quibus viventes aliquando fungebantur ac non aliis ut ut qualitate differentibus quae denuo animabus quaeque suis aeterno conjugio unientur  these doctrines are held out almost in the same words in both catechisms  from which circumstances i take occasion to ask whether as far as we may reasonably collect from the style and the sentiments of the editor of dr johnsons life of dr i watts with notes the views and the dispositions of the protestant dissenters of this age have not a tendency more inimical and destructive than were those of these same ancestors of theirs who triumphed in the ruin both of church and state  but is there not after all an inveterate difficulty which we have rather met than encountered and much less overcome and which furnishes popery with its shrewdest argument and infidelity with its strongest handle the protestant principle asserts the right of private judgment in matters of religion and yet precepts relative to obedience to spiritual authority etc are as plain as those directions which require us to prove all things and to hold fast that which is good etc how shall we reconcile these things in consequence of the exertion of this personal right differences arise in the world and controversies the natural issue of them how are these to be decided is it not a solecism in religion to suppose a controversy without a judge nevertheless we say and demonstrate too that the church of rome the only church which pretends to infallibility has erred and that even in fundamentals accordingly we refer to no arbitration we acknowledge no rule of faith no judge of controversy but holy scripture supremus judex say the westminster divines abovementioned a quo omnes de religione controversiae sunt determinandae omnia conciliorum decreta opiniones etc nullus alius esse potest praeter spiritum sanctum in scriptura pronunciantem confess fid cap    0   but are not these vain words does any man or any body of men pretend to the gift of discerning of spirits at this day or if they do are their pretensions admissible or can scripture with any propriety be said to be the judge of controversy when it is the whole and sole ground of it do not all parties find means to wrench the authority of the sacred pages to their side every antitrinitarian will say in the words of chillingworth whatever the real sentiments of the latter might be propose me any thing out of this book and require whether i believe or no and seem it never so incomprehensible to human reason i will subscribe it with hand and heart as knowing no demonstration can be stronger than this god has said so therefore it is true religion of protestants etc p     but then to the proofs you have to offer and the texts you have to produce he opposes his texts and his proofs such as they are or perhaps one general assertion which no body can deny viz that there is but one living and true god where now is the judge of controversy what is become of ecclesiastical authority or what have we to say to those who cast it in our teeth that the church of england has erred as well as the church of rome in short where is heresy and what is schism  with a view to the solution of this difficulty and by way of supplement to the contents of the foregoing sheets let us see whether a little enquiry will not enable us sufficiently to ascertain what heresy of the worst sort was in the days of the apostles themselves and according to the conception they must by fair construction be understood to have entertained of it  in his  d general epistle st peter foretells that there would be false teachers among christians who should privily bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them chapter   v   from which passage we can do no less than infer that the denial of the lord that bought us is of all heresies the most damnable  now whether we do or do not abide by dr whitbys interpretation who apprehends we are to understand god the father by the word lord in this passage christ being never styled  the original word in the new testament the inference will inevitably be one and the same jesus christ was confessedly the purchaser of the church with his own blood in point of nature or attribute there can therefore be no difference betwixt these two persons the heresy which denies either will be equally damnable according to dr ws sentiment but if we reject it the divinity of our savior is not less implied in the text before us for in most evident allusion to this very purchase ye are bought with a price says st paul to the corinthians therefore continues he glorify god i e out of all question jesus christ who bought you in your body and in your spirit which are gods i e which are christs   cor    0 it may be a satisfaction to the reader to compare this passage with the following in the next chapter he that is called being free is christs servant ye are bought with a price be not ye the servants of men v    etc  in his last and farewell address to the children of israel which is called his song their great legislator puts this question to them is not he thy father that has bought thee deutero chapter      god is said to have bought his people by his deliverance of them from the bondage of egypt which was only a type but indisputably a type of the eternal redemption obtained for us by the precious blood of christ and is it not just to infer the equality of these divine purchasers from the nature and value of their respective purchases the denial of the lord that bought us is therefore in effect the denial of the divinity of our savior  there is a passage in st jude parallel to this which we have had in consideration that will not be found consistent with it or with its context without supposing the same equality this apostle complains of certain ungodly men who denied the only lord god and our lord jesus christ they denied our lord jesus christ as one with the father not as in essence distinct from him i say the affinity of this passage to the other and its own context not barely warrant but demand this sense jude the servant of jesus christ etc to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserved by jesus christ and called we are very sufficiently authorized to read by for in see hammond etc etc in this passage and if so it is most undoubtedly as much the attribute or property of the supreme god to preserve and to call as it is to sanctify which indeed is the discriminative office of the holy ghost whose divinity by the way is here plainly asserted by implication but we are under no necessity of disturbing the present version in the  d verse the apostle exhorts christians to contend earnestly for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints that from the beginning some should depart from the faith or a belief in jesus christ as the son of god by eternal generation on principles and for reasons by which infidels and skeptics are influenced at this day is by no means matter of astonishment but supposing the faith of the primitive christians the faith which was once delivered unto the saints to have been merely a faith in jesus christ as a prophet or as the messiah or as a creature of a more or less excellent name there would i presume have been little room for contention about it or danger of its being denied  if we take into examination that impious and strange doctrine of which st john speaks in terms of strong censure and resentment in his first and second general epistle this research will likewise terminate in an unquestionable proof of our lords divinity and convince us that in the denial of it the error consisted every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard etc many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that jesus christ is come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist   john   v     john v   or as some read these passages that confess not jesus christ which is come in the flesh the import of these texts will not be in the least affected by this variation that the man christ jesus the person who was known by the name of jesus christ lived and conversed in the world did many wonderful works was contumeliously treated and at length put to a painful and ignominious death were facts too recent and too generally known to be disputed by any at the time when our apostle wrote these epistles that the jesus christ of these epistles was the very identical person whom the apostle styles in his gospel the son of god the word that was in the beginning with god and really and truly was god cannot with the least appearance of reason be questioned but that god was indeed manifest in the flesh took our nature upon him and bare our sins in his own body on the tree this was a saying too hard for the acceptance of those deceivers false prophets and antichrists as st john calls them and whom at the  th v of chap   he represents as possessed with the spirit of error accordingly they were weak and at the same time bold enough to resolve this great truth into mere semblance and deception and to affirm that the human person of jesus christ was a phantom and lived and suffered and died not really but in appearance only which abominably ridiculous notion was as has been observed in a great measure adopted afterward by mahomet who was offended at those indignities and sufferings which he considered as altogether unworthy of that prophetic character which he acknowleged jesus christ as his predecessor to have been vested with this doctrine is delivered in the koran in general terms but the followers of mahomet differ in their sentiments respecting it according to some jesus christ was not nailed to the cross but a malefactor who in person much resembled him the person crucified say others was a spy that was sent to entrap our savior and others assert him to have been judas and others simon the cyrenian  or if we suppose st john to have had in his eye another heretical tenet of a similar nature and tendency which was very early disseminated in the church viz that of the carpocratians etc who made a distinction betwixt jesus and christ and maintained that the former suffered and rose again but that the latter was impassible as being purely of a spiritual nature agreeably to the idea suggested by websters translation of father simon which for every spirit which confesses not etc reads which separateth jesus the result will necessarily be found to be one and the same for to what can we reasonably attribute the denial of our lords humanity or its separation from the divinity but to an averseness to acknowledge the union of god and man in the person of jesus christ and if so it will naturally follow that this union was the doctrine of the apostles and the belief of the primitive church  it is well worth observing that polycarp in his epistle to the philippians quotes word for word the  d v of the  th chapter of st johns first epistle whosoever does not confess etc and that ignatius who conversed with the apostles and upon the death of evodius was appointed bishop of antioch by as many of the sacred college as were then living not barely mentions but most expressly censures and condemns this whimsical opinion of the phantomists if i may take liberty so to call them stop your ears says he in his epistle to the trallians as often as any one shall speak contrary to jesus christ who was of the race of david etc who was truly born and did eat and drink was truly persecuted under pontius pilate was truly crucified and dead and a little after if says he some who are atheists that is to say infidels pretend that he only seemed to suffer they themselves only seeming to exist why then am i bound why do i desire to fight with beasts in the epistle of the same father to the smyrnaeans we have the following passage and he suffered truly as he also truly raised up himself and not as some unbelievers say that he only seemed to suffer  though therefore neither the apostles nor the apostolical fathers particularly specify what heresy is it appears by just and natural inference from many passages in their writings originally to have consisted in denying the perfect godhead and perfect manhood of our savior and that heresies in general deserve to be considered as so many evasions of these fundamental truths there is another passage in the epistle to the trallians which simply asserting the divinity of jesus christ puts this out of all reasonable doubt i exhort you says the venerable author or rather not i but the love of jesus christ that you use none but christian nourishment abstaining from pasture which is of another kind i mean heresy for see the references in the margin they that are heretics confound together the doctrine of jesus christ with their own poison etc wherefore guard yourselves against such persons and that you will do if you are not puffed up but continue inseparable from jesus christ our god and from your bishop and from the commands of the apostles in short all these circumstances concur to the establishment of our first hypothesis if the catholic faith of the primitive christians was the same which is held in the church of england at this day at and before the publication of the holy scriptures of the new testament as well as the writings of the apostolical fathers their doctrine on the subjects we have been handling is sufficiently uniform and explicit if otherwise it is by far too consistent and too perspicuous  agreeably to what has been advanced we may farther observe the sacred authors frequently referring to some standing doctrines some capital articles of belief which had been by them taught and were by the church universally received it will be a hard matter to comprehend the meaning of many passages in the scriptures without supposing them to import or to allude to some such doctrines or principles the first converts to christianity are said to have continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship acts ii    and whatsoever that doctrine might be it was then no written doctrine st paul thanks god that the roman converts had obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to them romans vi    he exhorts the thessalonians to stand fast and hold the traditions which they had been taught whether by word or by his epistle   thessalonians ii    and recommends it to timothy to keep that which was committed to his trust and to hold fast the form of sound words which he had heard of him   timothy i    he injoins titus to reject a man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition titus iii  0 it will be sufficient to add to this the advice of st jude to christians in general which just above fell under notice viz that they should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints  it was doubtless with an eye to this faith to the preservation of the same in purity and to the future peace and prosperity of the church that jesus christ gave some apostles as st paul informs us and some evangelists and some prophets and some pastors and teachers ephesians iv    nor could the purpose of such appointments have been answered but by a regular succession of some of these characters through all ages  for the same purpose most unquestionably god has set in the church helps and governments etc as the same apostle declares to his corinthian converts in the   th chapter of his first epistle to them  now how all this could be done or how either evangelist prophet or teacher or governor could at any time or in any manner exercise his function without invading the right of private judgment as it has of late days been contended for or without departing from the simplicity of the gospel in its original state i pretend not to have sufficient penetration to discover  matters appear then to stand thus  that jesus christ constituted no arbitrator no infallible judge or decider of controversy etc in his church is demonstrable from the differences the disputes and dissentions relative to circumcision etc which subsisted in its very infancy at the same time it is certain the holy scriptures speak of a common faith and of the common salvation titus i   jude v   you have seen what grounds we have for our persuasion that such common faith was nothing more or less than a belief in the doctrine of the holy trinity and the other articles contained in our creeds under this persuasion the church of england as a national church as a church reformed from the gross errors corruptions and superstitions of rome has not only power to decree rites or ceremonies but authority in controversies of faith viz authority not to determine but to declare accordingly we do not anathematise or molest them that renounce our doctrine or separate from our discipline upon principles avowed by ourselves we maintain our own rights without encroaching upon the privileges of others we discover condemn and avoid what we call and believe to be heresies without aiming or wishing to prevent them by coercion we conceive spiritual government to be as compatible with religious liberty as temporal jurisdiction is with civil and that when the reformers asserted the right of private judgment in matters of religion the natural right of all men to make use of their own faculties they could not possibly mean to invest every individual with the privilege of working out his own salvation by his own understanding and endeavors independently on any extraneous assistance or instruction whatever and much less to intimate that he is under an indispensable obligation so to do were this the case the apostles question are all teachers must be answered in the affirmative and the necessary consequence would be that every body and yet no body would be a teacher which is absurd neither the justest claim nor the most reasonable exemption can alter the nature of things if it be true that this church derives her existence from the exertions of human reason emancipating itself from spiritual slavery it is as true that she owes her preservation to decent order and legal establishment if it be true that the bulk of the people naturally wish to act to think and to judge for themselves it is as true that they naturally take advice or instruction from others submit to control and reverence authority in short to whatever causes we are to ascribe that diversity of opinion which distracts the world how perplexing so ever the present constitution of things may be or for whatever reasons it has pleased infinite wisdom to place us in a state of trial infirmity and imperfection one general truth must universally be subscribed to viz that with respect both to faith and practice the lord knows them that are his   timothy ii    and will hereafter acknowledge them accordingly  p s it is needless to tell the sensible reader that i have not been professedly
