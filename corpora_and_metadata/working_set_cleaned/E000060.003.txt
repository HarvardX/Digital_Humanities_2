ourselves an idea of the city of rome in its infancy from the cities which exist at this time except we have in view those of the crim tartars built for the stowing and securing of plunder cattle fruits and other produce of the country the ancient names of the chief places in rome are all relative to this use the city was even without streets unless we will give this name to the continuation of roads which center in it the houses were straggling built after an irregular manner and very small for the inhabitants being always either at their work or in the public square were very seldom at home but the greatness of rome soon appeared in its public edifices works which  have raised and still raise the greatest idea of its power were formed under its kings they began already to lay the foundation of that city which was to be eternal   romulus and his successors were engaged in almost perpetual wars with their neighbours to encrease the number of their citizens their women and their territories they used to return to the city loaded with the spoils of conquered nations and these spoils which consisted of wheatsheaves and flocks used to fill them with the greatest joy such is the origin of triumphs to which that city afterwards chiefly owed its grandeur the strength of the romans was greatly encreased by their union with the sabines a stubborn warlike people resembling the lacedæmonians from whom they sprung romulus  copied the form of their shields which were large and used them ever afterwards instead of the small buckler of argos and it is to be observed that the circumstance which chiefly raised the romans to the sovereignty of the world was their laying aside their own customs as soon as they met with better among the people they conquered and it is well known that they fought successively against all nations it was a maxim then among the republics of italy that treaties made with one king were not obligatory towards his successor this was a sort of law of nations † among them thus every thing which had been submitted to by one king of rome they thought themselves disengaged from under another and wars continually begot wars the reign of numa being long and pacific was very well adapted to leave the romans in their humble condition and had their territory in that age been less confined and their power greater it is probable their fortune would have been fixed for ever one cause of the prosperity of rome was that all her kings were great men no other history presents   us with an uninterrupted succession of such statesmen and such captains in the infancy of societies the leading men in the republic form the constitution afterwards the constitution forms the leading men in the republic tarquin took upon him the government without being elected by the senate   or the people his power became hereditary he rendered it absolute these two revolutions were soon followed by a third sextus the son of tarquin by violating the chastity of lucretia took such a step as has seldom failed to drive tyrants from the cities over which they presided for when once a people are made strongly sensible by the commission of so enormous a crime of the slavery to which they are reduced they immediately form a desperate resolution a people may suffer without murmuring the imposing of new tributes since they are not certain but that some advantage may accrue to themselves from the disposal of the monies so levied but when an insult is put upon them they are affected with their misfortune only and this they aggravate by fixing to it the idea of all the calamities which can possibly happen it must however be confessed that the death of lucretia did no more than occasion accidentally the revolution which happened for a haughty enterprizing bold people confined within walls must necessarily either shake off the yoke or soften the asperity of their manners from the situation of things at that time this was the result either that rome should change the form of its government or continue for ever a small poor monarchy   modern history furnishes us with a very remarkable example of what happened at that time in rome for as men have been sensible of the same passions in all ages the occasions which give rise to great revolutions are various but the causes are for ever the same as henry vii of england increased the power of the commons merely to humble the nobility so servius tullius enlarged the privileges of the people in order to depress the senate but the people growing afterwards bolder ruined each of the monarchies under which they lived no flattering colours have been employed in the picture which is left us of tarquin his name has not escaped any of the orators who declaimed against tyranny but his conduct before his calamities which it is evident he foresaw his gentleness and humanity towards the conquered his beneficence to the soldiers the arts by which he engaged such numbers to endeavour at his preservation the edifices he raised for the public use his courage in the field the constancy and patience with which he bore his misfortunes a twenty years war he either carried on or caused to be carried on against the romans though deprived of his kingdom and very poor these things and the resources perpetually found prove manifestly that he was no contemptible person the rank or place which posterity bestows is subject as all others are to the whim and caprice of fortune woe to the reputation of that monarch who is oppressed by a party which after becomes the prevailing one or who has endeavoured to destroy a prepossession that survives him the romans after having banished their kings appointed consuls annually a circumstance which contributed to raise them to so exalted a pitch in the lives of all princes there are certain periods of ambition and these are afterwards succeeded by other passions and even by indolence but the commonwealth   being governed by magistrates who were changed every year and who endeavoured to signalize themselves in their employment in the view of obtaining new ones ambition had not a moment to lose hence it was that these magistrates were ever persuading the senate to stir up the people to war and pointed our to them new enemies every day this body the senate was inclined enough to do this of their own accord for being quite tired of the complaints and demands of the people they endeavoured to remove the occasion of their disquiet and to employ them in foreign wars now the common people were generally pleased with war because a method had been found to make it beneficial to them by the judicious distribution that was made of the spoils rome being a city in which neither trade nor arts flourished the several individuals had no other way of enriching themselves but by rapine an order and discipline was therefore established in the way and manner of pillaging  and this was pretty near the same with that now practised among the inhabitants of lesser tartary the plunder was laid together and afterwards distributed among the soldiers not even the minutest article was lost because every man before he set out swore not to embezzle any thing besides that the romans were of all nations the most religious observers of oaths these being considered as the sinews of their military discipline in fine those citizens who staid at home shared also in the fruits of the victory for part of the conquered lands was confiscated and this was subdivided into two portions one of which was sold for the benefit of the public and the other divided by the commonwealth among such citizens as were but in poor circumstances   upon condition of their paying a small acknowledgment as the consuls had no other way of obtaining the honour of a triumph than by a conquest or a victory this made them rush into field with unparalleled impetuosity they marched directly to the enemy when force immediately decided the contest rome was therefore engaged in an eternal and ever obstinate war now a nation that is always  at war and that too from the very frame and essence of its government must necessarily be destroyed or subdue all other nations for these being sometimes at war and at other times in peace could never be so able to invade others nor so well prepared to defend themselves by this means the romans attained a perfect knowledge in the military arts in transient wars most of the examples are lost peace suggests different ideas and we forget not only our faults but even our virtues another consequence of the maxim of waging perpetual war was that the romans never concluded a peace but when they were victorious and indeed to what purpose would it be to make an ignominious peace with one nation and afterwards go and invade another in this view their pretensions rose always in proportion to their defeat by this they surprized the conqueror and said themselves under a greater necessity of conquering being for ever obnoxious to the most severe vengeance perseverance and valour became necessary virtues and these could not be distinguished among them from selflove from the love of ones family of ones country and whatever is dearest among men   the same had happened to italy which besel america in late ages the natives of the former quite helpless and dispersed up and down having resigned their habitations to new comers it was afterwards peopled by three differents nations the tuscans   the gauls and the greeks the gauls had no manner of relation or affinity either with the greeks or tuscans the latter formed a society which had its pecular language customs and morals and the grecian colonies who descended from different nations that were often at variance had pretty separate interests the world in that age was not like the world in ours voyages conquest trassick the establishment of mighty states the invention of postoffices of the sea compass and of printing these with a certain general polity have made correspondence much easier and give rise among us to an art called by the name of politics every man sees at one glance whatever is transacted in the whole universe and if a people discover but ever so little ambition all the nations round them are immediately terrified the people of italy had † none of those engines which were employed in sieges and further as the soldiers were not allowed any stipend there was no possibility of keeping them long before a town or fortress hence it was that few of their wars were decisive these fought from no other motive but merely to plunder the enemys camp or his lands after which both the conqueror and the conquered marched back to their respective cities this circumstance gave rise to the strong resistance which the people of italy made and at the same time to the inflexible resolution   the romans formed to subdue them this favoured the latter with victories which no way depraved their morals and left them in their original poverty had the romans made a rapid conquest of the neighbouring cities they would have been in a declining condition at the arrival of pyrrhus of the gauls and of hannibal and by a fate common to most governments in the world they would have made too quick a transition from poverty to riches and from riches to depravity but rome for ever struggling and ever meeting with obstacles made other nations tremble at its power and at the same time was unable to extend it and exercised in a very narrow compass of ground a train of virtues that were to prove of the most fatal consequence to the universe all the people of italy were not equally warlike those who inhabited the eastern part as the tarentines and the capuans all the cities of campania and of græcia major were quite immersed in indolence and in pleasures but the latins the hernici the sabines the æqui and the volscians were passionately fond of war these nations lay round rome the resistance they made to that city was incredible and they surpassed them in stubborness and inflexibility the latin cities sprung from alban colonies which were founded  by latinus sylvius besides their common extraction with the romans there were several rites and ceremonies common to both and servius tullius had † engaged them to build a temple at rome to serve at the center of union of the two nations losing a battle near the lake of regillus they were subjected to an alliance and forced to associate in the ‡ wars which the romans waged   it was manifestly seen during the short time that the tyranny of the decemvirs lasted how much the aggrandizing of rome depended on its liberty the government seemed to have lost the  soul which animated even to the minutest part of it there remained at that time but two sorts of people in the city those who submitted to slavery and those who for their own private interest endeavoured to enslave the rest the senators withdrew from rome as from a foreign city and the neighbouring nations did not meet with the least resistance from any quarter the senate having found means to give the soldiers a regular stipend the siege of veii was undertaken which lasted ten years but now a new art and a new system of war were seen to arise among the romans their successes were more signal and conspicuous they made a better advantage of their victories their conquests were greater they sent our more colonies in fine the taking of veii proved a kind of revolution but all this did not lessen their toils if on one side they attacked with greater vigour the tuscans the æqui and the volscians for this very reason they were abandoned by the latins and the hernici their allies who were armed after the same manner and observed the same discipline with themselves this engaged the tuscans to form new alliances and prompted the samnites the most martial people of all italy to involve them in a furious war after the soldiers received pay the senate no longer distributed to them the lands of the conquered people upon whom other conditions were now imposed they were obliged for instance to pay the army a certain quota for a time and to send supplies of cloaths and corn  0 the taking of rome by the gauls did no way lessen its strength almost the whole army which was dispersed rather than overcome withdrew to veii the people sheltered themselves in the adjacent cities and the burning of rome was no more than the setting fire to a few cottages of shepherds chap ii of the science of war as practised by the romans as the romans devoted themselves entirely to war and considered it as the only science they therefore bent all their thoughts and the genius with which they were informed to the improvement of it doubtless a god says  vegetius inspired them with the idea of the legion they judged that it would be necessary to arm the soldiers who composed the legion with weapons whether offensive or defensive of a stronger and † heavier kind than those of any other nation but as some things must be done in war which a heavy body is not able to execute the romans would have the legion include within itself a band of light forces which might issue from it in order to provoke the enemy to battle or draw back into it in case of necessity they also would have this legion strengthened with cavalry with archers and slingers to pursue those who fled and compleat the victory that it should be defended by military engines of every kind which it drew after it that every this body should    entrench itself and be as vegetius  observes a kind of strong hold but that the roman soldiers might be able to carry heavier arms than other men it was necessary they should become more than men and this they became by perpetual labour which increased their vigour and by exercises that gave them an activity which is no more than a just distribution of the strength we are invigorated with it is observed in this age that the † immoderate labour which soldiers are obliged to undergo destroys our armies and yet it was by incredible labour that the romans preserved themselves the reason i take to be this their toils were continual and uninterrupted whereas our soldiers are ever shifting from the extremes of labour to the extremes of idleness than which nothing can possibly be more destructive i must here take notice of what authors ‡ relate concerning the training up of the roman soldiery they were inured to the military pace that is to walk twenty miles and sometimes four and twenty in five hours during these marches they carried burthens of threescore pounds weight they habituated themselves to running and leaping armed capapee in their § exercises they made use of swords javelins and arrows double the weight of common weapons and these exercises were carried on without intermission the camp was not the only military school there being in rome a place in which the citizens used to    perform exercises it was the campus martius after their fatigues  they plunged into the tiber to accustom themselves to swimming and cleanse away the dust and sweat we have no very just idea of bodily exercise the man who assiduously applies himself to it appears to us rather in a contemplible light inasmuch as the far greater part of his exercises have for their object nothing more than selfgratification whereas among the ancients every exercise even down to that of dancing made a part of the art military with us moderns a deep knowledge in the use of warlike weapons is become ridiculous for since the custom of single combats was introduced fencing has been regarded as the sciences of quarrelsome fellows or cowards those who criticise homer for inspiring his heroes with strength dexterity and agility of body should hold sallust ridiculous who celebrates pompey † for running leaping or carrying a burthen as well as any man of his time whenever the romans thought themselves exposed to any danger or were desirous of repairing some loss it was a constant practice among them to invigotate and give new life to their military discipline are they engaged in a war with the latins a people no less martial than themselves manlius reflects upon the best methods of strengthening the command in the field and puts to death his own son for conquering without his orders are they defeated before numantia scipio æmilianus immediately removes the several blandishments which had enervated them have the roman legions passed under the yoke at numedia metellus wipes away their ignominy the instant he has obliged them to resume their ancient institutions    marius that he may be enabled to vanquish the cm bri and the teutones begins by diverting the course of  rivers and sylla employs in such hard labour his soldiers who were terrified at the war which was carrying on against mithridates that they sue for battle to put an end to their hardships publius nassica made the romans build a fleet of ships at a time when they had no occasion for such a force these people dreaded idleness more than an enemy aulus gellius † gives no very good reasons for the custom among the romans of letting soldiers blood who had committed a fault the true reason is that strength being the chief qualification of a soldier this was the means of adding not to his weakness but to his disgrace these men thus inured were generally healthy and vigorous we do not find by historians that the roman armies which waged war in so great a variety of climate fell often a prey to diseases whereas in the present age we daily see armies without once engaging perish and melt away if i may use the expression in a single campaign desertions are very frequent among us for this reason because the soldiers are the dregs of every nation and not one of them possesses or thinks himself possessed of a certain advantage which gives him a superiority over his comrades but among the romans they were less froquent it being scarce possible that soldiers raised from among a people naturally so haughty and imperious and so sure of commanding over others should demean themselves to such a degree as to cease to be romans as their armies were not great they were easily subsisted the commander had a better opportunity of knowing the several individuals and could more    easily perceive the various faults and misdemeanours committed by the soldiery the violence of their exercises and the wonderful roads they built enabled them to make long and speedy marches their sudden presence damped the spirits of their opposers they shewed themselves especially after some unfortunate event at a time when their enemies were in that state of negligence which is generally consequent on victory in the battles fought in our age every single soldier has very little security and confidence except in the multitude but among the romans every individual more robust and of greater experience in war as well as more inured to the fatigues of it than his enemy relied upon himself only he was naturally endued with courage or in other words with that virtue which a sensibility of our own strength inspires as no troops in the world were in any age so well disciplined it was hardly possible that in a battle how unfortunate soever but some romans must rally in one part or other of it or on the other side but that the enemy must be defeated in some part of the field and indeed we find every where in history that whenever the romans happened to be overpowered at the beginning either by numbers or the fierceness of the onset they at last wrested the laurel out of the enemys hand their chief care was to examine in what particular their enemies had an advantage over them and when this was found they immediately rectified it they accustomed themselves to behold the blood and the wounds of the gladiators the cutting swords  of the gauls and the elephants of pyrrhus intimidated them but once they strengthened their cavalry † first    by taking the bridles from the horses that their impetuosity might be boundless and afterwards by intermixing them with velites   when they understood the excellence of the spanish † sword they quitted their own for it they baffled all the art of the most experienced pilots by the invention of an engine which is described by polybius in fine as josephus observes ‡  war was a subject of meditation to the romans and peace and exercise if any nation boasted either from nature or its institution any peculiar advantage the romans immediately made use of it they employed their utmost endeavours to procure horses from numedia bowmen from crete slingers from the baleares and ships from the rhodians to conclude no nation in the world ever prepared for war with so much wisdom and carried it on with so much intrepidity chap iii the methods by which the romans raised themselves to empire as the people of europe in this age have very near the same arts the same arms the same discipline and the same manner of making war the prodigious fortune to which the romans attained seems incredible to us besides power is at this time divided so disproportionably that it is not possible for a petty state to raise itself merely by its own strength    from the low condition in which providence has placed it this merits some reflections otherwise we might behold several events without being able to account for them and for want of having a perfect idea of the different situation of things we should believe in perusing ancient history that we view a set of men different from ourselves experience has shewn perpetually that an european prince who has a million of subjects cannot without destroying himself keep up and maintain above ten thousand soldiers consequently great nations only are possessed of armies but the case was different anciently with regard to commonwealths for this proportion between the soldiers and the rest of the people which is now as one to an hundred might in those times be pretty near as one is to eight the founders of ancient commonwealths had made an equal distribution of the lands this circumstance alone raised a nation to power that is to say made it a well regulated society this also gave strength to its armies it being equally the interest and this too was very great of every invidual to exert himself in defence of his country when laws were not executed in their full rigour affairs returned back to the same point in which we now see them the avarice of some particular persons and the lavish profuseness of others occasioned the lands to become the property of a few immediately arts were introduced to supply the reciprocal wants of the rich and poor by which means there were but very few soldiers or citizens seen for the revenues of the lands that had before been employed to support the latter were now bestowed wholly on slaves and artificers who administered to the luxury of the new proprietors for otherwise the government which how licentious soever it be must exist would have    been destroyed before the corruption of the state the original revenues of it were divided among the soldiers that is the labourers after it was corrupted they went first to the rich who let them out to flaves and artificers from whom they received by way of tribute a part for the maintenance of the soldiers and it was impossible that people of this cast should be good soldiers they being cowardly and abject already corrupted by the luxury of cities and often by the very art they professed not to mention that as they could not properly call any country their own and reaped the fruits of their industry in every clime they had very little either to lose or keep in the survey  of the people of rome some time after the expulsion of the kings and in that taken by demetrius phalerous † at athens the number of inhabitants was found nearly equal rome had four hundred forty thousand athens four hundred thirtyone thousand but the survey at rome was made at the time when its establishment was come to maturity and that of athens when it was quite corrupt we find that the number of citizens grown up to manhood made at rome a fourth part of its inhabitants and at athens a little less than the twentieth the strength of rome therefore to that of athens was at these different times almost as four to twenty that is it was five times larger agis and cleomenes ‡ observing that instead of thirty thousand citizens for so many were at sparta in lycurguss time there were but seven hundred scarce a hundred of whom were possessed of lands and that all the rest were no more than a cowardly populace they undertook to revive the laws enacted on this occasion and from that period lacedæmonia    recovered its former power and again became formidable to all the greeks it was the equal distribution of lands that at first enabled rome to soar above its humble condition and this the romans were strongly sensible of in their corrupted state this commonwealth was confined to narrow bounds when the latins having refused to succour them with the troops which had been  stipulated ten legions were presently raised in the city only scarce at this time says livy rome whom the whole universe is not able to contain could levy such a force were an enemy to appear suddenly under its wall a sure indication that we have not risen in power and have only increased the luxury and wealth which incommode us tell me would tiberius gracchus say † to the nobles which is the most valuable character that of a citizen or of a perpetual slave who is most useful a soldier or a man entirely unfit for war will you merely for the sake of enjoying a few more acres of land than the rest of the citizens quite lay aside the hopes of conquering the rest of the world or be exposed to see yourselves dispossessed by the enemy of those very lands which you refuse us chap iv of the gauls of pyrrhus parallel between carthage and rome the war of hannibal the romans were engaged in several wars against the gauls a thirst of glory a contempt of death and an inflexible resolution of conquering were equal in both nations but the weapons they used were different the bucklers of the latter was small and their swords    unfit for execution and indeed the gauls were cut to pieces by the romans much after the same manner as the mexicans in these latter ages by the spaniards and a surprizing circumstance is that though these people were combating perpetually with the romans they yet suffered themselves to be destroyed one after another without their ever being sensible of enquiring after or obviating the cause of their calamities pyrrhus invaded the romans at a time when they were strong enough to oppose the power of his arms and to be taught by the victories he obtained over them from him they learned to entrench themselves as also the choice and proper disposition of a camp he accustomed them to elephants and prepared them for mightier wars the grandeur of pyrrhus was confined merely to his personal qualities plutarch  informs us that he was obliged to begin the war of macedonia from his inability to maintain any longer the six thousand foot and five hundred horse in his service this prince sovereign of a small country which has never made the least figure since his time was a military rambler who was continually forming new enterprises because he could not subsist but by enterprizing tarentum his ally had much degenerated from the institution of the lacedæmonians her ancestors †  he might have done great things with the assistance of the samnites but they were almost quite destroyed by the romans as the carthagenians grew wealthy sooner than the romans so they were sooner corrupted thus whilst at rome public employments were made the reward of virtue only and no other emolument accrued from them than honour and a preference in toils at carthage the several advantages which the public can bestow on particular persons were venal and every service done by such persons was there paid by the public  0 a monarchy is not dragged nearer to the brink of ruin by the tyranny of a prince than a commonwealth by a lukewarmness and indifference for the general good the advantage of a free state is that the revenues are employed in it to the best purposes but where does not the reverse of this happen the advantage of a free state is that it admits of no favourites but when the contrary is seen and instead of the friends and relations of a prince great fortunes are amassed for the friends and relations of all persons who have any share in the government in this case an universal ruin must ensue the laws are then eluded more dangerously than they are infringed by a sovereign prince who being always the greatest citizen in the state is most concerned to labour at its preservation by the constant practice of ancient customs and manners and a peculiar use that was made of poverty the fortunes of all the people in rome were very near upon a level but in carthage some particular persons boasted the wealth of kings the two prevailing factions in carthage were so divided that the one was always for peace and the other always for war by which means it was impossible for that city either to enjoy the one or engage in the other to advantage in rome  war immediately united the several interests but in carthage it divided them still more    in a monarchy feuds and divisions are easily quieted because the prince is invested with a coercive power to curb both parties but they are most lasting in a commonwealth because the evil generally seizes the very power which only could have wrought a cure in rome which was governed by laws the people entrusted the senate with the management of affairs but in carthage which was governed by fraud and dissoluteness the people would themselves transact all things carthage in warring with all its riches against the poverty of rome had a disadvantage in this very circumstance for gold and silver may be exhausted but virtue perseverance strength and poverty are inexhaustible the romans were ambitious through pride and the carthaginians through avarice the former would command the latter amass and these whose minds were wholly turned to traffick perpetually casting up their income and expences never engaged in any war from inclination the loss of battles the decrease of a people the decay of trade the consumption of the public treasure the insurrection of neighbouring nations might force the carthaginians to submit to the severest terms of peace but rome was not swayed by the consideration of blessings or calamities being determined by no other motive but its glory and as the romans were persuaded they could not exist without commanding over others neither hopes nor fears of any kind could prevail with them to conclude a peace the conditions of which were not prescribed by themselves nothing is so powerful as a commonwealth in which the laws are exactly observed and this not from fear nor from reason but from a passionate impulse as in rome and lacedæmon for then the wisdom of a good legislature is united to all the strength a faction could possibly boast    the cathaginians made use of foreign forces and the romans employed none but their own as the latter had never considered the vanquished but merely as so many instruments for future triumphs they made soldiers of the several people they conquered and the greater opposition those made the more worthy they judged them of being incorporated into their republic thus we find the samnites who were not subdued till after four and twenty triumphs   became auxiliaries to the romans and some time before the second punic war they raised from among that nation and their allies †  that is from a country of little more extent than territories of the pope and naples seven hundred thousand foot and seventy thousand horse to oppose the gauls in the height of the second punic war rome had always a standing army of twentytwo or twentyfour legions and yet it appears by livy that at this time the census or general survey amounted to but about    000 citizens the carthaginians employed a greater number of troops in invading others and the romans in defending themselves the latter armed as we have just now seen a prodigious multitude of men to oppose the gauls and hannibal who invaded them and they sent out no more than two legions against the most powerful kings by which means their forces were inexhaustible carthage was not so strong from its situation as rome from the spot on which it stood the latter had thirty colonies ‡ round it all which were as so many bulwarks the romans were never abandoned by one of their allies till the battle of cannæ the reason is the samnites and other nations of italy were used to their sovereignty    as most of the cities of africa were poorly fortified they presently surrendered to the first enemy that appeared under their walls so that agathocles regulus scipio in a word all who made a descent on those places immediately spread despair through all carthage we can ascribe to nothing but to an evil administration the several calamities which the carthaginians suffered during the whole war that scipio carried on against them their city   and even their armies were famished at the same time that the romans enjoyed a profusion of all things among the carthaginians the armies which had been defeated grew more insolent upon it insomuch that they sometimes used to crucify their generals punishing them in this manner for their own cowardice among the romans the consul after punishing such soldiers as had fled from their colours by a † decimation marched the surviving forces against the enemy the government of the carthiginians was vastly oppressive ‡  they had trampled so much upon the spaniards that when the romans arrived among them they were considered as their deliverers and if we reflect upon the immense sums it cost the carthaginians to maintain in that country a war which proved fatal to them it will appear that injustice is very improvident and is not mistress of all she promises the founding of alexandria had very much lessened the trade of carthage in the first ages superstition used to banish in some measure all foreigners from egypt and after the persians had conquered this    kingdom they had bent their whole thoughts to the weakening of their new subjects but under the grecian monarchs egypt possessed almost the whole commerce of the universe   and that of carthage began to decay such powers as are established by commerce may subsist for a long series of years in their humble condition but their grandeur is of short duration they rise by little and little and in an imperceptible manner for they do not perform any particular exploit which may make a noise and signalize their power but when they have once raised themselves to so exalted a pitch that it is impossible but all must see them every one endeavours to deprive this nation of an advantage which it had snatched as it were from the rest of the world the carthaginian cavalry was preferable to that of the romans for these two reasons first because the horses of numidia and spain were better than those of italy secondly because the roman cavalry was but indifferently provided with arms for the romans as † polybius informs us did not introduce any change on this occasion till such time as they fought in greece in the first punic war regulus was defeated as soon as the carthaginians made choice of plains for their cavalry to engage in and in the second ‡ hannibal owed his most glorious victories to the numidians scipio by the conquest of spain and the alliance he made with masinissa deprived the carthaginians of this superiority the numedian cavalry won the battle of zama and put an end to the war the carthaginians had greater experience at sea and were better skilled in the working of ships than    the romans but this advantage seems to have been less in those ages than it would be in the present as the ancients had not the use of the seacompass they were confined almost to coasting and indeed they had nothing but gallies which were small and flatbottomed most roads were to them as so many harbours the knowledge of their pilots was very narrow and contracted and their tackle extremely simple their art itself was so imperfect that as much is now done with an hundred oars as in those ages with a thousand their larger vessels had a disadvantage in this that being moved with difficulty by the crew of galleyslaves it was impossible for them to make the necessary evolutions mark antony experienced this in the most fatal manner at actium for his ships were not able to move about when attacked on all sides by the lighter vessels of augustus as the ancients used nothing but galleons the lighter vessels easily broke the oars of the greater ones which were then but as so many unwieldy immoveable machines like modern ships when they have lost their masts since the invention of the seacompass different methods have been employed oars  have been laid aside the main ocean has been visited great ships have been built the machine has become more complicated and the practices have been multiplied the discovery of gun powder has occasioned a circumstance one would no way have suspected which is that the strength of fleets depends more than ever upon art for in order to resist the sury of the cannon and prevent the being exposed to a superior fire it was necessary to build great ships but the power of the art must be proportioned to the bulk of the machine    the small vessels of the antients used often to grapple suddenly with one another on which occasion the soldiers engaged on both sides a whole landarmy was shipped on board a fleet in the seafight won by regulus and his colleague an hundred and thirty thousand romans fought against an hundred and fifty thousand carthagenians at that time soldiers were looked upon as considerable and artists the very reverse but in these ages the soldiers are considered as a little or nothing and artists the very contrary   a strong proof of the difference is the victory won by duillius the consul the romans were totally ignorant of navigation when a carthaginian galley happening to be stranded on their coast served them as a model for the building of others in three months time their sailors were trained their fleet was completely fitted out the romans put to sea came up with the carthaginians and defeated them in this age the whole life of a prince is scarce sufficient for the raising and equipping a navy capable to make head against a power already possessed of the empire of the sea this perhaps may be the only thing which money cannot of itself effect and though a great † monarch in our days succeeded immediately in an attempt of this kind experience has proved to others ‡  that such an example is to be admired rather than imitated the second punic war made so much noise in the world that it is known to every one when we survey attentively the croud of obstacles which started up before hannibal and reflect that this extraordinary man surmounted them all we view the most august spectacle that antiquity can possibly exhibit rome was a miracle in constancy and resolution after the battles of ticinus of trebia and trasymenus after the defeat at cannæ which was still more fatal    to them though they saw themselves abandoned by most of the nations in italy yet they would not sue for peace and for this reason the senate never once receded from their ancient maxims they conducted themselves towards hannibal in the same manner as they had before behaved with regard to pyrrhus to whom they refused all terms of accommodation till such time as he should leave italy and dionysius halicarnasseus  informs us that when coriolanus was treating with the romans the senate declared they would never infringe their ancient customs that their people could not conclude a peace so long as the enemy should continue in their territories but that in case the volscians would think fit to retire they then should agree to any terms that were just and reasonable rome was saved by the strength and vigour of its institution after the battle of cannæ their very women were not allowed to shed tears the senate refused to ransom the prisoners and sent the miserable remains of the army to carry on the war in scicily unrecompensed and deprived of every military honour till such time as hannibal was driven out of italy on the other side terentius varro the consul had fled ignominiously as far as venusia this man whose extraction was very mean had been raised to the consulship merely to mortify the nobles however the senate would not enjoy the unhappy triumph they saw how necessary it was for them to gain the confidence of the people on this occasion they therefore went out to meet vario and returned him thanks for not despairing of the safety of the commonwealth it is commonly not the real loss sustained in a battle that of the slaughter of some thousand men which proves fatal to a state but the imaginary loss the    general damp which deprives it even of that strength and vigour which fortune had left it some things are asserted by all men because they have been asserted once it is thought hannibal committed an egregious error in not laying siege to rome after the battle of cannæ it must be confessed that the inhabitants of the former were at first seized with a panic but then the surprize and dread of a martial people which always turns to bravery is not like that of a despicable populace who are sensible to nothing but their weakness a proof hannibal would not have succeeded is that the romans were still powerful enough to send succours where any were wanted it is also said that hannibal was greatly overseen in marching his army to capua where his soldiers enervated themselves but people who make these assertions should consider that they do not go back to the true cause of it would not every place have proved a capua to a body of men who had enriched themselves with the spoils of so many victories alexander whose army consisted of his own subjects made use on the like occasion of an expedient which hannibal whose army was composed wholly of mercenaries could not employ and this was the setting fire to the baggage of his soldiers and burning all their wealth and his own we are told that kouli khan after his conquest of the indies left to the share of each soldier no more than one hundred and fifty silver roupees the very conquests of hannibal began to change the fortune of the war he did not receive any succours from carthage either by the jealousy of one party      or the too great confidence of the other so long as he kept his whole army together he always defeated the romans but when he was obliged to put garrisons into cities to defend his allies to besiege strong holds or prevent their being besieged he then found himself too weak and lost a great part of his army by piecemeal conquests are easily made because we achieve them with our whole force they are retained with difficulty because we defend them with only a part of our forces chap v the state of greece of macedonia of syria and of egypt after the depression of carthage i imagine hannibal did not abound in witticisms especially in favour of fabius and marcellus against himself i am sorry to see livy strew his flowers on these enormous colossuses of antiquity i wish he had done like homer who neglects embellishing them and knew so well how to put them in motion besides what hannibal is made to speak ought to have common sense but if on hearing the defeat of his brother he said publicly that it was the prelude of the ruin of carthage could any thing have a greater tendency to drive to despair a people who had placed their confidence in him and to discourage an army which expected such high recompences after the war as the carthaginians lost every battle they fought either in spain in sicily or in sardinia hannibal whose enemies were fortifying themselves incessantly whilst very inconsiderable reinforcements were sent him was reduced to the necessity of engaging in a defensive war this suggested to the romans the design of making africa the seat of war accordingly scipio  0 went into that part of the world and so great was his success that the carthaginians were forced to recal from italy hannibal who wept for grief at his surrendering to the romans those very plains in which he had so often triumphed over them whatever is in the power of a great general and a great soldier to perform all this hannibal did to save his country having fruitlessly endeavoured to bring scipio to pacific terms he fought a battle in which fortune seemed to delight in confounding his ability his experience and good sense carthage received the conditions of peace not from an enemy but from a sovereign the citizens of it obliged themselves to pay ten thousand talents in fifty years to give hostages to deliver up their ships and elephants and not to engage in any war without the consent of the romans and in order that this republic might always continue in a dejected state the victors heightened the power of masinissa its irreconcileable enemy after the depression of carthage the romans were scarce engaged but in petty wars and obtained mighty victories whereas before they had obtained but petty victories and been engaged in mighty wars there were in those times two worlds as it were separate from each other in one the carthaginians and romans fought and the other was shaken by the feuds and divisions which had subsisted ever since the death of alexander in the latter no regard was had  to the transactions of the western world for though philip king of macedon had concluded a treaty with hannibal yet very little resulted from it and this monarch who gave the carthaginians but very inconsiderable succours just shewed the romans that he bore them a fruitless ill will    when two mighty people are seen to wage a long and obstinate war it is often ill policy to imagine that it is safe for the rest of the world to continue as so many idle spectators for whichsoever of the two people triumphs over the other engages immediately in new wars and a nation of soldiers marches and invades nations who are but so many citizens this was very manifest in those ages for scarce had the romans subjected the carthaginians but they immediately invaded other nations and appeared in all parts of the earth carrying on an universal invasion there were at that time in the east but four powers capable of making head against the romans greece the kingdoms of macedonia syria and egypt we must take a view of the condition at that time of the two first of those powers because the romans began by subjecting them there were three considerable people in greece the ætolians the achaians and the bœotians these were so many associations formed by free cities which had their general assemblies and magistrates in common the ætolians were martial bold rash greedy of gain very lavish of their promises and oaths in fine a people who warred on land in the same manner as pirates do at sea the achaians were incommoded perpetually by troublesome neighbours or defenders the bœotians who were the most heavy people of all greece but at the same time the wisest lived generally in peace guided entirely by a sensation of happiness and misery they had not genius enough to be either roused or misguided by orators what is most extraordinary their republic subsisted even in the midst of anarchy      lacedæmon had preserved its power by which i mean that warlike spirit which the institutions of lycurgus inspired the thessalians were in some measure enslaved by the macedonians the illyrian kings had already been very much depressed by the romans the acarnanians and athamanes had been cruelly infested by the troops of macedon and ætolia successively the athenians   weak in themselves and unsupported by † allies no longer astonished the world except by the slatteries they lavished on kings and the orators no more ascended the rostra where demosthenes had harangued unless to propose the basest and most scandalous decrees besides greece was formidable from its situation its strength the multitude of its cities the great number of its soldiers its polity manners and laws the greeks delighted in war they knew the whole art of it and had they united would have been invincible they indeed have been terrified by the first philip by alexander and by antipater but not subdued and the kings of macedon who could not prevail with themselves to lay aside their pretensions and their hopes made the most obstinate attempts to enslave them the greatest part of macedonia was surrounded with inaccessible mountains the inhabitants of it were formed by nature for war courageous obedient industrious and indefatigable and these qualities must necessarily have been owing to the climate since the natives of it are to this day the best soldiers in the turkish empire    greece maintained itself by a kind of balance the lacedæmonians were generally in alliance with the ætolians and the macedonians with the achaians but the arrival of the romans quite destroyed the equilibrium as the kings of macedonia were not able to maintain a large body of troops the least loss was of consequence to them besides it was difficult for these monarchs to aggrandize themselves because as their ambitious views were not unknown other nations kept a watchful eye over every step they took and the successes they obtained in the wars undertaken for the sake of their allies was an evil which these very allies endeavoured immediately to remedy but the kings of macedonia generally possessed great talents their monarchy was not like those which proceed for ever in the same steps that were taken at the foundation of them instructed perpetually by dangers and experience involved in all the disputes of greece it was necessary for them either to bribe the principal magistrates of cities to raise a mist before the eyes of nations or to divide or unite their interests in a word they were obliged to expose every moment their persons to the greatest dangers philip who in the beginning of his reign had won the love and confidence of the greeks by his moderation changed on a sudden he became  a cruel tyrant at a time when he ought to have behaved with justice both from policy and ambition he saw though at a distance the romans possessed of numberless forces he had concluded the war to the advantage of his alhes and was reconciled to the ætolians it was natural he should now endeavour to unite all the greeks with himself in order to prevent the romans from fettling in their country but so far from this he exasperated them by petty usurpations and trifled away    his time in examining affairs of little or no consequence at a time when his very existence was endangered by the commission of three or four evil actions he made himself odious and detestable to all greece the ætolians were most exasperated and the romans snatching the opportunity of their resentment or rather of their folly made an alliance with them entered greece and armed it against philip this prince was defeated at the battle of cynocephalæ and the victory was partly gained by the valour of the ætolians so much was he intimidated upon this that he concluded a treaty which was not so properly a peace as the renouncing his own strength for he evacuated his garrisons in all greece delivered up his ships and bound himself under an obligation of paying a thousands talents in ten years polybius compares with his usual good sense the disposition of the roman armies with that of the macedonians which was observed by all the kings who succeeded alexander he points out the conveniencies as well as inconveniencies of the phalanx and of the legion he prefers the disposition used by the romans in which he very probably was right since all the battles fought at that time shew it to have been preferable a circumstance which had contributed very much to the danger to which the romans were exposed in the second punic war was hannibals presently arming his soldiers after the roman manner but the greeks did not change either their arms or their way of fighting and could not prevail with themselves to lay aside customs by the observance of which they had performed such mighty things the success which the romans obtained over philip was the greatest step they ever took towards a general conquest to make sure of greece they employed all methods possible to depress the ætolians by whose assistance they had been victorious they ordained    moreover that every city of greece which had been subject to philip or any other sovereign prince should from that time be governed by its own laws it is very evident that these petty commonwealths must necessarily be dependent the greeks abandoned themselves to a stupid joy and fondly imagined they were really free because the romans had declared them to be so the ætolians who had imagined they should bear sway in greece finding they had only brought themselves under subjection were seized with the deepest grief and as they had always formed desperate resolutions they invited in order to correct one extravagance by another antiochus king of syria into greece in the same manner as they had before invited the romans the kings of syria were the most powerful of all alexanders successors they being possessed of almost all the dominions of darius egypt excepted but by the concurrence of several circumstances their power had been much weakened seleucus who founded the syrian empire had destroyed towards the latter end of his life the kingdom of lysamachus during the feuds and distractions several provinces took up arms the kingdom of pergamus of capadocia and of bithynia started up but these petty fearful states always considered the depression of their former masters as the making of their own fortune as the kings of syria always beheld with a most invidious eye the felicity of the kingdom of egypt they bent their whole thoughts to the conquest of that country by this means neglecting the east they were dispossessed of several provinces there and but indifferently obeyed in the rest in fine the kings of syria possessed upper and lower asia but experience has shewn that in this case when the capital city and the chief forces are in the lower provinces of asia there is no possibility of maintaining    the upper ones and on the contrary when the seat of the empire is in the upper provinces the monarch weakens himself by maintaining the lower ones neither the persian nor syrian empires were ever so powerful as that of the parthians though these reigned over but part of the provinces which formed the dominions of those two powers had cyrus not conquered the kingdom of lydia had seleucus continued in babylon and let the successors of antigonus possess the maritime provinces the greeks would never have conquered the persian empire nor the romans that of seleucus nature has prescribed certain limits to states purposely to mortify the ambition of mortals when the romans stepped beyond those limits the greatest part of them were destroyed by the parthians   when the parthians presumed to pass them they were forced immediately to retire back and in our days such turks as advanced beyond those boundaries were obliged to return whence they came the kings of syria and egypt had in their respective dominions two kinds of subjects victorious nations and nations vanquished the former still puffed up with the idea of their origin were ruled with very great difficulty they were not fired with that spirit of independence which animates us to shake off the yoke but with that impatience which makes us wish to change our sovereign but the chief weakness of the kingdom of syria sprung from that of the court where such monarchs presided as were successors to darius not to alexander luxury vanity and effeminacy which had prevailed through all ages in the asiatic courts triumphed more particularly in that of syria the evil infected the common people and the soldiers and catched the very romans themselves since the war in which they    engaged against antiochus is the true æra of their corruption such was the condition of the kingdom of syria when antiochus who had performed such mighty things declared war against the romans but he did not conduct himself in it with the wisdom which is even employed in common affairs hannibal requested either to have the war revived in italy and philip bribed or else that he might be prevailed upon to stand neuter antiochus did not follow any part of this advice he appeared in greece with only a small part of his forces and as though he were come merely to see the war not to carry it on he followed nothing but his pleasures by which means he was defeated and fled out of asia terrified rather than conquered philip who was dragged to this war by the romans as though a flood had swept him along employed his whole power in their service and became the instrument of their victories the pleasure of taking vengeance of and laying waste ætolia the promise made him of lessening the tribute he paid and of leaving him the possession of certain cities some personal jealousy of antiochus in a word a few inconsiderable motives swayed his resolutions and not daring so much as to think of shaking off the yoke he only considered how he might best lighten it antiochus formed so wrong a judgment of things as to fancy that the romans would not molest him in asia however they followed him thither he was again overcome and in his consternation consented to the most infamous treaty that ever was concluded by so mighty a prince i cannot recollect any thing so magnanimous as a resolution taken by a monarch in our days   to bury himself under the ruins of the throne rather than accept of terms unworthy of a king so haughty was his soul that he could not stoop lower than his misfortunes    had thrown him and he was very sensible that courage may but infamy never can give fresh strength to the regal diadem we often meet with princes who have skill enough to fight a battle but with very few that have the talents requisite for carrying on a war who are equally capable of making a proper use of fortune and of waiting for her and who join to a frame of mind which raises suspicions before it executes such a disposition as makes them fearless after they have once executed after the depression of antiochus only some inconsiderable powers remained if we except egypt which from the advantage of its situation its fertility its commerce the great number of its inhabitants its naval and land forces might have been formidable but the cruelty of its kings their cowardice their avarice their imbecillity and their enormous sensualities made them so odious to their subjects that they supported themselves for the most part by the protection of the romans it was a kind of fundamental law with regard to the crown of egypt that the sisters should succeed with the brothers and in order to preserve unity in the government the brother was married to the sister now it is scarce possible to figure any thing more pernicious in politics than such an order of succession for as all the little domestic feuds rose so high as to disorder the state whichsoever of the two parties had the least discontent immediately excited against the other the inhabitants of alexandria a numberless multitude always prepared to join with the first of their kings who should rouse them so that there were for ever princes who actually reigned and pretenders to the crown and as the kingdoms of cyrene and cyprus were generally possessed by other princes of that house who laid their respective claims to the whole by that means the throne of these princes was ever    tottering and being indifferently settled at home they had no power abroad the forces of the kings of egypt like those of the asiatic monarchs were composed of auxiliary greeks besides the spirit of liberty of honour and of glory which animated the latter people they were incessantly employed in bodily exercises of every kind in all their chief cities games were instituted wherein the victors were crowned in the presence of all greece which raised a general emulation now in an age when combatants fought with arms the success of which depended upon their strength and dexterity it is natural to suppose that men thus exercised must have had a great advantage over a crowd of barbarians who were enlisted at random and dragged indiscriminately into the field as was evident from the armies of darius the romans in order to deprive the kings of such a body of soldiery and to bereave them but in an easy silent manner of their principal forces observed two things first they established by insensible degrees as a maxim with respect to all the cities of greece that they should not conclude any alliance give any succour or make war against any nation whatsoever without their consent secondly in their treaties with kings   they forbad them to levy any forces from among the allies of the romans by which means those monarchs were reduced to employ their national troops only  0 chap vi the conduct which the romans observed in order to subdue all nations during the course of so mighty a prosperity in which it is usual for mankind to forget themselves the senate continued to act with the same depth of judgment and whilst their armies were spreading an universal terror they would not suffer those to rise who were once depressed a tribunal arose which judged all nations at the close of every war they determined the rewards or punishments which every one had merited they took away from the vanquished people part of their lands and gave them to their allies in which they did two things they engaged in the interests of rome princes from whom they had little to fear and much to hope and they weakened others from whom they had nothing to hope and every thing to fear in warring with an enemy they made use of their allies but immediately extirpated the destroyers philip was overcome by the assistance of the ætolians who were destroyed presently after for having joined themselves to antiochus this king was overcome by the assistance of the rhodians but after the most conspicuous rewards had been bestowed upon them they were depressed for ever upon pretence that they had demanded to have a peace concluded with perseus when the romans were opposed by several enemies at the same time they granted a truce to the weakest who thought themselves happy in obtaining it considering it as a great advantage that their ruin had been suspended when they were engaged in a mighty war the senate winked at wrongs of every kind and silently waited the season proper for chastisement if at any time a    people sent them the offenders they refused to punish them chusing rather to consider the whole nation as guilty and reserve to themselves a useful vengeance as they made their enemies suffer inexpressible evils very few leagues were formed against them for he who was at the greatest distance from the danger did not care to come near it for this reason war was seldom denounced against them but themselves always made it at a season in the manner and with a people as best suited their interest and among the great number of nations they invaded there were very few but would have submitted to injuries of every kind provided they could but be suffered to live in peace as it was usual for them to deliver themselves always in a magisterial way such ambassadors as they sent to nations who had not yet felt the weight of their power were sure to meet with illtreatment which furnished them with a sure  pretence to engage in a new war as they never concluded a peace with sincerity and integrity and intended a general invasion their treaties were properly only so many suspensiens from war they inserted such conditions in them as always paved the way to the ruin of those states which accepted them they used to send the garrisons out of the strong holds they regulated the number of the land forces or had the horses and elephants delivered up to them and in case this people were powerful at sea they obliged them to burn their ships and sometimes to remove higher up in the country after having destroyed the armies of a prince they drained his treasury by imposing a heavy tribute or taxing him immoderately under colour of making him defray the expence of the war a new species of tyranny    which obliged him to oppress his subjects and thereby lose their affection whenever they granted a peace to some prince they used to take one of his brothers or children by way of hostage which gave them an opportunity of raising at pleasure commotions in his kingdom when they had the next heir among them it was their custom to intimidate the possessor had they only a prince of a remote degree they made use of him to foment the insurrections of the populace whenever any prince or people withdrew their allegiance from their sovereign they immediately indulged them with the title of  ally to the romans by which means they became sacred and inviolable so that there was no monarch how formidable soever who could rely one moment upon his subjects or even upon his own family although the title of their ally was a kind of servitude †  yet was it very much sought after for these who enjoyed it were sure to receive no injuries but from them and had reason to flatter themselves such would be less grievous hence nations and kings were ready to undertake any kind of services and submitted to the meanest and most abject acts merely for the sake of obtaining it they had various kinds of allies some were united to them by privileges and participation in their grandeur as the latins and the hernici others by their very settlements as their colonies some by good offices as masinissa eumenes and attalus who were obliged to them for their kingdoms or their exaltation others by free and unconstrained treaties and these by the long continuation of the alliance became subjects as the kings of egypt bithynia capadocia and most    of the grecian cities in fine many by forced and involuntary treaties and by the law of their subjection as philip and antiochus for every peace the romans granted an enemy included also an alliance with him or in other words they made every nation subdued by them contribute to the depression of others when they permitted any cities the enjoyment of their liberties they immediately raised two  factions in them one of which defended the laws and liberties of the country whilst the other asserted that the will of the romans was the only law and as the latter faction was always the most powerful it is plain such a liberty could be but a mere name they sometimes possessed themselves of a country upon a pretence of being heirs to it they entered asia bithynia and lybia by the last wills of attalus of nicomedes †  and of appion and egypt was enslaved by that of the king of cyrene to keep great princes for ever in a weak condition they would not suffer them to conclude an alliance with those nations to whom they had granted theirs ‡  and as they did not resuse it to any people who bordered upon a powerful prince this condition inserted in a treaty of peace deprived him of all his allies besides when they had overcome any considerable prince one of the articles of the treaty was that he should not make war upon account of any feuds of his own with the allies of the romans that is to say generally with all his neighbours but should submit them to arbitration which deprived him of a military power for time to come and in order to keep the sole possession of it in their own hands they bereaved their very allies of this force the instant these had the least contest they sent ambassadors who obliged them to conclude a peace    we need but consider the manner in which they terminated the wars of attalus and prusias when any prince had gained such a conquest as often had exhausted him immediately a roman ambassador came and wrested it out of his hands among a multitude of examples we may remember how they with a single word drove antiochus out of egypt fully sensible how well the european nations were turned for war they established as a law that no  asiatic monarch should be suffered to come into europe and there invade any people whatsoever the chief motive of their declaring war against mithridates † was for his having subdued some barbarians contrary to his prohibition when they saw two nations engaged in war although they were not in alliance nor had any contest with either of them they nevertheless appeared upon the stage of action and like our knighterrants always sided with the weakest it was an ‡ ancient custom says dionysius halicarnasseus for the romans to grant succour to all who came to implore it these customs of the romans were not certain particular incidents which happened by chance but were so many invariable principles and this is easy to perceive for the maxims they put in practice against the greatest monarchs were exactly the same with those they had employed in their infant state against the little cities which stood round them they made eumenes and masinissa contribute to the subjection of philip and antiochus as they had before employed the latins and the hernici to subdue the volscians and the tuscans they obliged the carthaginians and the kings of asia to surrender their fleets to    them in like manner as they had forced the citizens of antium to give up their little vessels when any state composed too formidable a body from its situation or union they never failed to divide it the republic of achaia was formed by an association of free cities the senate declared that every city should from that time be governed by its own laws independent on the general authority the commonwealth of bœoria rose likewise from a league made between several cities but as in the war of perseus one city declared for that prince and others for the romans the latter received them into favour when the common alliance was dissolved macedonia was surrounded by inaccessible mountains the senate divided it into four parts declared those free prohibited them every kind of alliance among themselves by marriage carried off all the nobles into italy and by that means reduced this power to nothing had a great monarch who reigned in our time followed these maxims when he saw a neighbouring prince dethroned he would have employed a stronger force in his support and have confined him to the island which continued faithful to him by dividing the only power that could have opposed his designs he would have drawn infinite advantages even from the misfortunes of his ally whenever there happened any feud in a state they immediately made themselves judges of it and thereby were sure of having that party only whom they condemned for their enemy if princes of the same blood were at variance for the crown they sometimes declared them both kings and by this means crushed the power of both if one of them was  a minor    they declared in his favour and made themselves his guardians in quality of protectors of the world for they had carried matters to so high a pitch that nations and kings were there subjects without knowing directly upon what right or title it being a maxim that the bare hearing of their names was sufficient for a people to acknowledge them their sovereigns the romans never engaged in far distant wars till they had first made an alliance with some power contiguous to the enemy they invaded who might unite his troops to the army they sent and as this was never considerable with regard to numbers they always had  another in that province which lay nearest the enemy and a third in rome ever ready to march at a moments warning in this manner they never hazarded but a small part of their forces whilst their enemy ventured all his they sometimes insidiously perverted the subtilty of the terms of their language they destroyed carthage upon pretence that they had promised to preserve the civitas not the urbs †  it is well known in what manner the ætolians who had abandoned themselves to their faith were imposed upon the romans pretended that the signification of these words abandon ones self to the faith of an enemy implied the loss of all things of persons lands cities temples and even of burialplaces the romans would even go so far as to give arbitrary explanations to treaties thus when they were resolved to depress the rhodians they declared that they had formerly given them lycia not by way of present but as a friend and ally when one of their generals concluded a peace merely to preserve his army which was just upon the point of being cut to pieces the senate who did not    ratify it took advantage of this peace and continued the war thus when jugurtha had surrounded an army of romans and permitted them to march away unmolested upon the faith of a treaty these very troops he had saved were employed against him and when the numantians had reduced twenty thousand romans just perishing with hunger to the necessity of suing for peace this peace which had saved the lives of so many thousand citizens was broke at rome and the public faith was eluded by  sending back the consul who had signed it they sometimes would conclude a peace with a monarch upon reasonable conditions and the instant he had signed them they added others of so injurious a nature that he was forced to renew the war thus when they had forced jugurtha to † deliver up his elephants his horses his treasures and his deserters they required him to surrender up his person which being the greatest calamity that can befal a prince cannot for that reason be ever made an article of peace in fine they set up a tribunal over kings whom they judged for their particular vices and crimes they heard the complaints of all persons who had any dispute with philip they sent deputies with them by way of safeguard and obliged perseus to appear before these to answer for certain murthers and certain quarrels he had with some inhabitants of the confederate cities as men judged of the glory of a general by the quantity of the gold and silver carried in his triumph the romans stripped the vanquished enemy of all    things rome was for ever enriching itself and every war they engaged in enabled them to undertake a new one all the nations who were either friends or confederates quite  ruined themselves by the immensely rich presents they made in order to procure the continuance of the favours already bestowed upon them or to obtain greater and half the monies which used to be sent upon these occasions to the romans would have sufficed to conquer them being masters of the universe they arrogated to themselves all the treasures of it and were less unjust robbers considered as conquerors than considered as legislators hearing that ptolemy king of cyprus was possessed of immense wealth they † enacted a law proposed by a tribune by which they gave to themselves the inheritance of a man still living and confiscated to their own use the estates of a confederate prince in a little time the greediness of particular persons quite devoured whatever had escaped the public avarice magistrates and governors used to sell their injustice to kings two competitors would ruin one another for the sake of purchasing an everdubious protection against a rival who was not quite undone for the romans had not even the justice of robbers who preserve a certain probity in the exercise of guilt in fine as rights whether lawful or usurped were maintained by money only princes to obtain it despoiled temples and confiscated the possessions of the wealthiest citizens a thousand crimes were committed purely for the sake of giving to the romans all the money in the universe    but nothing was of greater advantage to this people than the awe with which they struck the whole earth in an instant kings were put to silence and seemed as though they were stupid no regard was had to their eminence but their very persons were attacked to hazard a war was to expose themselves to captivity to death to the infamy of a triumph thus kings who lived in the midst of pomps and pleasures did not dare to fix their eyes stedfastly on the roman people and their courage failing them they hoped to suspend a little the miseries with which they were threatened by their patience and submissive actions observe i intreat you the conduct of the romans after the defeat of antiochus they were possessed of africa asia and greece without having scarce a single city in these countries that were immediately their own they seemed to conquer with no other view but to bestow but then they obtained so complete a sovereignty that whenever they engaged in war with any prince they oppressed him as it were with the weight of the whole universe the time proper for seizing upon the conquered countries was not yet come had the romans kept the cities they took from philip the greeks would have seen at once into their designs had they after the second punic war or that with antiochus possessed themselves of lands in  africa and in asia they could never have preserved conquests so slightly established it was the interest of the romans to wait till all nations were accustomed to obey as free and as confederate before they should attempt to command over them as subjects and to let them blend and lose themselves as it were by little and little in the roman commonwealth  0 see the treaty which they made with the latins after the victory at the lake of legilus   this was one of the principal foundations of their power yet not a single word occurs in it which can give the least suspicion that they aimed at empire this was a slow way of conquering after overcoming a nation they contented themselves with weakening it they imposed such conditions as consumed it insensibly if it recovered they depressed it still more and it became subject without a possibility of dating the first æra of its subjection thus rome was not properly either a monarchy or a commonwealth but the head of a body composed of all the nations in the universe had the spaniards after the conquest of mexico and peru followed this plan they would not have been obliged to destroy all for the sake of preserving all it is a folly in conquerors to force their own laws and customs on all nations such a conduct is of very ill consequence for men are capable of obeying under all kinds of government but as rome did not impose any general laws the nations did not form any dangerous associations they formed one body no otherwise than by a common obedience and were all romans without being countrymen it perhaps will be objected that no empires founded on the laws of fiefs were ever durable or powerful but nothing could be so contradictory as the plan of the romans and that of the goths and just to mention these plans the former was a work of strength the latter of weakness in the one subjection was extreme in the other independence in the gothic states power was lodged in the vassals and the right of judging    only in the prince whereas it was the reverse in the roman government chap vii how it was possible for mithridates to resist the romans among the several kings whom the romans invaded mithridates was the only one who made a courageous defence and exposed them to danger his dominions were situated to wonderful advantage for carrying on a war with them they bordered on the inaccessible countries of mount caucasus peopled with savage nations whom that prince could call to his assistance they thence extended along the sea of pontus which mithridates covered with his ships and he was incessantly purchasing new armies of scythians asia was open to his invasions and he was rich because his cities situated on the pontus euxinus carried on an advantageous traffic with nations less industrious than themselves proscriptions the custom of which began at this time had forced several romans to leave their country these were received by mithridates with open arms and he formed legions   into which he incorporated those exiles who proved the best soldiers in his army on the other side the romans disordered by intestine divisions and threatened with more imminent dangers neglected the affairs of asia and suffered mithridates to pursue his victories or take breath after his defeats nothing had contributed more to the ruin of most kings than the manifest desire they shewed for peace    by this they had prevented all other nations from dividing with them a danger from which they were so anxious to extricate themselves but mithridates immediately made the whole world sensible that he was an enemy to the romans and would be so eternally in fine the cities of greece and asia finding the roman yoke grow more intolerable every day reposed their whole considence in this barbarous king who invited them to liberty this disposition of things gave rise to three mighty wars which form one of the noblest parts of the roman history and for this reason we do not on this occasion read of princes already overcome by luxury and pride as antiochus and tigranes not by fear as philip perseus and jugurtha but a magnanimous king who in adversity like a lion that gazes upon his wounds was fired with the greater indignation upon that account i his part of the roman history is singular because it abounds with perpetual and everunexpected revolutions for as on one side mithridates could easily recruit his armies so it appeared that in those reverses of fortune in which kings stand in greatest need of obedience and a strict discipline his barbarian forces forsook him as he had the art of enticing nations and stirring up cities to rebellion so was he likewise betrayed by his captains his children and his wives in fine as he was sometimes opposed by unexperienced roman generals so there was sent against him at other times sylla lucullus and pompey this prince after having defeated the roman generals and conquered asia macedonia and greece having been vanquished in his turn by sylla confined by a treaty to his former limits and harrassed by the roman generals having been once more superior to them and conqueror of asia driven away by lucullus pursued into his own country obliged to fly for shelter to tigranes and defeated with him finding    this monarch irrecoverably lost and depending merely upon himself for succour he took sanctuary in his own dominions and reascended the throne lucullus was succeeded by pompey who quite overpowered mithridates he then flies out of his dominions and crossing the araxes marches from danger to danger through the country of the lazi and assembling in his way all the barbarians he met with appeared in the bosphorus against his son  macchares who had reconciled himself to the romans although plunged in so deep an abyss he yet † formed a design of making italy the seat of the war and of marching to rome at the head of those nations who enslaved it some years after and by the same way these now took betrayed by pharnaces another of his sons and by an army terrified at the greatness of his enterprises and the perils he was going in search of he died in a manner worthy a king it was then that pompey in the rapidity of his victories completed the pompous work of the roman grandeur he united to the body of its empire countries of a boundless extent which however heightened the roman magnificence rather than increased its power and though it appeared by the titles carried in his triumph that he had increased the revenue of the public treasury ‡ above a third there yet was no augmentation in power and the public liberty was thereby only exposed to the greater danger    chap viii of the divisions which always subsisted in the city whilst rome was conquering the world a hidden war was carrying on within its walls these fires were like those of volcanos which break out the instant they were sed by some combustible substance after the expulsion of the kings the government became aristocratical the patrician families only obtained all the employments and dignities in the  state and consequently all † honours civil and military the patricians being determined to prevent if possible the return of the kings endeavoured to soment the restless principles which now prevailed in the minds of the people but they did more than they would willingly have done by attempting to inspire them with a hatred for kings they fired them with an inordinate thirst for liberty as the royal authority had devolved entirely upon the consuls the people sound they were far from possessing that liberty they were taught to idolize they therefore sought for methods by which they might depress the consulate procure plebeian magistrates and share the curule or greater employments with the nobles the patricians were forced to comply with all the demands of the people for in a city where poverty was the public virtue where wealth that clandestine path to power was despised neither birth nor dignities could bestow any great advantages it was therefore necessary for power to fall into the hands of the greater number and for aristocracy to change by insensible degrees into a popular state    those who are subordinate to a king are less tortured with envy and jealousy than such as live under an hereditary aristocracy the prince is at so great a distance from his subjects that he is scarce seen by them and is raised so far above them that they cannot conceive any relation capable of giving them disgust but when the nobles preside in a state they are exposed to the eyes of all men and are not seated so high as to prevent odious comparisons from being made perpetually and indeed the people have detested senators in this and in all ages such commonwealths in which birth does not bestow any share in the legislature are the happiest in this respect for it is natural that the people should not bear so much envy to an authority which they bestow on whom they think proper and resume at will the people being disgusted at the patricians withdrew to the sacred hill mons sacra whither deputies being sent they were appeased and as they all made a promise to assist one another in case the patricians should not perform their  engagement which would have created seditions every moment and disturbed all the magistrates in the exercise of their functions it was judged better to create an officer †  who might protect the people against any injustice that should be done them but by a malady for ever incident to man the plebeians who had obtained tribunes merely for their own defence employed those very magistrates to annoy others so that they stript by insensible degrees the patricians of all their privileges this gave rise to everlasting contests the people were supported or rather animated by their tribunes and the patricians were defended by the senate the greatest part of which consisted of patricians who were more inclined to favour the ancient maxims and afraid that the populace would raise some tribune to arbitrary power    the people employed in the defence of this magistrate their own strength and the superiority they had in the suffrages their refusal to march into the field their threats to go quite away the partiality of the laws in fine their judiciary sentences against those who had opposed them too vigorously the senate defended themselves by their wisdom their justice and the love they inspired into all for their country by their beneficence and the prudent distribution of the commonwealth by the veneration which the people had for the glory of the principal  families and the virtue of illustrious personages by religion itself the ancient institutions and the prohibition of days of public meeting upon pretence that the auspices had not been favourable by their clients by the opposition of one tribune to another by the creation of a † dictator the occupations of a new war or the misfortunes and calamities which united all parties in a word by a paternal condescension in granting the people part of their demands purposely to make them relinquish the rest and by that stedfast maxim of preferring the safety of the republic to the prerogatives of any order or public employment whatsoever    in process of time when the plebians had depressed the patricians to such a degree that this  distinction of families was empty and fruitless and that both were indiscriminately raised to honours new contests arose between the populace whom their tribunes spirited up and the chief families whether patricians or such plebians as were styled noble and were favoured by the senate that was composed of them but as the ancient manners subsisted no more as particular persons were possessed of immense wealth and that it is impossible but wealth must give power these nobles made a stronger resistance than the patricians had done which occasioned the death of the gracchi and of † several persons who followed their plan ‡  i must take notice of an office which contributed greatly to the happy polity of rome it was that of the censors these numbered or surveyed the § people farther as the strength of the commonwealth consisted in the strictness of discipline in the severity of manners and the uninterrupted observation of certain customs they corrected such errors and abuses as the legislative power had not foreseen or the ordinary    magistrate  could not punish some bad examples are worse than crimes and a violation of manners has destroyed more states than the infraction of laws in rome whatever might tend to introduce dangerous novelties to create a change in the minds or affections of the citizens and prevent if i may use the expression the perpetuity of it all disorders and tumults whether public or private were reformed by the censors these had authority to expel whomsoever they pleased the senate could take from a knight the horse maintained for him at the public expence or degrade a citizen to the rank of such as contributed to the maintenance of the magistrates of the city without enjoying the privileges of it in a word the censors took a view of the actual situation of the republic and distributed the people † among their various tribes in such a manner as to prevent the tribunes and persons    of an aspiring temper from engrossing the suffrages or the people from abusing their power m livius  degraded the people themselves and reduced thirtyfour tribes out of thirtyfive to the rank of those who had no share in the privileges of the city for said this roman you first condemned me and afterwards raised me to the consulate and the censorship you therefore must either have prevaricated once in punishing me or twice in creating me consul and afterwards censor m duronius †  tribune of the people was expelled the senate by the censors for having annulled when in office the law which limits the expences of feasts the following institution was a very wise one no magistrate ‡ could be turned out of his employment because that would have disturbed the exercise of the public power but they divested such a man of his order and rank and deprived as it were a citizen of his particular nobility servius tullius had made the famous division by centuries which livy ∥ and dionysius halicarnasseus § have so well explained he had divided one hundred and ninetythree centuries into six classes and in the last century which of itself formed the sixth class he placed all the commonalty this disposition evidently excluded the commonalty from voting not of right but in fact afterwards it was determined that some particular cases excepted the division of tribes should be followed in voting there were thirtyfive of these tribes each having their respective vote four belonging to the city and thirtyone to the country the principal citizens who were all farmers naturally belonged to the countrytribes and those of the city  0 admitted the commonalty   though these had very little influence in affairs this was considered as the safety of the republic and when fabius replaced in the four citytribes the commonalty whom appius claudius had dispersed through them all he acquired by that action the title of maximus †  the censors every five years surveyed the state of the republic and distributed the people in their several tribes in such a manner that the tribunes and ambitious might not engross the votes nor the people abuse their power the government of rome was wonderful in this respect ever since the foundation of that city its constitution was such either from the genius of the people the strength of the senate or the authority of certain magistrates that every abuse of power might always be reformed in it carthage was destroyed because when abuses were to be retrenched the citizens could not bear the hand even of their hannibal athens fell because the errors of the people appeared so lovely in their own eyes that they would not be cured of them and among us those italian republics which boast the perpetuity of their government ought to boast of nothing but the perpetuity of their abuses nor indeed do they enjoy greater liberty ‡ than rome did under the decemviri the british government is one of the wisest in europe because there is a body which examines it perpetually and is perpetually examining itself and its errors are of such a nature as never to be lasting and are frequently useful by rouzing the attention of the nation in a word a free government that is to say one for ever in motion cannot support itself unless its own laws are capable of correcting the disorders of it    chap ix two causes which destroyed rome whilst the sovereignty of rome was confined to italy it was easy for the commonwealth to subsist every soldier was at the same time a citizen every consul raised an army and other citizens marched into the field under his successor as their forces were not very numerous such  persons only were received among the troops as had possessions considerable enough to make them interested in the preservation of the city the senate kept a watchful eye over the conduct of the generals and did not give them an opportunity of machinating any thing to the prejudice of their country but after the legions had passed the alps and crossed the sea the soldiers whom the romans had been obliged to leave during several campaigns in the countries they were subduing lost insensibly that genius and turn of mind which characterized a roman citizen and the generals having armies and kingdoms at their disposal were sensible of their own strength and could no longer obey the soldiers therefore began to acknowledge no superior but their general to found their hopes on him only and to view the city as from a great distance they were no longer the soldiers of the republic but of sylla of marius of pompey and of cæsar the romans could no longer tell whether    the person who headed an army in a province was their general or their enemy so long as the people of rome were corrupted by their tribunes only on whom they could bestow nothing but their power the senate could easily defend themselves because they acted consistently and with one regular tenor whereas the common people were continually shifting from the extremes of fury to the extremes of cowardice but when they were enabled to invest their favourites with a formidable exterior authority the whole wisdom of the senate was baffled and the commonwealth was undone the reason why free states are not so permanent as other forms of government is because the misfortunes and successes which happen to them generally occasion the loss of liberty whereas the successes and misfortunes of an arbitrary government contribute equally to the enslaving of the people a wise republic ought not to run any hazard which may expose it to good or ill fortune the only happiness the several individuals of it should aspire after is to give perpetuity to their state if the unbounded extent of the roman empire proved the ruin of the republic the vast compass of the city was no less fatal to it the romans had subdued the whole universe by the assistance of the nations of italy on whom they had bestowed various privileges at different times most of those nations did not at first set any great value on the freedom of the city of rome and some  chose rather to preserve their ancient usages but when this privilege became that of universal sovereignty when a man who was not a roman citizen was considered as nothing and with this title was all things    the people of italy resolved either to be romans or die not being able to obtain this by cabals and intreaties they had recourse to arms and  rising in all that part of italy opposite to the ionian sea the rest of the allies were going to follow their example rome being now forced to combat against those who were if i may be allowed the figure the hands with which they shackled the universe was upon the brink of ruin the romans were going to be confined merely to their walls they therefore granted this so much wishedfor † privilege to allies who had not yet been wanting in fidelity and they indulged it by insensible degrees to all other nations but now rome was no longer that city the inhabitants of which had breathed one and the same spirit the same love for liberty the same hatred of tyranny a city in which a jealousy of the power of the senate and of the prerogatives of the great ever accompanied with respect was only a love of equality the nations of italy ‡ being made citizens of rome every city brought thither its genius its particular interests and its dependance on some mighty protector rome being now rent and divided no longer formed one entire body and men were no longer citizens of it but in a kind of fictitious way as there were no longer the same magistrates the same walls the same gods the same temples the same burying places rome was no longer beheld with the same eyes the citizens were no longer fired with the same love for    their country and the roman sentiments were obliterated cities and nations were now invited to rome by the ambitious to disconcert the suffrages or influence them in their own favour the public assemblies were so many conspiracies against the state and a tumultuous croud of seditious wretches were dignified with the title of comitia   the authority of the people and their laws nay that people themselves were more than so many chimæras and so universal was the anarchy of those times that it was not possible to determine whether the people had made a law or not authors enlarge very copiously on the divisions which proved the destruction of rome but their readers seldom discover those divisions to have been always necessary and inevitable the grandeur of the republic was the only source of that calamity and exasperated popular tumults into civil wars dissentions were not to be prevented and those martial spirits which were so fierce and formidable abroad could not be habituated to any considerable moderation at home those who expect in a free state to see the people undaunted in war and pusillanimous in peace are certainly desirous of impossibilities and it may be advanced as a general rule that whenever a perfect calm is visible in a state    that calls itself a republic the spirit of liberty no longer subsists union in a body politic is a very equivocal term true union is such a harmony as makes all the particular parts as opposite as they may seem to us concur to the general welfare of the society in the same manner as discords in music contribute to the general melody of sound union may prevail in a state full of seeming commotions or in other words there may be an harmony from whence results prosperity which alone is true peace and may be considered in the same view as the various parts of this universe which are eternally connected by the action of some and the reaction of others in a despotic state indeed which is every government where the power is immoderately exerted a real division is perpetually kindled the peasant the soldier the merchant the magistrate and the grandee have no other conjunction than what arises from the ability of the one to oppress the other without resistance and if at any time a union happens to be introduced citizens are not then united but dead bodies are laid in the grave contiguous to each other it must be acknowledged that the roman laws were too weak to govern the republic but experience has proved it to be an invariable fact that good laws which raise the reputation and power of a small republic become incommodious to it when once its grandeur is established because it was their natural effect to make a great people but not to govern them the difference is very considerable between good laws and those which may be called convenient between such laws as give a people dominion over others and such as continue them in the possession of power when they have once acquired it there is at this time a republic  in the world of which sew persons have any knowledge and which    by plans accomplished in silence and secrecy is daily enlarging its power and certain it is that if it ever rises to that height of grandeur for which it seems preordained by its wisdom it must inevitably change its laws and the necessary innovations will not be effected by any legislator but must spring from corruption itself rome was founded for grandeur and its laws  had an admirable tendency to bestow it for which reason in all the variations of her government whether monarchy aristocracy or popular she constantly engaged in enterprizes which required conduct to accomplish them and always succeeded the experience of a day did not furnish her with more wisdom than all other nations but she obtained it by a long succession of events she sustained a small a moderate and an immense fortune with the same superiority derived true welfare from the whole train of her prosperities and refined every instance of calamity into beneficial instructions she lost her liberty because she compleated her work too soon chap x of the corruption of the romans i am of opinion that the sect of epicurus which began to be propagated at rome towards the close of the republic was very prejudicial to the minds and genius of the people †  the greeks had been infatuated    with its doctrines long before and consequently were corrupted much earlier than the romans we are assured by polybius   that oaths in his time could not induce any person to place confidence in a greek whereas they were considered by a roman as inviolable obligations upon his conscience there is a passage in one of ciceros letters to † atticus which manifestly discovers how much the romans had degenerated in this particular since the time of polybius memmius says he imparted to the senate the agreement he and his fellow candidate had made with the consuls by which the latter stipulated to favour them in their solicitations for the consulship the ensuing year and they obliged themselves to pay four hundred thousand sesterces to the consuls if they did not furnish them with three augurs who should declare they themselves were present when the people made the curiatian law ‡  though in reality it had not been enacted and two former consuls who should affirm they had assisted at signing the edict of the senate which regulated the state of the provinces assigned to the present consuls notwithstanding no such edict was in being what an admirable set of people we discover in a single contract as religion always furnishes the best security for the rectitude of human actions so there was this peculiarity    among the romans that the love they expressed for their country was blended with some particular sentiment of devotion that mighty city founded in the most auspicious period the great romulus at once their monarch and their god the capitol esteemed as eternal as the city and the city reputed as eternal as its founder had anciently struck such impressions on the minds of the romans as might well be wished to have been constantly retained the grandeur of the state in general constituted the greatness of its particular members but as affluence consists in conduct and not in riches that wealth of the romans which had certain limitations introduced a luxury and profusion which had no bounds those who had been at first corrupted by their opulence received the same taint in their poverty by aspiring after acquisitions that no way comported with private life it was difficult to be a good citizen under the influence of strong desires and the regret of a large fortune that had been lost people in this situation were prepared for any desperate attempt and as sallust  says there was at that time a generation of men who as they had no patrimony of their own could not endure to see others less necessitous than themselves but as great soever as the corruption of rome might then be all its calamitous effects were not introduced among the people for the efficacy of those institutions by which they were originally established was so extraordinary that they always preserved an heroic fortitude and devoted themselves with the greatest application to war amidst all the softenings of luxury and pleasure which seems to me to be a circumstance in which they were never imitated by any nation in the world    the romans were not solicitous to improve commerce or cultivate the sciences but ranked them among the attentions proper for slaves   we may except indeed some particular persons who had received their freedom and persisted in their former industry but their knowledge in general was confined to the art of war which was the only track † by which they could arrive at promotions in the magistracy and other stations of honour for which reason their military virtues subsisted after all the rest were extinguished chap xi of sylla pompey and cæsar i intreat the readers permission to turn my eyes from the horrors of the wars between marius and sylla appian has collected all the dreadful particulars into this history besides the jealousy ambition and barbarity of the two chiefs each particular roman was infatuated with fury the new citizens ‡  and the ancient no longer considered each other as members of the same republic but gave a loose to a series of hostilities so peculiar in their nature as to comprehend all the miseries of a civil and foreign war  0 sylla made several good laws and reduced the power of the tribunes to which we may add that the moderation or caprice which induced him to resign the dictatorship reestablished the senate for some time but in the fury of his success he suffered himself to be hurried into actions which in their consequences made it impossible for rome to preserve her liberty in his asian expedition he wholly destroyed the military discipline he accustomed his army to rapine   and taught them wants to which before they were absolute strangers he first corrupted the soldiers who afterwards corrupted their leaders he entered rome with an armed force and taught the roman generals to violate the asylum of liberty †  he distributed ‡ the lands of the citizens among his soldiers and by that proceeding corrupted them for ever because from that moment there was not one of the military profession who did not wait for an opportunity of seizing the effects of his fellowcitizens he was likewise the inventor of proscriptions and set a price on the head of every man who had not embraced his party from that time it became impossible for any one to be devoted to the republic for whilst two ambitious men were contending for superiority those who observed a neutrality or were attached to the cause of liberty were sure to be proscribed by either of the competitors who should prove victorious it therefore became prudent to engage in one of the two parties he was succeeded says cicero §  by a man who in an impious cause and a victory still more infamous    not only confiscated the effects of individuals but involved entire provinces in the same calamity sylla when he abdicated the dictatatorship pretended that he was unwilling to live in any other manner than under the protection of his own laws but that action which indicated so much moderation was itself a consequence of his violences he had given lands to fortyseven legions in different parts of italy these forces says appian regarding their fortune as attached to his life gave the greatest attention to his safety and were always ready either to succour or avenge him   as the republic was fated to destruction the only material question was who should have the credit of overwhelming it two men equally ambitious with this exception that the one knew how to proceed directly to his purpose better than the other eclipsed by their reputation their exploits and their virtues all the rest of the citizens pompey made the first appearance in the scene of action and cæsar immediately followed him pompey to render himself popular had disannulled the law of sylla which limited the power of the people and when he had sacrificed the most salutary laws of his country to his particular ambition he obtained all he desired and the rash indiscretion of the populace was altogether unbounded in his favour the roman laws had wisely parcelled out the public power into several magistracies which mutually supported as well as restrained and tempered each other and as the power of all who enjoyed those promotions was confined to a proper extent every citizen was qualified for a station of that nature and the people seeing numbers of such persons passing away in succession were not habituated to any particular magistrate among them but in the times we    are now describing the plan of government was changed the most potent competitors obtained extraordinary commissions from the people which annihilated the authority of the magistrates and drew all the great affairs into the hands of one man or a few was war to be proclaimed against sertorius pompey was nominated to command the army were the romans to march against mithridates every voice called aloud for pompey did it become necessary to transinit corn to rome the people would have given it over for lost had not pompey been entrusted with the importation were the pirates to be destroyed who so proper for that expedition as pompey and when cæsar himself threatened rome with an invasion the senators cried out in their turn and placed all their confidence in pompey i am willing to believe said marcus  to the people that this pompey who is so much caressed by the nobility is more inclinable to secure your liberty than he is to countenance their authority over you but there was a time when each individual among you was protected by several and not the whole body of the people by one person and when it was never known that a single man either gave or took away things of so much consequence as rome was formed for grandeur it became necessary to unite the honours and power in the same persons which in unquiet times would six the admiration of the people on one particular citizen when honours are granted the givers know exactly what they bestow but when power is added to the donation they can never be certain how far it will be extended immoderate preferences given to a citizen in a republic are always productive of necessary effects they either raise envy in the people or make their affection overflow all bounds    when pompey returned twice to rome in a condition to enslave the republic he had the moderation to disband his armies before he entered the city and then he made his appearance with the air of a common citizen these instances of a disinterested behaviour which completed all his glory did not fail in their consequences to make the senate always declare in his favour whenever he attempted any thing prejudicial to the laws the ambition of pompey was more unactive and gentle than that of cæsar this warrior resolved like sylla to open himself a passage to sovereign power by arms but pompey grew displeased at such a method of oppression he aspired indeed to the dictatorship but was willing to owe it to the suffrages of the people he could not resolve to usurp power but would have been glad to have had it tendered to him as a gift as the favour of the people is always in a fluctuating state there were some seasons wherein pompey beheld his reputation in a declining condition   and it affected him in the most tender part to see the very persons he despised make advances in popularity and then employ it against him this led him into three actions equally fatal he corrupted the people with money and fixed a price in the elections on the suffrage of each citizen he employed the vilest of the populace to incommode the magistrates in the exercise of their functions in hopes that wise people growing weary of living in a state of anarchy would be urged by despair to create him dictator in a word he united his interests with those of cæsar and crassus cato said their union and not their enmity destroyed the republic and in reality it was then reduced to such an unhappy state that it    received less injury from civil wars than by a peace which as it united the views and interests of the leading men so it naturally introduced tyranny in the government pompey did not properly lend his reputation to cæsar but sacrificed it to his cause without knowing what he did and cæsar in return employed all the power he had received from pompey to the prejudice of the donor and even played off his own artifices against him he raised troubles in the city by his emissaries he made himself master of all elections and consuls prætors and tribunes purchased their promotions at their own price the senate who easily penetrated into cæsars designs had recourse to pompey and intreated him to undertake the defence of the republic if that name might properly be given to a government which implored protection of one of its citizens i am of opinion that what contributed most to pompeys destruction was the shame that affected him when he grew sensible that by raising cæsar as he had done he had committed a satal oversight but he suffered this consideration to prevail as late as possible and did not prepare for his defence lest he should be obliged to acknowledge himself in danger he asserted before the senate that cæsar durst not engage in a war and because he had made such a declaration several times he always persisted in repeating it one circumstance seems to have capacitated cæsar for any undertaking and that was the unhappy conformity of names the senate had added to his government of the cisalpine gaul all that part of gaul which was distinguished by the name of transalpine as the politics of those times did not permit armies to be stationed near rome so neither would they suffer italy to be entirely destitute of troops for which reason considerable forces were quartered in cisalpine gaul a country which extends from the rubicon a    little river in romania to the alps but in order to secure the city of rome against those troops the senate passed that famous edict which is still to be seen engraven in the road near rimini by which they solemnly devoted to the infernal gods and branded with sacrilege and parricide any person whatever who should presume to pass the rubicon with an army a legion or a single cohort to a government of that importance as to keep the city in awe another was added which proved still more considerable and that was all the transalpine gaul which comprehended the southern parts of france where cæsar had for several years an opportunity of prosecuting war against as many nations as he pleased by which means his soldiers advanced in years as well as himself and were conquered by him in their turn as well as the barbarians had cæsar not been entrusted with the government of transalpine gaul he could not have corrupted his troops nor rendered his name venerable to them by so many victories and had he not enjoyed cisalpine gaul pompey might have stopped him at the pass of the alps whereas he was compelled to retire from italy when the war began which made him lose among his own party that reputation which in civil wars is the very soul of power the same consternation which hannibal diffused through rome after the battle of cannæ was spread by cæsar over all that city when he had passed the rubicon pompey was so confounded that he became incapable even in the first moments of the war of forming any design but such as is usually suggested in the most desperate conjunctures he could only retire and trust to flight accordingly he lest rome and the public treasure and as he was in no condition to retard the conqueror he forsook part of his troops abandoned all italy and crossed the sea    cæsars fortune has been greatly celebrated but this extraordinary man enjoyed to many great qualities without the intermixture of a defect though he had several vicious inclinations that he would have been victorious at the head of any army he had commanded and would have governed in any republic that had given him birth when he had deseated pompeys lieutenants in spain he passed into greece to seek pompey himself and this general who had possessed himself of the seacoasts and was master of a superior force was on the point of beholding cæsars army destroyed by misery and famine but as the desire of approbation was his predominant frailty he could not forbear giving attention to some vain speeches  of those about him who were perpetually blaming his conduct and mortifying him with their jests this general says one would perpetuate his command and be a new king of kings like agamemnon i assure you replies another we shall not eat any tusculum figs this year a few encounters in which he had succeeded quite intoxicated the heads of this senatorial host and pompey to avoid censure gave into an indiscretion which posterity will ever blame he resolved to sacrifice all the advantages he had then obtained and marched at the head of undisciplined troops to engage an army that had been so frequently victorious when the shattered remains of pharsalia were withdrawn into africa scipio who then commanded them resused to follow catos advice for protracting the war he grew elated with a few instances of success he risked all and immediately lost all he had risked and when brutus and cassius reestablished that party the same precipitation destroyed the republic a third time †     it is observable that in the long course of these civil wars the power of rome was continually extending in foreign parts under marius sylla pompey cæsar antony and augustus and that mighty city growing daily more formidable completed the destruction of all the kings who presumed to resist her no state threatens its neighbours with conquest so much as that which is involved in the horrors of civil war in such a season the nobility the citizens the artizans the peasants and in short the whole body of the people become soldiers and when peace has united all the contending parties this state enjoys great advantages over others whose subjects are generally citizens besides civil wars always produce great men because in the universal confusion which then reigns those who are distinguished by any particular merit have a favourable opportunity of making themselves conspicuous each of these persons ranges himself in a suitable situation whereas in times of peace they are stationed by others and generally very injudiciously we shall pass from the romans and inquire for instances of this truth in nations that are more modern and among these france was never so formidable abroad as after the contentions between the houses of burgundy and orleans after the troubles of the league after the civil wars in the minority of lewis the thirteenth and after the national dissentions in the nonage of lewis the fourteenth england was never so much respected as in the time of cromwell after the wars of the long parliament the germans did not gain their superiority over the turks till after the civil wars of the empire the spaniards under philip the fifth and immediately after the civil wars that were kindled by the succession invaded sicily with such a force as astonished all europe and we now see the persians rising from the ashes of a civil war and humbling the ottoman power    in a word the republic was at last enslaved and we are not to charge that calamity on the ambition of particular persons but should rather impute it to the disposition of man in general whose cravings after power are always most insatiable when he enjoys the greatest share and who only desires the whole because he possesses a large part if the sentiments of cæsar and pompey had resembled those of cato others would have had the same ambitious thoughts as pompey and cæsar discovered and since the republic was fated to fall it would have been dragged to the precipice by some other hand cæsar pardoned every mortal but the moderation people discover when they have usurped all seems to be no extraordinary accomplishment though he has been much commended for being indefatigable after the battle of pharsalia yet cicero very justly accuses him of remissness he tells cassius  they never could have imagined pompeys party would have revived so considerably in spain and africa and that if they could have foreseen that cæsar would have amused himself in his alexandrian war they would not have made their peace with him as they did but would have followed scipio and cato into africa and thus a weak passion for a woman made him engage in four wars and by not foreseeing the two last he hazarded all he had gained at pharsalia cæsar governed at first under the usual titles of magistracy for nothing affects mankind more than names and as the asiatics abhorred those of consul and proconsul the europeans detested that of king so that those titles constituted at that time the happiness or despair of all the earth he made some overtures to have the diadem placed on his head but when he grew sensible that the people discontinued    their acclamations he thought fit to reject it he likewise made other attempts   and it is not to be comprehended how he could believe that the romans in order to suffer him to be a tyrant should for that reason be in love with tyranny or could even give credit to what they themselves had done one day when the senate tendered him some particular honours he neglected to rise from his seat and from that moment the gravest members of that body lost all patience mankind are always most offended at any trespass on the ceremonials and punctilios they expect if you endeavour to oppress them it sometimes passes for a proof of the esteem you entertain for them but a violation of their decorums is always an instance of contempt cæsar who was a constant enemy to the senate could not conceal the mean opinion he entertained of that body who had almost rendered themselves ridiculous when they were no longer in possession of power for which reason even his clemency was an insult and it became evident that he only pardoned because he scorned to punish cæsar formed the edicts of the senate himself and subscribed them with the names of the first senators he happened to think on cicero in the ninth book of his familiar letters writes to this effect i have been sometimes informed that an edict of the senate passed by my consent has been transmitted to syria and armenia before i had any knowledge that it was made and several princes have sent me letters of acknowledgment for my consent to allow them the title of kings when at the same time i was so far from knowing them to be kings till that moment that i even had not heard there were any such persons in the world  0 we may see in the letters  of some great men of that time though they passed under ciceros name because most of them were written by himself into what dejection and despair persons of the first rank in the republic were sunk by this sudden revolution which divested them of their honours and even their employments when the senate having no longer any functions to perform that reputation they had acquired through all the world was now to be dispensed from the cabinet of one man this state of affairs appears in a much better light in those letters than in any relations of historians and they are the most masterly representation of the ingenuous turn of mind of a set of people united by a common affliction and give us a complete portrait of an age wherein a false politeness had not infected all society with insincerity and untruth in a word they are not written like out modern letters with a view to deceive but are the faithful intercourse of friends who communicated all they knew it was hardly possible for cæsar in his situation to preserve his life the generality of the conspirators against him were of his party †  or had received many great obligations from him and the reason of their intention to assassinate him is very natural they had gained signal advantages by his conquest but the more their fortune improved the greater was their share of the common calamity and to those who have not any thing they can properly call their own it seems in some particulars to be of little consequence under what government they live besides there was a certain law of nations or a settled opinion which prevailed in all the republics of greece and italy and ascribed the character of a virtuous man to the person who should assassinate any one    who had usurped the sovereign power rome had been extremely fond of this notion ever since the expulsion of her kings the law was very express the examples had a general approbation the republic put a sword into the hand of every citizen constituted him their magistrate for a few moments and acknowledged him for their defender brutus  was bold enough to tell his friends that should his own father return from the grave he would sacrifice him to the public good with as little remorse as he stabbed cæsar and though by the continuance of tyranny this surprising spirit of liberty had gradually lost its vigour yet the conspiracies at the beginning of augustuss reign were perpetually reviving the ancient romans were animated by a predominant love for their country which acting by a variation from the common ideas of crimes and virtues was only attentive to its own dictates and in the fervors of its operation entirely disregarded friends and citizens fathers and benefactors virtue seemed to have forgotten her own precepts with a resolution to surpass herself and when an action seemed too severe to be immediately considered with approbation she soon caused it to be admired as divine in a word did not the guilt of cæsar who lived in a free government consist in placing himself out of the reach of all punishments but an assassination and when we ask why he was not opposed by open force or the power of the laws do we not at the same time demand satisfaction for his crimes    chap xii observations on the state of rome after the death of cæsar so impossible was it for the republic to accomplish its reestablishment that a conjuncture then happened which was never known before there was no longer any tyrant and yet liberty was extinguished for the causes which had contributed to its destruction still subsisted to prevent its revival the assassins had only formed the plan of a conspiracy but had not taken any measures to render it effectual in the event when they had struck the blow they all retired to the capital the senate sorbore to assemble and the next day lepidus who was fond of commotions took possession of the forum with a band of soldiers at his devotion the veteran troops who were apprehensive that the immense donations they had received would be no longer repeated had marched into rome this proceeding compelled the senate to approve all the acts of cæsar and then by a faculty of reconciling extremes they granted a general amnesty to the conspirators which produced a false appearance of peace cæsar a little before his death whilst he was preparing for his expedition against the parthians had appointed magistrates for several years that he might secure himself a set of men who in his absence would maintain the tranquility of his government so that after his death the party who had espoused his interest were in a condition to support themselves for a considerable time as the senate had ratified all the acts of cæsar without any restriction and as the consuls were intrusted with the execution of them antony who    was then one of those magistrates got possession of cæsars book of accounts gained upon his secretary and made him insert in that book all the articles he thought proper by which means the dictator reigned more imperiously than when he was living for what he could never have accomplished antony had the dexterity to effect great sums of money which cæsar would never have bestowed were distributed among the people by antony and every man who had any seditious designs against the government was sure to find a sudden gratuity in cæsars books it unfortunately happened that cæsar to make his expedition effectual had amassed prodigious sums and deposited them in the temple of ops antony disposed of these as he thought fit by the expedient of his book the conspirators had at first determined to cast the body of cæsar into the tyber   and might have executed that design without any interruption for in those seasons of astonishment which succeed unexpected events every intention becomes practicable this however did not take effect and we shall now relate what happened on that occasion the senate thought themselves under a necessity of permitting cæsars funeral obsequies to be performed and indeed they could not decently forbid them as they had never declared him a tyrant now the romans in conformity to a custom established among them and much boasted of by polybius always carried in their funeral processions the images which represented the ancestors of the deceased and made an oration over the body antony who charged himself with this last province unfolded the bloody robe of cæsar to the view of all the people read to them the particulars of his will in which he had left them extraordinary    legacies and then wrought them into such violent emotions that they immediately fired the houses of the conspirators cicero who governed the senate in this whole affair   makes no scruple to acknowledge that it would have been much better to have proceeded with vigour and even to have exposed themselves to destruction though indeed it was not probable that such a fate would have attended them but he alledges for his excuse that as the senate was then assembled they had no opportunity in their favour and he adds that those who are sensible of the importance even of a moment in affairs wherein the people have so considerable a part will not be surprized at his conduct in that transaction another accident happened at this time when the people were celebrating funeral games in honour of cæsar a comet with long flaming hair appeaed for the space of seven days which made them believe the soul of cæsar was received into heaven it was very customary for the people of greece and asia to erect temples † to the kings and even the proconsuls who had governed them and they were indulged in this practice because it was the greatest evidence they could possibly give of their abject servitude nay the romans themselves might in their private temples where their lares were deposited render divine honours to their ancestors but i cannot remember that from the time of romulus to julius cæsar any roman ‡ was ever ranked among the gods of the republic the government of macedonia was assigned to antony but he was desirous of changing it for that of gaul and the motives which so induced him are very evident decimus brutus who governed cisalpine    gaul having refused to resign that province to antony he was resolved to deprive him of it by force this produced a civil war in which the senate declared antony an enemy to his country cicero to accomplish the destruction of antony his mortal enemy was so injudicious as to employ all his interest for the promotion of octavius and instead of defacing the idea of one cæsar in the minds of the people he placed two before their eyes octavius in his conduct to cicero acted like a man who knew the world he flattered he praised he consulted him and employed every engaging artifice which vanity never distrusts great affairs are frequently disconcerted because those who undertake them seldom confine their expectations to the principal event but look after some little particular success which soothes the indulgent opinion they entertain of themselves i am inclined to think that if cato had reserved himself for the republic he would have given a very different turn to affairs cicero had extraordinary abilities for the second class but was incapable of the first his genius was fine but his soul seldom soared above the vulgar his characteristic was virtue that of cato glory   cicero always beheld himself in the first rank cato never allowed his merit a place in his remembrance this man would have preserved the republic for his own sake the other that he might have boasted of the action i might carry on the parallel by adding that when cato foresaw cicero was intimidated and when the former hoped the latter was confident cato beheld things through a serene medium cicero viewed them through a glare of little passions antony was defeated at modena where the two consuls hirtius and pansa lost their lives the senate    who thought themselves superior to their tumultuous affairs began to think of humbling octavius who now ceased hostilities against antony marched his army to rome and caused himself to be declared consul in this manner did cicero who boasted that his robe had crushed the arms of antony introduce an enemy into the republic the more formidable because his name was much dearer to the people and his pretensions to all appearance better founded   antony after his overthrow retired into transalpine gaul where he was received by lepidus these two men entered into an association with octavius and gave up to each other the lives of their friends and their enemies †  lepidus continued at rome whilst the other two went in quest of brutus and cassius and found them in those parts where the empire of the world was thrice contended for in battle brutus and cassius killed themselves with a precipitation not to be vindicated and it is impossible to read this period of their lives without pitying the republic which was so abandoned cato closed the tragedy with his own murder and these in some measure opened it with theirs several reasons may be assigned for this custom of selfdestruction which so generally prevailed among the romans the progress of stoicism which encouraged it the establishment of triumphs and slavery which induced several great men to believe they ought not to survive a deseat the advantages accruing to the accused who put an end to life rather than submit to a tribunal which condemned their memory to infamy ‡  and their goods to confiscation a point of honour more rational perhaps than that which now prompts    us to stab our friend for a gesture or an expression in a word the convenience  of heroism which gave every one the liberty of finishing his part on the stage of the world in what scene he pleased we might add the great facility of putting such a principle in execution the soul all attentive to the action she is preparing to commit to the motives which determine her resolution to the dangers she avoids by it does not properly behold death because passion makes itself felt but always blinds the eyes selflove and a fondness for our preservation changes itself into so many shapes and acts by such contrary principles that it leads us to sacrifice our existence for the very sake of existence and such is the estimate we make of ourselves that we consent to die by a natural and obscure sort of instinct which makes us love ourselves even more than our lives it is certain that we are become less free less courageous and less capable of grand enterprizes than they were formerly by this love of ourselves chap xiii augustus sextus pompeius possessed sicily and sardinia was master at sea and saw himself at the head of a great multitude of fugitives and persons devoted to death by proscriptions whose last hopes depended on their valour octavius contended with him in two very laborious wars and after a variety of ill success vanquished him by the abilities of agrippa most of the conspirators ended their lives in a miserable manner and it was natural that persons who headed a party so frequently harrassed by wars in    which no quarter was afforded should die a violent death that event was however interpreted into a consequence of divine vengeance which punished the murderers of cæsar and in its turn proscribed their cause octavius gained over the soldiers of lepidus to his own interest and divested him of his power in the triumvirate he even envied him the consolation of passing the remainder of his days in obseurity and compelled him to appear as a private man in the assemblies of the people it is impossible for any one to be displeased at the humiliation of this lepidus he was the most depraved citizen in all the republic a constant promoter of disturbances and one who perpetually formed fatal schemes wherein he was obliged to associate with people of more ability than himself a modern author  has thought fit to be large in his commendation and cites antony who in one of his letters represents him as an honest man but he who had that character from antony could not have much title to it from other persons i believe octavius is the only man of all the roman generals who ever gained the affections of the soldiers by giving them perpetual instances of a natural timidity of spirit the soldiers at that time were more affected with the liberality of their commanders than their valour perhaps it was even fortunate for him that he was not master of any qualities which could procure him the empire and that his very incapacity should be the cause of his promotion to it since it made him the less dreaded it is not impossible that the defects which threw the greatest dishonour on his character were the most propitious to his fortune if he had discovered at first any traces of an exalted soul all mankind would have been jealous of his abilities and if he had been spirited by any true bravery    he would not have given antony time to launch into all the extravagances which proved his ruin when antony was preparing to march against octavius he assured his soldiers by a solemn oath that he would restore the republic which makes it evident that even they were jealous of the liberty of their country though they were the perpetual instruments of its destruction for an army is the blindest and most inconsiderate set of people in the world the battle of actium was fought cleopatra fled and drew antony after her it evidently appeared by the circumstances of her future conduct that she afterwards betrayed him   perhaps that incomprehensible spirit of coquetry so predominant in her sex tempted her to practise all her arts to lay a third sovereign of the world at her feet a woman to whom antony had sacrificed the whole world betrayed him many captains and kings whom he had raised or made failed him and as if generosity were connected with servitude a company of gladiators remained heroically faithful to him load a man with benefits the first idea you inspire him with is to find ways to preserve them they are new interests which you give him to defend the most surprising circumstance in those wars is that one battle should generally decide the difference and that one defeat should be irreparable the roman soldiers were not properly under the prevalence of any party spirit they did not fight for any particular acquisition but for some particular person they only knew their commander who engaged their service by prodigious hopes but when he was once defeated and consequently no longer in a condition to accomplish his promises they immediately revolted to the other side the provinces did not embark in the quarrel with any greater sincerity  0 for it was of little consequence to them whether the senate or the people prevailed and therefore when one of the generals lost the day they declared for the other for every city was obliged to justify itself before the conqueror who having engaged himself to the soldiery by immense promises was constrained to sacrifice to their avidity those countries which were most obnoxious we have been afflicted in france with two sorts of civil war one had religion for its pretext and was of long duration because the motive which first inflamed it continued to subsist after victory the other could not properly be said to have any motive but was rather kindled by the caprice or ambition of some great men and was soon extinguished augustus for that was the name offered by flattery to octavius was careful to establish order or rather a durable servitude for when once the sovereignty has been usurped in a free state every transaction on which an unlimited authority can be founded is called a regulation and all instances of disorder commotion and bad government are represented as the only expedients to preserve the just liberty of the subject all the roman citizens who were ever actuated by ambitious views have attempted to introduce a kind of anarchy in the republic and pompey crassus and cesar succeeded to a miracle they authorized an impunity for all public crimes and abolished every institution calculated to prevent the corruption of manners and every regulation accommodated to the best politics and as good legislators endeavour to improve their fellow citizens these on the contrary were indefatigable to lead them into a degeneracy from every virtue with this view they gave a sanction to the pernicious custom of corrupting the people by money and when any persons were accused of undue practices for obtaining place of trust the delinquents corrupted the judges who were to decide the cause they interrupted    the elections by every violent proceeding and even intimidated the tribunal itself the authority of the people was reduced to annihilation witness gabanius   who after he had reinstated ptolemy by force of arms on his throne contrary to the inclinations of the people very boldly demanded a triumph these leading men in the republic endeavoured to make the people disgusted at their own power and to become necessary themselves by rendering the inconveniences of the republican government as disagreeable as possible but when augustus had established himself in the supremacy his politics were employed to restore order that the people might be sensible of the happiness of being ruled by one man when augustus was at the head of an armed power he dreaded the revolt of his soldiers and not the conspiracies of the citizens for which reason he lavished all his caresses on the former and was altogether inhuman to the latter but when his arms had accomplished a peace he was apprehensive of conspiracies and the idea of cæsars untimely death being always present to his remembrance he resolved to vary from his conduct that he might avoid his fate we shall now give the reader a complete key to the whole life of augustus he wore a coat of mail under his robe in the senate house he refused the title of dictator and whereas cæsar insolently affirmed the republic to be nothing and that his words alone were the laws augustus was perpetually expatiating on the dignity of the senate and his veneration for the republic he was solicitous therefore to establish such a form of government as should be most satisfactory without incommoding his particular interest and changing it into an aristocracy with relation to the civil and into a monarchy with respect to the military administration    rendering it by these means an ambiguous system of government which being unsupported by its own power could subsist no longer than the sovereign pleased and consequently was a monarchy in all its circumstances a question has been started whether augustus had a real inclination to divest himself of the empire but is it not apparent that had he been in earnest he might easily have effected his design but his whole proceeding in that affair was a mere artifice because though he expressed a desire every ten years to be eased of the mighty load that encumbered him yet he always thought fit to bear it these were little refinements of low cunning calculated to induce the people to give him what in his opinion he had not sufficiently acquired i form my thoughts in this particular by the whole life of augustus and though mankind are frequently fanciful and inconsistent they are seldom known to renounce in one moment any enjoyment that has engaged the attention of all their life every action of augustus and each of his various regulations visibly tended to the establishment of monarchy sylla resigned the dictatorship but amidst all his violent proceedings a republican spirit is apparent in every part of his conduct all his regulations though executed with a tyrannical air had an aspect to some certain form of a commonwealth sylla who was a man of an impetuous temper precipitated the romans into liberty augustus who was a smooth and subtile tyrant   led them gently into slavery when the republic regained its power under sylla all the people exclaimed against tyranny and whilst this became fortified under augustus liberty was the general boast    the custom of triumphs which had so much contributed to the greatness of rome was abolished by augustus or more properly this honour became the prerogative of sovereignty   the greatest part of those customs which prevailed under the emperors derived their origin from the republic †  and it will be proper to bring them together that the similitude may be more apparent that person alone under whose auspices a war had been conducted was intitled to demand a triumph ‡  now wars were always carried on under the auspices of a generalissimo and consequently of the emperor who was the generalissimo of all the forces as constant war was the reigning principle of the republic the maxim under the emperors was altogether pacific victories were considered as so many opportunities of introducing disorder by armies who might fix too great a valuation on their services those who were advanced to any command were apprehensive of engaging in enterprises of too great importance they found it necessary to aim at glory with moderation and were to engage the emperors notice and not raise his jealousy in a word they were not to appear before him with a lustre which his eyes could not bear augustus was very cautious § of investing any one with the rights of a roman citizen he made laws ∥    to prevent the enfranchisement of too many slaves   and by his will recommended the observation of these two maxims with a dissuasive against extending the empire by new wars these three particulars were very well connected for when all war was discontinued there was no need either of new citizens or enfranchisements when rome was in a constant state of war she was under a perpetual necessity of recruiting her inhabitants at the beginning part of the people were transplanted thither from the conquered cities and in process of time several citizens of the neighbouring towns came to rome to obtain a share in the rights of suffrage and established themselves there in such numbers that upon the complaints of the allies the romans were obliged to remand them back multitudes at last arrived from the provinces the laws favoured marriages and even rendered them necessary rome in all her wars gained a prodigious number of slaves and when the riches of the citizens became immense they bought these unhappy people from all parts and from a principle of generosity avarice or ambition enfranchised them without number †  some intended by this proceeding to reward the fidelity of their slaves others had a view by it to receive in their name the corn which the republic distributed among the poor citizens in a word others desired to have their funeral solemnity graced with a long train of attendance crowned with flowers the people were generally composed of persons ‡ who had received their freedom so that the lords of the universe not only in their original but through the greatest part of succeeding times were of servile extraction the number of the populace being chiefly collected out of slaves who had been enfranchised or the    sons of such became very incommodious and were therefore transplanted into colonies by which means the state effectually secured the obedience of the provinces there was a general circulation of mankind through the world rome received them in the state of slaves and sent them away romans augustus under the pretence of some tumults in the elections placed a garrison and a governor in the city made the legions perpetual stationed them upon the frontiers and established particular funds for their pay to which we may add that he gave orders for veterans to receive their donations in money   and not in lands many unhappy consequences resulted from the distribution of land after the time of sylla the citizens property in their estates grew precarious and if all the soldiers of one cohort were not settled in the same place they became dissatisfied with their allotments neglected the cultivation of their lands and degenerated into dangerous citizens †  but if they were distributed in entire legions the ambitious could raise armies against the republic in a moment augustus likewise established fixed provisions for the naval power which was never done before his time for as the romans were masters of the mediterranean and as all navigation was then confined to that sea they had not any enemy to fear dion observes very judiciously that after the emperors had assumed the sovereign power it became very difficult to write the history of those times all transactions were industriously concealed the dispatches from the provinces were transmitted to the cabinets of the emperors and we know little more than what    either the folly or rashness of tyrants divulged or such events as fall within the conjectures of historians chap xiv tiberius as a river sometimes with a slow and silent progress undermines the banks that have been thrown up to restrain its current and at last overwhelms them in a moment and sheds an inundation over the fields they formerly preserved in the same manner the supreme authority which gained an insensible growth under augustus bore down all before it in the succeeding reign of tiberius a law at that time subsisted which made it treason to form any injurious attempt against the majesty of the people tiberius assumed to himself the interpretation and enforcement of this law and extended it not only to the cases for which it was originally calculated but to every conjuncture that could possibly be favourable to his hatred or suspicions and now not only actions but words and signs and even thoughts were adjudged by this standard for those expressions which drop from the overflowing of the heart in the conversation of intimate friends are always supposed to be their real sentiments all freedom was therefore banished from their feasts diffidence reigned among relations there was no fidelity among the slaves the gloomy disposition and insincerity of the prince were diffused through all ranks of men friendship had the disrepute of a dangerous quicksand a fine genius passed for a shining indiscretion and virtue itself was only considered as an affectation which officiously reminded the people of their lost happiness no tyranny can have a severer effect than that which is exercised under the appearance of laws and    with the plausible colours of justice when the executors of cruel power would if we may use the expression drown the unhappy wretches on the very plank that before saved them amidst the troubled waves as a tyrant is never destitute of instruments to accomplish his designs so tiberius always found the senate tractable enough to condemn  as many persons as he could possibly suspect and this venerable body sunk at last into a degeneracy too low to be described the senators even courted servitude to gain the favour of sejanus and the most illustrious among them abandoned themselves to the dishonourable profession of informers it seems easy to discover several causes of that flavish disposition which then prevailed in the senate when cæsar had entirely crushed the party who declared for the republic all the friends as well as enemies he then had in the senate concurred with equal unanimity to remove the bounds with which the laws had limited his power and at the same time they agreed to render him unparalleled honours some came into these compliances with a view to please him others intended by such means to make him odious dion informs us that some even proposed that he might have the liberty to enjoy as many women as he should desire this obsequious conduct freed him from all suspicions of the senate and consequently was the cause of his assassination but then it prevented in the succeeding reigns all flattery from rising to such wild and unexampled heights as might have created disaffection in the minds of the people before rome submitted to the dominion of one man the riches of the nobility in what manner soever acquired were certainly immense but those grandees were divested of the greatest part of their treasures by    the emperors   the senators were no longer resorted to by those great and wealthy clients who were the sources of their patrons affluence the provinces produced nothing considerable except for cæsar and especially when they were under the government of his præfects whose office had some resemblance to that of the intendants in france however though the fountain from whence all this opulence flowed was at last exhausted the expences were continued in their former profusion and the track being once marked out the men of rank could only pursue it now by the emperors favour augustus had deprived the people of their legislative capacity and abolished all their jurisdiction with respect to public offences but he still left them the power of electing magistrates tiberius who dreaded the assemblies of a people so numerous divested them even of this privilege and transferred it to the senate †  or rather to himself now it is impossible to conceive the abject lowness to which the declension of the peoples power sunk the spirits of the grandees when dignities were in the disposal of the populace the magistrates who solicited their interest practised a number of mean condescensions but these were intermixed with a certain magnificence that in some measure concealed them for instance they exhibited pompous games and recreations they distributed sums of money and quantities of corn among the people and sometimes regaled them with splendid feasts but though the motive was low the manner seemed august because it always comports with a great man to obtain the favour of the people by liberality but when that people had nothing to bestow and the prince in the name of the senate disposed of all employments they    were desired as well as obtained in a dishonourable manner and could only be compassed by adulation infamy and a hateful train of crimes that were made necessary arts by the iniquity of the age it does not indeed appear that tiberius had any intention to make the senate contemptible and he complained of nothing so much as the propensity of that body to slavery his life was filled with dissatisfactions on that account but he resembled the generality of mankind and was fond of contradictory enjoyments his general politics were inconsistent with his particular passions he would willingly have seen a free senate who by their conduct might have created a veneration for his government but then he was also desirous of a senate that would every moment be tractable to his fears his jealousies and his aversions in a word the politician was perpetually subordinate to the man we have already intimated that the people had formerly obtained from the patricians the privilege of electing from their own body a set of magistrates who were to protect them from the insults and injustice that might be intended against them and in order to capacitate those magistrates for the exercise of such a power their persons were declared sacred and inviolable and whoever should presume to treat a tribune injuriously either by actions or language was condemned by the law to suffer death on the spot now when the emperors were invested with the tribunitial power they obtained the same prerogatives and it was upon this principle that such a number of people were deprived of their lives from this source flowed the impunity with which informers flourished in their profession   and hence it was that the accusation of treason that crime says pliny which was charged on  00 those to whom no real offence could be imputed was at last extended to any one to whom the wantonness of tyranny pointed out i am inclinable however to believe that some of those titles of accusation were not so ridiculous as they appear at present and can never be persuaded that tiberius would have caused a man to be accused for selling to one who bought his house a statue of the emperor that domitian should condemn a woman to die for undressing herself before his image or that he should proceed with the same severity against a citizen of rome for causing a description of all the earth to be delineated on the walls of his apartment if such actions as these had not called up an idea in the minds of the romans very different from that they now excite in us for my part i am of opinion that as rome had changed the form of its government those actions which now appear inconsiderable to us might when they were committed have a very different aspect and i judge in this manner from my reflection on what is now customary in a nation which cannot with any justice be suspected of tyranny and yet it is a capital crime there to drink to the health of a certain person i cannot omit any circumstance which tends to give a clear representation of the roman genius that people were so habituated to obedience and so constantly placed their happiness in homaging their masters that after the death of germanicus they were affected with such inconsolable sorrow and despair as never appears in our contemporaries the descriptions given by historians  of a desolation so public so universal and immoderate deserve a readers curiosity and it is certain that this scene of grief was not affected since a whole people are never known to practise so much flattery and dissimulation  0  the romans who had now no longer any share in the government and were chiefly composed of persons who had received their freedom or such indolent and unindustrious people who lived at the expence of the public treasure were now sensible of nothing but their imbecility and afflicted themselves like children or women who from a principle of weakness abandon themselves to sorrow these people were politically indisposed they placed all their fears and hopes in the person of germanicus and when he was snatched from them by an untimely death they sunk into despair no people are so apprehensive of calamity as those whom the misery of their condition should rather discharge from all fear and who ought to say with andromache would to heaven i had any enjoyment i could dread to lose there are at this day in naples fifty thousand men who have no food but herbs and whose whole cloathing consists of a few miserable rags and yet these people who are the most wretched creatures upon earth discover a dreadful consternation at the least irruption of vesuvius and are so infatuated as to fear they shall be miserable chap xv remarks on the emperors from caius calicula to antoninus calicula succeeded tiberius and it was said of him that there never was a better slave nor a worse master and indeed these two circumstances are very consistent for the same turn of mind which inclines a person to be strongly affected at unlimited power in his sovereign makes him to be no less in love with it when he rises to empire himself  0  caligula restored the assemblies of the people which tiberius had prohibited and abolished the arbitrary law and constructions of treason established by that emperor from which proceeding we may observe that the beginnings of a bad reign sometimes resemble the conclusion of a good one for a wicked prince may from a principle of contradiction to the motives of his predecessors conduct be spirited to actions which the other performed from a virtuous inducement and we owe to this very principle a number of good as well as bad regulations but what did the romans gain by these plausible beginnings caligula annulled the law which constituted the circumstantials of treason but then he destroyed those who displeased him by a military severity and his vengeance instead of pointing at some particular senators hung over all their heads like a sword that threatened them with extermination at one blow this formidable tyranny of the emperors arose from the disposition of the romans in general who as they were suddenly enslaved to an arbitrary government and were hardly sensible of any interval between dominion and subjection were not prepared for such a transition by any gentle softenings the fierce and untractable disposition still remained and the citizens were used in the same manner as they themselves had treated their conquered enemies and were governed altogether upon the same plan when sylla made his public entrance into rome he was still the sylla who had done the same in athens and he governed with an uniform imperiousness as to us who are natives of france and have sunk into subjection by insensible degrees if we are destitute of laws we are at least governed by engaging manners the constant view of the combatants of gladiators inspired the romans with extraordinary fierceness and it was observable that claudius became more disposed  0  to shed blood by being habituated to those spectacles the example of this emperor who was naturally of a gentle disposition and yet degenerated into so much cruelty at last makes it evident that the education in those times was very different from our own the romans being accustomed to tyrannize over human nature  in the persons of their children and slaves had a very imperfect idea of that virtue we distinguish by the name of humanity whence proceeds the savage cast of mind so remarkable in the inhabitants of our colonies but from their constant severity to an unfortunate class of mankind when barbarity prevails in civil government what natural justice or harmony of manners can be expected from the individuals we are fatigued and satiated with seeing in the history of the emperors such an infinite number of people whom they destroyed for no other end than to confiscate their goods our modern accounts furnish us with no such instances of inhumanity this difference as we have already intimated is to be ascribed to the milder cast of our manners and the civilizing restraints of a more amiable religion we may likewise add that we have no opportunity of pillaging the families of senators who have ravaged the world and we derive this advantage from the mediocrity of our fortunes which are consequently in a safer situation in a word we are not considerable enough to be plundered †  that class of the roman people who were called plebeians had no aversion to the worst of their emperors for since they had no longer any share of empire themselves nor were any more employed in wars they became the most contemptible and degenerate people in the world they looked upon commerce and the sciences  0  as only proper for slaves and the distributions of corn which they received made them neglect the cultivation of their lands they had been familiarized to public games and splendid spectacles and since they had no longer any tribunes to obey or magistrates to elect those gratifications which they were only permitted to enjoy became necessary to them and their indolence and inactivity stimulated their relish of those indulgences caligula nero commodus carcalla were lamented by the people for their folly for whatever these loved the others were as madly fond of in their turn and not only contributed their whole power but even devoted their own persons to those pseasures they lavished all the riches of the empire with the greatest prodigality and when these were exhausted the people without the least emotion beheld all the great families pillaged they enjoyed the fruits of tyranny without the least intermixture of uneasiness because their low obscurity was their protection such princes have a natural antipathy to people of merit and virtue because they are sensible their actions are disapproved by such persons the contradiction  and even the silence of an austere citizen were insupportable to them and as they grew intoxicated with popular applause they at last imagined their government constituted the public felicity and consequently that it could be censured by none but disaffected and illdisposed persons caligula was a true sophist in cruelty for as he equally descended from antony and augustus he declared  0  he would punish the consuls if they celebrated the day appointed to commemorate the victory at actium and that they should likewise feel his severity if they neglected to honour that event and drusilla to whom he accorded divine honours being dead it was a crime to bewail her because she was a goddess and as great an offence to forbear that sorrow because she was a sister we have now ascended an eminence from whence we may take a view of human affairs when we trace in the roman history such a variety of wars and their prodigal effusion of human blood when we view so many once flourishing nations depopulated and see such a diversity of shining actions and triumphant processions when we trace the masterly strokes of politics sagacity and fortitude so conspicuous in that people and reflect on their advances to universal monarchy by schemes so judiciously concerted so successfully supported and so happily accomplished to what view are all these mighty preparations directed why truly to satiate the ambition of five or six monsters is it possible then that the senate could divest so many kings of their power only to plunge themselves into the most abject slavery to one of their unworthy citizens and to exterminate itself by its own edicts did it rise to such a height of grandeur to drop more splendidly into ruin and do the sons of men only labour to augment their power that they may sall by their own combinations into better hands when caligula was assassinated the senate assembled to form a new model of government and whilst they were engaged in such deliberations a party of soldiers rushed in to plunder the palace and found in some obscure place a man trembling with fear this man was claudius and they immediately saluted him emperor claudius completed the subversion of the ancient form of government by intrusting the dispensation of  0  justice to his officers the principal motive to the wars of marius and sylla was to determine the competition of the senators and the equestrian  order for this prerogative and it was now wrested from both parties by the arbitrary fancy of a weak man surprizing event indeed of a dispute which had set the world in flames when the reign of a prince succeeds the dissolution of a republic no authority can be more absolute than his own for he then possesses all that power which before was distributed among the people who exercised it without any limitations and for this reason the kings of denmark are the most despotic sovereigns in europe the people were altogether as abject and unmanly as the senate though they once were animated with such a martial spirit that when armies were levied in the city before the time of the emperors they gained the military discipline upon the spot and immediately marched to the enemy in the civil wars of vitellius and vespasian rome became a prey to the ambitious and was full of timorous citizens who were struck with consternation by any party of soldiers who could first approach them the emperors themselves were in no better a situation for as the right of electing a sovereign was not appropriated to any single army it generally happened that when an emperor was chosen by one body of soldiers that circumstance alone was sufficient to discredit him with the others who immediately set up a competitor to oppose him as the grandeur therefore of the republic proved fatal to that form of government so the mighty extent of the empire was altogether as pernicious to the monarchs if the territories they were to defend had been confined to moderate limits those sovereigns might have been effectually served by one principal army  0  and the soldiers when they had once elected their emperor would have been dutiful enough to acquiesce in their choice the soldiers were attached to the family of cæsar under which they enjoyed every advantage that a revolution would have procured them the time came that the great families of rome were all exterminated but that of cæsar which itself became extinct in the person of nero the civil power which had been continually depressed was unable to balance the military each army wanted to make an emperor let us here compare the times when tiberius began his reign wherein did he not employ the senate   he was informed that the armies of illyrium and germany had mutinied he granted some of their demands and maintained that it belonged to the † senate to judge of the rest he sent them deputies of that body those who have ceased to fear the power may still respect the authority when it had been represented to the soldiers that in a roman army the children of the emperors and the deputies of the senate ran the risk of ‡ their lives they might relent and even proceed so far as to punish ∥ themselves but when the senate was entirely depressed its example moved no one in vain did § otho harangue his soldiers to talk to them of the dignity of the senate in vain did  vitellius send the principal senators to make his peace with vespasian they did not for one moment pay to the orders of the state that respect which they had so long lost the armies looked on these deputies as the most abject slaves of a master whom they had already rejected  0  it was an ancient custom at rome for those who obtained a triumph to distribute some money to each soldier it was not much   in the time of the civil wars these gratuities were augmented †  formerly they were made with the money taken from the enemy in these unhappy times they gave that of the citizens and the soldiers would have a share where there was no booty these distributions had taken place only after a war nero made them in a time of peace the soldiers were used to them and they raged against galba who boldly told them that he knew to choose but not to buy them galba otho and vitellius ‡ made a very transient appearance in the imperial scene vespasian who like them was elected by the army devoted all his reign to the reestablishment of the empire which had been successively possessed by six tyrants all equally cruel and most of them exceedingly furious and untractable generally very weak and to complete the public calamity profuse even to infatuation titus who succeeded his father was the darling of the people but domitian presented to their view an uncommon monster more inhuman in his disposition or at least more implacable than any of his predecessors because he was more timorous his favourite freemen and according to some historians the empress herself finding his friendship as dangerous as his aversion and that he allowed no bounds to his suspicions and accusations turned their thoughts to a successor and chose the venerable nerva  0  nerva adopted trajan who proved the most accomplished prince in all history it was a happiness to be born under his reign which blessed the empire with more prosperity and true glory than it had ever enjoyed before he was an admirable statesman and a most accomplished general the native sweetness of his disposition inclined him to universal humanity and his unclouded penetration guided him through the best and purest tracts of government he was actuated by a noble soul to whose embellishment every virtue had contributed his conduct was free from all extremes and his amiable qualities were tempered with such exact proportion that the brightness of one was never lost in the lustre of another to sum up all he was the best qualified of mankind to do honour to human nature and to represent the divinity on earth he accomplished cæsars project of invading the parthians and was very successful in his wars with that mighty people any monarch but himself would have sunk under the weight of such an enterprize where danger was always present and from whence the source of his necessary supplies was at a vast distance in a word where he could not be sure of victory itself would save him from destruction the difficulty consisted in the situation of the two empires and the military discipline of both nations if he directed his march through armenia towards the sources of tygris and euphrates he was sure to be incommoded with a mountainous and impracticable country through which no convoy of provision could pass so that the army would be half destroyed before they could penetrate into media   on the other hand if he should strike out a lower tract towards the south through nisibis he would find himself bewildered in a ghastly desart that separated the two empires and if he intended to proceed still lower and march through   0 mesopotamia he was then to cross a large country that was either uncultivated or laid under water and as the tygris and euphrates flowed from north to south he could not gain a passage into the country without quitting those rivers which if he did he must inevitably perish as to the manner practised by the two nations in making war the strength of the romans consisted in their infantry which was the most firm and best disciplined body of soldiers in the world the parthians on the contrary had no infantry but then their horse were admirable and always combated at such a distance as placed them out of the reach of the roman army and the javelin was seldom launched far enough to wound them their own weapons consisted of a bow and many formidable shafts and they rather besieged an army than gave it battle they were pursued to no purpose in their flight for that was the same with them as an engagement they carried off all the inhabitants of the country and only left garrisons in their fortified places and when these were taken the conquerors were obliged to destroy them the parthians likewise set fire to all the country that lay round the roman army and did not leave them the least blade of herbage in a word they managed their wars in manner very much like that which is now practised on the same frontiers we may add to these disadvantages that the illyrian and german legions which were drawn out for this war were no way capable to sustain it  because the soldiers who were accustomed to plentiful food in their own country perished in these regions for want of many necessaries the parthians by these means had accomplished that for the preservation of their liberty which had hitherto been impracticable to all other nations against     the victorious power of the romans but they owed this advantage not to any resistless valour but to their inaccessible situation adrian gave up the conquest of trajan and made euphrates the boundary of his empire and indeed it was surprizing that the romans after such a series of war should lose nothing but what they were desirous to quit and thus they resembled the ocean whose expansion is never lessened but when it retires of itself this conduct of adrian occasioned great dissatisfactions among the people it was recorded in the sacred book of that nation  that when tarquin intended to build the capitol he found the place most commodious for his purpose filled with the statues of other deities upon which he employed his skill in augury to discover if they were inclinable to resign their places to jupiter and they all consented except mars hebe and terminus this proceeding gave birth to three religious opinions namely that mars would never resign his place to any other being that the roman youth would be always invincible and that their god terminus would never recede from his station the contrary of which was however verified in the reign of adrian chap xvi considerations on the state of the empire from antoninus to probus in this period the stoics propagated their doctrines in the empire with great popularity and it seems as if nature herself had been industrious to produce this admirable sect which resembled those plants the earth causes to spring up in places never visited by the sunbeams     this sect furnished the romans with their best emperors none but marcus aurelius could extinguish the remembrance of the first antonine who adopted him and we find ourselves affected with a secret pleasure when we speak of this emperor we cannot read his life without some impressions of tenderness and grow inclinable to think better of ourselves because the history of that prince makes us entertain a more favourable opinion of mankind the wisdom of nerva the glory of trajan the valour of adrian and the virtue of the two antonines gained them the veneration of the soldiers but when a set of new monsters became their successors the abuse of military government appeared in its full enormity and the soldiers who had exposed the empire to sale assassinated the emperors for the sake of new gratuities it has been a conceived opinion that there is a certain prince in the world who for the space of fifteen years has been endeavouring to abolish the civil government in his dominions and to substitute the military in its room i have no intention to make odious reflections on such a design and shall only observe that from the nature of things in general two hundred guards may be a better security to a prince than four thousand and besides an armed people are of all others the most dangerous to be opposed commodus succeeded his father marcus aurelius and was a monster who gave a loose to all his own passions and those of his courtiers the persons who delivered the world from such a barbarian transferred the imperial dignity to the venerable pertinax who was soon assassinated by the prætorian bands the empire was then exposed to auction and didius julian carried it by a number of magnificent promises this proceeding exasperated the whole body of the people for though the empire had been frequently bought it had never been sold upon credit before pescennius niger severus and albinus were saluted     emperors and julian not being in a condition to pay the immense sums he had promised was abandoned by the soldiers severus defeated niger and albinus he was master of extraordinary qualities but wanted that sweetness of disposition which in princes is the most amiable quality they can possess the power of the emperors might easily appear more tyrannical than that of modern princes for as their dignity was a conjunction of the various authorities in the roman magistracy such as dictators for instance tribunes of the people proconsuls censors supreme pontiffs and sometimes consuls they frequently assumed the dispensation of distributive justice and it was easy for them to create suspicions that they had oppressed those whom they condemned for the people usually judge of the abuse of power by the greatness of its extent whereas the kings of europe being legislators and not executors of the law sovereign princes but not judges are consequently discharged from the exercise of an authority that might prove odious and have consigned the infliction of punishments to magistrates whilst they reserved to themselves the distribution of pardons and other popular acts of mercy few emperors have ever been more jealous of their authority than tiberius and severus and yet they suffered themselves to be governed in a most dishonourable manner the one by sejanus and the other by plautian the unhappy custom of proscribing introduced by sylla was still practised under the emperors and the prince must have been distinguished by some virtue if he discountenanced that severe proceeding for as the ministers and favourites turned their thoughts to confiscations at the beginning of a reign they were always representing to their sovereign the necessity of punishments and the dangerous effects of clemency     when severus gave full play to his proscriptions a great body of nigers  army retired for safety to the parthians † and perfected them in every part of military discipline wherein they were any way defective they habituated them to the roman weapons and even taught their workmen how to make their martial equipage in consequence of which that people who till then had usually limited their exploits to defensive wars ‡  were generally aggressors for the future it is very remarkable that in the long series of those civil wars that were continually raging the chiefs who were supported by the legions of europe generally defeated the leaders of the asiatic legions ∥  and we read in the history of severus that he could not take the city of atra in arabia because the european legions having mutinied he was obliged to employ those of syria this difference became evident when the levies were first made § in the provinces and it appeared as considerable in the legions as it did in the nations out of which they were raised and who by nature or education were more or less formed for war another unhappy consequence likewise ensued from these provincial levies for the emperors who were generally elected out of the soldiery were for the most part strangers and sometimes the worst of barbarians     rome was now no longer mistress of the world but received laws from the whole universe each emperor brought with him some peculiarity from his own country relating to fashions manners politics or religion and heliogabalus had even formed a resolution to destroy every object of religious veneration in rome and to banish all the gods from their temples that he might place his own in their room this circumstance even considered as independent on the secret operations of the deity which are obvious to his omniscience alone greatly contributed to the establishment of christianity for nothing was now strange in the empire and the people were prepared to relish every new custom which the emperors were inclinable to introduce it is well known that the romans received the gods of other nations into their city but then they received them with the art of conquerors and carried them in their triumphal processions but when strangers attempted to establish them by their own authority they were immediately rejected it is likewise notorious that the romans gave foreign deities the names of such of their own gods as were most conformable to the others in their attributes but when the priests of other countries would introduce the adoration of their divinities under the proper names among the romans they were not permitted to accomplish that design and this was the greatest obstacle to the progress of christianity caracalla who succeeded severus may be called not only a tyrant but the destroyer of mankind caligula nero and domitian limited their barbarities to rome but this monster endeavoured to extend his fury through the world like a pestilence severus amassed prodigious treasures by the exactions of a long reign and his proscriptions of those who declared for his competitors in the empire     caracalla having commenced his reign with murdering his brother geta with his own hands purchased with those riches a connivance at his crime from the soldiers who had an extraordinary regard for geta but the liberalities of caracalla had such an effect upon them that they declared they had taken oaths to both the children of severus and not to one alone the immoderate treasures which have been gathered by princes have commonly produced fatal effects they generally corrupt the successor who grows dazzled with the lustre they diffuse and if they happen not to prevent his heart they misguide his mind and cause him to form plans of mighty enterprizes by the ministration of a power that is only accidental always transitory and unnatural and an empty inflation instead of a real grandeur caracalla augmented the soldiers pay macrinus wrote to the senate that this augmentation amounted to  seventy millions of drachms †  this prince seems to have magnified things and if we compare our soldiers pay nowadays with the rest of our public expences and suppose that we kept the same proportion among the romans we shall see that this sum was excessive here we should enquire what was a roman soldiers pay we learn from orosius that domitian raised ‡ it a fourth from what it was before and it appears from a soldiers speech in tacitus that ∥ at the death of augustus it was ten ounces of brass per day we find in suetonius §  that julius cæsar doubled the pay of his time in pliny   at the second punic war it     was diminished one fifth it was then in the punic war  about six ounces of copper in the second †  about five ounces at ten under julius cæsar and thirteen and a third under domitian ‡  i shall make here some reflections the pay which the republic might easily advance when it was only a small state when it engaged in a new war every year and received the spoils of it as often it was not able to raise without running in debt under the first punic war when it carried its arms beyond italy when it maintained a long war and supported great armies in the second punic war the pay was reduced to five ounces of brass and this diminution might be made without danger at a time when the most of the citizens were ashamed to receive pay and were willing to serve at their own charge the treasures of persia ∥  and of so many other kings which flowed into rome put an end to taxes there in such public and private opulence they had the prudence not to enlarge the former payment of five ounces of brass though even from this pay they made a deduction for corn cloaths and arms still it was sufficient because they enrolled only those citizens who had patrimonies of their own marius having enrolled people of no substance and his example being afterwards followed julius cæsar was obliged to augment the pay     this augmentation having been continued after the death of cæsar they were obliged under the consulship of hirtius and pansa to reestablish taxes the weakness of domitian in adding one fourth to this pay was a great blow to the state the unhappiness of which was not that it brought in luxury in general but infused it among people of that condition who ought to be supplied with no more than the bare necessities which nature requires lastly by caracallas final augmentation the empire was thrown into such a condition that not being able to subsist without soldiers it could not subsist with them caracalla to soften the horror of his fratricide instituted divine honours to his brother geta and what was very peculiar he himself received the same deification of macrinus who after he had caused him to be stabbed and was desirous of appeasing the prætorian bands who regretted the death of a prince whose liberalities they had so often enjoyed erected a temple and established a priesthood of flamens in his honour this preserved his memory from all degrading imputations  and the senate not knowing to censure him he was not ranked among the tyrants like commodus who had not done more to deserve that title than himself as to the two great emperors adrian and severus †  one established and the other relaxed the military discipline and the events exactly corresponded with their causes the reigns which succeeded that of adrian were a series of happiness and tranquility but after the death of severus nothing was seen but a succession of calamities and horror caracalla had confined himself to no limitations in his prodigality to the soldiers and in that particular he acted conformably to the sentiments of his father     who on his deathbed advised him to enrich the army and disregard all the rest of mankind but these politics could be only accommodated to one reign for the successor being no longer able to continue those expences was soon assassinated by the army so that the emperors who were eminent for wisdom were always murdered by the soldiers and those whose lives were infamous were destroyed either by the conspiracies or edicts of the senate when a tyrant suffered himself to be entirely influenced by the war and left the citizens exposed to their licentious depredations such injurious proceedings could not be extended beyond the period of one reign because the soldiers in consequence of their devastations impoverished the people and defeated themselves of their pay by that event it therefore became necessary to reform the military discipline which was a project always fatal to the persons who presumed to attempt it when caracalla lost his life by the treachery of macrinus the soldiers in despair at the death of a prince whose liberality had been dispensed to them with an unlimited flow elected heliogabalus   and when he by his prostitution to infamous pleasures and the lawless extravagancies he suffered the army to commit grew contemptible even in their eyes they dispatched him by an assassination the same sate attended alexander who was preparing to restore the true military discipline and threatened to punish the soldiers for their misconduct †  in this manner a tyrant who instead of being solicitous for his safety affected an ability to be criminal perished with the fatal advantage of being murdered a few days before another who would willingly have been a better man   0 after the death of alexander the imperial dignity was transferred to maximin who was the first emperor of barbarian extraction and had been distinguished by his strength and gigantic stature this prince and his son were likewise slain by the soldiers the two first gordians perished in africa maximus balbinus and the third gordian were massacred philip who had caused the young gordian to be destroyed was himself slain with his son and decius who was chosen to succeed him was murdered in his turn by the treason of gallus   the roman empire was improperly so denominated at that time and might rather be called an irregular commonwealth nearly resembling the aristocracy of algiers where the militia who are invested with the sovereign power elect and depose the magistrate they called the dey and it may perhaps be taken for a general rule that a military government is in some respects a republic rather than a monarchy but lest any one should imagine the soldiers had no other share in the government than what they extorted by their disobedience and insurrections let it be asked whether the orations in which the emperors addressed themselves to the army were not at last very correspondent to those which the consuls and tribunes formerly made to the people and though the soldiers had no particular place to assemble in nor were under the regulation of any certain forms though the temper of their minds was not usually serene their proceedings consisting of action rather than deliberation did they not however dispose of the public fortune     with a sovereign authority what was an emperor but the minister of a violent and tumultuous government and did not the soldiers elect him for their own particular convenience when the army associated into the empire   philip the prætorian prefect of the third gordian claimed the exercise of an undivided command but did not succeed in his pretensions he then requested the army to divide the power equally between them but to as little effect he next intreated them to leave him the title of cæsar and was still refused he afterwards solicited them to create him prefect of the prætorian bands and met with the usual repulse till at last he was reduced to plead for his life the army in the instance before us exercised the supreme magistracy in their several decisions the barbarians were at first unknown to the romans and for some time afterwards only incommodious but at last they became formidable to them by an event altogether unparalleled at that time and which perhaps may never be equalled hereafter rome had so effectually extinguished all nations that when she at last was vanquished in her turn the earth seemed to produce a new race of mankind to accomplish her destruction those princes who have large dominions seldom find them bordered by any territories considerable enough to be the objects of their ambition and should there be any such they would naturally be swallowed up in a series of conquest we will say they are bounded then by seas and mountains and vast deserts whose sterility rendered them contemptible the romans for this reason suffered the germans to range in their forest and gloomy wilds and let the northern nations shiver amidst the polar snow and yet those inhospitable regions produced a people who at last enslaved the conquerors of the world     in the reign of gallus a mighty collection of nations who afterwards became more celebrated spread their ravages through all europe and the persians having invaded syria abandoned their conquests only to preserve their booty we no longer see any of those swarms of barbarians which the north formerly sent out the violences of the romans had made the people of the south retire into the north while the force which confined them subsisted they remained there when it was weakened they dispersed themselves into all parts   the same thing happened some ages after the conquest and tyrannies of charlemagne had again forced the nations of the south into the north as soon as this empire was weakened they poured a second time from the north into the south and if at present a prince made the same ravages in europe the nations driven into the north with their backs to the limits of the universe would maintain their ground till the moment they should overrun and conquer europe a third time the miserable disorders which had so long been springing up in the several successions of the emperors were now come to their fatal maturity and that period which was concurrent with the close of valerians reign and the duration of that of his son gallienus produced thirty pretenders to the empire the greatest part of whom being swept away by their mutual contentions their devastations were limited to a short reign and they gained nothing durable but the appellation of the thirty tyrants valerian having been taken prisoner by the persians and his son gallienus neglecting the public affairs the barbarians penetrated into all parts and the empire was now in the same condition it was afterwards     reduced to in the west   at the close of another century and it would then have felt its last convulsions had not a happy conjunction of events interposed for its preservation the terrible confusion in succeeding to the empire being come to its height we find at the end of the reign of valerian and during that of gallienus his son no less that thirty pretencers to the throne most of whom having got possession of it and reigned for a very short time were called the tyrants odenatus prince of palmyra and one of the roman allies dislodged the pe sians who had invaded the greatest part of asia rome furnished an army of its own citizens and they effectually delivered it from the barbarians who came to pillage their city an innumerable army of scythians who put to sea in a fleet of five thousand ships entirely perished by storms fatigue and famine and even by their formidable grandeur and gallienus being at last slain claudius aurelian tacitus and probus who happily succeeded him and were four extraordinary princes snatched the empire from the verge of ruin chap xvii changes in the state the emperors to prevent the continual treasons of the army associated into the government proper persons in whom they might confide and dioclesian under pretext of the weight and multiplicity of the public affairs established a law that there should always be two emperors and as many cæsars he judged that by this proceeding the four principal armies being possessed by the partners in the empire would naturally intimidate one another and that the inferior armies being too weak to have any thoughts of raising     their chiefs to the imperial dignity their custom of election would be gradually discontinued and entirely abolished at last besides the dignity of the cæsars being always subordinate that power which for the security of the government was in the participation of four would be exercised in its full extent by no more than two the soldiers were likewise restrained from their exorbitances by considering that as the riches of particular persons as well as the public treasure were considerably diminished the emperors were in no condition to offer them such large donations as formerly and consequently the gratuities would be no longer proportionable to the danger of a new election we may add to this that the prefects of the prætorian bands whose power and employments rendered them the grand visirs of those times and frequently tempted them to murder their emperors in order to raise themselves to the throne were greatly reduced by constantine who divested them of all but their civil functions and augmented their number to four instead of two the lives of the emperors began now to be in greater security and they might reasonably expect to die peaceably in their beds this circumstance seems in some measure to have softened their dispositions and they no longer shed human blood with the barbarous prodigality of their predecessors but as the immense power they still possessed must needs have some particular tendency it began to manifest itself in a species of tyranny less glaring than the former the subjects were no longer affrighted with inhuman massacres but then they were harassed by unjust sentences and forms of judicature which seemed to defer death only to render life itself uncomfortable the court governed and was likewise swayed in its turn by a greater variety of artifices and a more exquisite train of political resinements which were conducted with greater silence than     usual in a word instead of an unterrisied disposition to form a bad action and a cruel precipitation to commit it those gigantic iniquities shrunk into the vices of weak minds and could only be called languid crimes a new train of corruption was now introduced the first emperors pursued pleasures but these sunk into softness they shewed themselves with less frequency to the soldiers were more indolent and fonder of their domestics more devoted to the palace and more abstracted from the empire the poison of the court grew more malignant in proportion to the disguise it assumed all direct terms were disused in discourse and distant insinuations became the dialect of the palace every shining reputation was sullied and the ministers as well as the officers of the army were perpetually left to the discretion of that sort of people who as they cannot be useful to the state themselves suffer none to serve it with reputation and glory in a word that affability of the first emporors which alone qualified them for an insight into their affairs was now entirely discarded the prince had no informations but what were conveyed to him by the canal of a few favourites who acted always in concert together and even when they seemed to disagree in their opinions were only in the province of a single person to their sovereign the residence of several emperors in asia and their perpetual competition with the kings of persia made them form a resolution to be adorned like those monarchs and dioclesian though others say gallerius published an edict to that effect this pompous imitation of the asiatic pride being once established the people were soon habituated to such a spectacle and when julian would have regulated his conduct by a modest simplicity of manners that proceeding which was no more than a renovation     of the ancient behaviour was imputed to him as a reproachful inattention to his dignity though several emperors had reigned after marcus aurelius yet the empire was undivided and as the authority of those princes was acknowledged in all the provinces it was but one power though exercised by many persons but galerius  and constantius chlorus being at variance with each other divided the empire in reality and this example which was afterwards followed by constantine who pursuing the plan of galerius and not that of dioclesian introduced a custom which might be called a revolution rather than a change we may likewise add that the strong desire of constantine to be the founder of a new city and an impulse of vanity to distinguish it by his own name determined him to transfer the seat of empire to the east though rome was far from being so spacious within the walls as it is at present yet the suburbs were prodigiously extensive †  italy was filled with seats of pleasure and might properly be called the garden of rome the husbandmen were in cicily africa and egypt ‡  but the gardeners lived altogether in italy the lands were generally cultivated by the slaves of the roman citizens but when the seat of empire was established in the east all rome was in a manner transplanted to that situation thither did the grandees send their slaves or in other words the greatest part of the people and italy was almost exhausted of its inhabitants it was constantines intention that the new city should not be inferior in any particular to the old one and therefore he took care to have it sufficiently supplied with corn commanding all the harvest of egypt     to be sent to constantinople and consigning that of africa to rome which does not seem to have been a very judicious proceeding whilst the republic subsisted the people of rome who were then the sovereigns of all other nations became naturally entitled to a proportion of the tribute this circumstance induced the senate to sell them corn at first for a low price and afterwards to make a gratuitous distribution of it among them and when monarchy itself was introduced this latter custom was still continued though entirely opposite to the principles of that form of government it is true the abuse remained unrectified through an apprehension of the inconveniences that would have risen from its discontinuance but when constantine founded a new city he established the same custom without the least appearance of reason when augustus had conquered egypt he conveyed the treasure of the ptolomies to rome and this proceeding occasioned much the same revolution which the discovery of the indies afterwards effected in europe and which some ridiculous schemes have since accomplished in our time the revenue was doubled at rome   and as that city continued to absorb all the riches of alexandria which was itself the repository of the treasures of africa and the east gold and silver by these means became very common in europe and the people were able to pay very considerable taxations even in money but when the empire was afterwards divided all these riches flowed in a full tide to constantinople and we may add to this unhappy circumstance that the mines in germany † had not then been opened     that those of italy  and gaul were very few and inconsiderable and that the mines of spain † had not been worked since the carthaginians lost that country or at least they were not so productive as formerly italy itself was now a continued waste of forsaken gardens and consequently could not be in any condition to draw money from the east whilst the west at the same time was drained of all its wealth by the oriental merchants who supplied the inhabitants with their necessary commodities gold and silver by these means became extremely scarce in europe and yet the emperors extorted the same pecuniary tributes as formerly which completed the general destruction when a government has been established in one certain form and its political circumstances are adjusted to a particular situation it is generally prudent to leave them in that condition for the same causes which have enabled such a state to subsist though they may frequently be complicated and unknown will still continue to support it but when the whole system is changed remedies can only be accommodated to the inconveniences visible in the theory whilst others which nothing but experience can point out are lurking without opposition in the new plan for these reasons though the empire grew already too great yet it was effectually ruined by the divisions into which it was parcelled because all the parts of this vast body had for a long series of time been arranged so as to become settled and steady and were compacted by a mutual dependency through the whole constantine ‡  after he had weakened the capital proceeded     to impair the frontiers by drawing off those legions which were stationed on the banks of great rivers and distributing them into the provinces this innovation was extremely prejudicial in more instances than one for as the barrier which comprehended so many nations was now removed so the soldiers  passed all their time and grew effeminate in the circus and the theatres †  when julian was sent by constantius into gaul he found that fifty towns on the rhine ‡ had been taken by the barbarians and that the provinces were all plundered and that there was now no more than the shadow of a roman army which fled at the very mention of the enemies name this prince by his wisdom ∥  and preservance joined with œconomy conduct and valour and prospered by a noble series of heroic actions chaced the barbarians out of their new settlements and his name became a terror to them as long as he lived §  the shortness of the reigns the various political parties the different religions and the particular sects of these religions have greatly disfigured the characters of the emperors i shall give only two examples that alexander who is a coward in herodian is a hero in lampridius that gratian so highly celebrated   0 by the orthodox is compared to nero by philostorgius no prince saw the necessity of restoring the ancient plan more than valentinian his whole life was employed in fortifying the banks of the rhine making levies raising castles placing troops in proper stations and furnishing them with subsistence on those frontiers but an event that afterwards happened determined his brother valents to open the danube and that proceeding was attended with very dreadful consequences that track of land which lies between the palus mæotis the mountains of caucasus and the caspian sea was inhabited by a numerous people who composed great part of the nation of the huns or that of the alans the soil was exceedingly fertile the inhabitants were fond of wars and robberies and were always either on horseback or in their chariots and wandered about the country wherein they were inclosed they sometimes made depredations on the frontiers of persia and armenia but the ports of the caspian sea were easily guarded and it was difficult for them to penetrate into persia by any other avenues and as they imagined it impracticable to cross the palus mæotis they were altogether unacquainted with the romans so that whilst other nations of barbarians ravaged the empire these confined themselves within the limits which their ignorance had drawn around them it has been the opinion of some  that the slime which was rolled down by the current of the tanais had by degrees formed a kind of incrustation on the surface of the cimmerian bosphorus over which these people are supposed to have passed others † inform us that two young scythians being in full pursuit of a hind the terrified creature swam over that arm of the sea upon which the youths immediately followed her in the same track were exceedingly astonished to find     themselves in a new world and at their return to the old one they gave their countrymen  a particular account of the strange hands and if i may be indulged the expression in inviting indies they had lately discovered upon this information an innumerable body of huns immediately passed those streights and meeting first with the goths made that people fly before them it should seem as if these mighty countries poured their nations out precipitately upon one another and that asia had acquired a new weight to make it ponderate equal to the european power the goths in consternation presented themselves on the banks of the danube and with a suppliant air intreated the romans to allow them a place of refuge the flatterers † of valens improved this conjecture and represented it as a fortunate conquest of a new people who by the accession of their numbers would defend and enrich the empire valens ordered ‡ them to be admitted into his territories upon delivering up their arms but his officers suffered them to repurchase with their money as many as they pleased they were afterwards distributed into several allotments of land but the goths ∥ contrary to the custom of the huns did not cultivate the portions of ground assigned them they were even left destitute of the promised supplies of corn and were     ready to perish amidst a land of plenty they were armed for war and yet unjustly insulted in consequence of these provocations they ravaged all the country from the danube to the bosphorus they destroyed valens and all his army and repassed the danube only to quit the hideous solitude they had effected by their devastations   chap xviii an account of some new maxims received by the romans sometimes the pusillanimous spirit of the emperors †  and frequently the defenceless state of the empire made the people employ their money to appease the nations that threatened to invade them but the desired peace could never be effectually purchased because those who sold it could whenever they pleased oblige the romans to buy it again it is much better to hazard an unsuccessful war than to part with great sums for a precarious peace for a prince is always suspected when it is known he will make a long resistance before he can be vanquished besides such gratifications as these were changed into tribute at last and though they were free at the beginning they became necessary in the event and     passed for an acquired property for which reason when an emperor refused them to some particular people or was not disposed to give them so much as they demanded they immediately declared themselves his mortal enemies to produce an instance or two from a thousand the army which julian led against the persians  was pursued in his retreat from the east by the arabians to whom the customary tribute had been refused and in a short time afterwards in the reign of valentinian the germans †  who had been offered more inconsiderable presents than usual grew exasperated at that disobliging frugality and these northern people being already influenced by a point of honour avenged themselves of this pretended insult by a cruel war all those nations that surrounded the empire in europe and asia exhausted it by degrees of its riches and as the romans derived their grandeur and power from the gold and silver which flowed into the empire from the coffers of so many kings they now grew weak and despicable ‡ because the same gold and silver was drained from them by other nations the misconduct of politicians is not always voluntary but happens frequently to be the unavoidable consequence of their particular situation and therefore one inconvenience is generally the offspring of another the army as we have already declared became very expensive to the state and the soldiers had three     sorts of advantages their ordinary pay donations of recompence after their services and accidental liberalities which were often claimed as stated properties by a body of men who had both princes and people in their power the inability of the people to furnish these expences obliged them to employ a less chargeable soldiery and treaties were struck up with barbarous nations who had neither the luxury of the roman army nor the same spirit and pretensions there was another advantage besides this for as the barbarians poured their troops into a country with the greatest precipitation the romans being unprovided for their reception and finding it sometimes difficult to raise levies in the provinces were obliged to hire another party of barbarians who were always mercenary and eager for battle and plunder this expedient had its use in the present emergency but when that was over the romans found it as difficult to rid themselves of their new allies as of their enemies themselves the ancient romans never suffered the auxiliary troops to outnumber their own in their armies   and though their allies might properly be reputed their subjects yet they had no inclination to let those subjects be better warriors than themselves but in the latter times this proportion of the auxiliaries was not only disregarded but even the national troops were composed of barbarian soldiers thus were customs established quite opposite to those which had rendered the romans masters of the world and as the genius of their former politics always prompted them to reserve the military art to themselves and exclude their neighbours from any participation of its principles they now extinguished     it in their own people and established it among foreigners take this compendium of the roman history they subdued all nations by their maxims but when they had so far succeeded their republic could not subsist any longer the plan of their government must be changed and maxims contrary to the first being then introduced they were divested of all their grandeur fortune never interposes in the government of this world and we may be convinced of this truth by the romans who enjoyed a continual series of prosperity when they regulated their conduct by one invariable plan but suffered an uninterrupted train of calamities when they acted upon different principles there are a set of general causes either moral or physical which operate in every monarchy and either raise and maintain it or else involve it in ruin all accidental conjunctures are subordinate to these causes and if the hazard of a battle which in other words is no more than a particular cause has been destructive of a state some general cause presided and made a single battle be the inevitable ruin of that state in a word the tendency of the main principle draws after it all the particular incidents we are sensible that for two centuries past the danish troops have been generally defeated by the swedes we may therefore conclude that independent of the bravery of the two nations and the chance of war either their civil or military government is disconcerted by some secret flaw which produces this effect and i am of opinion it may easily be discovered in a word the romans lost their military discipline and even neglected it in their very arms vegetius  acquaints us that the soldiers finding them too ponderous obtained the emperor gratians permission to quit their coats of mail and soon after their helmets     and when their bodies were thus defenceless they grew attentive to nothing but flight the same author adds they had lost the art of fortifying their camps and that by this negligence they were easily overwhelmed by the barbarian horse the cavalry of the first romans was not numerous it was but the eleventh part of the legion and often less and what is extraordinary was made less use of by them than by us who are obliged to carry on so many sieges where cavalry is of little service when the roman empire was in its decay their forces consisted of little else but cavalry i imagine as a nation improves in the knowledge of the military art it trusts the more to its intantry and as that science decreases it increases its cavalry in proportion the reason is because the infantry whether light or heavy is nothing without discipline whereas the cavalry is always of use even in its disorder   the action of the latter consists chiefly in its impetuosity and sudden shock that of the former in its resistance and impenetrable firmness which is not so much action as reaction lastly the force of the cavalry is momentaneous that of the infantry of longer duration now there is need of discipline to continue it in a persevering state the romans arrived at universal monarchy not only by the arts of war but likewise by their wisdom their perseverance their passion for glory and their heroic love for their country and when even these virtues disappeared under the emperors and they had only the art military among them yet this alone notwithstanding the weakness and tyranny of their princes enabled them to preserve their former acquisitions but when corruption had at last insinuated itself among the soldiery they became the prey of every nation an empire founded by arms must likewise have arms for its support but as a people when their     state is in confusion are at a loss how to rectify their civil disorders in the same manner when they enjoy a profound peace and are respected for their power they never imagine this calm scene may change and consequently neglect their military force from whence as they have nothing more to hope so they fancy they have all things to fear and sometimes proceed so far as to weaken that basis of their welfare it was an inviolable law among the romans that whoever abandoned his post or quitted his arms in the combat should be punished with death julian and valentinian had reinforced the ancient penalties in this particular but the barbarians who were taken into the roman pay   and were accustomed to make war in the manner now practised by the tartars who fly in order to rally and are more solicitous for plunder than martial reputation were incapable of conforming to such severe regulations the discipline of the ancient romans was so strict that they have had generals who sentenced their own children to die for gaining a battle without their orders but when they were intermixed with the barbarians they contracted from that association the same spirit of independence which marks out the character of those nations and such as read the wars of belifarius with the goths will see a general very frequently disobeyed by his officers sylla and sertorius amidst the fury of civil wars would rather die than connive at any thing from whence mithridates might derive the least advantage but in the succeeding times when a minister † or any grandee     imagined it would be favourable to his avarice his revenge or ambition to admit the barbarians into the empire he immediately permitted them to give a loose to their depredations no states are more necessitated for tributes than those which are weak because this circumstance obliges them to augment their charges in proportion to the peoples inability to defray them and therefore the tributes in the roman provinces became insupportable it would not be improper to read salvians  account of the horrible exactions that were made upon the people the citizens were so harrassed by the farmers of the revenue that they were obliged either to seek refuge among the barbarians or surrender their liberty to the first of their insatiable countrymen who would accept of such a present this may account for the relations we find in our french history of the patience with which the gauls supported a revolution calculated to establish that shocking distinction between a gallant nation and a community of servile wretches i say between a nation who retained their liberty and military privileges and an ignoble body of people the barbarians in making so many citizens slaves to till the earth that is the country to which they were attached introduced no services which were not more cruelly exacted before †      chap xix some particulars of the grandeur of attila the establishment of the barbarians accounted for reasons why the western empire was overturned before that in the east as christianity was established when the empire was in a declining condition the prosessors of this religion reproached the pagans for that decay and these retorted the charge on the religious doctrines of their antagonists the christians replied that dioclesian  ruined the empire by associating his three colleagues because each emperor would be altogether as expensive and maintained as great armies as could have subsisted had there been but one sovereign in consequence of which those who furnished the contributions being unequally proportioned to the number of the receivers the charges became so excessive that the lands were forsaken by the husbandmen and for want of cultivation lay waste and were covered with wild and barren forests the pagans on the other hand were perpetually exclaiming against the strange innovations in religion introduced by their adversaries and never heard of till those days and as the overflowings of the tyber and other prejudicial effects of nature were in the flourishing state of rome ascribed to the displeasure of the gods so the calamities of declining rome were imputed to a religious novelty and the subversion of the ancient altars symmachus the prefect in a letter † to the emperors relating to the altar of victory attacked the christian religion with arguments extremely popular and consequently very seducing and had art enough   0 to set them off with all the plausibility invention could furnish what circumstance says he can lead us more effectually to the knowledge of the gods than the experience of our former prosperity we ought to be faithful to such a series of ages and pursue the same track in which our fathers so happily followed their ancestors imagine rome herself speaks to you in this manner o imperial princes compassionate fathers of your country look with eyes of veneration on those years of mine wherein i always conformed to the ceremonies of my predecessors those sacred institutions have made the universe obedient to my laws these were the allies that chaced hannibal from my walls and drove the gauls in confusion from the capitol we fervently ask peace for the gods of our country nay we solicit it in the anguish of our souls for our compatriot deities we have no inclination to engage in disputes which are only proper for idle persons and we would express ourselves in the language of supplication and not of war symmachus was answered by three celebrated authors orosius composed his history to prove there had always been calamities in the world as great as those complained of by the pagans salvian likewise wrote his book   wherein he maintains that the ravages of the barbarians were to be imputed to the degenerate behaviour of the christians and st austin † demonstrates that the city of heaven is very different from that city on earth in which the ancient romans received for a few human virtues a recompence as vain as the virtues themselves we have already observed that part of the politics of the ancient romans consisted in dividing all the powers that gave them any umbrage but that scheme was deseated in after times and rome could not prevent attili from conquering all the northern nations     he extended his victories from the danube to the rhine demolished all the forts and military works on the banks of those rivers and made both the empires tributary theodosius says he   with an insolent air is descended from a father as noble as mine but the moment i compelled him to pay tribute to me he fell from the grandeur of his extraction and became my vassal and therefore it is unjust in him to act like a base slave and endeavour to prejudice his master by treachery an emperor said he upon an other occasion ought not to be a liar he promised one of my subjects to give him the daughter of saturninus in marriage and i will immediately declare war against him if he presumes to depart from his word but if the disobedience of those about him puts it out of his power to be punctual i will march to his assistance it is not to be imagined that attila was induced by any moderation and lenity of temper to let the romans subsist he only conformed himself to the genius of his nation which prompted them to awe and not to conquer foreign states this prince retiring from the splendor of majesty to his mansion built of wood according to the representation of priscus †  though at the same time he was lord of all the barbarous nations and in some degree master of the chief part of those who were civilized ‡  was one of the geeatest monarchs recorded in history ambassadors were dispatched to his court both from the eastern and western empires of the romans     to receive his laws and implore his favour sometimes he commanded them to deliver up the huns who had deserted from his armies or the roman slaves who had escaped from the vigilance of his officers at other times he would not be satisfied till some minister of the emperor was surrendered into his power he charged the empire of the east with a tribute of two hundred thousand pounds of gold he received the yearly sum allowed to a roman general and sent those he intended to reward to constantinople that they might be gratified to their utmost wish making by these means a constant traffic of the apprehensions of the romans he was feared by his subjects   but we have no reason to believe they entertained any aversion to his person he was surprizingly fierce and impetuous and at the same time exceeding politic and artful he appeared violent in his rage but had a sufficient presence of mind to know when to pardon an offence or deser a punishment as the circumstances were more or less agreeable to his interest war was never his choice when he could derive sufficient advantages from peace he was faithfully served even by the kings who were subordinate to his power and had collected into his own conduct all the ancient simplicity of the northern manners in a word we can never sufficiently admire this gallant sovereign of a people whose very children were warmed with enthusiastic rage at the relation of their fathers bravery whilst those fathers shed manly tears because they were incapacitated by age to imitate their martial children all the barbarian nations after his death were divided into several independent bodies but the romans were then so weak that the most inconsiderable people were in a condition to molest them     the empire was not ruined by any particular invasion but sunk gradually under the weight of the several attacks made upon it after that general assault it sustained in the time of gallus it seemed indeed to be reestablished because none of its territories were dismembered from the main body but it was stooping to its fall by several degrees of declension till it was at once laid low in the reigns of arcadius and honorius in vain did the romans chace the barbarians from their settlements in the empire that people without any compulsion would have retired to deposit their spoils in their own country with as little success did rome endeavour to exterminate that nation since her cities were still sacked   her villages consumed with flames and her families either slaughtered or dispersed when one province had been wasted the barbarians who succeeded the first ravagers meeting nothing for their purpose proceeded to another their devastations at first were limited to thrace mysia and pannonia and when these countries were ruined they destroyed macedonia thessaly and greece from thence they expatiated to noricum the empire that is to say those tracts of land which were not depopulated was continually shrinking and italy at last became the frontier the reason why the barbarians established themselves in no fixed settlements in the reigns of gallus and gallienus was because the countries about them had something left that was worth plundering thus the normans who in some measure resembled the conquerors of the empire ravaged france for several centuries and when at last they could find no more booty they thought fit to accept of a depopulated province and parcelled it into † several properties     scythia in those times lying waste and uncultivated   the inhabitants were frequently subject to famine and subsisted in a great measure by their commerce with the romans †  who furnished them with provisions from the provinces bordering on the danube the barbarians in return gave them the booty and prisoners they had taken and the gold and silver which the romans paid them for their friendship but when the empire could no longer afford them a sufficient tribute for their subsistence ‡  they were obliged to fix themselves in some settlement the western empire was destroyed before that in the east for these reasons when the barbarians passed the danube they found themselves blocked up on the left hand by the bosphorus of thrace the city of canstantinople and all the forces of the eastern empire this made it necessary for them to bend their march to the right towards illyria and so proceed westward that part of the country was crouded with a vast conflux of several nations and as the passages into asia were the best guarded the whole body of the people bore with a full tide into europe whereas the forces of the barbarians were separated in their first invasion the empire being parcelled out into two great portions ∥  the eastern emperors who were then in alliance     with the barbarians   would not break it to assist the princes of the west this division of the administration says priscus †  was very prejudicial to the affairs of the west thus the romans of the east refused those of the west a naval armament ‡  because they had entered into alliance with the vandals the visigoths in conjunction with arcadius made an irruption into the west and honorius ∥ was obliged to fly to ravenna lastly zeno to get rid of theodoric persuaded him to fall upon italy which had been already laid waste by alaric there was a very strict alliance § between attila and genseric king of the vandals the last stood in fear of the goths   he had married his son to a daughter of their king and afterwards slitting her nose had sent her back to her father for which reason he united with attila the two empires enslaved by these two potentates had no power to shake off their chains the situation of that of the west was more particularly deplorable it had no forces at sea ††  they being all dispersed in egypt cyprus phænicia ionia and greece the only countries where at that time commerce subsisted the vandals and other nations attacked the west from all sides an embassy came from italy to constantinople says priscus ‡‡  representing that it was impossible they should keep their ground unless peace was made with the vandals those that presided in the west were not mistaken in their politics they judged it necessary to save italy which was in some respects the head and in others the heart of the empire they removed the     barbarians to the extremities and settled them there the design was well laid and as well executed these nations asked for nothing but subsistence they gave them the plains and reserved to themselves the mountainous parts of the country the defiles the passes over rivers and the strong forts upon them they kept in their own hands the sovereignty it is probable these people would have been forced to have become romans and the facility with which these ravagers were themselves destroyed by the franks by the greeks and the moors is a proof of this conjecture this whole system was overthrown by one revolution more fatal than all the rest the army of italy composed of strangers demanded that which had been granted to nations still greater strangers it formed under odoacer an aristocracy which claimed the thirds of the lands in italy and this was the most fatal blow to the empire amongst so many misfortunes it is natural to enquire with a melancholy curiosity after the fate of rome it was we may say without defence and could easily be starved by an enemy the extent of its walls made it almost impracticable for the inhabitants to defend them and as it was situated in a plain it might be stormed without much difficulty besides this no recruits were to be expected for the number of the people was so extremely diminished that the emperors were obliged to retire to ravenna a city once fortified by the sea as venice is at this time the romans being generally abandoned by their princes began to take the sovereign power into their own hands and stipulated for their safety by treaties   which is the most likely method of acquiring the supreme authority †  armorica and brittany seeing themselves forsaken began to regulate themselves by their own laws     this was the fatal period of the western empire rome ascended to such a height of grandeur because the scenes of her former wars opened successively and by an incredible felicity of affairs she was never attacked by one nation till another had been first destroyed but rome herself was overpowered at last because she was invaded at once by all the nations around her chap xx the conquests of justinian some account of his government as this vast body of people broke all at once like a flood into the empire they mutually incommoded one another and all the politics of those times consisted in setting them at variance together this was a circumstance easy to accomplish their avarice and fierce dispoposition greatly contributing to make it practicable the largest part of them was therefore destroyed before they could fix themselves in any settlement and this was the reason why the empire of the east still subsisted for some time the northern regions were likewise exhausted at last and no longer poured out those innumerable armies they originally produced for after the first invasion by the goths and huns and especially since the death of attila these people and their successors appeared in the field with force much inferior to the former in number when the nations who assembled together in the form of an army were distributed into peaceful partitions of lands much of their martial vivacity was abated and as they were scattered through the countries they had conquered they were exposed themselves to the same invasions in this situation of affairs justinian undertook the recovery of africa and italy and accomplished the same designs which the french so happily executed against the visigoths the burgundians the lombards and the saracens     when christianity was first planted among the barbarians the arian sect was predominant in the empire and valens sent priests to them who were their first apostles now in the interval from their conversion to their establishment this sect fell into disreputation among the romans for which reason when the barbarians of this persuasion found all the country orthodox and could never insinuate themselves into the affections of the people it was easy for the emperors to incommode them we may likewise add that the barbarians being unqualified for the siege of towns and much more so for their defence suffered the walls to drop into ruins procopius informs us that belisarius found all the italian cities in this condition and those of africa had already been dismantled by genseric   with a gothic view of fortifying the inhabitants the generality of these northern people after they had established themselves in the provinces of the south soon degenerated into the unmanly softness of those regions and became incapable of the fatigues of war †  the vandals were emasculated with pleasures a luxuriant table an effeminate habit the delicacy of baths the enervating lull of music gay dances florid gardens and splendid theatres were now become their necessary gratifications they no longer disquieted the romans ‡  says malchus ∥  when they discontinued those armies which genseric perpetually kept prepared for any expedition and with which he prevented the vigilance of his enemies and astonished all the world with the rapidity of his enterprizes the cavalry of the romans and that of the huns their auxiliaries were very expert at drawing the bow but that of the goths § and vandals sought only with     the sword and lance and were unpractised in the distant combat for which reason belisarius ascribes part of his success to this difference   justinian received signal services from the huns a people from whom the parthians sprung and these descendants combated like their ancestors when the huns lost all their power by the divisions which the great number of attilas children occasioned they served the romans in the quality of auxiliaries and formed their best cavalry each of these barbarous nations † was distinguished by their particular manner of combating as well as by their arms the goths and vandals were formidable at the drawn sword the huns were admirable bowmen the suevi were serviceable infantry the alans were heavily armed and the heruli were a flying troop the romans selected from all these people the different bodies of troops which were serviceable to their designs and sought against one nation with the joint advantage of all the rest it is remarkable that the weakest nations have been those that made the greatest establishments we should be muched deceived if we judged of their force by their conquests in this long train of irruptions the barbarians or rather the swarms which issued from them were vanquishers or vanquished every thing depended on circumstances and while one great nation was defeated or engaged a body of new adventurers finding a country open carried desolation into it the goths who by reason of the disadvantage of their arms were obliged to fly before so many nations settled in italy gaul and spain the vandals too weak to keep their   0 possessions in spain passed into africa where they founded a great empire justinian could not fit out more than fifty ships against the vandals and when belisarius embarked he had but five thousand soldiers this was undoubtedly a bold expedition and leo who before that time had sent against the same people a fleet of all the ships in the east and manned with a hundred thousand soldiers could not conquer africa and was even in danger of losing the whole empire these great fleets have been as little successful as very numerous land armies for as they impoverish and depopulate a state so should the expedition be of a considerable length or any misfortune befal them they can neither be succoured nor recruited and if one part be lost the other becomes insignificant because ships of war as well as transports cavalry infantry ammunition in a word all the particulars have a necessary dependance on the whole the tardiness of an enterprize makes those who engage in it always find the enemy prepared to receive them besides such an expedition is seldom made in a proper season and generally overtaken by the stormy months because such a vast number of preparations are hardly ever compleated till the season is too far advanced belisarius invaded africa and very advantageously supplied himself with provisions from sicily in consequence of a treaty made with amalasonta queen of the goths when he was sent to attack italy he took notice that the goths received their subsistence from sicily and therefore began his expedition with the conquest of that island by which proceeding he at the same time starved his enemies and plentifully supplied his own army with all accommodations belisarius took carthage rome and ravenna and sent the kings of the goths and vandals captives to constantinople where the ancient triumphs were renewed after a long interval of years       the extraordinary qualities of this great man   naturally account for his success a general who was master of all the maxims of the first romans was then at the head of such an army as that brave people anciently composed virtues that are very shining are generally concealed or lost in servitude but the tyrannical government of justinian could not oppress the grandeur of that soul nor the noble superiority of such a genius narses the eunuch was thrown into this reign to make it still more illustrious as he had received his education in the palace he was honoured with a greater share of the emperors confidence for princes always esteem their courtiers the most faithful of their subjects on the other hand the irregular conduct of justinian his profusions tyranny and rapine his intoxicated fondness for building changing and reforming his inconstancy in his designs a severe and weak reign made still more incommodious by a lingering old age were a train of real calamities intermixed with unprofitable success and a false glitter of unsubstantial glory these victories were not the effect of any solid power subsisting in the empire but resulted from the lucky conjunction of some particular circumstances and were soon rendered ineffectual for whilst the army was pursuing its fortunate beginnings a new swarm of barbarous nations passed the danube and spread desolation through illyria macedonia and greece and the persians in four invasions weakened the empire with incurable wounds †  the more rapid these conquests appeared the less durable was their foundation and italy and africa were hardly wrested from the enemy before it became     necessary to recover them a second time by new victories justinian had taken from the theatre a  woman who had long prostituted herself to immodest pleasures and she governed him with an authority that has no parallel in history perpetually intermixing his affairs with the passions and fanciful inconsistencies of her sex in consequence of which she defeated the victorious progress of his arms and disconcerted the most favourable events the eastern people were always accustomed to a plurality of wives in order to deprive the sex of that strange ascendant they maintain over man in our climates but at constantinople the prohibition of polygamy made the empire subject to the will of a female or in other words threw a natural weakness into the government the people of constantinople had for many years been divided into two factions donominated the blue and the green they derived their original from the approbation usually given in the theatres to some particular actors and when races were exhibited in the circus the charioteers who were dressed in green disputed the prize with those who were habited in blue and each of these spectators became interested even to madness in the competition of those colours these two factions being diffused through all the cities of the empire proportioned their animosities to the rank and grandeur of those cities or as we may justly say to the indolence and idle lives of the generality of the people but though such divisions are always necessary in a republic and may be considered as essential to its support they are insallibly destructive to an arbitrary government because they can only change the person of the sovereign but never contribute to the establishment of the laws or the discontinuance of abuses     justinian who favoured the faction of the blue   and denied all justice to the green increased the mutual inveteracy of both parties and consequently strengthened them in the state these contending parties proceeded so far as even to disannul the authority of the magistrates the blues were in no apprehension of the laws because the emperor protected them against their severity and the † greens began to disregard them because they could not defend them from insults all the bands of friendship affinity and gratitude were cut asunder and whole families destroyed each other every villain who intended to be remarkably wicked belonged to the faction of the blue and every man who was either robbed or assassinated was a partisan for the green we may add that the government was if possible more cruel than senseless and the emperor not satisfied with a general injustice of loading his subjects with excessive impositions resolved to ruin them in their private affairs by all imaginable tyrannies i am far from entertaining an implicit belief of all the particulars related by procopius in his secret history because the pompous commendations he in his other works bestows on this prince may make his veracity a little questionable in this where he paints him out as the most stupid and inhuman tyrant that ever lived on the other hand there are two circumstances which incline me to pay some regard to this secret history for in the first place the particulars seem better connected with the astonishing weakness which     discovered itself at the latter end of this reign and in those of the succeeding emperors the other circumstance is that monument which still exists among us and is a collection of the laws of this emperor which in the course of a few years present us with greater variations than are to be found in our laws for the three last centuries of our monarchy these variations  generally relate to matters of so little importance that we can see no reason to induce a legislator to make them unless we refer to the secret history for a solution and acknowledge that this prince exposed his judgment and his laws equally to sale but the political state of the government received the greatest injury from his project of establishing a general uniformity of opinion in matters of religion and in circumstances that rendered his zeal as indiscreet as possible the ancient romans fortified their empire by indulging all sorts of religious worship but their posterity destroyed it by rooting out the various sects whose doctrines were not predominant these sects were composed of entire nations some of which as the jews and samaritans had retained their ancient religion after they were conquered by the romans others were dispersed through the country as the followers of montanus in phrygia the manichees the sabbatarians the arians in the other provinces besides which the generality of the people in the country continued in idolatry and were insatuated with a religion as gross as their understandings these sects justinian caused to be extirpated by the military as well as the civil power and the persecuted people revolting in their own defence he thought himself obliged to exterminate them from the empire in consequence of which he depopulated several provinces and whilst he imagined himself increasing the     number of the faithful he was only diminishing the race of mankind procopius assures us that palestine by the destruction of the samaritans was changed into a desert and this proceeding was the more singular because the very zeal which weakened the empire in order to establish religion sprung out of the same quarter from whence the arabians afterwards sallied with an intention to subvert it but nothing could be more aggravating than that the emperor whilst he was so averse to all toleration himself should yet disagree with the empress in the most essential points he followed the council of chalcedon and she favoured its opposers whether as evagrius says   they were sincere in this proceeding or not is uncertain when we read procopiuss description of justinians buildings and the forts and other places of defence he erected in all parts it naturally raises in our minds the idea of a flourishing state but that idea happens to be very delusive the ancient romans had none of these fortifications but placed all their security in their armies which they distributed along the banks of rivers and raised towers at proper distances for the lodgment of the soldiers afterwards indeed when they had but very indifferent armies and frequently none at all the frontiers † could not defend the countries they limited and therefore it became necessary to strengthen them the     consequence of which was they had more fortifications and less force many places for retreat and very few for security the country was only habitable about the fortifications and these were built in all parts the condition of the empire resembled that of france in the time of the normans  which was never so defenceless as when all its villages were girt around with walls we may venture to affirm therefore that the whole catalogue of justinians forts which fills several pages in procopius only exhibits to us so many monuments of the weakness of the empire chap xxi disorders in the eastern empire the persians during this period were in a much happier situation than the romans they had little reason to be apprehensive of the northern people †  because that part of mount taurus which extends between the caspian and euxine seas separated them from those nations and they effectually shut up a very narrow pass ‡  which was the only practicable avenue for the cavalry in every other part the barbarians were obliged to descend from frightful precipices §  and to quit their horses in which all their military strength consisted and besides these impediments they were blocked in by the araxes a river of great depth and which flows from west to east all the passages of which were easy to be defended with all these advantages the persians were in perfect tranquility with respect to the eastern nations on the south they were bounded by the sea and the arabian princes who were partly their allies and partly     in confederacy with the romans were totally engaged in pillaging one another the persians therefore had none whom they could properly call their enemies but the romans we are sensible said an ambassador of hormisdas   that the romans are engaged in several wars and are at variance with almost all nations whilst we as they well know have no hostilities with any people but themselves the persians had cultivated the military art to as great a degree as it was neglected by the romans belisarius said to his soldiers the persians are not your superiors in courage and only surpass you in the discipline of war they had likewise the same superiority in the cabinet as they preserved in the field and demanded tribute of the romans under a pretence that they maintained garrisons in the caspian streights as if each nation had not a right to guard its frontiers they obliged them to pay for peace and every cessation of arms and did not scruple to make them purchase the very time employed either in negociations or war the avari having crossed the danube the romans who had seldom any troops to oppose them being engaged against the persians when they should have given battle to the avari and having full employment from these when they ought to have faced the persians were still obliged to submit to a tribute and thus the majesty of the empire bowed down before all nations justin tiberius and maurice were very sedulous to defend the empire the last of these princes had some virtues but they were all sullied by an avarice almost incredible in a great monarch the king of the avari offered to restore all his roman prisoners to maurice if he would ranson them at an inconsiderable price for each man and this proposal being rejected he caused them all to be inhumanly     murdered the roman army was greatly exasperated at this proceeding and the faction of the greens making an insurrection at the same time a centurion named phocas was raised to the imperial dignity and he ordered maurice and his children to be put to death the history of the grecian empire for so we shall denominate the monarchy of the romans for the future is little more than a series of revolts seditions and persidy the subjects had no idea of the loyalty due to princes and there were so many interruptions in the successions of the emperors that the title of porphyrogenitus which signifies one born in the apartment where the empress reposed was an appellation which few princes of the several imperial families could with any propriety assume all the paths that could be struck out to empire were unexceptionable and the candidates were conducted to the diadem by the clergy the senate the peasants the inhabitants of constantinople and the people of the provincial cities christianity being now the prevailing religion of the empire was intermixed with several successive heresies which called aloud for condemnation arius having denied the divinity of the word the macedonians that of the holy spirit nestorius the unity of the person of jesus christ the eutychians his two natures the monothelites his two wills it became necessary to convene councils against them but their decisions not being universally received several emperors who had been seduced into these heretical opinions relapsed into the same persuasions after they had been condemned and as no nation was ever so implacable against heretics as the greeks who even imagined themselves polluted when they conversed with any of that class or had any cohabitation with them several emperors in consequence of that popular aversion lost the affections of their subjects and the people became persuaded that princes who were so frequently rebellious against god     could never be chosen by providence to be their sovereigns a new opinion formed by an idea that it was unlawful to shed christian blood and which daily grew more popular when the mohammedans appeared upon the stage of military action was the cause that offences in which religion was not directly interested were punished with great moderation those who had spirited up an insurrection or framed any attempt against the person of the prince were only sentenced to lose their eyes to have their hair or noses cut off or to suffer some other mutilation as these offences might be committed with very little hazard they might likewise be attempted without much courage   a certain veneration for the regalia of imperial majesty drew the eyes of all the people on those who presumed to wear them and it was criminal to be either habited in purple or to keep it in a wardrobe but when a man had once the resolution to appear in that dress the multitude immediately flocked after him because their respect was more attached to the apparel than the person ambition received greater provocatives still from the surprising infatuation of those times and there was hardly a man of any considerable consequence who could not accommodate to himself some prediction that promised him the empire as the indispositions of the mind are generally incurable †  judicial astrology and the art of pointing out futurity by objects seen in a bason of water succeeded among the christians to the solemn imposture of divination by the entrails of victims or the flight of birds which had been abolished with paganism its parent and vain promises became the motives to most of the rash   0 actions of particular persons and constituted the wisdom of princes councils the calamities of the empire daily increasing it was natural to impute ill success in war and dishonourable treaties in peace to the injudicious conduct of those at the helm one revolution was now pregnant with another and the effect itself became a cause and as the greeks had seen such a succession of different families on the throne they were not devoted to any and since fortune had created so many emperors out of all classes of people no birth was so obscure and no merit so inconsiderable as to be destitute of hope several examples which had been familiar to the nation modelled the genius of the people in general and formed a system of manners which reigned as imperiously as the laws it should seem that great enterprizes among us are more impracticable than they were to the ancients it is very difficult to conceal them because intelligence is now become so manageable that every prince has ministers in each court and traitors may possibly be lurking in all the cabinets of majesty the invention of posts has given wings to information and can immediately wast it to all parts as great undertakings are not to be accomplished without money and as merchants are masters of it since the invention of bills of exchange their affairs are always connected with the secrets of state and they neglect nothing to penetrate into those depths the fluctuations in exchange without any visible cause entice numbers of people to search after it and some of them find it at last to their cost the invention of printing which has put books into the hands of all the world the improvements in engraving which have made geographic charts so common in a word the establishment of political papers give every individual a knowledge of a general     interests sufficient enough to instruct him in all the private transactions conspiracies in a state are now become very difficult because since the establishment of posts all the secrets of particular persons are in the power of the public princes may act with promptitude because all the power of the state is in their possession conspirators must proceed with caution because they are destitute of expedients and since at present all transactions are more easily discovered those who form designs against a government are generally detected before they can adjust their schemes chap xxii the weakness of the eastern empire phocas amidst the general confusion of affairs being unsettled in his new dignity heraclius came from africa and caused him to be murdered at the same time he found the provinces invaded and the legions destroyed as soon as this prince had in some measure remedied these disasters the arabians quitted their own country to extend the empire and religion which mohammed had founded by their cooperation no people ever made so rapid a progress for they immediately conquered syria palestine egypt and africa and then turned their hostilities against the persians god permitted his religion to be laid low in so many places where it once had been predominant not that it now ceased to be the object of his providential care but because it always either in its state of glory or depression produces its natural effect which is the sanctification of the soul     the welfare of religion has no similitude to the prosperity of empires and we are told by a celebrated author that it may well be distempered since malady itself is the true state of a christian to which we may add that the humiliations and dispersion of the church the destruction of her temples and the persecutions of her martyrs are eminent seasons of her glory but when she appears triumphant to the eyes of the world she is generally sinking in adversity we are not to have recourse to enthusiasm alone to clear up this memorable event of the arabian conquests which spread through so many countries the saracens had been long distinguished among the auxiliaries of rome and persia and they as well as the osroanians were the expertest archers in the world alexander severus and maximin had engaged them as much as possible in their service and they were extremely useful in the wars with the germans to whom their arrows were fatal at a great distance the goths themselves   in the reign of valens were incapable of resisting them in a word they at that time were the best cavalry in the world we have already observed that the legions raised in europe were much preferable to those of asia but it was directly contrary with respect to the cavalry i mean that of the parthians the osroanians and the saracens this was the power that stopped the full career of the roman conquests because after the death of antiochus a new nation of tartars who had the best cavalry of any people made themselves masters of the upper asia this cavalry was heavy †  and that of europe light quite contrary to the present nature of their military equipage holland and friseland were not as yet won     from the waters and  germany was full of woods lakes and marshes where the cavalry were of little importance when a free passage was opened to the great rivers the stagnant waters shrunk from those marshes and germany assumed a new surface many changes were effected by the works of valentinian † on the necker and those of the romans on the rhine and commerce being once established those countries which did not originally produce horses ‡ began to propagate the breed and the inhabitants made great use of those animals constantine ∥  the son of heraclius having been poisoned and his son constance slain in sicily constantine the bearded his eldest son succeeded to the empire but the grandees of the eastern provinces being assembled on this occasion were determined to crown the other brothers of this prince jointly with himself alledging that as it was indispensably necessary for them to believe in the trinity so it was reasonable they should be governed by three emperors the grecian history is crouded with proceedings as extraordinary as this and a low turn of mind being then characteristic of that nation the former wisdom was no longer conspicuous in their actions and the empire became a scene of troubles and revolutions to which it was impossible to assign any preparatory motives an universal bigotry had stupified and emasculated the whole empire constantinople was the only place in the east where christianity was predominant and likewise where the pusillanimous indolence and degrading softness of the asiatic nations were blended with devotion itself of a thousand instances that might     be alledged i shall only mention the conduct of philippicus the general of maurices army who being on the point of charging the enemy in the field burst into tears  when he suddenly considered what numbers of mankind were then to be destroyed the tears of the arabians † flowed from a very different source when they wept with regret that their general had agreed to a truce which frustrated their intended effusion of christian blood there is a total difference between an army of fanatics and another of bigots and it evidently appeared in a late memorable revolution in which cromwells army resembled the arabians whilst the irish and scottish forces were like the greeks a gross superstition which debases the mind as effectually as true religion exalts it had reduced all virtue and devout confidence in the deity to a stupid veneration for images and history presents us with generals who would raise a siege ‡ or surrendered a city for ∥ the gallant acquisition of a relick christianity degenerated under the grecian empire into as many corruptions as were intermixed with it in our time by the muscovites till the czar peter the first new modelled that nation and introduced more changes into the dominions he governed than are usually established in those which conquerors usurp we may easily believe the greeks were infected with idolatry there can be no suspicion that the italians and germans were but coldly devoted to external worship and yet when the greek historians take notice of the contempt expressed by the italians for images and relies one would be apt to compare them with the modern zealots against calvin nicetas informs us that the germans in their march to the holy land     were received by the armenians as friends because they did not offer any adoration to images now if the italians and germans did not sufficiently reverence images in the apprehension of the greeks what an enormous veneration must then be paid to them by this people the east was on the point of being made the scence of such a revolution as happened about two centuries ago in the west when upon the revival of learning the abuses and corruptions in religion became evident to all and as every person was inquisitive after a proper remedy so there were some so bold and untractable as to rend the church by divisions instead of restoring it to its original purity by a due reformation leo isaurus constantine copronymus and leo his son were implacable against images and when the worship of them had been reestablished by the empress irene leo the arminian michael the stammerer and theophilus abolished them again these princes imagined they could not moderate that worship unless they destroyed it effectually they likewise turned their hostilities against the monks   who incommoded the state and as their proceedings were always carried to extremes they endeavoured to exterminate that fraternity instead of regulating them in a proper manner the monks † being accused of idolatry by those who favoured the new opinions retorted in their turn upon their adversaries and accused them of magic practices ‡ and then calling upon the people to behold the churches that were divested of images and the other furniture which till that time     had been the objects of adoration they created a belief in their flock that these holy places must certainly be profaned by daily sacrifices to dæmons the controversy relating to images was connected with very delicate circumstances which kindled it into a raging flame and in the event made persons of solid judgment incapable of proposing a moderate worship the dispute included the tender article of power and the monks having seized it in consequence of their spiritual usurpations they could neither enlarge nor maintain it but by making daily additions to the acts of external adoration wherein they were so considerably interested for this reason all oppositions to the establishment of images were considered as so many hostilities against themselves and when they had succeeded in their pretensions their power was no longer limitable this period was remarkable for such a conjuncture as happened some centuries afterwards in the warm disagreement between barlaam and the monks of that time which brought the empire to the verge of destruction the subject of the dispute was whether the light which encircled jesus christ on mount tabor was created or not the monks indeed were indifferent as to either part of the question in debate but as barlaam made a direct attack upon that fraternity they found it consistent with their interest to assert that light to be uncreated the war which those emperors who were called iconoclasts declared against the monks revived some particular principles of government and offered a plausible pretence for employing the public revenue for the public advantage and for disengaging the state from every inconvenience that encumbered it when i consider the profound ignorance into which the grecian priests had plunged the laity it seems natural to compare the former to those scythians mentioned     by herodotus  who caused the eyes of their slaves to be plucked out that their attention might not be diverted when they were churning milk for their masters when the empress theodora had reestablished the use of images the monks immediately began to corrupt the public devotion and proceeded even to oppress the secular clergy they thrust themselves into every beneficial see † and gradually excluded all ecclesiastics from episcopal promotion by this proceeding they became unsupportable and if we draw a parallel between them and the latin clergy and compare the conduct of our popes with that of the patriarchs of constantinople we shall see in our pontiffs and clergy a set of men altogether as judicious as the others were irrational we are presented with a surprizing contradiction in human nature when we consider that the ministers of religion among the ancient romans when they were not made incapable of public employments and civil society were but little solicitous about either and that after the establishment of christianity the ecclesiastics who were most secluded from temporal affairs engaged in them with the greatest moderation but when the monks in the declension of the empire became the sole clergy these people who were forbidden by a more particular profession to intermeddle with the transactions of state embraced all opportunities that could possibly introduce them into the government and never ceased to fill every place with confusion and to discompose the world which they pretended to renounce there was not any affair of the empire any particular peace or war any truce or negociation or any private treaty of marriage capable of completion without the ministration of these monks they crowded into the     cabinets of princes and composed the greatest part of the national assemblies the calamities which resulted from this irreligious officiousness are inconceivable these ecclesiastic statesmen infused an indolent insignificance into the minds of princes and communicated a taint of imprudence to their best actions whilst basilius employed his naval forces in erecting a church to the honour of st michael   he abandoned sicily to the depredations of the saracens and suffered them to take syracuse but lest he should be singular in that proceeding leo his successor consigned his fleet to the same employment and permitted the barbarians to possess themselves of tauromenia and the island of lemnos andronicus palæologus † entirely neglected his maritime power because he had been assured god was so well satisfied with his zeal for the churchs peace that his enemies would never presume to invade his dominions by sea he was even apprehensive that the deity would call him to a strict account for the time he devoted to the necessary affairs of state and deducted from spiritual attentions the greeks being very loquacious great disputants and naturally inclined to sophistry were perpetually incumbering religion with controversial points and as the monks were in great reputation in a court which was always weak in proportion to its corruption that court and those monks mutually communicated infection to each other in consequence of which the emperors devoted all their thoughts sometimes to calm and frequently to inflame theological disputes which were always observed to be most frivolous when they were debated with the greatest warmth michael palæologus ‡  whose reign was so infested     with controversies in religion growing sensible of the melancholy devastations committed by the turks in asia said with a sigh that the rash zeal of some persons who by exclaiming against his conduct had exasperated his subjects against him made it necessary for him to employ all his cares to accomplish his own preservation and compelled him to be a tame spectator of the ruin of several provinces i contented myself said he with providing for the security of those distant parts by the ministration of governors who being either corrupted by the enemy or apprehensive of punishment never acquainted me with the unhappy situation of the people with whose welfare they were intrusted the patriarchs of constantinople had assumed an unlimited power and as the emperors and their grandees generally retired to the churches when the people were spirited up to insurrections the patriarchs had consequently an opportunity of delivering them up to the popular fury and never failed to exercise this power as they were directed by any particular fancy by which means they always became the arbiters of public affairs though in a very indirect manner when the elder andronicus  caused the patriarch to be admonished not to intermeddle with the transactions of state but to confine his attention to spiritual affairs such a request replied that imperious priest is as if the body should say to the soul i do not claim any community with you and have no occasion for your assistance in the exercise of my functions such monstrous pretensions became insupportable to princes and the patriarchs were frequently divested of their sees but such a proceeding in a superstitious nation who detested all the ecclesiastical functions of the patriarch whom they considered as an intruder produced continual schisms each particular patriarch   0 the old the new and the last elected being supported by his own set of partizans such conditions as these were much more pernicious than any disagreements on points of doctrine because they resembled an hydra to whom every defeat was a renovation the rage of disputation became so natural to the greeks that cantacuzenus   when he took constantinople found the emperor john and his empress engaged in a council which had been summoned against some adversaries of the monks and when mohammed the second besieged that city †  the emperor could not suppress the theological animosities and the council of florence ‡ engaged the general attention much more than the turkish army as every person in common disputes is sensible he may be deceived a tenacious and untractable spirit seldom prevails to any extreme but in those controversies where religion is the subject for there as every person from the nature of the point in debate becomes persuaded that his own opinion is true he grows exasperated against those who instead of concurring with his sentiments endeavour to make him a convert to their own those who may happen to read the history written by pachymerus will be effectually convinced of the unalterable inability of divines to accommodate their own disagreements and will see an emperor ∥ who spent his days in assembling people of that class listening to their disputations and reproaching them for the inflexibility of their opinions they will likewise behold     another engaged with a hydra of controversies that were perpetually rising to new life and will be sensible that the same pacific methods and persevering patience the same inclination to finish their contentions in a word the same artless pliancy to their intrigues joined with the same deference to their aversions will never reconcile these implacable ecclesiastics while the world endures we shall present the reader with a remarkable instance of the disposition we have been describing the partisans of the patriach arsenus   were prevailed upon by the solicitations of the emperor to come into a treaty with those who were in the interest of the patriarch joseph this treaty specified that both parties should write down their several pretensions and then throw the two papers which contained them into a pan of live coals and if one of them should remain unconsumed they were then to acquiesce with that determination from heaven but if both should happen to be burnt the parties were no longer to persist in their demands the fire destroyed the two papers the factions were reconciled and the peace continued for a day the next morning they pretended that the renunciation of their claims ought to flow from an internal persuasion and not from chance and from that moment the contention was renewed with greater animosity than ever the disputes of divines should always be considered with great attention but at the same time this ought to be concealed as much as possible because any visible solicitude to calm the contending parties never fails to credit their singularities and consequently tempts them to believe their sentiments are of such importance as to comprehend the welfare of the state and the security of the sovereign     it is altogether as impracticable to decide the disagreements of clergymen by attending to their affected subtilties as it would be to abolish duels by erecting a court with a delegation to trace a point of honour through all its refinements such was the imprudence of the greek emperors that when a religious controversy had been lulled asleep by time they again awakened it in all its rage justinian heraclius and manual comnenus proposed articles of faith to their ecclesiastics and laity who would certainly have been deceived in the truth though it had flowed from the lips of those princes in all its purity and as they were always defective in forms and generally in essentials and grew desirous of displaying their penetration which they might have manifested to more advantage in other affairs confided to their judgment they engaged in vain disputes on the nature of god who as he withdraws himself from the proud curiosity of the learned so he veils the majesty of his existence as effectually from the great men of the earth it is an error to believe any human power can be absolute and insallible in these respects for such there never was nor ever will be imparted to any mortal the largest extent of temporal authority is confined to certain limitations and when the grand seignior ordains a new taxation at constantinople the universal murmurs of his subjects make him sensible of those restrictions of his power which till then were concealed from his observation a persian monarch may indeed compel a son to murder his father or oblige a parent to plunge his dagger into the heart of his child but he can never force his subjects to drink wine there is a general principle in every nation which is the invariable basis of power and when once this principle is too much loaded it infallibly shrinks into smaller dimensions     an unacquaintedness with the true nature and limits of ecclesiastical and secular power was the most pernicious source of all the calamities that befel the greeks and involved both priests and people in perpetual errors this great distinction which constitutes all the tranquillity of a nation is founded not only on religion but on reason and nature which never confound things really distinct in themselves and which can only subsist in consequence of that very distinction though the priesthood among the ancient romans did not form a separate body yet the distinction we have been representing was as well known to them as it can be to us clodius had consecrated the house of cicero to the goddess of liberty but when that great orator returned from his exile he did not fail to demand it as his lawful property the pontiffs were of opinion that if it had been so consecrated without an express order obtained from the people it might be restored to him without any violation of religion they have declared says cicero   that they only examined the validity of the consecration and not the law enacted by the people and that they had decided the first article as pontiffs and the second in the quality of senators chap xxiii the duration of the eastern empire accounted for its destruction after this account of the grecian empire it seems natural to enquire how it could possibly subsist so long and i believe sufficient reasons may be assigned for that duration     the arabians having invaded the empire and conquered several provinces their chiefs became competitors for the khalisat and the flame of their first zeal only burst out in civil dissensions the same people having conquered persia and afterwards divided and weakened themselves in that country the greeks were no longer obliged to keep the principal forces of the empire stationed on the banks of the euphrates callinicus an architect who came from syria to constantinople invented an artificial flame which was easily ventilated into a point by means of a tube and was of such a peculiar nature that water and every other substance which extinguish common fire did but increase the violence of this the greeks were in possession of it for several years and managed it in such a manner as made it capable of firing their enemies ships particularly the arabian fleet which sailed from africa or the syrian coasts to invade them even in constantinople this flame was ranked among the secrets of state and constantine porphyrogenitus in his treatise on the administration of the empire and which he dedicated to his son romanus advises him to tell the barbarians when they should desire him to give them any of the grecian fire that he was not permitted to part with it because an angel who presented it the emperor constantine commanded to refuse it to all other nations and that those who had disobeyed that injunction were consumed by a fire from heaven the moment they entered the church constantinople was the greatest and almost the only city of commerce in the world for the goths on the one side and the arabians on the other had ruined all manner of traffic and industry in every other part the silken manufactures were brought thither from persia and were even neglected in that country since the arabian invasion we may add to this that the     greeks were masters at sea which opened an immense flow of riches into the state and proved an inexhaustible source of relief in all its emergencies and if at any time there seemed to be any declension of the public affluence it was immediately recruited by a new accession we shall justify this observation by a remarkable instance the elder andronicus comnenus though he was the nero of the greeks yet amidst all his vices he was indefatigable in the suppression of injustice and vexations in the grandees and it is a known fact that during the three years of his reign he restored several provinces to their ancient splendor in fine the barbarians having once fixed their settlement on the banks of the danube were no longer so formidable to the empire as before but rather became useful to it as a barrier against other barbarous nations and thus whilst the empire was harassed by any bad government some particular incidents were always in reserve for its relief thus we see spain and portugal in a condition amidst all their weakness to support themselves with the treasures of the indies the temporal dominions of the pope owe their safety to the respect paid to their sovereign and the rovers of barbary derive their security from the obstructions they fasten upon the commerce of lesser  nations and the very piracies of these people on inferior states make them serviceable in their turn to the greater the turkish empire is at present in the same state of declension to which that of the greeks was formerly † sunk but in all probability it will still subsist a     long time for should any prince endanger it by pursuing his conquests to an immoderate extent it will always be desended by the three trading powers of europe who are too sensible of their own interests ever to be unconcerned spectators of its fall it is happy for these trading powers that god has permitted turks and spaniards to be in the world for of all nations they are the most proper to enjoy a great empire with insignificance in the time of basilius porphyrogenitus the arabian power came to its period in persia mohammed the son of sambreal who was then sovereign of that empire invited four thousand turks from the north in the quality of auxiliaries but upon a sudden dissatisfaction conceived by this prince he sent an army against them which was soon put to flight by the turks mohammed in the height of his indignation against his pusillanimous soldiers gave orders that they should pass before him habited like women but they disappointed his anger and joined the turks upon which the united army immediately dislodged a garrison which was stationed to guard a bridge over the araxes and opened a free passage to a vast body of their countrymen when they had extended their conquests through persia they spread themselves from east to west over the territories of the empire and romanus diogenes who endeavoured to oppose their progress became their prisoner after which they subdued all the asiatic dominions of the greeks down to the bosphorus some time after this event the latins invaded the western regions in the reign of alexis commenus an unhappy schism had for a long time infused an implacable hatred between the nations of two different communions and would have produced fatal effects much sooner had not the italians been more attentive to check the german emperors whom they feared than     they were to distress the greek emperors whom they only hated affairs were in this situation when all europe imbibed a religious belief that the place where jesus christ was born as well as that where he accomplished his passion being profaned by the infidels the surest atonement they could make for their own sins would be to dispossess those barbarians of their acquisitions by force of arms europe at that time swarmed with people who were fond of war and had many crimes to expiate and as it was proposed to them to obtain their remission by indulging their prevailing passion every man armed himself for the crusade when this consecrated army arrived in the east they besieged and made themselves masters of nice which they restored to the greeks and whilst the infidels were seized with a general consternation alexis and john commenus chaced the turks to the banks of euphrates but as advantageous as these crusades might be to the greeks the emperors trembled to see such a succession of fierce heroes and formidable armies marching through the heart of their dominions this induced them to leave nothing unattempted that might create a dissatisfaction in europe at these expeditions and the votaries to the cross were continually ensnared by every instance of treachery that could possibly be expected from a timorous enemy it must be acknowledged that the french who promoted these expeditions had not practised any conduct that could render their presence very supportable and we may judge by the invectives of anna comnena against our nation that we act without much precaution in foreign countries and were at that time chargeable with the same exceptionable freedoms we are reproached for at this day a french nobleman was going to seat himself upon the emperors throne but earl baldwin caught him by     the arm you ought to know said he that when we are in any country whatever it is proper to comply with the customs that prevail there what a clown is he replied the other to sit whilst so many captains are standing the germans who came after the french and were the most civil and undesigning people in the world   suffered very severely for our follies and were continually embarassed with a set of dispositions that had been sufficiently irritated by our countrymen against all foreigners in fine the aversion of those eastern people was worked up to the highest extreme and this with some incivilities offered to the venetian merchants operating upon the ambition avarice and false zeal of that nation as well as the french determined them to form a crusade against the greeks the united army of these two european nations found their enemies altogether as pusillanimous and unwarlike as the chinese appeared to the tartars in our time the frenchmen ridiculed their effeminate habit †  and walked through the streets of constantinople dressed in flowered mantles and carrying pens and paper in their hands in derision of that nation who had degenerated from all military discipline and when the war was over they refused to admit any greeks into their troops the venetians and french soon after declared for the western empire and transferred the imperial throne to the earl of flanders whose dominions being very distant could not create any jealousy in the italians the greeks still supported themselves in the east being separated from the turks by a chain of mountains and divided from the italians by the sea     the latins who found no obstacles in their conquests met with many in their settlement the greeks returned from asia into europe retook constantinople and seized the greatest part of the east this new empire however was but a feint shadow of the former and had no solid power for its basis it comprehended few territories in asia besides the provinces on this side the meander and sangar and most of those in europe were parcelled out into small sovereignties we may add to this that during the sixty years the latins were possessed of constantinople the conquered people being dispersed and the victors engaged in war all commerce was transferred to the cities in italy and constantinople became divested of its riches the commerce even of the inland countries was carried on by the latins the greeks   who were but newly reestablished and were likewise alarmed with innumerable apprehensions became desirous to ingratiate themselves with the genoese by granting them a permission to traffic without paying any duties and as they were unwilling to irritate the venetians who had not accepted of peace but only consented to a truce these were likewise discharged from the same payments though manuel comnenus had suffered the navigation of the empire to decline before constantinople was taken yet it could be easily reestablished since commerce still subsisted but when all maritime affairs became entirely neglected under the new empire the mischief grew remediless because the power of the empire was daily declining this state which extended its dominion over many islands and was intersected by the sea which likewise surrounded several of its territories was entirely unprovided of ships the former communication no longer   0 subsisted between the provinces the inhabitants  were obliged to shelter themselves in the inland parts from pirates and when they thought themselves safe in such a sanctuary they soon found it necessary to retire into the fortresses to preserve themselves from the hostilities of the turks these barbarous people were at that time engaged in a peculiar war against the greeks and might properly be called hunters of men they sometimes marched two hundred leagues into a country to accomplish their depredations and as they were in subjection to several sultans †  it was impossible to purchase a peace from every tribe and to procure it from any particular parties was altogether insignificant these barbarians had embraced mohammedism and their zeal for that religion strangely prompted them to ravage the christian territories besides as they were the most unamiable people on earth ‡  and married to wives as disagreeable as themselves the moment they were acquainted with the grecian women all the rest of that sex became insupportable to them and those beauteous females were continually exposed to the brutal passion of these barbarians ∥  in fine they had been always accustomed to invade the properties of     other people and were the same huns who had formerly involved the roman empire in so many calamities the turks broke in like a deluge upon the shattered remains of the grecian empire in asia and those of the inhabitants who were happy enough to escape their fury fled before them to the bosphorus from whence such as could accommodate themselves with ships sailed to those parts of the empire that were situated in europe which occasioned a considerable addition to the number of the inhabitants though they were diminished in a short period of time for civil wars began to rage with so much fatality that the two factions invited several turkish sultans to their assistance   with this extravagant and inhuman stipulation that all the people of the country who were made captives from the opposite party should be carried into slavery by which means each of those factions concurred in the destructions of their own country with a view of ruining their adversaries bajazet having conquered all the other sultans the turks would then have acted agreeably to their future behaviour in the reign of mahommed ii had not they been in danger of extermination by the tartars i am now afraid to describe the miseries which resulted from these revolutions and shall only intimate that the empire under its last monarchs being contracted within the suburbs of constantinople finished its progress like the rhine which shrinks into a rivulet before it loses itself in the ocean         a dialogue between sylla and eucrates some days after sylla had resigned the dictatorship i was told the reputation i had among the philosophers made him desirous of seeing me he was at his house on the tiber enjoying the first peaceful moments he had ever known on coming before him i felt nothing of that confusion which the presence of great men generally occasions in us and when we were alone syila said i to him you have then voluntarily reduced yourself to that middle condition of life which to most men is an affliction you have resigned that command which your glory and your virtues gave you over all men fortune seems to be vexed that she could not raise you to higher honours eucrates said he if the eyes of the whole universe are no longer fixed on me it is the fault of human things which have their prescribed limits and not owing to me i imagined i had fulfilled my destiny when i no longer had great things to achieve i was not made for governing in quiet an enslaved people i love to obtain victories to found or overturn states make alliances punish usurpers but as to the little subordinate branches of government wherein middling geniuses shew themselves to so much advantage the slow execution of the laws the discipline of a tame militia my soul could not employ itself in them     it is very singular said i that you should have mixed so much delicacy with your ambition we have seen many great men unaffected with the vain pomp and splendor which wait on rulers but there have been very few insensible of the pleasure of governing and of having that respect which is due only to the laws paid to their humour and i eucrates was never less satisfied than when i saw myself absolute master in rome when i looked round me and found neither rival nor enemy i thought it would be one day said that i had only chastised slaves would you said i to myself have no more men in your country capable of being affected with your glory and since you establish despotism do not you clearly see that no prince can come after you so cowardly and despicable whom flattery will not equal to you and adorn with your name your titles and even your virtues my lord you have quite changed the idea i had formed of your conduct i thought you had ambition but not a love of glory i saw very well that you had a high spirit but i did not suspect that you had a great soul your whole life seemed to discover you to be one preyed on by lust of power and who full of the most destructive passions chearfully loaded himself with the shame the remorse and even the meanness attached to despotism for after all you sacrificed every thing to your power you were feared by all the romans you discharged without pity the functions of the most terrible magistracy that ever subsisted the senate looked with dread on a defender so relentless some one said to you sylla how much roman blood will you shed do you want to command bare walls you then published those tables by which the life and death of every citizen were determined and it is the shedding so much blood that has enabled me to do the greatest action of my whole life had i ruled the romans with gentleness what wonder     that weariness disgust or caprice should make me resign the government but i laid down the dictatorship at a time when every one thought i entirely owed my safety to my being invested with it i appeared before the romans a citizen in the midst of my citizens and had the boldness to say to them i am ready to give account of all the blood which i have shed for the republic i will answer all who shall come to demand of me their fathers their sons or their brothers every roman was silent before me this great action which you speak of appears to me very imprudent the astonishment indeed into which you had just thrown the romans was of service to you but how could you dare to talk of vindicating yourself and taking for judges persons who had so much to revenge on you supposing your actions had been only severities while you were in power they became frightful crimes the moment you were out of power do you call crimes said he what saved the republic would you have had me quietly see senators betray the senate for that people who imagining that liberty ought to be as extreme as slavery can be wanted to abolish all authority the people kept under by the laws and the weight of the senate have always endeavoured to overturn both but he who is so ambitious as to serve them against the senate and the laws has always ambition enough to become their master it is thus we have seen an end put to so many republics of greece and italy to prevent a like evil the senate hath always been obliged to employ this untractable people in war it has been forced against its inclination to ravage the earth and reduce so many nations whose subjection is a burden to us at present when the universe can furnish no more enemies against us what would be the fate of the republic and without me would the senate have been able to prevent the people in their     blind fury for liberty from delivering themselves up to marius or to the first tyrant who should have given them hopes of independence the gods who have given to most men a cowardly ambition have attached to liberty almost as many evils as to slavery but whatever may be the price of this noble liberty the gods must be paid it the sea swallows up vessels and lays under water whole countries yet it is useful to man posterity will decide of what rome has not as yet ventured to examine it will find perhaps that i have not shed blood enough and that all the partizans of marius have not been proscribed i must own sylla you astonish me how was it to serve your country that you spilled so much blood and had you no attachment but to her eucrates said he to me i had never that predominant love for my country of which we find so many examples in the first ages of the republic and i love coriolanus who carried fire and sword to the very walls of his ungrateful city and made every citizen repent the affront which every citizen had given him as much as i do him who drove the gauls from the capitol i never piqued myself on being the slave or the worshipper of a society of my equals and this so much boasted love is a passion too popular for such a high spirit as mine all my actions proceeded from reflexion and principally from the contempt which i entertained for men you may judge by the manner in which i treated the only great people in the world how high my contempt was of all others i thought that while i was on the earth i ought to be free had i been born among barbarians i should have sought to usurp the throne less to obtain command than to avoid obedience born in a republic i have acquired the glory of a conqueror in seeking only that of a free man     when i entered rome with my troops i breathed neither rage nor revenge i passed sentence without hatred but also without pity on astonished romans you were free said i and you want to live slaves no die and you will have the advantage of dying citizens of a free city to deprive of its liberty a city of which i was a citizen i looked on as the greatest of crimes i punished that crime and was little concerned whether i should be the good or the evil genius of the republic however the government of our ancestors has been reestablished the people have expiated all the indignities they put on the nobles fear has suspended animosities and rome never enjoyed such perfect tranquility this it was which determined me to all the bloody tragedies you have seen had i lived in those happy days of the republic when the citizens quiet in their houses presented to the gods a free soul you would have seen me pass my whole life in this retreat which has cost me so much blood and toil my lord said i to him it is well for mankind that heaven has been sparing in the number of such men as you born for a middling station we are overpowered by sublime geniuses one mans being raised above humanity costs all the rest too dear you looked on the ambition of heroes as a common passion and made no account of any but a reasoning ambition the insatiable desire of ruling which you found in the hearts of some citizens made you resolve to be an extraordinary man love of liberty determined you to be terrible and cruel who would have thought that a heroism founded on principle would be more destructive than a heroism founded on fury and impetuosity the roman people you say beheld you unarmed and made no attempt on your life you have escaped one danger a greater may await you a grand offender may one day take advantage     of your moderation and confound you in the crowd of a subjected people i have acquired a name said he which suffices for my safety and the safety of the roman people that name prevents all attempts there is no ambition which does not stand in awe of it sylla lives and his genius is more powerful than that of all the romans sylla is surrounded by chæronea orchomenus and signion sylla hath given every family in rome a terrible example within itself every roman will have me always before him and even in his sleep i shall appear to him covered with blood he will imagine he sees the fatal tables and reads his name at the head of the proscribed my laws are murmured at in secret they can never be effaced but by floods of roman blood am not i in the midst of rome you will still find with me the javelin i had at orchomenus and the buckler i wore on the walls of athens because i have no lictors am i the less sylla i have the senate justice and the laws for me my genius fortune and glory are for the senate i own said i that when a person has once made any one tremble he almost always retains something of the advantage he had over him undoubtedly said he i struck men with astonishment and that was a great deal review in your mind the story of my life you will see that i have drawn all from that principle and that it has been the soul of all my actions call to mind my quarrel with marius i was stung with indignation to see a man of no name proud of the meanness of his birth attempt to pull down the first families in rome and confound them with plebeians and at this time i bore all the weight of a great soul i was young and i resolved to put myself in a condition to call marius to account for his insults for this end i fought him with his own weapons that is to say by victories over the enemies of the republic     when i was forced by the caprice of chance to leave rome i pursued the same plan i went to make war on mithridates and laboured to destroy marius by vanquishing the enemy of marius while i left that roman to enjoy his power over the populace i multiplied his mortifications and forced him to go every day to the capitol to return thanks to the gods for successes which drove him to destraction i waged a war of reputation against him a hundred times more cruel than what my legions made on the barbarian king every word i spoke shewed my daringness and my most inconsiderable actions always full of haughtiness were fatal presages for marius at last mithridates sued for peace the terms were reasonable and had rome been in quiet and my fortune not still wavering i would have accepted them but the bad state of my affairs obliged me to make the terms still harder i demanded that he should destroy the fleet and restore to the kings his neighbours the territories he had taken from them i leave to you said i the kingdom of your ancestors to you who ought to thank me that i leave you the hand with which you signed an order for the execution of  00000 romans in one day mithridates was struck motionless and marius trembled in the midst of rome this boldness which was of such service to me against mithridates against marius against his son against thelisinus against the people which supported my dictatorship also protected my life the day i resigned the dictatorship and that day insures my liberty for ever my lord said i marius reasoned in the same manner when covered with the blood of his enemies and of the romans he gave proofs of that boldness which you have punished you have it is true a few more victories and greater excesses on your side but in assuming the dictatorship you set an example of the crime which you punished this is the example which   0 will be followed and not that of your moderation which will only be admitted when the gods suffered sylla with impunity to make himself dictator at rome they proscribed liberty from it for ever they must work too many miracles now to root out of the heart of every roman leader the ambition of reigning you have taught them that there is a much surer way to arrive at despotism and to maintain it without danger you have divulged the fatal secret and removed what alone makes good citizens in a republic too rich and too great to despair of being able to oppress it he changed colour and was silent for a moment i am only afraid said he with emotion of one man in whom i think i see many mariuss chance or perhaps a more powerful destiny made me spare him my eyes are ever on him i study his soul where he hides deep purposes but if he dares to form the design of commanding men whom i have made my equals i swear by the gods i will punish his insolence     persian letters by m de montesquieu         preliminary reflections on the persian letters by m de montesquieu prefixed to the quarto edition there is nothing in the persian letters that has given readers so general a satisfaction as to find in them a sort of romance without having expected it it is easy to discern in them the beginning the progress and the conclusion of it the several different persons introduced are connected together by a sort of a chain the longer they reside in europe the less marvellous and extraordinary the manners of that part of the world begin to appear to them and they are more or less struck with the marvellous and extraordinary according to their different characters add to this that the asiatic seraglio grows disorderly in proportion to the time of usbeks absence that is to say according as phrenzy increases in it and love abates there is another reason why these romances generally speaking succeed and that is because the persons introduced give themselves an account of what happens to them which causes the passions to be felt more sensibly than any narrative made by another could do this is likewise one of the causes of the success of some admirable works which have appeared since the persian letters to conclude in common romances digressions can never be admitted except when they themselves constitute another romance reasoning cannot be intermixed with the story because the personages not being brought together to reason that would be repugnant to the design and nature of the work but in the form of letters wherein personages are introduced at random and the subjects treated of do not     depend upon any design or plan already formed the author has the advantage of being able to blend philosophy politics and morality with romance and to connect the whole by a secret and as it were undiscoverable chain so great a call was there for the persian letters upon their first publication that the booksellers exerted their utmost efforts to procure continuations of them they pulled every author they met by the sleeve and said sir i must beg the favour of you to write me a collection of persian letters but what has been said is sufficient to convince the reader that they do not admit of a continuation and still less of a mixture with letters wrote by another hand how ingenious soever there are in them some strokes which many have looked upon as too bold but these are requested to take the nature of the work into consideration the persians who were to play so considerable a part in it were all on a sudden transplanted to europe that is removed to another world as it were at a certain time therefore it was necessary to represent them as full of ignorance and prejudices the authors chief design was to display the formation and progress of their ideas their first thoughts could not but have a dash of singularity in them it was apprehended that there is nothing to be done but to give them that sort of singularity which is not incompatible with understanding it was only to represent their situation of mind at seeing any thing that appeared extraordinary to them the author far from having a design to strike at any principle of our religion thought himself even free from the imputation of indiscretion these strokes appear always connected with a manifestation of surprize or astonishment and not with the idea of inquiry much less with that of criticism in speaking of our religion these persians should not appear better informed than when they talk of our manners and customs and if they sometimes seem     to look upon the tenets of our religion as singular the singularity they discover in them fully shews their ignorance of their connection with the other truths thereof the author justifies himself in this manner as well on account of his attachment to these important truths as through respect for the human species which he certainly could not have had an intention to wound in the tenderest part the reader is therefore requested not to cease one moment to consider these strokes as the effects of surprize in persons who ought to be surprized or as the paradoxes of men who spoke of what they did not understand he is likewise requested to consider that the whole beauty of the invention consisted in the constant contrast between the real state of things and the singular or whimsical manner in which they were contemplated certain it is that the nature and design of the persian letters are so apparent and obvious that none can mistake them but such as have a mind to impose upon themselves     introduction to the first french edition i shall neither write a dedicatory epistle nor solicit protection for this work if it is good it will be read if bad i am not anxious that it should be read by any i have adventured the first of these letters to try the public taste i have a great number more which i may hereafter give but this depends upon my not being known for from the moment that happens i am silent i know a lady who walks very well but limps if observed there are faults enough in the work for the critics without subjecting myself to them if i was known it would be said his book is his true character he might have engaged himself to a better purpose it is unworthy of a grave man the critics are never deficient in these kinds of reflections because little wit is necessary to make them the persians who wrote these letters lodged with me and we passed our time together as they regarded me as one of another world they hid nothing from me in fact persons removed to such a considerable distance could have no secrets they communicated to me the most of their letters which i copied others i took which they were desirous not to entrust me with as they exposed the jealousy and vanity of the persian i am no more than a translator my whole care has been to suit this work to our manners i have relieved the reader as much as i could from the asiatic stile and have exonerated him from the trouble of an infinite number of sublime and elevated expressions but this is not all the service i have rendered him i have retrenched those long compliments of which the orientals are not less profuse than ourselves and have passed over a great     many particulars too trifling to be made public and which ought only to live from friend to friend if this had been observed by most of those who have published epistolary collections many of their works would have disappeared there is one circumstance which has often excited my admiration that these persians were frequently as well instructed as myself in the manners and customs of our nation even to a knowledge of the most minute particulars taking notice of some things which i am sure have escaped many of the germans who have visited france this i attribute to the long stay they made here without considering that it is less difficult to an asiatic to inform himself of the manners of the french in one year than it would be to a frenchman to acquire a knowledge of those of asia in four years because the one are as open as the other are reserved translators have been indulged by custom even the most barbarous commentators to decorate the head of their version or glossary with a panegyric on the original and to expatiate on the usefulness merit and excellency of it but this i have not done the reasons are obvious one of the best is that it would be tedious in a part of a work already too much so i would say in a preface          0   0  usbëk      tauris rustan letter i usbëk to his friend rustan at ispahan at com we remained only one day when having paid our devotions

surrounds me if i were allowed to chuse from among all men who live in this capital of nations usbek i swear to thee i should chuse none but thee think not that thy absence has made me neglect a beauty dear to thee though i must not be seen by any person and though the ornaments with which i deck myself do not contribute to thy happiness yet i endeavour to amuse myself by a habit of pleasing i never go to rest till i am perfumed with the most agreeable essences i recal to my mind the happy time when you came to my arms a flattering dream deceives me shews me the dear object of my love my imagination loses itself in its desires as it flatters itself in its hopes i sometimes think that disgusted at a toilsome journey thou wilt return to us the night wears away in these kind of dreams which are not verified either waking or asleep i seek for thee at my side and it seems to me that thou fliest from me at length the fire itself which burns me disperses these delusions and recals my spirits i then find myself reanimated—thou wilt not believe it usbek it is impossible to live in this condition the fire burns in my veins why cannot i express to thee what i so sensibly feel and how can i so sensibly feel what i cannot express in these moments usbek i would give the empire of the world for one of thy kisses how unhappy is the woman who has such strong desires when she is deprived of him who only can satisfy them who left to herself has nothing that can divert her she must live in a course of sighs and in the fury of an irritated passion who far from being happy has not the privilege of promoting the felicity of another an useless ornament of a seraglio kept for the honour and not the happiness of her husband you men are very cruel you are delighted that we have passions which we     cannot gratify yet you treat us as if we were insensible and would be sorry if we were so you think that our desires though a long time mortified will be quickened at the sight of you it is very difficult to make ones self be beloved it is the best way to obtain by doubting of our understanding what you dare not expect from your own merit farewel my dear usbek farewel be assured that

would make a noise but it gives me no trouble what wouldest thou have me follow what my enemies think prudent or what i myself think to be so i appeared at court when i was very young i may say my heart was not at all corrupted there i formed to myself a vast design i dared to be virtuous there when i knew vice i kept at a distance from it but i afterwards approached it to pluck off its mask i carried truth to the foot of the throne i spoke a language till then unknown i disconcerted flattery and astonished at the same time the worshippers and the idol but when i saw my sincerity had created me enemies that i had attracted the jealousy of the ministers without obtaining the favour of the prince i resolved to retire since my feeble virtue could no longer support me in a corrupt court i feigned to be strongly attached to the sciences and in consequence of that pretence became really so     i no longer engaged myself in any affairs but retired to a house in the country but even this retreat had its inconveniences i was continually exposed to the malice of my enemies and was almost deprived of the means of safety some secret advice disposed me to think more seriously of myself i resolved to banish myself from my country and my retreat from court provided me with a plausible pretence i waited on the king and acquainted him with my desire to inform myself of the sciences in the west i insinuated to him that he might be benefited by my travels i found favour with him i departed and stole a victim from my enemies see rustan the true motive of my travelling let ispahan talk defend me only to those who love me leave with my enemies their malicious interpretations i should be happy if that were the only hurt that they could do to me they talk of me at present probably i shall be too much forgotten hereafter and my friends—no rustan i will not resign myself to these melancholy suspicions i shall always be dear to them i reckon upon their fidelity as on

provinces and kingdoms no chagrin affects thee each moment presents thee with fresh objects every thing thou seest amuses thee and makes thee pass away thy time imperceptibly it is otherwise with me who am shut up in a horrible confinement surrounded continually by the same objects and perplexed with the same cares i groan beneath the burden of fifty years of cares and pains and through the     period of a long life i cannot say i have seen a days case or a moments quiet when my first master formed the cruel design of confining me to the care of his wives and induced me by promises inforced by a thousand threats to part with myself for ever tired of being employed in a most toilsome service i reckoned upon sacrificing my passions to ease and plenty unhappy that i was my mind was prepossessed with the evils i should escape but not with the loss i should sustain i expected that an incapacity to gratify the attacks of love would secure me from it alas the gratification of the passions is extinguished but the foundation of them remained and far from being freed from them i found myself encompassed by objects which continually excited them i entered the seraglio where every thing filled me with regret for what i had lost i felt myself provoked to love each instant a thousand natural beauties seemed to shew themselves to my view only to torment me and to complete my misfortune i had always before me the happy master of these beauties during this unhappy time i never led a woman to my masters bed i never undressd one but i returned back enraged in my heart at myself and my soul filled with a horrible despair see how miserably i passed my youth i had no confident but myself loaded with grief and care i must needs be destroyed and those women whom i was tempted to regard with the most tender looks i could only behold with the most stern attention i was ruined had they penetrated my thoughts what advantages would they not have taken i remember once as i put a lady into a bath i felt myself so ravished that i entirely lost my reason and ventured to clap my hand upon a most formidable part on the first reflection i thought that day would be my last i was so happy however to escape the thousand deaths i feared but the beauty whom i had made witness of my weakness made me buy her silence very dear i lost entirely my power over her and she   0 forced me from that time to compliances which a thousand times exposed me to hazard the loss of my life at length the fire of youth is extinguished i am old and i find myself with respect to these things in an easy condition i regard women with indifference and i reward them well for their contempt and all the torments which they made me feel i always remember that i was born to govern them and it seems to me as if i recovered my manhood on every occasion that i have yet to command them since i can behold them with coldness and my reason permits me to see all their foibles i hate them though it is for another i watch them the pleasure of being obeyed affords me a secret joy and it is as if i did it for myself and it always gives me an indirect happiness when i can deprive them of their pleasures i am in the seraglio as in a little empire and my ambition my only remaining passion receives some satisfaction i see with pleasure that all depends upon me and that i am necessary on every occasion i charge myself willingly with the hatred of all these women which establishes me the more firmly in my post so they do not find me in any affair an ungrateful man i always prevent them in their most innocent pleasures i ever present myself to them as a fixed barrier they form schemes and i suddenly frustrate them i am armed with refusals full of scruples i never open my mouth but with lectures of duty virtue chastity and modesty by continually talking to them of the weakness of their sex and of the authority of my master i drive them to despair afterwards i complain of the necessity i am under to be thus severe and seem as if i would have them suppose their proper interest and a strong attachment to them to be my only motives not but that in my turn i suffer a number of disagreeable things from these vindictive women who daily endeavour to repay me the evils i heap on them there is between us a kind of interchange of empire and obedience they     are always imposing upon me the most humiliating offices they affect an exemplary contempt and regardless of my age make me rise ten times in a night on the most trifling occasion i am continually tired with orders commands employments and caprices it looks as if they alternately relieved each other to weary me with a succession of whimsies they take a pleasure sometimes in making me redouble my attention they pretend to make me their consident at one time they run to tell me that a young man is seen about the walls another time that a noise is heard or a letter delivered and delight themselves with laughing at the trouble and torment these things give me sometimes they fix me behind a door and make me continue there night and day they well know how to feign sickness swoonings or frights and never want a pretence to gain their will of me on these occasions i am forced to yield an implicit obedience and boundless complaisance for a refusal from such a man as i would be an unheard of thing and if i were to hesitate about obeying them they would take a right to correct me i would much rather my dear ibbi lose life than to submit to such a mortifying state but this is not the whole my masters favour is not sure to me for a moment i have too many enemies in his heart who are all watching to ruin me they enjoy certain seasons when i cannot be heard seasons in which he can refuse them nothing times in which i am ever in the wrong i conduct women enraged to my masters bed can you imagine they will serve me or that my interest will be the strongest from their tears their sighs their embraces and from their very pleasures i have every thing to fear it is then they triumph and that their charms become terrible to me their present services in an instant efface all my past ones and to a master no longer himself by me nothing can be answered how frequently has it happened to me to sleep in favour and a wake to disgrace the day i was     so disgracefully whipt round the seraglio what had i done i had left in my masters arms a woman who when she saw he was inflamed burst into a flood of tears she lamented and so successfully managed her complaints that they arose with the love she excited in him in so critical a moment how was i able to support myself i was ruined when i least expected i was the victim of an amorous intrigue and a treaty made by fighs see dear ibbi the

have here many disputations which turn commonly on morality the question yesterday was whether the happiness of mankind consists in pleasure and sensual gratifications or in the exercise of virtue i have frequently heard you maintain that virtue is the end for which we were born and that justice is a quality as necessary to us as existence explain to me pray what you mean by this i have conversed

need to use very abstracted reasons to sulfil the task which thou hast prescribed to me there are some certain truths of which it is not sufficient to be persuaded but men must be made even to feel them moral truths are of this kind probably this historical piece may affect thee more than a philosophical subtlety in arabia there were a few people named troglodites descendants of the ancient troglodites who if we can believe our historians resembled beasts rather than men they were not so deformed they were not hairy like bears they did not hiss they had two eyes yet they were so wicked and brutish that they were strangers to the principles of justice and equity a foreign king who reigned over them willing to correct their natural wickedness treated them with severity but they conspired against him murdered him and exterminated all the royal family having struck this blow they met to chuse a government and after much dissention appointed magistrates but they were scarcely elected when they became intolerable and were massacred the people freed from this new yoke consulted only their own savageness every one agreed to     submit to no person that each should follow his own interest without any attention to that of others this general resolution was extremely pleasing to all—they reasoned thus why should i destroy myself in labouring for those who do not concern me i will take care for myself only i shall live happily what is it to me how others live i shall provide for my own wants and if they are satisfied what care i if all the rest of the troglodites are miserable—this was seedtime each man said i will only manure as much land as will supply corn sufficient for myself a greater quantity would be useless to me i shall not take the trouble to work in vain the lands of this little kingdom were not all alike some parts were dry and mountainous others in the low grounds were well watered by rivulets this year there was a great drought insomuch that the upper grounds failed greatly whist those which were watered proved very fertile the consequence was that almost all the people who lived in the mountains perished by famine through the hardheartedness of those who refused to share their harvest with them the following year was very rainy the higher grounds proved extraordinary fruitful whilst the lower grounds were drowned now the other half of the people complained of famine but these miserable people found the mountaineers as hardhearted as they themselves had been one of the chief inhabitants had a very handsome wise of whom his neighbour became in love and forced her from him this occasioned a strong contest and after many blows and outrages they consented to submit the decision to a troglodite who whilst the republic subsisted had been in some esteem they came to him and were going to plead their cause before him—what does it concern me said the umpire whose wife she is yours or yours i have my land to till i cannot spend my time in determining your quarrels not busy myself in your affairs to the neglect of my own pray let me be quiet     and do not trouble me with your disputes—having so said he left them and went to work on his land the ravisher who was the stronger man swore he would sooner die than restore the woman whilst the husband penetrated with the injustice of his neighbour and the hardness of his judge returned home in despair when meeting in his way a handsome young woman returning from a fountain and having now no wife of his own being pleased with her and much more so when he learned she was the wife of him whom he had chosen for his judge and who had been so little sensible of his affliction he seized on her and forced her to go to his house there was another man who possessed a fruitful field which he had cultivated wich great labour two of his neighbours united together forced him out of his house and took possession of his field they formed a compact to defend themselves against all those who should endeavour to take it from them and did really support themselves several months but one of them tired of sharing what he might possess alone murdered the other and became sole master of the field his reign was not long two other troglodites attacked him and he was massacred being too weak to defend himself another troglodite who was almost naked asked the price of some cloth which he saw and wanted to buy the draper reasoned thus with himself i indeed ought not to expect more money for my cloth than will buy two measures of wheat but i will sell it for four times that advantage that i may purchase eight measures—the man must needs have the cloth and pay the price demanded i am very well contented said the draper i now shall have some wheat what is it you say replied the buyer do you want wheat i have some to sell however the price perhaps may surprise you for you know wheat is extremely dear and that the famine is extended almost every where but return me my money and you shall have a measure of wheat     and though you should perish by the famine you should not have it otherwise in the mean time the country was ravaged by a mortal distemper a skilful physician arrived from a neighbouring country who administered his medicines so properly that he cured all who put themselves under his care when the distemper ceased he went to those whom he had cured to demand his pay but refusals were all he received he returned to his own country tired with the fatigue of so long a journey but a short time after he heard that the same distemper had returned again and more grievously afflicted those ungrateful people they did not now wait for his coming but went to him themselves unjust men said he go you have in your souls a more deadly poison than that of which you desire to be cured you are unworthy to enjoy a place upon earth for you are void of humanity and the laws of equity are unknown to you i should think it an offence against the gods who punish you should i oppose their just anger erzeron the  d of the moon of the  d gemmadi      ushek      erzeron ispahan letter xii ushek to the same at ispahan thou hast seen my dear mirza how the troglodites were destroyed by their own wickedness and fell the victims of their own injustice of so many families two only remained who escaped the miseries of this people there were in this country two very extraordinary men they possessed humanity were acquainted with justice and loved virtue they were as much united by the uprightness of their hearts as by the corruption of those of others they saw the general desolation and only shewed their sense of it by     their pity this was a new motive to union a common solicitude and a common interest engaged their labours there was no difference between them but what owed its birth to a sweet and tender friendship in a retired part of the country separate from their unworthy countrymen they led a life of peace and happiness cultivated by their virtuous hands the earth seemed to yield its fruits spontaneously they loved their wives and were affectionately beloved by them the training up their children to virtue engaged their utmost care they continually represented to them the miseries of their countrymen and placed their melancholy example before their eyes they especially inculcated upon their minds that the interest of individuals was always to be found in that of the community and that to attempt to seek it separately was to destroy it that virtue is by no means a thing that ought to be burdensome to us nor the practice of it considered as painful that doing justice to others is acting charitably to ourselves they soon enjoyed the consolation of virtuous parents which consists in having children like themselves these young people who grew up under their care were increased by happy marriages and their number augmented the same union continued and virtue far from being weakened by the multitude was on the contrary strengthened by a greater number of examples who is able to represent the happiness of the troglodites at this period a people so just could not but be dear to the gods they learned to reverence them as soon as they had a knowledge of them and religion improved their morals and softened their natural roughness in honour of the gods they instituted feasts the young women dressed with flowers and the youths danced to the sound of rural music then followed banquets which were not less joyful than frugal in these assemblies pure nature spoke it was here they learned to give and receive hearts it was here     that virgin modesty blushing consessed its alarms but its wishes were soon established by the consent of fathers and here affectionate mothers delighted themselves with the foresight of a loving and faithful union they went to the temple to ask the favour of the gods it was not for riches or a burdensome superfluity such kind of wishes were unworthy to be desired by the happy troglodites except only for their fellowcountrymen they only bowed before the altars to pray for the health of their parents the unity of their brethren the affection of their wives and the love and obedience of their children maidens came thither to offer up the tender sacrifice of their hearts and that they might make a troglodite happy was the only favour they asked when the flocks at evening left the fields and the weary oxen returned home with the plough then these happy people met together and during a frugal repast sang the crimes of the first troglodites and their punishment and the revival of virtue with a new race they also sang the power of the gods their favour ever present to those who worship them and their inevitable displeasure at those who fear them not they afterwards described the pleasures of a rural life and the happiness with which innocence is always adorned they soon after resigned themselves to a repose never interrupted by any cares or uneasiness nature equally provided for their cares and their pleasures in this happy country covetousness was unknown they made presents to each other and the donor always supposed he had the advantage the troglodites ever considered themselves as one family their flocks were mingled together and the only trouble they excused themselves was that of separating them erzeron the   th of the moon of the second gemmadi          usbek      erzeron ispahan letter xiii usbek to the same the virtue of the troglodites is what i cannot speak to thee enough of one of them once said my father tomorrow should labour in the field i will rise two hours before him and when he comes into the field he shall find all his work done—another said to himself my sister seems to like a young troglodite a relation of ours i must speak to my father that he may terminate it by a marriage—another being told that some robbers had carried off his herd i am very sorry said he for there was a white heiffer which i intended to have offered up to the gods—another was once heard saying i must go to the temple to return the gods thanks that my brother who is so greatly beloved by my father and who is so dear to me has recovered his health—or else adjoining to a field of my fathers there is another and those who work in it are continually exposed to the heat of the sun i must plant some trees there that those poor men may sometimes rest themselves under the shadow of them—one time several troglodites being together an elderly man reproached a younger whom he suspected of having committed a base action we do not think he has done such an action said the others but if he has may his death happen the last of his family—a troglodite being informed that some stranger had pillaged and carried every thing off replied i could wish the gods would give them a longer use of them than i have had were they not unjust men—such great prosperity was not regarded without envy the neighbouring people gathered together and under a frivolous pretence determined to take away their flocks as soon as this resolution was known the troglodites sent ambassadors to them who addressed   0 them to this purpose what have the troglodites done to you have they taken away your wives stolen your cattle or ravaged your country no we are just and fear the gods what then do you demand of us would you have wool to make you clothes would you have the milk of our flocks or the fruits of our lands lay down your arms come among us and we will give you all these but we swear by that which is most sacred that if you enter our lands as enemies we will treat you as wild beasts—this address was treated with contempt and the savage people entered armed into the country of the troglodites who they supposed had no other defence besides their innocence but they were well prepared for a defence they had placed their wives and children in the midst of them and were surprised at the injustice but not dismayed at the numbers of their enemies their hearts were seized with a fresh ardour one would lose his life for his father another for his wife and children this for his brethren and that for his friends and all of them for their country the place of him who was killed was instantly taken by another who besides the common cause had also a private death to revenge such was the combat between injustice and virtue these base people who sought nothing but the spoil were not ashamed to fly and submit to the virtue of the troglodites and even without being touched with a sense of it erzeron the  th of the moon of the  d gemmadi      usbek      erzeron ispahan letter xiv usbek to the same as these people the troglodites every day grew more numerous they thought it necessary to elect a king they determined to offer the crown to him     who was the most just and cast their eyes on one venerable for his age and a long course of virtue but he would not attend the assembly and retired to his own house with a heart oppressed with grief they then sent deputies to him to acquaint him of the choice they had made of him the gods forbid said he that i should so wrong the troglodites as that they should believe that there is not a more just person among them than myself you offer me the crown and if you will absolutely have it to be so i must accept it but be assured i shall die of grief at having seen the troglodites born free now to see them become subject—at these words he lamented with a torrent of tears miserable day said he why have i lived so long then cried he in a severer accent i very well perceive what is the cause o ye troglodites your virtue begins to be too heavy for you in the state you are without a head you are constrained to be virtuous in spite of yourselves or you cannot subsist but must sink into the miseries of your ancestors but this seems too hard a yoke for you you like better to be subject to a king and to obey his laws less rigid than your morals you know that then you may gratify your ambition gain riches and languish in slothful luxury and provided you avoid falling into great crimes you will have no want of virtue he ceased a little and his tears flowed more than ever—and what do you expect me to do how can it be that i should command a troglodite any thing would you have him act virtuously because i command him which he would do wholly of himself without me and purely from a natural inclination oh troglodites i am at the end of my days my blood is frozen in my veins i shall soon go to revisit your holy ancestors why would you have me afflict

forbidden to touch a corpse and why for the purification of our souls are we commanded continually to wash our bodies these things appear to me to be in themselves neither pure nor impure for that they should be rendered such by any inherent quality in them i cannot conceive dirt appears filthy to us only because it is offensive to our sight or to some other of our senses yet in itself it is no more so than gold or diamonds the idea of filthiness contracted by touching a dead body arises only from a certain repugnance which we have to it if the bodies of those who do not wash themselves neither offended our smell nor sight how could we imagine them to be impure therefore the senses divine mollak ought to be the only judges of the purity or impurity of things yet as the same objects do not affect all men in the same manner as that which yields an agreeable sensation to some affords an unpleasant one to others it follows that the evidence of our senses cannot in this case serve as a rule unless we allow that each person may according to his own fancy determine the point and distinguish for what relates to himself what things are pure or impure but would not this divine mollak

mahomet it is an unclean animal and that it is so i will instantly convince you he moulded some dirt in his hand into the figure of a man threw it upon the ground and cried arise thou immediately a

account of the events of the first months and then continued as follows  all the dung of the beasts we cast to one side of the ark which made it lean so much that we were all terribly frightened especially our wives who made an horrible lamentation our father noah having taken counsel of god he ordered him to remove the elephant to that part and to turn his head toward the side which leaned this huge animal made such plentiful evacuations that a hog was produced from them dost thou not believe usbek that from this time we have abstained from this animal and regarded it as unclean but as this hog wallowed daily in the dung he raised such a stench in the ark that he himself could not help sneezing and a rat fell from his nose which immediately ghawed every thing he met with and thereby he became so intolerable to noah that he once more thought it necessary to consult god he ordered him to strike the lion a great blow on his forehead who also sneezed and from his nose leaped a cat

distempered body does not support itself by a mild and temperate government but by such violent remedies as incessantly exhaust and destroy it the bashaws who procure their employments only by the power of money enter those provinces in a ruined condition and ravage them as conquered countries an insolent militia subject only to its own caprice the towns dismantled the cities deserted the country desolated the culture of the land and commerce entirely neglected under this severe government impunity reigns the christians who cultivate the lands and the jews who collect the tribute are exposed to a thousand outrages the property of the lands is uncertain and consequently the desire of increasing their value diminished as neither title nor possession are a sufficient security against     the caprice of those who have the government these barbarians have so far abandoned the arts that they have even neglected the military art whilst all europe grows daily more refined they remain in their ancient ignorance and rarely think of improving by their new inventions till they have been a thousand times employed against them they have gained no experience at sea no skill in naval affairs a mere handful of christians the possessors of a barren rock   are a terror to the ottoman race and distress their whole empire it is with anxiety they suffer the christians always laborious and enterprising to carry on for them that commerce for which themselves are unfit they imagine they are granting a favour when they permit these foreigners to enrich themselves through this vast extent of country that i have passed smyrna is the only rich and powerful city that i have observed it is the europeans that have rendered it such and it is no fault of the turks that it is not in the

distance i am at did not afford thee time to alter thy conduct and allay the excessive jealousy with which i am tormented i am informed that you were catched alone     with nadir the white eunuch whose head shall pay for his infidelity and treachery how could you forget yourself so far as not to be sensible that it is not allowed you to receive a white eunuch into your chamber whilst you have black ones appointed to serve you you may say what you will to me that these eunuchs are not men and that your virtue raises you above all thoughts that an imperfect likeness might give birth to this is not sufficient either for you or for me not for you because you have done what the laws of the seraglio forbid nor for me in that you rob me of my honour in exposing yourself to the looks to the looks did i say it may be to the attempts of a traitor who may have defiled you by his crimes and yet more by the repinings of his despair and of his impotence perhaps you will say that you have always continued faithful how had you a power to be otherwise how could you deceive the vigilance of those black eunuchs who are astonished at the life you lead how could you break through those bolts and doors with which you are locked up you glory in a virtue which is not free and perhaps your impure desires have robbed you a thousand times of the merit and value of that fidelity of which you so much boast i will admit that you have not done all that i might reasonably suspect that this traitor has not laid his sacrilegious hands upon you that you have refused to indulge him with a sight of the delights of his master that covered with your habit you let that weak barrier between you and him remain that struck with a reverential awe he cast his eyes to the ground that failing in his courage he trembled at the chastisement he was preparing for himself though all this should be true it is nevertheless so that you have acted contrary to your duty and if you have broken through your duty for nothing without fulfilling your irregular desires what would you have done to gratify them what would you do if you could leave that sacred place which seems to   0 you a melancholy prison though it is an happy asylum to your companions against the attacks of vice an holy temple where your sex loses its weakness and finds itself invincible in opposition to all the disadvantages of nature what would you do if abandoned to yourself you had no other defence but your love to me which is so grievously injured and your own duty which you have so basely acted against how sacred are the manners of the country in which you live which secure you from the attempts of the meanest slaves you ought to thank me for the restraint i make you live under since it is by that only that you even merit to live the chief of the eunuchs is intolerable to you because he is always attentive to your conduct and affords you his sage advice you cannot look at him you say without uneasiness because he is so extremely ugly as if the handsomest objects should be appointed to such kind of posts as his the not having in his place the white eunuch who dishonours you is what afflicts you but what has your chief slave done to you she has told you that the familiarities you take with young zelida are not decent this is the cause of your aversion i ought zachi to be a severe judge but i am a kind husband who desire to find you innocent the love i bear to roxana my new spouse has not deprived me of that tenderness which i ought to entertain for you who are not less beautiful i divide my

view of every human eye you suffer those whose conduct is intrusted to your care to do what you have not boldness enough to do yourself and are you not sensible of the thunder just ready to break on you and them and what are you but vile instruments which i can destroy according to my humour who exist only as long as you obey who were born only to live under my laws or to die at my pleasure who do not breathe longer than my happiness my love and even my jealousy have need of your servility in short who have no other portion but submission no other will but my pleasure and no hope but my happiness some of my wives i know bear with impatience the strict laws of duty the continual presence of a black eunuch disgusts them they are tired with those frightful objects which are appointed to confine their affections to their husband all this i know but you who have taken part in this irregularity you shall be punished in such a manner as to make all those who have abused my confidence tremble by all the prophets in heaven and by hali the greatest of them all i swear that if you swerve from your duty i will regard your life but as the life of those infects which i crush under my

necessary to the happiness of one man at the same instant that nature placed women in a dependent state it seemed to deliver them from it disorder arose between the two sexes because their rights were

forty days we have reached leghorn it is a new city a proof of the great genius of the dukes of tuscany who have raised the most flourishing city in italy from a marshy village here the women are greatly indulged they may look at men through certain windows called jealousies they may go out every day accompanied only by some old women they wear only a single veil   their brothersinlaw uncles and nephews may visit them at which the husband is scarcely ever offended the first view of a christian city is a great sight to a mahometan i do not mean such things as at first view strike every spectator as the difference of buildings dress and principal customs there is even to the minutest thing a singularity which i know not how to describe though i can feel it we set out for marseilles tomorrow our continuance there will be short for rica and i design to go immediately to paris which is the seat of the european empire great cities are always the desired objects of travellers for they are a kind of common country to all strangers farewel be assured i shall always love you leghorn the   th of the moon saphar          rica      paris ibben letter xxiv rica to ibben at smyrna we have been this month at paris and all the while in a continual motion there is a good deal to be done before one can be settled meet with all the persons one has business with and procure every thing necessary all which are wonted at once paris is as large as ispahan one would imagine the houses were only inhabited by astrologers they are so lofty thou wilt easily judge that a city built in the air which has six or seven houses one on another must be extremely populous and that when all this world of people are come down into the streets there must be a fine bustle thou wilt not perhaps believe that during the month i have been here i have not yet seen one person a walking there is no people in the world who make better use of their machines than the french they run they fly the slow carriages of asia the regular pace of our camels would make them fall asleep as for my own part who am not made for such expedition and who often go on foot without altering my pace i am sometimes as mad as a christian for passing over the splashing me from head to foot i cannot pardon the punches of elbows which i receive regularly and periodically a man comes behind me and passes me turns me half round and another who crosses me on the other fide in an instant returns me back again into my first place and i am more bruised before i have walked a hundred paces than if i had travelled ten leagues thou must not expect that i can as yet give thee a perfect account of the european manners and customs i have myself only a faint idea of them and have scarcely had more     than time to wonder the king of france is the most puissant prince in europe he has not like his neighbour the king of spain mines of gold but his riches are greater than his for he supplies them from the vanity of his subjects more inexhaustible than those mines he has engaged in and supported great wars without any other fund than the sale of titles of honour and his troops have been paid his towns fortified and his fleets fitted out by a prodigy of human pride this prince is besides a great magician he exercises his empire even over the minds of his subjects and makes them think as he pleases if he has but only a thousand crowns in his treasury and has occasion for two he needs only tell them that one crown is worth two and they believe it if he has a difficult war to maintain and has no money he has only to put it into their heads that a piece of paper is money and they are presently convinced of the truth of it he even goes so far as to make them believe that he can cure them of all kinds of evils by touching them so great is the power and influence which he has over their minds thou needest not be astonished at what i tell thee of this prince there is another magician more powerful than he who is no less master of his mind than he is of those of others this magician is called the pope sometimes he makes him believe that the bread which he eats is not bread or that the wine which he drinks is not wine and a thousand other things of the same nature and to keep him always in breath and that he may not lose the habit of believing he gives him from time to time to exercise him certain articles of faith it is two years since he sent him a large scroll which he called constitution and would needs oblige under great penalties this prince and all his subjects to believe every thing it contained he succeeded with the king who instantly submitted and set     an example to his subjects but some among them revolted and declared they would believe nothing of all that was contained in the scroll the women are the movers of this rebellion which divides the whole court all the kingdom and every family in it this constitution prohibits the women reading a book which all the christians say was brought down from heaven which is properly their koran the women enraged at this affront offered to their sex raise all their force against the constitution they have gained the men to their party who on this occalion will not receive their privilege the mufti it must be owned does not reason amiss and by the great hali it must be that he has been instructed in the principles of our holy faith for since the women are an inferior creation to ours and our prophets insorm us that they will not enter into paradise for what end should they corcern themselves in reading a book which is only designed to teach the way to paradise some miraculous things i have heard related to the king which i doubt not but you will hesitate to believe it is said that whilst he made war against his neighbours who were all leagued against him he had in his kingdom an infinite number of enemies who surrounded him they add that he searched for them above thirty years and that notwithstanding the unwearied pains of some dervises who have his confidence he could never discover one they live with him are in his court in his capital in his troops in his tribunals yet it is said he will have the mortisication to die without finding one of them they may be said to have a general existence and to have nothing of individuality it is a body but without members doubtless it is heaven that would punish this prince for not having been sufficiently moderate towards his conquered enemies since it hath raised up against him invisible ones whose genius and appointment are superior to his own i shall continue to write to you and     to acquaint you with things extremely remote from the character and genius of the persians it is indeed the same earth that bears us both

nor modesty are known how happy art thou thou livest in my seraglio as in the abode of innocence secure from the attempts of all mankind you with pleasure experience a happy inability to go astray never did man pollute you with his lascivious looks during the freedom of festivities even your fatherinlaw never saw your fine mouth you never neglected to cover it with a holy veil happy roxana whenever you have gone into the country you have always had eunuchs to march before to punish with death the temerity of those who did not fly from your sight even i myself to whom heaven gave you to make me happy how much trouble have i had to render myself master of that treasure which with so much constancy you defended how distressing to me during the first days of our marriage not to see you and how impatient when i had beheld you yet you would not satisfy it on the contrary you increased it by the obstinate refusals of your bashful alarms you did not distinguish me from all other men from whom you are always concealed do you recollect the day i lost you among your slaves who betrayed me and hid you from my searches do you remember another time when finding your tears insufficient you engaged the authority of your mother to stop the eagerness of my love do you remember when every other resource failed you those you found in your own courage you took a dagger and threatened to sacrifice a husband who loved you if he persisted in requiring of you what you prized more than     your husband himself two months passed in the struggle between love and modesty you carried your modest scruples too far you did not even submit after you were conquered you defended to the last moment a dying virginity you regarded me as an enemy who had done you a wrong not as a husband who had loved you you was above three months before you could look at me without a blush your bashful looks seemed to reproach me with the advantage i had taken i did not enjoy even a quiet possession you deprived me of all those charms and graces that you could and without having obtained the least favours i was ravished with the greatest if your education had been in this country here you would not have been so troublesome the women here have lost all modesty they present themselves before the men with their faces uncovered as though they would demand of them their defeat they watch for their looks they see them in thier mosques their public walks and even by themselves the service of eunuchs is unknown to them in the room of that noble simplicity and that amiable modesty which reigns amongst you a brutal impudence prevails to which it is impossible to be accustomed yes if thou wert here roxana you would be enraged at the wretched shamefulness to which your sex is degenerated you would fly these polluted places and sigh for that sweet retreat where you find innocence and yourself secure and where no dangers terrify you in a word where you can love me without fear of ever losing that love for me which is my due when you heighten your beautiful complexion with the finest colours when you persume your whole body with the most precious effences when you deck yourself with the richest dresses when you endeavour to distinguish yourself from your companions by your graceful motions in dancing and when by the sweetness of your voice you pleasingly dispute with them charms   0 affability and gaiety i cannot imagine you have any other object to please but myself and when i see your modest blush that your eyes seek mine that you insinuate yourself into my heart by your soft alluring speeches i cannot roxana suspect your love but what can i think of the european women the art which forms their complexion the ornaments they use in dress the pains which they take with their persons the constant desire to please that possesses them are blemishes in their virtue and affronts to their husbands it is not roxana that i suspect they carry their incroachments upon virtue to such a length as their conduct might lead one to believe or that they carry their defection to such a horrid excess that makes one tremble as really to violate the conjugal vow there are few women abondoned enough to go this length they all bear in their hearts a certain impression of virtue naturally engraved on them which though their education may weaken it cannot destroy though they may decline the external duties which modesty exacts yet when about to take the last step nature returns to their help thus when we shut you up closely when we make you be guarded by so many slaves when we so strongly restrain your desires when they would range too far it is not that we fear the least infidelity but because we know that purity cannot be too great and that by the least stain it may be polluted i pity you roxana your chastity so long tried merited a husband who would never have left you and who might himself have satisfied those desires which can be subdued by your virtue alone

confidence paris the  th day of the moon of chahban          rica  letter xxviii rica to    yesterday i saw a very extraordinary thing though it happens every day at paris after dinner towards evening all the people assemble to act a kind of mimickry which i heard called a play the performance is in a place called a theatre on each side are little nooks called boxes in which the men and women act together dumb scenes something like those in use in persia here you see a languishing lovesick lady another more animated eagerly ogling her lover whose returns are as ardent all the passions are painted in their faces and expressed by an eloquence which though dumb is not the less lively here the actresses expose but half their bodies and commonly cut of modesty wear a muff to conceal their arms in the lower part of the theatre is a troop of people standing who ridicule those who are above and they in their turn laugh at those below but those who put themselves to the greatest trouble are some who take the advantage of their youth to support the fatigue of it they are forced to be every where they go through passages known only to themselves they mount with extraordinary activity from story to story they are above below and in every box they dive if i may so speak they are lost this moment and appear again the next they often leave the place of scene and go to play in another now there are others though such a prodigy is not to be expected seeing they use crutches who walk and move about like the others you come at length to some rooms where they act a private comedy this commences with low bows continued by embraces the slightest acquaintance they say gives a man a right to squeeze another to death this place seems to inspire tenderness in fact     they say that the princesses who reign here are not cruel and excepting two or three hours a day in which they are hardhearted enough one must allow that they are very tractable and that the other humour is a kind of drunkenness which they easily quit all that i have been relating to you is pretty nearly transacted in another place called the operahouse all the difference is that they speak at the one and sing at the other a friend of mine the other day took me into a room where one of the principal actresses was undressing we became so intimate that the next day i received from her the following epistle       paris  sir i am the most unhappy woman in the world i have been always the most virtuous woman in the whole opera seven or eight months ago as i was dressing myself for a priestess of diana in the same room you saw me in yesterday a young abbot came in and regardless of my white habit my veil or my frontlet deprived me of my innocence i have in vain remonstrated to him the sacrifice i made to him he only laughs and maintains he found me a very profane woman in the mean time i dare not come upon the stage i am so big for i am with respect to honour inconceivably delicate and i always insist that to a woman well born it is more easy to lose her virtue than her modesty with this delicacy you may readily judge that the young abbot had never succeeded if he had not made to me a promise of marriage such a lawful motive induced me to pass over those little usual formalities and to begin where i ought to have concluded but since his infidelity has dishonoured me i will no longer continue at the opera where between you and me they scarcely give me sufficient for my support for at present that i advance in years and lose the advantage of charms my salary though     the same seems to diminish daily i have learned from one of your attendants that in your country a good dancer is highly esteemed and that if i was at ispahan my fortune would be quickly made if you would take me under your protection you would have the praise of doing good to a woman who by her virtue and prudent conduct would not render herself unworthy of your generosity i am c from paris the  d of the moon of chalval      rica      paris ibben letter xxix rica to ibben at smyrna the pope is the head of the christians an old idol whom they reverence through custom he was heretofore terrible even to princes themselves for he deposed them as easily as our magnificent sultans do the kings of iremetta and georgia but he is no longer feared he says he is the successor of one of the first christians named saint peter and it is certainly a rich succession for he hath immense treasures and a large country under his dominion the bishops are the men of the law who are subject to him and have under his authority two very different functions articles of faith are constituted by them as well as by himself when they are assembled together when they are separated the business of their function is no other than to dispense with the fulfilment of the law for the christian religion thou must know is loaded with a vast number of very difficult practices and as it is judged less easy to fulfil those obligations than to have bishops to dispense with them they have for the public benefit taken the latter method in such a manner that if they are not willing to observe the fast of rahmazan   if unwilling to subject them to the formalities     of marriage if they would break their vows if they would marry contrary to the appointment of the law nay sometimes if they are desirous not to abide by their oath they go to the bishop or pope who presently grants a dispensation the bishops do not make articles of faith of their own proper accord there is a prodigious number of doctors for the most part dervises who raise among themselves new questions in religion which are lest in dispute a long time and the contention subsists until a decision comes to terminate it i can also affirm to thee that there never was a kingdom where there has been so many civil wars as in that of christ those who publish any new proposition are at once called heretics each heresy has its own name which is used in ridicule to those who engage in it but no man need to be an heretic unless he will he has only to divide the difference in the middle and admit a distinction to those who charge him with heresy and provided there be a distinction intelligible or not he purifies himself as white as snow and may make himself esteemed orthodox what i tell you does very well in france and germany but i have heard that in spain and portugal the dervises do not relish jesting and will burn a man as readily as they would straw when a man comes into the hands of these people there it is happy for him if he has always prayed to god with little wooden balls in his hands that he has carried about with him pieces of cloth fastened to two ribbons and that he has been sometimes in the province of galicia otherwise the poor devil is terribly embarrassed though he should swear like a pagan that he is orthodox it is possible they may not admit his plea and may burn him for an heretic it is to no purpose for him to make distinctions away with distinctions he shall be in ashes before they even think of hearing him the judges here commonly presume upon the innocence of the accused there they always suppose the party culpable if in doubt it is their     custom to determine on the side of severity probably because they think badly of mankind but the others conceive so well of them that they never judge them capable of a lie for they receive the testimony of mortal enemies of loose women of such who follow an infamous calling the others in their sentence pay a slight compliment to those whom they dress up in a shirt painted with flames of fire and assure them that they are extremely concerned to see them so badly habited that their own disposition is to mercy that they abhor blood and that they are grieved at having condemned them but for their own consolation they confiscate to their own emolument all the effects of the miserable sufferers happy the land which is possessed by the children of the prophets there these melancholy spectacles are unknown   the holy religion brought there by angels maintains its power by truth itself it needs no cruel means for its support paris the

formed a rainbow about me variegated with a thousand colours if i attended the public shows my strange figure attracted a hundred spying glasses     in short never was a man so much looked at as myself i smiled sometimes at hearing persons who but scarcely ever stirred from their chamber whispering to each other it must be allowed he has much of the air of a persian but what is very wonderful i met with my own picture every where saw myself multiplied in every shop upon every chimneypiece so fearful were they of not seeing me sufficiently all these honours however are only burdensome i did not imagine i was so curious or so extraordinary a person and though i think very well of myself i never imagined i should have disturbed the quiet of a great city where i was wholly unknown this determined me to quit my persian dress and put on that of an european to try if my physiognomy would yet retain any of the wonderful this experiment convinced me of what i really was divested of these foreign ornaments i found myself properly rated i had occasion enough to be displeased with my taylor for making me lose all public regard and attention for i at once sunk into a contemptible nothingness i was sometimes an hour in company without being the least noticed and without any bodys giving me occasion to speak but if by chance any one informed the company that i was a persian

melancholy fatal effects of this liquor i cannot avoid considering it as the most dreadful present that nature hath made to mankind if any thing ever disgraced the lives and characters of our monarchs it hath been their intemperance it hath been the most empoisoned spring from whence have issued all their injustice and cruelty i must needs say to the disgrace of these men the law prohibits our princes the use of wine and yet they drink it to an excess that degrades them of humanity this custom on the contrary is indulged to the christian princes and never observed to lead them into any crime the mind of man is a contradiction to itself during a licentious debauch they transgress the precepts and the law made to render us just serves only to render us more culpable yet when i disapprove of the use of this liquor which   0 destroys our reason i do not at the same time condemn those beverages which exhilerate the mind the orientals are so wise as to inquire after remedies

as the consolations drawn from the necessity of evil the inefficacy of medicines the irreversibleness of fatality the decrees of providence   and the miserable condition of humanity it is mockery to attempt to soften evils by the consideration that it is the consequence of our being born it is much better to divert the mind from its reflections and to treat man as a being susceptible of sensation rather than reason the soul united to a body is continually under its tyrannical power if the blood moves too slowly if the spirits are not sufficiently pure if they are not enough in quantity we

more gay and airy what in persia renders the blood so pure is the regular life the women observe they neither game nor sit up late they drink no wine and do not expose themselves to the open air it must be allowed that the seraglio is better adapted for health than for pleasure it is a dull uniform kind of life where every thing turns upon subjection and duty their very pleasures are grave and their pastimes solemn and they seldom taste them but as so many tokens of authority and dependence the men themselves in persia are not so gay as the french there is not that freedom of mind and that appearance of content which i meet with here in persons of all estates and ranks it is still worse in turky where there are families in which from father to son not one of them ever laughed from the foundation of the monarchy the gravity of the asiatics arises from the little conversation there is among them who never see each other but when obliged by ceremony friendship that sweet engagement of

know that their abode will not be with the prophets and that the great haly is not come for their sakes but dost thou believe they will be sentenced to eternal punishment because they have been so unhappy as to find no mosques in their country and that god will punish them for not practising a religion that he never made known to them i can assure thee i have frequently examined these christians i have questioned them to see if they had any idea of the great haly who was the most excellent of mankind and have found that they have never so much as heard him mentioned they are not like those infidels whom our holy prophet put to the sword for refusing to believe in the miracles of heaven but rather like those unhappy people who lived under the darkness of idolatry before the divine light illuminated the face of our great prophet again if you search their religion closely you will find some seeds of our doctrines i have often admired the secret dispositions of providence which seems thereby willing to prepare them for a general conversion i have heard speak of a book of their doctors called polygamy triumphant in which is proved that polygamy is enjoined to christians their baptism is an emblem of our legal washings and the christians only mistake in the efficacy that they ascribe to this primary ablution which they believe sufficient for every other their priests and monks like us pray seven times a day they hope to enjoy a paradise where they shall taste a thousand delights by the means of the resurrection of their bodies they have as well as we set fasts and mortifications by which they hope to incline the divine mercy they worship good angels and fear the evil they pay a holy credulity to the miracles which god works by the ministry of his servants they acknowledge as we do the insufficiency of their own merits and the need they have of an intercessor with god i see mahometism throughout the whole though i do     not there find mahomet do all we can

houses where they sell it in some of these houses they talk of news in others they play at draughts there is one where they prepare the coffee in such a manner that it inspires the drinkers of it with wit at least of all those who frequent it there is not one person in four who does not think he has more wit after he has entered that house but what offends me in these wits is that they do not make themselves useful to their country and that they trifle away their talents on childish things for instance at my arrival in paris i found them very warm about the most trifling controversy imaginable they were disputing about the character of an old greek poet of whose country and the time of his death they have been ignorant these two thousand years both parties allowed he was an excellent poet the question was only whether he had more or less merit ascribed to him than he deserved each was for settling the value but amidst these distributers of reputation some made better weight than others such was     the quarrel it has been very fierce for they so heartily abused each other and were so bitter in their raillery that i did not less admire the manner of their dispute than the subject of it if any one said i to myself should be giddyheaded enough in the company of these defenders of this greek poet to attack the reputation of an honest citizen he would be but badly received and surely this zeal so delicate for the reputation of the dead would be inflamed in defence of that of the living but however that may be added i may i ever be defended from the censors or this poet whose abode of two thousand years in the grave has not defended him from so implacable an hatred they now do but beat the air but how would it be if their fury was animated by the presence of an enemy these i have been speaking of dispute in the vulgar tongue and must be distinguished from another kind of disputants who make use of a barbarous language which seems to augment the fury and obstinacy of the combatants there are particular quarters of the town where these people engage as in a battle night and day they as it were feed themselves with distinctions and live upon obscure reasonings and false consequences this trade by which it should seem no bread could be got yet does not fail answering a whole nation expelled their own country hath been seen to pass the seas to settle in france bringing

governs with the same spirit his family his court and his kingdom he hath often been heard to say that of all the governments in the world that of the turks or of our august sultan pleased him best so highly does he esteem the politics of the east i have studied his character and have discovered in it contradictions impossible for me to solve for example he hath a minister who is not above eighteen years old and a mistress turned of fourscore he loves his religion and yet cannot bear those who say it ought to be rigorously observed though he avoids the tumult of cities and is little communicative yet he is busy from morning to evening what he may do to be talked of he is very fond of trophies and victories but he fears as much to see a good general at the head of his troops as he would have cause to do one at the head of his enemies troops it never happened i believe but to himself to be at the same time loaded with more riches than a prince could wish to be and to be oppressed with a poverty that a private person could not be able to sustain he loves to reward those who serve him but he rewards as liberally the assiduity or rather the idleness of his courtiers as the laborious campaigns of his generals he oftentimes prefers a man who undresses him or gives him a napkin when he sits down to table preferable to another who takes cities or gains battles for him he does not think that the grandeur of a sovereign ought to be restrained in the distribution of favours and without examining     whether the man he loads with his favours hath real merit he thinks his choice capable of rendering him such accordingly he hath been known to bestow a small pension on a man who run away two leagues from the enemy and a good government to another who run twice that length he is magnificent above all in his buildings he has more statues in his palacegardens than there are inhabitants in a great city his guard is as strong as that of the prince before whom all

ibben at smyrna whether it is better to deprive women of their liberty or to permit it them is a great question among men it appears to me that there are good reasons for and against this practice if the europeans urge that there is a want of generosity in rendering those persons miserable whom we love our asiatics answer that it is meanness in men to renounce the empire which nature has given them over women if they are told that a great number of women shut up are troublesome they reply that ten women in subjection are less troublesome than one who is refractory but they object in their turn that the europeans cannot be happy with women who are faithless to them they reply that this fidelity of which they boast so much does not hinder that disgust which always follows the gratification of the passions that our women are too much ours that a possession so easily obtained leaves nothing to be wished or feared that a little coquetry provokes desire and prevents disgust perhaps a man wiser than myself would be     puzzled to decide this question for if the asiatics do very well to find out proper means to calm their uneasiness the europeans also do as well to have uneasiness after all say they though we should be unhappy as husbands we should always find means to recompence ourselves as lovers for that a man might have reason to complain of the infidelity of his wife it must be that there should be but three persons in the world they will always be at even hands when there are four another question among the learned is whether the law of nature subjects the women to the men no said a gallant philosopher to me the other day nature rever dictated such a law the empire we have over them is real tyranny which they only suffer us to assume because they have more good nature than we and in consequence more humanity and reason these advantages which ought to have given them the superiority had we acted reasonably have made them lose it because we have not the same advantages but if it is true that the power we have over women is only tyrannical it is no less so that they have over us a natural empire that of beauty which nothing can resist our power extends not to all countries but that of beauty is universal wherefore then do we hear of this privilege is it because we are the strongest but this is really injustice we employ every kind of means to reduce their spirits their abilities would be equal with ours if their education was the same let us examine them in those talents which education hath not enfeebled and we shall see if ours are as great it must be acknowledged though it is contrary to our custom that among the most polite people the women have always had the authority over their husbands it was established among the egyptians in honour of isis and among the babylonians in honour of semiramis it is said of the romans that they commanded all nations but obeyed their wives i say nothing of the sauromates who     were in perfect slavery to the sex they were too barbarous to be brought for an example thou seest my dear ibben that i have contracted the fashion of this country where they are found of defending

parents are ever the principal duties of it and indeed ought not the first object of a religious man to be to please the deity who hath established the religion he professes but the surest way to do so is without doubt to obey the laws of society and to discharge the duties of humanity for whatever religion a man professes the moment any religion is supposed it must also necessarily be supposed that god loves mankind since he establishes a religion to render them happy that if he loves men we are certain of pleasing him in loving them also that is in exercising toward them all the duties of charity and humanity and not breaking the laws under which they live by these means we are much surer of pleasing god than by observing such and such a ceremony for ceremonies in themselves have no

tell me who is that man over against us so badly dressed who makes so many faces and speaks a language different from the rest     who hath not wit enough to talk but talks that he may have wit he is a poet replied he a grotesque figure of the human kind these kind of creatures they say are born what they are it is true and no less so that they will continue the same all their lives that is to say for the general part the most ridiculous of mankind accordingly nobody spares them contempt is liberally poured on them by all hunger hath driven him to this house and he is here well received by both the master and mistress of the house whose good nature and politeness do not permit them to descend to personal prejudices he wrote an epithalamium when they were married it is the best thing he ever did for the marriage hath proved as happy as he predicted it would be you will perhaps not believe added he possessed as you are of oriental prejudices that there are among us happy marriages and women whose virtue is their strict guard the couple we are talking of enjoy an uninterrupted peace they are beloved and esteemed by all the world there is but one thing amiss their goodnature makes them admit all kinds of people which occasions their having bad company not that i dislike them we must live with people as we find them those who are called good company are often such whose vices are more refined and perhaps it is as with poisons of which the most subtle are the most dangerous and who is this old man said i to him softly who looks so morose i took him at first for a foreigner for besides that he is dressed different from the rest he censures every thing done in france and disapproves of your government he is an old warrior said he who makes himself memorable to all his auditors by the tedious relation of his exploits he will not allow france hath gained any battle at which he was not present or that any siege should be boasted of where he did not mount the trenches he fancies himself of so much importance to our history that he imagines it ended where he concluded     his actions he looks upon some wounds he received as he would upon the dissolution of the monarchy and different to those philosophers who say that we enjoy only the present time and that the past is nothing he on the contrary enjoys only the past and exists not but in the campaigns he hath made he breathes in the times that are passed away as heroes ought to live in those which are to come but why said i did he quit the service he did not quit it replied he but it quitted him he is employed in a little garrison where he will recount his adventures the remainder of his life but he will get no further the road of honour is shut up from him and why said i we have a maxim in france replied he never to promote officers whose patience hath languished in subaltern offices we regard them as persons whose understandings are straitened by a narrow sphere of action and who accustomed to little things are become incapable of greater we think that a man who at thirty hath not the qualifications of a general will never have them that he who has not that cast of eye as to shew him at once a tract of several leagues in all its various situations that presence of mind which enables him to improve all the advantages of a victory and in a defeat to help himself by every possible resource will never acquire these talents therefore we have high employments for great and elevated persons to whom heaven has not only given the heart but also the genius of heroism and inferior stations for those whose talents are also inferior of this class are those who are grown old in an obscure warfare at best they succeed only in doing what they have done all their lives and we ought not to begin loading them at a time when they begin to be enfeebled a moment afterwards the spirit of curiosity reseized me and i said to him i promise to ask no further questions if you will allow of this one more who is that big young man in his own hair with so little wit and so     much impertinence how comes he to talk louder than the rest and seem so pleased that he is alive he is a man of good fortune replied he—as he said this some company came in others went away and all got up somebody came to speak to my companion and i remained as ignorant as before but a moment afterwards this young man happened to sit by me and began talking to me it is fine weather sir will you take a turn in the garden i answered him as civilly as possible and we went out together i am come into the country to please the mistress of this house with whom i am upon no bad terms there is a certain woman in the world who will not be in the best humour but what can be done i visit the handsomest women in paris but i do not confine myself to one and they have need to look sharp after me for between you and i i am a sad fellow probably then sir said i you have some post or employment that prevents you from attending them more constantly no sir i have nothing else to do but to provoke an husband or drive a father to despair i love to alarm a woman who thinks she is secure of me and reduce her within a fingers breadth of losing me here is a set of us young fellows who in this manner divide all paris and make it take notice of the least step we take by what i learn from you said i you make a greater noise than the most valiant warrior and are more observed than a grave magistrate you would not enjoy all these advantages if you were in persia you would be thought fitter to guard our women than to give them pleasure i began to grow warm and i believe if i had talked a little more i could not have helped affronting him—what sayest thou of a country where these kind of wretches are tolerated and where they suffer a man to live who employs himself in such a manner where infidelity treason rapes persidy and injustice conduce to render a man considerable where a man shall be

dreadfully to see the horrible climate of muscovy none would ever think it a punishment to be exiled nevertheless when a great man is disgraced he is banished to siberia as the law of our prophet forbids us to drink wine that of this prince prohibits the muscovites the use of it they have a custom of receiving their guests which has nothing at all of persian in it on the entrance of a stranger into the house the husband presents him to his wife and the stranger kisses her and this passes as a compliment to the husband though the fathers in the marriage contract of their daughters generally covenant that their husbands shall not beat them yet it is not to be believed how much the muscovite women love to be beaten   they cannot conceive that they   0 possess their husbands heart if he does not beat them a contrary treatment from him is a mark of indifference not to be forgiven see a letter which one of these wives lately wrote to her mother       moscow  my dear mother i am the

design only suitable to you a moment afterwards i happened to be near her aunt who says to me what do you say to that woman who at least is threescore and yet spent an hour today at her dressing table it was time lost said i and she ought to have     had your beauty to excuse her i went to this unhappy threescore and pitied her in my heart when she whispered me is there any thing so ridiculous look at that woman of fourscore who yet wears flamecoloured ribbons she would fain make herself young and indeed she has succeeded for this borders upon infancy oh heavens said i to myself shall we never be sensible but of the folly of others it is perhaps a happiness said i afterward that we can reap comfort from the weaknesses of another however being in a humour to be merry come said i we have

despair who will always be calling to mind what he hath been to put her in mind of what he now no longer is who always ready to enjoy and never enjoying will always be cheating himself and cheating her and make her continually sensible of the wretchedness of her condition and then to be always in dreams and fancies to live only in imagination to find ones self ever near but never tasting

a thousand times that eunuchs taste a kind of pleasure with     women that is unknown to us that makes up their loss that nature hath resources which repair the disadvantage of their condition that they may indeed lose their manhood but not their sensibility and that in this state they enjoy a kind of third sense so that they only change as one may say one pleasure for another if it be so i

it is but every thing goes against me it is above three days since i have said any thing that hath done me honour and i have been confounded indiscriminately in the general conversation without the least attention or being spoken to twice i had prepared some witty expressions to embellish my discourse but they would not let me introduce them i had a good story but every time i endeavoured to tell it they avoided it as though they had done it on purpose i was provided with some clever jests which for these four days have lain like old lumber in my head without the least occasion to use them if this continues i shall be a fool at last it seems that my stars will have it so and drive me to despair yesterday i had hopes     of shining among three or four old ladies who certainly had no design to impose upon me and i had some mighty pretty things to say i was above a quarter of an hour labouring to turn the conversation but they would not follow but like the fatal sisters cut off the thread of my discourse shall i tell you it is very difficult to support the character of a wit i do not know how you have managed to obtain it—i have a thought replied the other let us jointly endeavour to support each others wit let us make a partnership we will every day tell each other what we will say and support each other so well that let what will happen our thoughts shall never be interrupted we will draw every body to us and if they will not come over freely we will force them we will agree when to approve when to smile and when to burst out a laughing you shall find we will give a turn to all conversations and nothing shall be admired but the quickness of our wit and the good things we say we will protect each other upon a nod you shall shine today to morrow you shall second me i will go into a house with you and cry out as i introduce you i must tell you a witty reply this gentleman made just now to one we met in the street and then turning to you he did not expect any such thing he was quite confounded i will repeat some of my verses and you must say i was present when he made them it was a supper he did not study a moment for them nay you and i will sometimes rally each other and people will say observe how they attack one another how they defend themselves they do not spare each other lets see how he will get off that wonderful what presence of mind a downright battle indeed—but they cannot tell we have been skirmishing beforehand we must get some works full of jests composed for the use of those who have not wit and are willing to counterfeit it but all depends upon copying from originals i see that in less than six months we shall be able to     maintain a conversation of an hour long all composed of witticisms but we must be very careful to support our good fortune it is not enough to say a good thing it must be spread abroad and dispersed every where or else it will be lost and i must confess that there is nothing so mortifying as to have said a smart thing and to have it expire in the ear of the fool who heard it it is true this is sometimes compensated by having a good many foolish things we say passed over in silence and this is the only thing that can console us on such an occasion see my dear friend the scheme we must pursue act as i have directed you and i promise you in less than six months you will

lose nothing it is because they have nothing to lose but you may always know o shameful the moment of their defeat and without consulting the stars the birth of their children may be predicted to the very hour the french seldom or ever speak of their     wives it is for fear of talking of them before people who know them better than themselves there is a set of very miserable creatures among them whom nobody comforts these are jealous husbands there are some whom all the world hates jealous husbands there are some whom every body despises these are the same jealous husbands therefore there is no country where there are so few of them as among the french their tranquility is not placed upon the confidence they have in their wives it is on the contrary upon the bad opinion they entertain of them all the wise precautions of the asiatics the veils that cover them the prisons that secure them the vigilance of eunuchs appear to them more likely means to put the sex upon contriving than to weary it out here the husbands bear their part with a good grace and consider the infidelity of their wives as an inevitable stroke of fatality an husband who would keep his wife to himself would be regarded as a disturber of the public peace and as a madman who would enjoy the light of the sun to the exclusion of every body else here an husband who loves his wife is considered as a man who hath not merit enough to make himself beloved by any other woman and as one who makes a bad use of the necessity of the law to supply the perfections he wants who makes use of his rights to the prejudice of the whole community who appropriates that to himself which was only lent to him and who endeavours as much as in him to break that tacit compact which constitutes the happiness of both sexes the report of being married to a very handsome woman which in asia is concealed with so much care is borne here without uneasiness they find themselves able to divert themselves every where a prince comforts himself upon the loss of one place by the taking of another at the time the turks took bagdad from us were not we taking from the mogul the sortress of candahar in general a man who bears

women here it may be said they are distinguished my conductor hath constantly made me take notice of them but they were all so ugly that a man must be a saint not to hate such virtue after what i have told thee of the manners of this country thou wilt easily imagine that the french do not pique themselves much on their constancy they think it as ridiculous to swear to a woman that they will love her always as to maintain that they will always continue in good health or that they will always be happy when they promise a woman that they will always love her they suppose that she on her part

express command prohibited all games of chance and where it was impossible to take away the cause of our passions he hath deadened them love amongst us brings no trouble no fury it is a languid

i have never heard of this employment how do you not know what a casuist is attend i will give you an idea of it that shall thoroughly inform you there are two kinds of sins mortal sins which absolutely exclude from paradise and venal sins which though indeed offensive to god do not so provoke him as to deprive us of beatitude now our whole art consists in rightly distinguishing these two kinds of sin for except some libertines all christians are willing to obtain paradise but there is scarce any person would not willingly gain it upon as easy terms as possible when they are well acquainted what sins are mortal they take care not to commit them and their business is done these are persons who do not aspire to a great degree of perfection and as they have no ambition are not solicitous for the first places so as they can but get into paradise they desire no more provided they are there thats enough for them these are those who take heaven by violence rather than not obtain it and who say to god lord i have rigorously fulfilled the conditions thou canst not refuse to keep thy promise as i have done no more than what thou didst demand of me i do not expect thou shouldest grant  0  me more than thou hast promised we are therefore sir a very necessary kind of people this however is not all you shall hear something further it is not the act that constitutes the sin it is the knowledge of him who commits it he who doth evil if he can believe that it is not an evil his conscience is safe and there are a vast number of actions of a doubtful nature a casuist can give them a degree of goodness that they have not and pronounce them good and provided he can persuade the man to believe they are harmless he entirely takes away all their evil i have here told you

inquirest what they do here the very same they do in persia nothing more resembles a jew in asia than a jew in europe they shew among the christains as among us an invincible obstinacy for their religion which they carry to the height of folly the religion of the jews is an old trunk which hath produced two branches which have covered all the earth i mean christianity and mahometism or rather it is a mother who hath brought forth two daughters who have covered her with a thousand wounds for with respect to religion its nearest friends are its greatest enemies but as ill as she hath been treated by these she doth not cease to glory in having produced them she serves herself of both to encompass the whole world whilst on her own part her venerable age embraces all ages the jews consider themselves as the source of all holiness and the origin of all religion they on the other hand look upon us as heretics who have changed the law or rather as rebellious jews if the change had been gradually effected they think they might have been  0  easily seduced but as it was suddenly changed and in a violent manner as they can point out the day and the hour of the birth of the one and the other they are offended at finding us reckoning our religion by ages and therefore adhere firmly to a religion not preceded in antiquity by even the world itself they never enjoyed in europe a calm equal to the present christians begin to lay aside that intolerating spirit which formerly influenced them spain hath experienced the bad consequence of having expelled the jews and france of having worried the christians whose faith differed a little from that of the prince they are now sensible that a zeal for the progress of religion is different from that attachment which ought to be preserved towards her and that in order to love and obey her it is not necessary to hate and persecute those who do not regard her it is to be wished that our mussulmans would think as rationally upon this subject as the christians that we might in good earnest make peace between hali and abubeker and leave to god the care of deciding the pretensions of these holy prophets i would have them

the generality of people said he envy the happiness of our condition and with reason however it hath its uneasinesses we are not so divided from the world as not to be called into it upon a thousand occasions and there it is very difficult to support our part the people of the world are surprising they can neither bear our approbation nor our censures if we attempt to reprove them we are ridiculous if we approve their conduct we are considered as acting beneath our character there is nothing so humbling as the thought of having given scandal even to the impious we are therefore obliged to use a doubtful kind of conduct and deal with libertines not in a decisive way but by the uncertainty in which we leave them to judge of the manner in which we received their conversation there must be a good deal of ingenuity to this purpose this neutral state is very difficult the men of the world who hazard every thing who indulge all their flights and who according to their success pursue or drop them succeed much better this is not all this state so happy and so quiet so much boasted of is not to be kept up in the world as on our appearance there we are forced to dispute we are obliged to undertake for example to prove the efficacy of prayer to a man who does not believe in god the necessity of fasting to another who all his life time hath denied the immortality of the soul the enterprize is difficult and the laughers are not with us further a strong desire to draw others to our opinion perpetually torments us and is as i may say fixed to our profession this is as ridiculous as it would be for the europeans to labour for the honour of human nature to wash the africans white we trouble the state we torment even ourselves to make men receive the nonessential points of religion and we are like that conqueror  0  of china who forced his subjects into a general revolt because he wanted to oblige them to cut their hair and their nails that zeal even which we have to make those who are under our immediate care fulfil the duties of our holy religion is often dangerous and cannot be attended with too much prudence theodosius the emperor put to the sword all the inhabitants of a certain city even the women and children afterwards offering to go into a church ambrose a bishop shut the doors against him as a sacrilegious murderer and in this he did a noble action this emperor having afterwards submitted to the penance such a crime required being admitted into the church going to place himself among the priests the same bishop turned him out and in this

say i knew nothing of women till i came here i have learned more of them here in a month than i should have done in thirty years in a seraglio with us there is an uniformity of character as it is al

years from the remotest part of africa my native country i was at first sold to a master who had above twenty wives or concubines who judged from my gravity and taciturnity that i was fit for a seraglio he ordered i should be made so and made me submit to an operation painful at first but which afterwards made me happy as it brought me to the ear and confidence of my masters i entered the seraglio which was a new world to me the chief eunuch a man the most severe i ever saw governed there with an absolute power there was no talk heard there of divisions or quarrels a profound silence reigned throughout all the women retired to rest at the same hour from one end of the year to another and rose again always at a certain hour they entered the baths by turns and came out at the least signal we made they were shut up in their chambers almost the rest of their time he had one rule which was to make them observe the greatest neatness and it is impossible to express his care for this purpose he punished without mercy the least refusal of his orders i am said he a slave but it is to a man who is your master as well as mine and i only use the power he hath given me over you it is he who corrects you and not i who do no more than lend my hand these women never entered my masters chamber unless they were called they received this favour with joy and saw themselves deprived of it without murmuring in short i who was the meanest black in this peaceful seraglio was a thousand times more respected than i am in thine where i command every body as soon as this chief eunuch understood my genius he regarded me spoke of me to my master as a man fit to pursue his methods and to succeed him in the post he filled he was not prejudiced at my youthfulness he thought my     attention would supply the want of experience shall i tell thee i grew so much in his confidence that he made no difficulty to put into my hands the keys of those tremendous places which he for so long a time had guarded it was under this able master that i learned the difficult art of commanding and formed to myself the maxims of an inflexible government i studied under him the hearts of women he taught me to take advantage of their weaknesses and not to be confounded by their haughtiness often did he please himself with seeing me force them to the utmost verge of obedience he then made them return again by degrees and made me seem myself to give way for a time you should have seen him in those moments when they were driven almost to despair between intreaties and reproaches he bore their tears without being moved himself and experienced a pleasure in this kind of triumph see said he with an air of complacency how women must be governed their number does not incommode me i could govern in the same manner all those of our great monarch how can a man captivate their hearts if their trusty eunuchs did not first break their spirits he was not only possessed of a firm resolution but also of as great penetration he read their thoughts and saw through their dissimulations their studied looks their fictitious countenances concealed nothing from him he gained a knowledge of all their most private actions and their most secret words he made use of some to gain intelligence of others and delighted to reward the least confidence placed in him as they never approached their husbands but when they had notice the eunuch introduced whom he pleased and directed his masters regards according to his own views and this distinction was the reward of some secret intelligence he had persuaded his master that it was necessary to leave this choice to him in order to preserve good order and to make his authority the greater such was the government     magnificent lord in a

loves on the product of an honest traffic his whole life is remarkable for generous actions and though he seeks to be private he hath more heroism in his soul than in that of the greatest monarchs i have talked a thousand times to him of thee i shew him all thy letters i observe they give him pleasure and i already perceive that thou hast a friend who is unknown to thee thou wilt find here his chief adventures though he wrote them with reluctance he could refuse nothing to my friendship and i intrust them to thine the history of apheridon and astarte i was born among the guebres   of a religion which is perhaps the most ancient in the world i was so unhappy that love came to me before reason i was scarce six years of age when i could not live without my sister my eyes were always fixed on her and if she left me but a moment she found them at her return bathed in tears every day did not add more to my age than to my love my father astonished at so strong a sympathy wished indeed to marry us together according to the ancient custom of the guebres introduced by cambyses but the fear of the mahometans whose yoke we live under restrains those of our nation from thinking of such holy alliances which our religion rather commands than forbids and which resemble so much the natural union constituted by nature my father seeing it would be dangerous to     follow his inclination and mine determined to extinguish a flame which he thought in its infancy but which was at its height he pretended to make a voyage and took me with him leaving my sister in the hands of one of his relations for my mother had been dead two years i will not tell you what my despair was at this separation i embraced my sister all bathed in teats but i shed none for grief had rendered me insensible we arrived at tefflis and my father having intrusted my education to one of our relations left me there and returned home some time after i learned that by the interest of one of his friends he had got my sister into the kings seraglio where she attended a sultana if i had been informed of her death i could not have been more affected for besides that i had no hopes of seeing her again her entering into the seraglio had made her a mahometan and she could no more according to the prejudice of that religion regard me but with horror however not being able to live longer at tefflis weary of myself and of life i returned to ispahan my first words to my father were bitter i reproached him with having put his daughter in a place into which none can enter without changing their religion you have brought upon your family said i to him the wrath of heaven and of the sun that lights you you have done worse than if you had sullied the elements since you have defiled the soul of your daughter which is not less pure i shall die of grief and love but may my death be the only punishment that god may make you feel at these words i went out and during two years i passed my life in looking at the walls of the seraglio and considering the part where my sister might be exposing myself a thousand times every day to be killed by the eunuchs who keep their round about these dreadful apartments at last my father died and the sultana whom my sister waited on observing her beauty increased every day became jealous of her     and married her to an eunuch who passionately wished for her by this means my sister left the seraglio and took with her eunuch an house at ispahan i was above three months without an opportunity of speaking to her the eunuch the most jealous of all men always putting me off with frivolous excuses at last i entered this seraglio and was obliged to talk through a latticed window the eyes of a lynx could not have discovered her so hid was she with her dress and veils and i only knew her by her voice what was my emotion when i saw myself so near her and so far from her i restrained myself for i was observed as to her it seemed to me that she shed some tears her husband offered to make some trifling excuses but i treated him as the most contemptible of slaves he was quite confounded when he found i talked to my sister in a language unknown to him this was the ancient persic which is our sacred language what my sister said i is it true that you have renounced the religion of your fathers i know that on entering the seraglio you must have made profession of mahometism but tell me hath your heart consented like your mouth to quit the religion which permits me to love you and for whom have you quitted that religion which ought to be so dear to us for a wretch yet marked with the chains he wore who if he was a man would be the last of mankind my brother said she this man of whom you speak is my husband i must honour him all unworthy as he appears to you and i should also be the last of women if— ah my sister interrupted i you are a guebre he is not your husband nor can he be if you was a believer like your forefathers you could not but regard him as a monster alas said she at what a distance does that religion shew itself to me scarce had i known its precepts when i was obliged to renounce it you must observe that the language i speak is not very familiar to me and that i take the     utmost pains to express myself but be assured that the remembrance of our childhood always gives me pleasure but since that time i have known only false joys that there hath not passed a day of my life in which i have not thought of you that you have a greater share in my marriage than you can believe and that it had not been concluded but from a hope of seeing you again but this day which hath cost me so much will yet cost me more i see you are quite beside yourself my husband foams with rage and jealousy i shall see you no more i without doubt speak to you for the last time of my life if so my brother it will not be long at these words she wept and finding herself incapable of talking she left me the most disconsolate of all men three or four days after i desired to see my sister the barbarous eunuch would indeed have hindered me but besides that these kind of husbands have not the same authority over their wives as others he loved my sister so passionately that he knew not how to refuse her any thing i saw her again in the same place and with the same veils attended by two slaves which made me have recourse to our own language my sister said i how comes it that i cannot see you without finding myself in this terrible situation these walls which keep you shut up these bolts and iron gates these miserable attendants who watch you put me in a rage how have you lost that sweet liberty which your ancestors enjoyed your mother who was so chaste did not give herself to her husband to guard her virtue but her virtue itself was her guard they both lived happy together in mutual confidence and the simplicity of their manners was to them a treasure a thousand times more precious than that false splendor which you seem to enjoy in this sumptuous house in losing your religion you have lost your liberty your happiness and that precious quality which constitutes the honour of your sex but what is yet worse is that you are not   0 the wife for that you cannot be but a slave to a slave who hath been degraded of manhood ah my brother said she respect my husband respect the religion i have embraced according to which religion i cannot hear you nor speak to you without guilt what my sister cried i quite in a transport do you then believe this religion to be true ah said she how well would it be for me if it was not i have made too great a sacrifice to it not to believe in it and if my doubts—at these words she was silent yes your doubts my sister are well founded whatever they are what can you expect from a religion which renders you unhappy here in this world and leaves you no hope of another consider our religion is the most ancient in the whole world that it hath always flourished in persia and hath no other origin but with that empire whose beginning is not known it was nothing but chance which introduced mahometism there that sect was established there not by the power of persuasion but by that of conquest if our natural princes had not been weak you would have seen the worship of the ancient magi flourishing yet review those ages which are passed every thing informs you of magism and nothing of the mahometan sect which many thousand of years after was but then in its infancy but said she though my religion should be of a more modern date than yours it is at least more pure since it adores none but god whereas you also adore the sun the stars fire and even the elements i see my sister that you have learned among the mussulmans to calumniate our holy religion we worship neither the stars nor the elements and our fathers never worshipped them they never raised temples to them they never offered sacrifices to them they only paid them a religious worship of an inferior kind as to the works and manifestations of the divinity but my sister in the name of him who enlightens us receive this sacred book     which i have brought you it is a book of our legislator zoroaster peruse it without prejudice receive in your heart the rays of light which will enlighten you as you read it remember your fathers who for so long a time honoured the sun in the city of the holy balk and lastly do thou remember me who hope neither for ease happiness nor life but from your change there quite transported i quitted her and left her alone to determine the most important affair that i could have in my life i came there again two days after i said nothing to her waiting with silence the sentence of my life or of my death thou art beloved my brother said she to me and by a guebre i have struggled a long time but gods what difficulties doth love remove how relieved am i i fear nothing now but loving you too much i can fix no bounds to my love but the excess is lawful ah how well does this suit the state of my heart but you who have known how to break the chains which my mind itself had forged how will you break those that tie my hands from this moment i give myself to thee show by the readiness with which you receive me how dear this present is to you my brother the first time that i embrace you i believe i shall die in your arms i can never fully express the joy i felt at these words i did believe and actually saw myself in a moment the most happy of all mankind i saw all the wishes which i had been five and twenty years of my life in forming nearly accomplished and all those uneasinesses vanished which had rendered my life so burthensome but when i had a little enjoyed these delightful thoughts i found that i was not so near my happiness as i had so hastily imagined within myself though i had surmounted the greatest of all obstacles the vigilance of her guardians was to be deceived i did not dare to confide this secret of my life with any body i had nobody but my sister and she nobody but me to consult if my scheme     failed i ran the risque of being imprisoned but i saw no pain more tormenting than that of miscarrying we agreed that she should send to me for a cloak that her father had left her and that i should put a file into it to saw the lattice of her window which opened to the street and a ropeladder to descend by and after that not to visit her but that i should walk every night under the window to wait till she could execute her design i passed fifteen whole nights without seeing any body because she had not found a favourable opportunity at length the sixteenth night i heard a saw at work from time to time the work was discontinued and in those intervals my fear was inexpressible after an hours labour i saw her fasten the cord she then put herself on it and slided down into my arms i thought no more of danger and staid some time without moving from thence i then conducted her out of the city where i had a horse ready i placed her behind me and rode with all the haste possible from a place which might have been very fatal to us we reached before day the house of a guebre in a desert place where he lived retired by the labour of his hands not thinking it proper to stay with him by his advice we entered into a thick forest and hid ourselves in the hollow of an old oak tree till the noise of our flight should be over we lived both together in this place without being seen continually repeating how we would always love one another waiting an opportunity when some guebre priest should perform the ceremony of our marriage ordered by our sacred books my sister said i to her how holy is this union nature hath united us our holy law will again unite us at length a priest came to satisfy our impatient love he performed in the house of a peasant the whole marriage ceremony he blessed us and wished us a thousand times all the vigour of gustaspe and the sanctity of hohoraspe soon after we quitted persia where     we were not in safety and retired to georgia we lived there a year every day more delighted with each other but as my money was near expended and as i feared the distress of my sister more than of myself i left her to seek some assistance from our relations never was there a parting so tender but my journey was not only unprofitable but fatal for finding on one hand our whole estate confiscated on the other my relations in a manner incapable of assisting me i brought away no more money than was sufficient for my journey back but what was my despair at not finding my sister some days before my arrival the tartars had made an incursion into the town where she was and as they found she was beautiful they took her and sold her to some jews who were going into turky and left only a little girl of whom she had been delivered a few months before i followed these jews and got up to them three leagues off my prayers my tears were in vain they demanded of me thirty tomans for her and would not abate one after i had asked every body implored the help of both christian and turkish priests i applied to an armenian merchant sold both my daughter and myself to him for five and thirty tomans i went to the jews paid them thirty tomans and carried the other five to my sister whom i had not yet seen thou art at liberty my sister said i to her and i may embrace you here are five tomans which i bring you i am sorry the sale of myself would fetch no more what cried she are you sold yes replied i ah unhappy man what hast thou done was i not miserable enough without your endeavouring to make me more so your liberty consoled me and your slavery will send me to the grave ah my brother how cruel is your love and where is my daughter i have not seen her i have sold her also said i we both melted into tears and were no more able to talk i went afterwards to wait upon my master and my sister got there     almost as soon as myself she fell down upon her knees before my master i ask slavery of you said she as others do liberty take me you may sell me at a higher price than my husband this then occasioned a struggle between us which drew tears from my master unhappy man said she did you think i would accept of my liberty at the expence of thine sir behold here two unfortunate persons who must die if you separate us i offer myself to you pay me perhaps that money and my services may one day obtain from you what i dare not ask of you it is your interest not to separate us be assured that his life is at my disposal the armenian who was a good tempered man was touched with our misfortunes both of you serve me said he with fidelity and zeal i promise you that in a year you shall have your liberty i see that neither of you merit the misfortunes of your condition if when at liberty you should be as happy as you deserve to be if fortune should smile upon you i am certain you will recompence me for the loss i shall sustain we both embraced his knees and went the voyage with him we mutually assisted each other in the labours of servitude and i was always delighted when i had done that work which belonged to my sister the end of the year at length arrived our master kept his word and gave us our liberty we returned to tefflis there i found an old friend of my father who practised physic in that city with success he lent me some money with which i trafficked some affairs afterwards called me to smyrna where i settled i have lived here six years and i enjoy here the most delightful and most agreeable society in

he in the manner we conduct it it is no more than an amusement but how have not you your head always filled with the affairs of another are not you perpetually busied with affairs that do not concern you you are right those affairs do not give us any concern because we do not interest ourselves the least in them and this is the reason that the profession is not so fatiguing as you supposed it to be when i saw he treated the matter with so much ease i added sir i have not yet seen your study i believe not for i have none at all when i took this office i wanted money to pay for it i sold my library and the bookseller who purchased it out of the great number of volumes it contained left me only my account book but this gives me no concern we judges do not puff ourselves up with useless knowledge what business have we with so many volumes of law almost all cases are hypothetical and out of the general rule but may not that be sir said i because you put them out of the general rule for in short why have all the people in the world laws if they do not make use of them and how can they be used if they do not know them if you was but acquainted with the courts of justice answered the magistrate you would not talk in this manner we have living books who are the counsellors they study for us and take upon themselves our instruction and do not they sometimes take upon themselves to deceive you replied i     you would do well to guard yourselves against their arts they have arms with which they attack your equity it would be well you had some to defend it and not to suffer

at venice thou couldst never have imagined that i should become a greater metaphysician than i was however so it is and you will be convinced of it when you have endured this inundation of my philosophy the most sensible philosophers who have reflected upon the nature of god have declared him to be a being most absolutely perfect but they have very greatly abused this idea they have enumerated all the different perfections that man is capable of possessing or imagining and with these they load this idea of the divinity not considering that these attributes are frequently opposite to one another and that they cannot subsist in the same subject without destroying themselves the poets of the west say that a painter desirous to make a portrait of the goodess of beauty assembled the handsomest grecian women and selected from each what was most agreeable of which several beauties he composed one whole to resemble the most beautiful of all the goddesses if a man from hence should conclude that she was fair and brown that she had black eyes and grey and that her countenance was mild and fierce he would pass for a fool god often wants a perfection which would render him very imperfect but he is never limited but by himself he is his own necessity thus     though god is all powerful he cannot break his promises nor deceive man very often too the inability is not in him but in relative things and this is the reason why he cannot change the essence of things so that it is not a matter of wonder that some of our divines have dared to deny the infinite foreknowledge of god upon this foundation that it is incompatible with his justice as bold as this opinion may be there is in metaphysics what favours it greatly according to the principles of that it is not possible that god can foresee what depends upon the determination of free agents because what hath not existed is not in being and consequently cannot be known which having no properties cannot be perceived god cannot read in the will what is not in it or see in the soul a thing which is not yet existing in it for till she hath determined the action which she determines upon is not in her the soul is the maker of her own determination but there are some circumstances in which she is so irresolute that she knows not on which side to determine sometimes she may even do it only to make use of her liberty in such a manner that god cannot see this determination beforehand neither in the action of the soul nor in the actions which the objects make upon her how then can god foresee those things which depend upon the determination of free agents he could foresee them but in two ways by conjecture which is irreconcileable with infinite foreknowledge or otherwise he must see them as necessary effects which infallibly follow a cause which produces them as infallibly for the soul must be free upon this supposition and yet in the act she would be no more so than one billiard ball is free to lie still when it is pushed by another however do not think i would set bounds to the knowledge of god as he makes his creature act according to his own mind he knows all that he wills to know but though he can see every thing he does     not always make use of that power he commonly leaves the creature at liberty to act or not to act that he may leave him a power to merit or demerit it is for this end then that he renounces his right which he hath to act upon her and to determine her actions but when he wills to know any thing he always knows it because that he needs only to will that it happen as he sees it and to determine his creatures according to his will thus it is that he brings forth what shall happen from a number of things merely possible by fixing by his decrees the future determinations of the minds of his creatures and depriving them of that power which he hath given them to act or not to act if the comparison may be used with respect to what is above all comparison a monarch is ignorant of what his ambassador will do in a certain important affair if he would know it he need only order him to act in such a manner and he may be assured the thing will happen as he directs the koran and the books of the jews constantly oppose this doctrine of absolute foreknowledge god appears there throughout ignorant of the future determination of human minds and it seems that this was the first truth moses taught mankind god places adam in a terrestrial paradise upon condition that he should not eat of a certain fruit an absurd command from a being who knew the future determination of the soul for in short could such a being make that the condition of his favour without rendering it ridiculous it is as if a man who knew of the taking of bagdad should say to another i will give you an hundred tomans if bagdad is not taken would not this be a very bad jest my dear rhedi why so much philosophy god is above whom we cannot perceive even in the clouds indeed we have no knowledge of him but in his precepts he is immense spiritual infinite what his greatness is we may conclude from our own weakness     always to humble ourselves is always to adore

difference between profession and belief between belief and practice religion is less a matter of holiness than of dispute in which every body is concerned courtiers soldiers even the women oppose themselves against it to the clergy demanding from them a proof of what they are determined not to believe it is not because they would be determined by reason and that they have taken the pains to examine the truth or falsehood of the religion which they reject they are rebels who have felt the yoke and have shook it off before they knew what it was nor are they better fixed in their

it—i have in six months time run through spain and portugal and i have lived among a people who despising all others do the french alone the honour of hating them gravity is the shining character of these two nations it shows itself chiefly there two ways by spectacles and mustachios the spectacles demonstratively show that he who wears them is a man consummate in the sciences and buried in profound reading to such a degree as to have impaired his sight and every nose that is thus ornamented or loaded may pass without contradiction for the nose of a learned man as to the mustachio it is respectable in itself and independently of any consequences though great benefits have been sometimes drawn from it for the service of the king and the honour of the nation as hath been made appear by a famous portuguese general  in the eastindies for being in want of money he cut off one of his mustachios and sent to demand of the inhabitants of goa twenty thousand pistoles upon this pledge they very readily accepted it and he afterwards honourably redeemed his mustachio it is easily conceived that such grave and phlegmatic people as these may be proud and so they are they commonly found it upon these two considerable points those who live upon the continent of spain and portugal find their hearts greatly elated if they are those who are called the old christians that is to say not originally descended from those who in the latter centuries were forced by the inquisition to embrace     christianity they who live in the indies are no less elated when they consider that they have the sublime merit to be as they say men with white skins there never was in the seraglio of the grand signior a sultana so proud of her beauty as the oldest great ugly cur born is of his olivewhite complexion when in the town of mexico sitting at his door with his legs crossed a man of such consequence so compleat a creature would not work for all the treasures in the world nor ever persuade himself by a vile mechanic industry to venture the honour and dignity of his skin for you must know that when a man hath a certain merit in spain as for example when he can add to the qualities i have been speaking of that of being the proprietor of a long sword or hath learned of his father the art of making a wretched noise on an ill tuned guitar he works no more his honour is interested in the repose of his limbs he who sits still ten hours a day acquires exactly one moiety more of respect than one who rests but five because honour is here to be acquired upon a chair but though these invincible enemies to labour make a show of philosophical tranquility they have yet none in their heart for they are always in love they are the first men in the world to die languishing under the window of their mistresses and every spaniard who hath not a cold cannot pass for a gallant they are in the first place bigots in the next jealous they take great care not to venture their wives to the attacks of a soldier disabled with wounds or to a decrepid magistrate but they will shut them up with a servent novice who meekly casts his eyes down to the earth or a robust franciscan who as devoutly turns them upwards they allow their wives to appear with their bosoms naked but they will not let their heel be seen lest they should be catched by the foot the rigours of love are universally admitted to be great they are much more so to the spaniards the women relieve their pains but they only do so to   0 change them and frequently a long and troublesome remembrance of an extinguished passion continues with them they observe little pieces of politeness which in france would appear oddly applied for example a captain never corrects his soldier without first asking his leave and the inquisition never burns a jew without making an apology to him the spaniards who are not burned appear so fond of the inquisition that it would be illnatured to deprive them of it i would only have another erected not for heretics but for heresarchs who attribute to some little monkish tricks the same efficacy as to the seven sacraments who worship every thing which they should only reverence and who are so extremely devout that they are hardly christians you may meet with wit and good sense among the spaniards but look for neither in their books view but one of their libraries romances on this side and school divines on the other you would say that they had been made and collected together by some secret enemy to human reason the only good one of all their books is that which was wrote to show the ridiculousness of all the others in the new world they have made immense discoveries and as yet know not their own continent they have not yet discovered there what

arrives at its end with the least difficulty of this kind that which leads men in a way which best suits their disposition is the most perfect if under a mild government the subjects are as obedient as under a severe one the first is preferable because it is most conformable to reason and because severity is a foreign motive be assured rhedi that in a state punishments more or less cruel do not procure greater obedience to the laws in a country where chastisements are moderate they are as much dreaded as in those where they are tyrannical and dreadful let the government be mild let it be cruel the punishment is always gradual the punishment inflicted is greater or less as the crime is greater or less the imagination conforms itself to the manners of the country in which we live eight days imprisonment or a lighter punishment affects the mind of an european brought up under a mild government as much as the loss of an arm intimidates an asiatic men affix a certain degree of fear to

venice if there be a god rhedi he must necessarily be just if he was not such he would be the worst and most imperfect of all beings justice is a relation of congruity which really subsists between two things this relation is always the same whatever being considers it whether it be god or an angel or lastly a man it is true men do not always see these relations often indeed when they do see them they deviate from them and their interest is always what they see best justice raises her voice but it is with difficulty she makes herself heard amidst the tumult of the passions men may do injustice because it is their interest to commit it and because they prefer their own private satisfaction to that of others it is always with a view to themselves that they act nobody is wicked for nothing he must have some reason that determines him and this reason is always a reason of interest but it is impossible that god should ever commit any injustice from the instant that we suppose he sees justice it must necessarily be that he follows it for as he hath no want of any thing and is allsufficient in himself he would be the most wicked of all beings because he would be such without gaining any thing thus though there was no god we ought always to love justice that is we should endeavour to resemble that being of whom we have so amiable an idea and who if he exists must necessarily be just though we should be free from the yoke of religion we ought not to be so from that of equity this it is rhedi that makes me believe that justice is eternal and depends not upon human compacts and if it was dependent upon them it would be a terrible truth which should be concealed     even from ourselves we are surrounded by men stronger than we are they can injure us in a thousand different ways three times in four they might do it with impunity what a satisfaction to us to know that there is in them in the heart of all these men an inward principle which fights in our favour and secures us from their attempts if it was not for this we should be in continual fear we should pass by men as by lions and we should not be assured one moment of our goods honour and life all these considerations make me angry at those doctors who represent god as a being who exercises his power with tyranny who make him act in a manner that we ourselves would not for fear of offending him who charge him with all those imperfections that he punishes in us and by their contradictory opinions represent him as an evil being by and by as a being who hates evil and punishes it when a man

been listened to it is unknown how this affair failed neither those who made the proposal nor those who rejected it were sensible of the consequences chance did the office of reason and policy and saved the empire from a greater danger than it would have gone through from the loss of a battle and of two cities by     banishing the armenians it is supposed they would have rooted out at once all the traders and very near all the artificers in the kingdom i am certain that the great chahabbas would rather have cut off both his arms than have signed such an order and he would have been of opinion that by thus sending to the mogul and the other kings of the indies the most industrious of his subjects he had given them half his dominions the persecution which our mahometan zealots exercised against the guebres obliged them to remove in multitudes into the indies and deprived persia of that people so much given to tillage and who alone by their industry were in a way to get the

that very religion it wanted to render so flourishing if we could reason without prejudice i know not mirza but it may be good for a state that there should be several religions in it it is observable that the members of the tolerated religions commonly make themselves more useful to their country than those of the established religion because being excluded from all honours they can only render themselves considerable by their opulence they are led to acquire it by their industry and to embrace the most toilsome employments in the society besides as all religions contain precepts useful to society it is good that they should be observed with zeal now what is there more capable of animating this zeal than a multiplicity of religions they are rivals who never forgive any thing this

is not the princes interest to permit several religions in his kingdom tho all the sects in the world were to get together in it it would not be any prejudice to it for there is not one which doth not enjoin obedience and that doth not preach up submission i acknowledge that history is full of religious wars but we must take care to observe it was not the multiplicity of religions that produced these wars it was the intolerating spirit which animated that which thought she had the power of governing it was the spirit of proselytism which the jews contracted from the egyptians and which from them hath passed like an epidemic and popular disease to mahometans and christians it is in short the spirit of enthusiasm the progress of which can be considered only as a total eclipse of human

public every day separately exclusive of the visits they make in general at places where every body meet but as this is too short a way it is reckoned as nothing in the rules of their ceremonial they injure the doors more with knocking at them than the winds and storms if all the porters visiting lists were to be examined their names would be found every day mangled a thousand ways in swiss

passion is indeed always engraved upon their hearts but imagination and education mould it a thousand ways this difference which is founded between man and man is more perceivable between nation and nation it may be laid down as a maxim that in every state the desire of glory increases with the liberty of the subjects and diminishes with it glory is never the companion of slavery a sensible man said to me the other day we are in france in many respects more free than you are in persia and therefore here there is a greater love of glory this happy delusion makes a frenchman do with pleasure and inclination what your sultan obtains only from his slaves by continually setting before their eyes rewards and punishments therefore among us the prince is jealous for the honour of the meanest of his subjects there are for the support of it the most respectable tribunals this is the sacred treasure of the nation and the only one of which the sovereign is not master for he could not be so without acting against his own interest so that when a subject finds himself injured in his honour by his prince either by an unjust preference or by the smallest mark of contempt he quits immediately his court his employment and his service and retires to his estate the difference between     the french troops and yours is that the one composed of slaves naturally cowards only surmount the fear of death by that of punishment which railes in the soul a new kind of terror which renders them insensible instead of which the others present themselves to dangers with delight and banish fear by a satisfaction which is superior to it but the sanctuary of honour reputation and virtue seems to be seated in republics and in those states where the word country may be pronounced at rome at athens at lacedæmon honour was the only payment for the most signal services a crown of oak or laurel a statue or an inscription was an immense recompence for a battle won or a city taken there a man who had performed a brave action found himself sufficiently recompensed by the action itself he could not behold one of his countrymen without being sensible of the pleasure of having been his benefactor he reckoned the number of his services by that of his fellowcitizens every man is capable of doing good to another but it is being like to god to contribute to the happiness of a whole society but must not this noble emulation be wholly extinct in the heart of your persians among whom employments and honours are only derived from the caprice of the sovereign reputation and virtue are there only considered as imaginary if not accompanied by the favour of the prince with which alone they spring up and die a man who enjoys the public esteem is never sure that he shall not be dishonoured the

difficult to me to make thee understand what this is because we have not a right idea of it the french formerly especially the nobility followed scarcely any other laws than those of this point of honour they regulated the whole conduct of their lives and they were so strict that they could not without suffering what was worse than death i do not say infringe but not even elude the least punctilio of them when they had occasion to settle any difference they seldom prescribed more than one method to decide it that was by duel which cut off all difficulties but what was the worst part of it was that frequently the trial was made between other parties besides those who were interested in the affair how little soever a person might know another he was obliged to enter into the dispute and to expose his person in the same manner as if he himself was in anger such a one always thought himself honoured by the choice and so flattering a distinction one who would not have been willing to give four pistoles to a man to save him and all his family from the gibbet would make no difficulty to run the risque of his life for him a thousand times this manner of decision was badly enough contrived for if one was more dextrous or stronger than another it does not follow that he had more reason on his side therefore the     kings have forbidden it under very severe penalties but this is in vain honour which will always reign rebels and will acknowledge no laws so that the french are in a great state of violence for these laws of honour oblige a wellbred man to revenge himself when he hath been affronted but on the other hand justice punishes him with the severest penalties when he hath done so if men follow the laws of honour they die upon a scaffold if those of justice

but they are born all united to one another a son is born near his father and there he continues here is society and the cause of it the law of nations is better understood in europe than in asia yet

ought to administer justice between citizen and citizen every nation ought to do the same between themselves and another nation in     this second distribution of justice no other maxims ought to be employed but those in the first for nation and nation there is seldom need of a third to judge between them because the subjects of their disputes are for the most part always plain and easy to be determined the interests of the two nations are generally so separate that nothing more is necessary but a love of justice to find it out they can scarcely mistake the proper cause it is not the same with the differences that happen between private persons as they live in society their interests are so mixed and so confounded and there are so many different kinds of them that it is necessary for a third person to clear up what the covetousness of the parties endeavour to obscure there are but two kinds of just wars one which is waged to repulse the attack of an enemy the other to succour an ally who is attacked it would not be justice to enter into a war upon the private quarrel of a prince unless the case was so heinous as to merit the death of the prince or the people who committed it thus a prince should not engage in a war because he hath been refused an honour which was his right or for any unsuitable demeanor towards his ambassadors and such similar cases no more than a private person ought to kill him who refuses him precedency the reason is this as a declaration of war ought to be an act of justice wherein the punishment should always be in proportion to the fault it should be inquired whether the party against whom war is declared merits death for to make war against any person is to be willing to punish him with death in the law of nations the severest act of justice is war since the effect of it is the destruction of society reprisals are of the second degree to proportion the punishment to the offence is a law which no tribunals could ever avoid observing the third act of justice is to deprive a prince of the advantages that he might derive from us always proportioning the punishment to the offence the fourth     act of justice which ought to be the most frequent is the renunciation of the alliance of a people against whom we have reason to complain this punishment answers to that of banishment appointed by courts of justice to cut off delinquents from the community thus a prince whose alliance we renounce is cut off from our society and is no longer one of its members a greater affront cannot be done to a prince than to renounce his alliance nor a greater honour than to contract one with him there is nothing among men that can be more honourable or more useful to mankind than to be always attentive to their preservation but that the alliance may be binding it must be just so that an alliance concluded between two nations to oppress a third is not lawful and may be broke without a fault it is not suitable to the honour and dignity of a prince to ally himself to a tyrant an egyptian monarch once remonstrated to a king of samos upon his cruelty and tyranny and called upon him to amend as he did not he sent him word that he renounced his friendship and alliance conquest of itself gives no right when a society subsists it is a security for peace and for reparation of injuries and if it is destroyed or dispersed it is a monument of tyranny treaties of peace are so sacred among men that they seem as if they were the dictates of nature which reclaims its rights they are always lawful when the conditions of them are such that both parties may preserve themselves without which that of the two societies which would perish deprived of its natural defence by peace may seek it by war for nature which hath

of his own sometimes the headdresses mount up gradually to a great height and a sudden revolution makes them descend again at once there was a time when the immense loftiness of them left the face of a woman in the middle of her body another time the     feet occupied the same situation the heels formed a kind of pedestals which raised the women into the air who will credit this the architects have often been obliged to raise lower and enlarge the doors as the dress of the women required these changes and the rules of their art have been subjected to their caprice you shall sometimes see

inconstancy with which they are daily changing them when i tell thee that they despise     every thing that is foreign i speak only of trifles for upon important occasions they seem to be diffident even of themselves to their own degradation they are very ready to allow other nations are wiser provided they will allow that they are better dressed they are quite willing to submit themselves to the laws of a rival nation provided french perukemakers may decide like legislators the shape of foreign perukes to them nothing appears so glorious as to see the taste of their cooks reign from north to south and the ordonnances of their tirewomen extended through all the toilettes of europe with these noble advantages what does it signify to them if their good sense comes to them from abroad and that they have taken from their neighbours every thing that relates to their government political and civil who would think that a kingdom the most ancient and the most powerful in europe should have been governed about ten ages by laws which were not made for them if the french had been conquered it would not be difficult to comprehend this but they are the conquerors they have abandoned the ancient laws made by their first kings in the general assemblies of the nation and what is more extraordinary the roman laws which they have taken instead of them were partly made and partly digested by the emperors cotemporary with their legislators and that the theft might be complete and that all their good sense might be derived from others they have adopted all the constitutions of the popes and made them a new part of their law a new kind of slavery in these latter times they have it is true digested in writing some statutes of cities and provinces but they are almost all taken from the roman law this multitude of adopted and if i may say naturalized laws is so great that it oppresses equally justice and the judge but these volumes of laws are nothing in comparison to that terrible army of glossers commentators and compilers a set of men as weak     as to the justness of their understanding as they are strong from their number this is not all these foreign laws have introduced formalities whose excess is a disgrace to human reason it would be very difficult to determine whether formality hath been more hurtful when it got into the law or when it took place in physic whether

cii usbek to ibben at smyrna the most powerful states in europe are those of the emperor the kings of france spain and england italy and a large part of germany are divided into a great many little states the princes of which are strictly speaking the martyrs of sovereignty our glorious sultans have more wives than some of these petty princes have subjects the states of italy which are not so united are more to be pitied their dominions are as much exposed as so many caravanseras they are forced to admit the first who come they are therefore obliged to attach themselves to some great prince and give him a share of their fears rather than of their assistance the greater part of the governments in europe are monarchical or rather they are so called for i do not know whether there ever was one truly so at least it is difficult that they should subsist long without being corrupted it is a state of violence that always degenerates into despotism or into a republic the power can never be equally divided between the people and the prince the balance is too difficult to be preserved the power must decrease on one side whilst it     increases on the other but the balance is generally in favour of the prince who is at the head of the armies accordingly the power of the european kings is very great and it may be said they have as much as they please but they do not exercise it so extensively as our sultans first because they are not willing to offend the manners and religion of the people secondly because it is not their interest to extend it so far nothing more reduces princes to the condition of their subjects than the immense power they exercise over them nothing subjects them more to the turns and caprices of fortune the custom in some states of putting to death all those who offend them upon the least signal that they make destroys that proportion which ought to be observed between crimes and punishments which is in a manner the soul of a state and the harmony of empires and this proportion carefully observed by the christian princes hath given them a very great advantage over our sultans a persian who hath by imprudence or misfortune drawn upon himself the displeasure of his prince is sure to die the smallest fault or the least caprice reduces him to this necessity but if he had attempted the life of his sovereign if he had designed to give up places of importance into the hands of the enemy he still would but lose his life he runs no greater risque in this latter case than in the former so that under the least disgrace seeing certain death before him and nothing worse to fear he is naturally led to disturb the state and to conspire against his sovereign the only resource he hath left it is not the same with the great men in europe from whom their disgrace takes away only the good will and favour of their prince they retire from court and think of nothing but enjoying a quiet life and the advantages of their birth as they seldom lose their lives but for hightreason they are fearful of falling into it from a consideration of how much they have to lose and how     little to gain this is the reason that we see few rebellions here and few princes perish by violent deaths if in that unlimited power our princes have they did not take so many precautions for the security of their lives they would not live a day and if they had not in their pay a great number of troops to tyrannize over the rest of their subjects their empire would not subsist a month it is not above three or four ages ago that a king of france took guards contrary to the custom of those times to secure himself from some ruffians whom a petty prince of asia had sent to assassinate him till then kings lived quiet in the midst of their subjects as fathers amidst their children though the kings of france cannot of their own motion take away the life of any of their subjects like our sultans they have however always the power of extending mercy to all criminals it is sufficient that a man hath been so happy as to see the august countenance of his prince to remove his unworthiness to live these monarchs are like the sun who carries warmth and

the other day the worst method the asiatic princes could take is to shut themselves up as they do they think to render themselves more respected but they make the royalty respected and not the king and attach the minds of the subjects to a certain throne and not to a certain person that invisible power which governs is always the same to the people though ten kings who are known only by name have their throats cut one after another the subjects are sensible of no difference it is just as if     they had been governed by their spirits if the detestable parricide of the great king henry iv here had given his blow to one of the indian kings master of the royal signet and of a great treasure which would have seemed to have been heaped up for him he would quietly have assumed the reins of the empire without any persons thinking to inquire after his king or his family and children we wonder that there is scarcely ever any change in the governments of the eastern princes whence comes this if it is not that they are tyrannical and terrible changes cannot be effected but by the prince or by the people now there the princes will take care not to make a change because being in so high a degree of power they have all they can have if they were to make any change it could not but be to their own prejudice as to the subjects if any one of them forms such a design he cannot execute it upon the state it would be necessary he should counterbalance immediately a power formidable and always the only one he wants time as well as the means but he has no more than to go to the source of this power and he wants nothing but an arm and a moment the murderer mounts the throne whilst the monarch descends falls and expires at his feet a malecontent in europe thinks of carrying on some private intelligence to go over to the enemy to get some strong place into his power to excite murmurings among the subjects a malecontent in asia aims directly at the prince surprises strikes and overthrows he blots out his very memory in an instant slave and master in an instant usurper and lawful unhappy the king who hath but one head he seems to collect all his power upon it only to point

of europe are not equally subject to their princes for instance the impatient humour of the english seldom give their king time to make his power heavy passive obedience and nonresistance are no virtues in their esteem they say upon this head very extraordinary things according to them there is but one tie that can bind men which is that of gratitude a husband a wife a father and son are not bound to each other but either by the love they bear to one another or by mutual services and these different motives of acknowledgment are the origin of every kingdom and of all societies but if a prince very far from making his subjects live happy endeavours to oppress and ruin them the foundation of obedience ceases nothing ties them nothing attaches them to him and they return to their natural liberty they maintain that no unlimited power can be lawful because it never could lawfully commence for we cannot say they give to another more power over us than we have ourselves now we have not an unlimited power over ourselves for instance we cannot take away our own lives no person then upon earth conclude they hath a right to such a power high treason is nothing according to them but a crime committed by the weaker against the stronger by disobeying him in whatever manner he does so accordingly the people of england when they found themselves strongest in opposition to one of their kings declared it to be high treason in a king to make war upon his subjects they have therefore good reason to say that the precept in their koran which enjoins obedience to the powers is not very difficult to be followed as it is impossible for them not to observe     it since it is not to the most virtuous that they are obliged to submit but to the strongest the english say that one of their kings having overcome and taken prisoner a prince who disputed the crown with him and reproaching him with his treachery and perfidiousness it is not above a moment replied the unfortunate

to mankind for the bad use to which they are daily applied i have heard say that the single invention of bombs hath destroyed the liberty of all the people of europe the princes being no longer willing to intrust the guard of towns to the citizens who would surrender them at the first bomb made that a pretext for keeping a large body of regular troops with which they afterwards oppressed their subjects thou knowest that since the invention of gunpowder there is no place impregnable that is to say usbek that there is not any longer an assylum upon earth against injustice and violence i always tremble left they should arrive at last at the discovery of some secret which may furnish them with a shorter way to destroy   0 mankind and to depopulate whole nations and whole kingdoms thou hast read the historians reflect seriously upon them almost all monarchies have been founded only upon the ignorance of arts and have only been destroyed by their being too much cultivated the ancient empire of persia may furnish us with a domestic example i have not been long in europe but i have heard wise men talk of the ravages of chymistry it seems to be a fourth scourge which ruins mankind and destroys them singly but continually whilst that of war plague and famine destroys them in large bodies but by intervals how have we been benefited by the invention of the compass and the discovery of so many nations who have rather communicated to us their distempers than their riches gold and silver have been established by a general agreement to be the price of all merchandizes and the measure of their value because these metals were scarce and unfit for other uses what benefit was it to us then that they should become more common and that to mark the value of any commodity we should have two or three tokens instead of one this was only a greater inconvenience but on the other hand this invention hath been very hurtful to the countries that have been discovered whole nations have been discovered and those who have escaped death have been reduced to so cruel a slavery that the relation of it makes the mussulmans tremble happy ignorance of the children of mahomet

agree with thee more than thou dost with thyself hast thou well reflected on the barbarous and unhappy condition into which we should be sunk by the loss of the arts there is no need to imagine it we may see it there are yet people upon earth among whom an ape tolerably well taught might live with honour he would be nearly upon a level with the rest of the inhabitants he would not be thought an odd being nor a whimsical character he would pass as well as another and would even be distinguished for his politeness thou sayest that almost all the founders of empires have been ignorant of the arts i will not deny that these barbarous people may have like an impetuous torrent spread themselves over the earth and covered with their savage armies the most polite states but observe they learned the arts or made those they conquered exercise them otherwise their power would have passed away like the noise of thunder and tempests thou sayest thou art afraid lest they should invent some crueller method of destruction than that now used no if such a fatal invention should be discovered by the law of nations it would be prohibited and by the unanimous consent of nations it would be suppressed it is not the interest of princes to conquer by such means it is their business to gain subjects and not lands thou dost complain of the invention of gunpowder and     bombs you think it is bad that no place is any longer impregnable that is you think it is a bad thing that wars should be sooner terminated than they were before thou must have observed in reading of history that since the invention of gunpowder battles are much less bloody than formerly because armies hardly ever mix among one another and if an art in some partiticular case should be found prejudicial ought it on that account to be rejected thou thinkest that the arts render the people effeminate and by that means are the cause of the fall of empires thou mentionest the ruin of the antient persians which was the effect of their effeminacy but this example is far from being decisive since the greeks who conquered them so often and subdued them cultivated the arts with much greater assiduity when they say the arts make men effeminate they do not in the least speak of those people who work at them because they are never idle which of all vices is that which weakens courage most the question then is as to those who enjoy the fruits of them but as in a polite country those who reap the benefits of one art are obliged to cultivate another lest they should be reduced to a shameful poverty it follows that idleness and luxury are incompatible with the arts paris is perhaps the most luxurious city in the world and refines the most upon her pleasures and yet perhaps no people live harder than there that one man may live in luxury a hundred must be continually labouring a lady takes it into her head that she must appear at an assembly in a certain dress from this moment fifty artificers have no leisure either to eat drink or sleep she commands and is more readily obeyed than our monarch for interest is the greatest monarch upon earth this great application to labour this thirst to grow rich runs through every rank from the artificers up to the greatest men nobody loves to be poorer than him who is next beneath him you may see at     paris a man who hath sufficient to live upon to the end of the world who continually labours and ventures the shortening of his days to scrape up as he says wherewith to live the same spirit prevails through the whole nation nothing is seen there but labour and industry where then is the effeminate people of whom you talk so much i will suppose rhedi that in some kingdom they should suffer no arts but such as are absolutely necessary for the manuring of the lands which are nevertheless very numerous and that they should expel all those which only administer to pleasure or curiosity i will maintain that this would be one of the most miserable states that hath ever been in the world though the inhabitants should have resolution enough to shift without so many things as their wants require the people would decay daily and the state would become so weak that there would be no state so little that could not conquer it it would be easy to discuss this at large and to make thee sensible that the revenues of the subjects would be almost absolutely at an end and consequently those of the prince there would hardly be any of those mutual relations between citizens of the same faculties they would see an end to that circulation of riches and that increase of the revenues which arise from the dependance of the arts one upon another every one would live upon his land and raise no more than what would be precisely necessary to keep him from starving but as this sometimes is not the twentieth part of the revenue of the state the number of the inhabitants must diminish in proportion and there would be but a twentieth part of them remaining consider to how much the revenue of industry arises land produces annually to the owner but the twentieth part of its value but with a pistole worth of colours a painter will draw a picture that will produce him fifty the same may be said of goldsmiths workers in wool and silk and every kind of artificers from     all which we conclude rhedi that for a prince to be powerful it is necessary his subjects should live in affluence it is necessary he should endeavour to procure them every kind of superfluities with as much attention as the necessaries of life paris the   th of the

soon see the one and the other labouring to possess the mind of this and he on this account will be the subject of great contentions for under a young prince these two powers are always rivals but

of birth and i can answer for his conduct however thou must not imagine that these women who held this conversation were favourites of the prince they had not perhaps spoke to him twice in their lives which yet is a very easy thing to do with european princes but there is not a person who hath any employment at court in paris or in the provinces who hath not some woman through whose hands all the favours and sometimes all the injustice he can do always pass these women are constantly connected together and make a kind of republic the members of which are always busy mutually to succour and serve each other it is a new kind of state within another and a person at the court at paris or in the provinces who sees the ministers magistrates and prelates acting in their several stations if he knows nothing of the women who govern them is like a man indeed who sees a machine at work but who is unacquainted with the springs that move it dost thou think ibben that a woman agrees to be a mistress to a minister for the pleasure of lying with him what a strange thought this would be it is that she may every morning present him with five or six petitions and the goodness of their natural disposition appears in the zeal which they have to do good to a great number of unhappy people who procure them a hundred thousand livres a year they complain in persia that the kingdom is governed by

the great fault of these journalists is that they speak only of new books as if truth was always novel it seems to me that till a man hath read all the ancient books he hath no reason to prefer the new ones to them but when they impose it as a law upon themselves never to speak of works but such as are just hot from the forge they likewise lay themselves under another which is to be very tiresome they take care not to criticise those books from which they make their extracts for this reason because they are not able and indeed what man is bold enough to make ten or a dozen enemies

among her own principles the sea and land seem engaged in an eternal war every instant produces new conjunctions mankind in an abode so subject to changes are in a state likewise uncertain a hundred thousand causes may act capable of destroying them and much more of increasing or diminishing their number i shall not mention to thee those particular catastrophes so frequent among historians which have destroyed cities and whole kingdoms there are general ones which have often put the human species within an inch of destruction history is full of those universal plagues which have by turns desolated the whole earth of one among others that was so violent that it blasted the very roots of the plants and infected the whole known world to the very empire of cathai one degree more of corruption would perhaps in a single day have destroyed all human nature it is not two centuries ago that the most shameful of all distempers was felt in europe asia and africa it wrought in a little time prodigious effects that would have destroyed mankind if it had continued its progress with the same fury depressed with disease from their birth incapable of sustaining the weight of the duties of society they must miserably have perished what if the venom had been a little more exalted and without doubt it would have become so if they had not been     so happy as to find out so powerful a remedy as that which hath been discovered this disease perhaps attacking the parts of generation would have affected generation itself but why talk i of the destruction which might have happened to human nature hath it not in fact arrived and did not the deluge reduce it to one single family there are philosophers who maintain two creations that of things and that of man they cannot conceive that matter and things have been created but six thousand years that god deferred his works during all eternity and did not use but yesterday his creative power was it because he could or because he would not but if he could not at one time neither could he at another it must be then because he would not but as there is no succession of time in god if we admit that he willed any thing once he willed it always and from the beginning   however all historians mention a first father they present us with the birth of human nature is it not natural to think that adam was saved from some common destruction as noah was from the deluge and that these great events have been frequent upon earth since the creation but all these destructions have not been violent we see many parts of the earth grown weary as it were of furnishing subsistence to man how do we know if the whole earth hath not in it general causes slow and imperceptible of this weariness i was willing to give thee these general ideas before i answered more particularly to thy letter of the decrease of mankind which hath happened within these seventeen or eighteen centuries i shall show thee in a succeeding letter

thou inquirest from what cause the earth is less populous than it was formerly and if thou considerest carefully thou wilt find that this great difference comes from that which hath happened in our manners since the christian and mahometan religions have divided the roman world things have been greatly changed these two religions have been far from being so favourable to the propagation of our species as that of those lords of the universe among the romans polygamy was prohibited and by that law it had a very great advantage over the mahometan religion divorces were also allowed which gave it another and no less considerable advantage over the christian i find nothing so contradictory as this plurality of wives permitted by the holy koran and the order of satisfying them commanded in the same book converse with your wives says the prophet because ye are as necessary to them as their vestments and they are as necessary to you as your own vestments see here a precept which renders the life of a true mussulman very laborious he who hath the four wives settled by law and only as many concubines or slaves must not he be weighed down with so many vestments your wives are your tillage saith the prophet apply yourselves therefore to your tillage do good for your souls and you shall one day find your recompence i consider a good mussulman as a champion destined always to be fighting but who soon weakened and weighed down with his first fatigues saints in the very field of battle and finds himself as may be said to be     buried beneath his own triumphs nature evers acts slowly and as one may say sparingly her operations are never violent even in her productions she requires temperance she constantly goes on by rule and measure if she is precipitated she falls into a languor she employs all her remaining strength for her own preservation quite losing her productive virtue and generative power it is to this state of debility we are always reduced by so great a number of women who are fitter to exhaust than satisfy us it is very common among us to see a man with a very great seraglio and yet a very small number of children these children too are generally weak and unhealthy and feel the imbecility of their fathers this is not all these women obliged to a forced continence have need of people to guard them who can be none but eunuchs religion jealousy reason itself will permit no others to approach them these guardians must be numerous to the end they may maintain peace within doors amidst the continual contentions of these women and prevent attempts from without so that a man who hath ten wives or concubines must have no fewer eunuchs to guard them but what a loss to society so great a number of men dead as it were from their birth what depopulation must follow the female slaves kept in the seraglio to wait with the eunuchs upon this great number of women almost always growing old in an afflicting virginity they cannot marry while they stay there and their mistresses when once used to them will hardly ever dismiss them see how many persons of both sexes a single man employs for his pleasures they are dead to the state and rendered useless in the propagation of the species constantinople and ispahan are the capitals of the two greatest empires in the world it is there that every thing ought to terminate and where every body drawn by a thousand different ways should come from all parts yet even these cities decay     of themselves and would soon be destroyed if the sovereigns did not almost every century make whole nations remove thither to repeople them i will continue this subject in another letter paris the   th of the moon chahban      usbek      paris rhedi letter cxv usbek to the same the romans had not a less number of slaves than we they had even more but they made a better use of them so far from hindering by violent means the multiplication of their slaves they on the contrary favoured it all in their power they coupled them as much as they could by a kind of marriage by this means they filled their houses with servants of both sexes of all ages and the state with an innumerable people these children who made in time the riches of their master were born around him without number he alone had the charge of their maintenance and education their fathers freed from this burden followd wholly the inclination of their nature and multiplied without the fear of having too numerous a family i have observed to thee that among us all the slaves are employed in guarding our women and in nothing more that they are with respect to the state in a perpetual lethargy so that the cultivation of the arts and of the land is necessarily confined to some freemen and some heads of families who apply themselves to it as little as possible it was not the same among the romans the republic served itself with very great advantage by this generation of slaves each of them had his peculium   which he enjoyed upon such conditions     as his master imposed upon him with this peculium he laboured and applied himself in that way to which his ingenuity led him this made himself a banker another applied himself to commerce by sea one sold goods by retail another gave himself to some mechanic art or else farmed and cultivated some lands but there was none who did not apply himself to his utmost power to improve his peculium which procured him at the same time comforts in his present state of servitude and the hope of being able in some future time to purchase his liberty this made a laborious people and encouraged arts and sciences these slaves became rich by their care and labour bought their freedom and became citizens the republic was thus continually replenished and received into her bosom new families as fast as the old ones failed i may perhaps in my following letters have an opportunity to prove to thee that the more men there are in any state there commerce flourishes the more i may also as easily prove that the more commerce flourishes the more the number of people increases these two things mutually assist and favour each other if this is so how much must this very great number of slaves always at work have grown and increased industry and plenty gave them birth and they in return gave birth to plenty and industry paris the   th of the moon chahban      usbek      paris rhedi letter cxvi usbek to the same hitherto we have spoken only of the mahometan countries and inquired into the reason why they are less populous than those which were subject     to the government of the romans let us now examine what hath produced this effect among the christians divorces were allowed in the pagan religion and forbidden to the christians this change which at first may appear of so little consequence had by degrees terrible effects and such as are not easily to be believed this not only took away all the sweets of marriage but struck at its very end desirous to tie the knot faster they loosened it and instead of uniting hearts as they pretended they separated them for ever in so free an action and in which the heart ought to have so great a part they put torment necessity and even fate itself they reckoned for nothing disgusts caprices and unsociable humours they wanted to fix the heart that is to say that which is the most variable and inconstant thing in nature they joined together without the hope of a change people tired of one another and almost always ill matched and did by them like those tyrants who used to tie living men to dead bodies nothing contributed more to a mutual attachment than the power of divorce a husband and a wife were induced to bear patiently domestic troubles knowing they were masters of the power of ending them and they often retained this power in their hand all their lifetime without using it from this single consideration that they were at liberty to do so it is not the same with the christians their present vexations drive them to despair at the apprehension of those which are to come they see nothing in the discomforts of marriage but their continuance or rather their eternity hence arise disgusts contentions contempt and this is so much loss to posterity three years of marriage are scarcely past but the essential design of it is neglected thirty years of coldness follow private separations are formed as strong and perhaps more hurtful than if they had been public each lives apart his own way and all this to the prejudice of future generations a man disgusted at having  00 a wife for ever soon gives himself up to loose women a commerce shameful and contrary to nature which without answering the end of marriage represents at most but the pleasures of it if of two persons thus linked together one be unfit to answer the design of nature and the propagation of the species either from constitution or age that party buries the other with itself and renders the other equally useless we are not therefore to wonder that we see among the christians so many marriages produce so small a number of citizens divorce is abolished marriages ill formed are not to be rectified the women do not pass as among the romans successively through the hands of several husbands who for the time make the best they can of them i dare say if in a free state like that of lacedæmon where the citizens were continually tormented by odd and subtle laws and in which there was but one family that of the republic if it had been there established that the husbands might change their wives every year it would have produced an innumerable people it is very difficult to comprehend the reason that led the christians to abolish divorces marriage among all the nations of the world is a contract capable of every kind of settlement and none ought to be excluded from it but such as would have weakened the design of it but the christians do not consider it in this point of view and they are at a good deal of trouble to explain themselves upon this subject they do not make it to consist in the pleasure of sense on the contrary as i have already told thee it seems as if they were desirous to banish it as much as they can but it is with them an image a figure and some mysterious thing that i cannot at all comprehend paris the   th of the moon chahban       0  usbek      paris rhedi letter cxvii usbek to the same the scarcity of people in the christian countries is not to be ascribed solely to the prohibition of divorces the great number of eunuchs which they have among them is not a less considerable occasion of it i mean the priests and dervises of both sexes who devote themselves to perpetual continence this is among the christians a virtue of virtues in which i cannot comprehend any virtue not knowing how that can be a virtue which is productive of nothing i find their doctors plainly contradicting themselves when they say that marriage is holy and that celibacy which is opposite to it is more holy without considering that in a matter of precepts and dogmas the good is always the best the number of these people professing celibacy is prodigious fathers used formerly to condemn their children to it from their infancy at present they devote themselves to it at fourteen years of age which comes very near to the same point this practice of continence hath been the loss of more men than ever have been destroyed by the plague or the most bloody wars we see in every religious house an endless family where nobody is born and who are maintained at the expence of every body else these houses are always open like so many pits wherein future generations are buried alive this is very different policy from that of the romans who established penal laws against those who avoided the law of marriage and who wanted to enjoy a liberty so opposite to the public good i have yet only spoken of catholic countries in the protestant religion every body enjoys the right of propagation it allows neither of priests not dervises    0  and if at the establishment of this religion which brought back every thing to the standard of the primitive times its founders had not been continually reproached with incontinence it is not to be doubted but that after having rendered the practice of marriage universal they would likewise have softened the yoke and have concluded with entirely removing the barrier which in this case separates the nazarene from mahomet but however that might have been it is certain that the religion of the protestants gives them a very great advantage over the catholics i might venture to say that in the present state of europe it is not possible the catholic religion should subsist there five hundred years before the reduction of the power of spain the catholics were greatly stronger than the protestants the latter are gradually come to an equality with them the protestants are grown richer and more powerful and the catholics weaker the protestant countries ought to be and really are better peopled than those of the catholics from whence it follows first that their public revenues are more considerable because they are augmented in proportion to the number of those who pay them secondly that their lands are better cultivated lastly that trade flourishes better there because there are more people who have their fortunes to make and where there are more wants there will be more resources to supply them when there are only a sufficient number of people to cultivate the lands trade must needs perish and where there are no more than necessary for carrying on of trade the cultivation of the lands must be neglected which is indeed to say that both must sink together because no person can apply himself to one but the other must suffer as to the catholic countries not only the cultivation of their lands is neglected but even their industry is hurtful it consists only in learning five or six  0  words of a dead language   with this attainment a man need not trouble himself about his fortune he will find in a cloister a life of ease which in the world would have cost him labour and pains this is not all the dervises have in their hands all the riches of the state they are a society of misers who are always receiving but never restore they are continually heaping up their revenues to acquire a large capital so much wealth if we may be allowed the expression falls into a dead palsy and there is no more circulation no more trade no more arts no more manufactories there is no protestant prince who does not raise from his people much greater taxes than the pope does from his subjects yet these latter are poor whilst the former live in affluence

reigns amongst all their families of seeing the birth of a powerful king who shall be lord of the whole earth the ancient kings of persia had not had so many thousand subjects but on account of this dogma in the religion of the magi that the most pleasing acts to god that men can do are to get a child manure a field and to plant a tree if china contains such a prodigious number of people it

that are deserving of our cares we live in a general state of insensibility and leave every thing to be done by providence it was a spirit of vanity that established among the europeans the unjust law of primogeniture so unfavourable to propagation in that it directs the attention of a father to only one of his children and turns his eyes from all the others in that it obliges him in order to make

worthy of them except hunting and fishing but as there are often years in which hunting and fishing afford very little they are desolated by frequent famines besides that there is not any country

to send them into such a country we act directly contrary to the end we designed the romans knew this by experience they banished all their criminals into sardinia and made the jews go there too they were obliged to be contented with their loss which the contempt they had for those wretches made very easy to them the great chaabbas inclined to deprive the turks of the means of supporting great

so very favourable that the inhabitants multiply there continually witness those islands  which were peopled by some distempered people whom some ships left there and where they soon recovered their health but though such colonies should always succeed instead of increasing the power they only divide it unless they are but of small extent as those are where they send some to inhabit a place for

extended too far draw all the sap from the trunk and serve only for a shade nothing is properer to cure the arduous desire in princes of making distant conquests than the examples of the portugueze and spaniards these two nations having conquered with inconceivable rapidity immense kingdoms more astonished at their own victories than the conquered people were at their own defeat considered of the means to preserve them and took each for that end a different way the spaniards despairing of keeping the conquered nations in subjection determined to exterminate them and send thither more loyal people from spain never horrible design was more punctually executed a people as numerous as all those of europe together were cut off from the earth at the arrival of these barbarians who seemed in

raised themselves above the shoulders of others to behold our serenity we have even received several petitions from some of the fair sex supplicating us to observe that it is notorious that they are

them get quit of their amorous inquietudes i remember on this occasion a story i heard told by a person who had been in the country of the mogul which shows that the indian priests are no less fruitful than others in the ideas they have of the pleasures of paradise—a woman who had just lost her husband went in form to the governor of the city to ask his leave to burn herself but as in the

leave of this cursed governor to be permitted to burn myself he falls into a passion and raves like a madman there happened to be present a young bonze insidel said the governor to him is it you who have instilled this madness into the mind of the woman no replied he i never spoke to her but if she will be guided by me she shall perform her sacrifice she will do an action agreeable to the god brama and she shall also be well recompensed for she shall find in the other world her husband and be joined to him again     by a second marriage what do you say cried the woman in a fright—i shall find my husband again ah i will never burn myself—he was jealous stupid and besides so old that if the god brama hath made no reformation in him he certainly hath no need of me—burn myself for him—not

but as soon as they are fallen from their high station nothing but our lamentations can make them recal the idea of their greatness i think there is something very natural and very great in the speech

was visiting the trenches with only one engineer he received a shot in his head which killed him they immediately arrested his prime minister   the states assembled and condemned him to lose his head he was accused of a very great crime namely of calumniating the nation and depriving them of the confidence of their king an offence that in my opinion merits a thousand deaths for in short it is a bad action to blacken the lowest subjects in the mind of their king what is it then to traduce a whole nation and to deprive them of the goodwill of him whom providence hath made choice of to render them happy i would have men speak to kings as the angels spoke to our holy propher thou knowest that in the sacred banquets where the lord of lords descends from the most sublime     throne in the world to communicate himself to his slaves i made a severe law to myself to restrain an unruly tongue they never heard me utter a single word that might have been disagreeable to the meanest of his subjects though i happened to lose my sobriety i never lost my honesty and in that trial of our fidelity i ventured my life but never my virtue i know not how it happens but there is scarcely a king so bad but his minister is still worse if he commits a bad action he is almost always prompted to it insomuch that the ambition of princes is never so dangerous as the baseness of soul in his counsellors but can you comprehend that a man who was a minister but yesterday who may be deprived of his place tomorrow can become in a moment an enemy to himself his friends his country and to the people who are to be born of those whom he is about to oppress a prince hath passions the minister works upon them it is by their means that he directs his ministry he hath no other aim nor will he

me was a geometrician and indeed every thing in him showed him such for     he was in a deep meditation my friend was obliged to pull him a long time by the sleeve and to jog him to make him descend from his sublime speculations he was so busied with a curve which he had been perhaps eight days about great civilities passed between them and they mutually informed each other of the literary news this conversation led them to the door of a coffeehouse into which i went with them i observed that our geometrician was received there with the utmost officiousness and that the coffeehouse boys paid him much more respect than to two musqueteers who were in a corner of the room as for him he seemed as if he thought himself in an agreeable place for he unwrinkled his brow a little and laughed as if he had not the least tincture of the geometrician in him in the mean time he measured every thing that was said in conversation he resembled a person in a garden who with a sword cuts off all the heads of the flowers that rise up above the rest a martyr to regularity he was offended at every start of wit as a tender eye is by too strong a light nothing was indifferent to him if so be it were true accordingly his conversation was singular he was come that day out of the country with a person who had been to view a noble seat and magnificent gardens but he saw nothing but a building of sixty foot in front by five and thirty in depth and a wood of ten acres he wished that the rules of perspective had been so observed that the walks of the avenues might have appeared throughout of one and the same breadth and he would have laid down for that end an infallible method he seemed very well satisfied with a dial he found there of a very singular make and was mighty angry at a learned man who sat next me who unhappily asked if the dial showed the babylonian hours a newsmonger talked of the bombardment of the castle of fontarabbia and he presently informed us what kind of lines   0 the bombs described in the air and delighted with the knowledge of this he was contented to remain entirely ignorant of the success of the bombardment a gentleman complaining that the winter before he had been ruined by an inundation what you say pleases me much said the geometrician i find i am not mistaken in the observation i made and that at least there fell upon the earth two inches of water more than the year before a moment after he went out and we followed him as he walked very fast and never looked before him he run full against another man it was a rough rencounter and from the percussion each rebounded back in proportion to his velocity and bulk when they were a little recovered from their dizziness the man with his hand on his forehead said to the geometrician i am very glad you run against me for i have great news to tell you i have just now published my horace how replied the geometrician horace hath been published these two thousand years you do not understand me says the other it is a translation of that ancient author which i have just now published i have been twenty years engaged in translations how sir answered the geometrician have you been twenty years without thinking you speak for others and they think for you sir says the learned man do not you believe that i have rendered a great service to the public by making the reading of good authors familiar to them i do not say absolutely so i esteem as much as another the sublime genius whom you have travestied but you do not at all resemble him for if you should translate for ever you will never be translated yourself translations are like copper money which bear in proportion an equal value with a piece of gold and are even sometimes of far greater use to the people but they are always light and of a bad alloy you are desirous you say to revive among us these illustrious dead and i     own that you give them indeed a body but you do not restore life to them there is still wanting a

whom chance put at the head of others and who scarcely consulted any thing but their own prejudices and fancies they appear not to have known the greatness and dignity of their employment they amused themselves in forming childish institutions by which indeed they conformed themselves to weaker understandings but disgraced themselves with men of good sense they plunged themselves into disadvantageous circumstances and run into particular cares which is the sign of a narrow genius which sees things only by parts incapable of taking a general view some affected to make use of a language different from the vulgar an absurd thing in a maker of laws for how should the people observe what they do not understand they often abolished needlessly those laws that were established thereby plunging the people into disorders inseparable from changes it is true that on account of a strange turn that springs rather from the head than the heart it is sometimes necessary to change certain laws but it is an uncommon case     and when it happens it should be touched with a timorous hand they ought to observe much solemnity in doing it and conduct it with such precautions that the people may naturally conceive that the laws are very sacred since so many formalities are necessary to be observed in repealing them they have often made them too refined and have followed logical ideas rather than natural equity in process of time they were found to be severe and men thought themselves obliged in equity to deviate from them but this remedy was a new inconvenience be the laws of what nature they will they should be always punctually adhered to and considered as the conscience of the public to which that of individuals should always be conformable we should however acknowledge that some legislators have by one regulation discovered great prudence they have given fathers a great share of authority over their children nothing contributes more to the ease of the magistrates nothing more prevents the courts of justice from being crowded nothing more firmly establishes tranquility in a state where morality always makes better citizens than laws can make of all sorts of authority this is the seldomest abused this is the most sacred sort of magistracy it is the only one which does not owe its origin to any contract but has even preceded all contracts it has been observed that in the countries where the greatest share of power is lodged in the hands of parents the families are always best regulated fathers are representatives of the creator of the universe who though he might bind men to serve him through love alone has thought proper to attach them to him still stronger by the motives of hope and fear i cannot finish this letter without putting you in mind of the capriciousness of the french it is said that they have retained many things in the roman laws which are either useless or worse and they     have not borrowed from them the

pausing their discourse would produce no greater effect than a silence of the same duration yet they think themselves men of importance because they harangue upon glorious projects and talk of grand interests a curiosity at once frivolous and ridiculous is the basis of their conversation no cabinet can be so mysterious but they pretend to dive into its secrets they will not allow themselves to be ignorant of any thing they know how many wives our august sultan has how many children he begets every year and though they are at no expence to hire spies they are acquainted with the measures to humble the emperor of the turks and the great mogul scarcely have they exhausted the present but they plunge deep into futurity and taking the lead of providence they prevent it in all its conduct towards man they lead a general by the hand and after having praised him for many follies of which he never was guilty they make him commit a thousand more which will never come to pass they make armies fly like cranes and the walls of cities fall as easily as the walls of a cardhouse they have bridges upon all the rivers secret roads upon every     mountain immense magazines upon burning

and shall give it to you in this place   sir i am seldom mistaken in my conjectures upon public affairs upon the first of january      i foretold that the emperor would die within the year it is true as he was then in good health i was apprehensive of becoming an object of ridicule if i declared my sentiments in express terms for which reason i used expressions somewhat enigmatical but all rational people easily guessed my meaning he died of the smallpox in the same year upon the   th of april as soon as war was declared between the emperor and the turks i went through every corner of the tuilleries in quest of our gentlemen i assembled them near the bason and prophesied to them that belgrade would be besieged and taken i had the happiness of seeing my prediction fulfilled it is true about the middle of the siege i laid a wager of  00 pistoles that it would be taken on the   th of august it was however taken the day after is it not provoking to lose when so near the mark when i saw the spanish fleet invade sardinia i imagined they would reduce the island i said so and my conjecture was justified by the event encouraged by this success i added that this victorious fleet would make a descent at final in order to reduce the milanese as this opinion met with opposition i was resolved to support it nobly i laid a wager of  0 pistoles and i lost a second time for that confounded cardinal alberoni in violation of the faith of treaties sent his fleet to sicily and proved at     once too hard for two great politicians i mean the duke of savoy and myself all this sir has so greatly disconcerted me that i have formed a resolution to foretel henceforward without ever betting formerly the practice of betting was unknown at the tuilleries and the count de l— would never suffer them but since a considerable number of petit maîtres has mixed with our society we scarce know what to do scarce can we open our lips to tell a piece of news but one of these youngsters offers to lay a wager that it is not true the other day as i was opening my manuscript and settling my spectacles upon my nose one of those flashy gentlemen catching at the pause i made between the first and second word told me ill hold a hundred pistoles to the contrary i affected not to have taken notice of this extravagance and speaking in more emphatical terms i said the marshal of    having learned — that is false said he you always propagate extravagant intelligence there is not common sense in what you say sir you would greatly oblige me by lending me fifty pistoles for these wagers

greatest prince that ever was surnamed the great i have been moreover a long time employed in another work which will contribute to raise our national glory still higher if your eminence will grant me a privilege my design is to prove that     since the foundation of the monarchy the french never lost a battle and that what historians have hitherto said of our having been sometimes worsted is utterly false and groundless i am obliged to set them right upon many occasions and i think i may say without vanity that i have great talents for criticism i am my lord c   my lord as we have lost

keep the old in awe it is in vain for us to remonstrate to them that we were in possession of the tuilleries long before they were born i am inclined to think they will at last drive us out of it and

republics you are not ignorant that most of the     asiatics have not even an idea of this form of government and that the powers of imagination have not yet enabled them to conceive that there can be on earth any other form but the despotic the first governments of which we have any knowledge were monarchical it was merely by accident and the succession of ages that republics were at length formed greece having been overflowed by a deluge new inhabitants came to people it it drew all its colonies from egypt and the neighbouring countries of africa and as those were governed by kings the people who came from thence were governed in the same manner but the tyranny of these princes becoming insupportable they shook off the yoke and from the ruins of so many kingdoms sprung those republics which caused greece so greatly to flourish and rendered it the model of politeness whilst surrounded with barbarous nations the love of liberty and the aversion to kings long preserved greece in a state of independence and made the republican form of government become every day more extensive the cities of greece made alliances with some cities of asia minor they sent thither colonies as free as themselves which served them as ramparts against the enterprises of the kings of persia this is not all greece peopled italy italy spain and perhaps gaul it is well known that the great hesperia so much renowned among the ancients was at first the greece considered by neighbouring nations as a blissful abode the greeks who could not find that happy place of residence at home went in quest of it to italy those of italy to spain those of spain to bettica or portugal so that these regions went by that appellation amongst the ancients these greek colonies brought with them a spirit of liberty which they had contracted in that mild country it is for this reason we do not meet with any example of a monarchy in italy spain or gaul during these ancient ages it will be soon     seen that the people of the north and of germany were no less free and if any traces of kingly government are thought to be found amongst them this may easily be accounted for as the commanders of armies and the chief magistrates of republics have frequently been taken for kings all this happened in europe for asia and africa have always groaned beneath the yoke of despotism excepting only the cities of asia minor which have been spoken of above and the republic of carthage in africa the empire of the world was shared by two powerful republics i mean those of rome and carthage no part of history is less known than that of the origin of the republic of carthage we are totally in the dark with regard to the succession of african princes from the time of dido as well as of the manner in which they were deprived of their power the prodigious grandeur of the roman commonwealth would have been an advantage to the world in general if there had not been that unjust distinction between the citizens of rome and the conquered nations if the governors of provinces had not been invested with an authority so considerable if the just laws established in opposition to their tyranny had been always put in execution and if they had not in order to render them of no effect availed themselves of the very treasures which they had amassed by their injustice cæsar destroyed the roman commonwealth and made it subject to an arbitrary power europe long groaned under a military and violent government and the mild sway of the romans was converted into a cruel oppression in the mean time an infinite number of nations never before heard of poured out of the north and spread like torrents all over the roman provinces as these found it equally easy to make conquests and to exercise piracy they dismembered the empire and founded other kingdoms upon its ruins these people were free and the authority of     their kings was so limited that they could properly be called only their chiefs or generals thus these kingdoms though founded by force never once felt the conquerors yoke when the people of asia for example the turks and tartars made conquests whilst under the command of a single person they had nothing else in view but to procure him new subjects and to establish his violent authority by the force of arms but the people of the north free in their own country when they seized upon the roman provinces did not allow their chiefs much authority nay some of these people as the vandals in africa and the goths in spain went so far as to depose their kings when they were dissatisfied with their conduct and amongst others the authority of the prince was limited in a variety of manners a great number of the nobility shared it with him wars were never waged without their concurrence the spoils were divided between the chief and the soldiers no tax was levied in favour of the prince the laws were made in the national assembly and upon this fundamental principle were formed all the states

observed a gentleman tolerably well dressed who had got an audience about him he spoke of the pleasure of living at paris he lamented the necessity he lay under of retiring to languish away his life in the country i have said he an estate of fifteen thousand livres ayear in land and i should think myself much more happy if i had one quarter   0 of it in money and portable effects it is to no purpose for me to bear hard upon my tenants and put them to expence by frequent lawsuits this only makes them less able to pay i can never see a hundred pistoles at a time if i was to owe ten thousand livres all my land would be seized on and i should be reduced to an hospital i went out without giving much attention to all this conversation but happening to be yesterday in the same part of the town i entered the same house and i there saw a grave man with a long pale visage who sat melancholy and pensive in the midst of five or six praters at length beginning somewhat abruptly he said with a loud voice gentlemen i am ruined i have nothing left to live upon for i have now at home two hundred thousand livres in bankbills and a hundred thousand crowns in money i am in a most melancholy situation i thought myself rich and now i find myself reduced to beggary if i had but a small estate in the country to retire to i should at least be secure of a subsistence but i have not the breadth of this hat in land happening to turn my head on the other side i saw a man who made such grimaces that one would have thought him possessed who can we trust for the future exclaimed he there is a villain whom i had so good an opinion of and thought so sincerely my friend that i lent him money he paid me again what black persidy and ingratitude is this let him do what he will he will never be able to retrieve my good opinion near him was a man very ill dressed who listing up his eyes to heaven said god prosper the projects of our ministers may the actions rise to two thousand livres and the footmen of paris be richer than their masters i had the curiosity to ask his name the answer i received was he is a very poor man and has a poor trade he is a genealogist and he hopes that his art will become profitable if these changes of fortune continue and that all the new rich will have occasion     for him to reform their names furbish up their ancestors and adorn their coaches he has a notion that he will have it in his power to make as many persons of quality as he thinks proper and he exults within himself to think that the number of his customers will increase at last i saw an old man enter pale and thin whom i knew to be a coffeehouse politician before he sat down he was not one of those who are never to be intimidated by disasters but always prophecies of victories and success he was one of those timorous wretches who are always boding ill our affairs said he are in a very bad situation in spain we have no horse upon the frontiers and it is to be feared that the prince pio who has a considerable body will levy contributions upon the whole province of languedoc there sat opposite to me a philosopher of a tolerably shabby appearance who seemed to despise the politician and shrugged his shoulders in token of contempt whilst the other elevated the tone of his voice i approached him and he whispered in my ear you see how that coxcomb talks of his apprehensions for languedoc and i for my part yesterday perceived a spot in the sun which if it should increase might cause a general dissolution of nature and yet i did not say a single word about it

begged he would be so kind as to inform me what those books were which i saw so much better bound than the rest sir says he i am here as the inhabitant of a foreign country i know nobody many besides you have proposed such questions to me but you cannot think it reasonable that i should read all these books in order to give them information my librarian here can satisfy your curiosity for he is busred night and day in decyphering what you see here he is a very worthless member and a great burthen to us because he does nothing for the convent but the bell rings to call me to the refectory

from him whom i had seen before his air was simple his countenance lively and his address affable as soon as i signified to him my curiosity he prepared to gratify it and even to instruct me as i appeared to be a stranger reverend father said i what are those books with which all that side of the library is filled those are the works of the interpreters of scripture answered he there is a prodigious number of them replied i scripture must have been formerly very obscure     but very perspicuous at present can there possibly be any doubts remaining can there possibly be any uncontroverted points can there possibly answered he good god can there possibly there are almost as many doubts as verses indeed said i what good then have the writings of these authors done these authors answered he have not searched the scriptures for what should be believed but what they believed themselves they did not consider the scriptures as books containing the opinions they were bound to embrace but as a work which might give a sanction to their own opinions for this reason they have every where corrupted its sense and put forced constructions upon every passage it resembles a country which men of every sect invade and to which they go as it were to pillage it is a field of battle where the hostile nations that meet have frequent engagements where they attack each other and where they have skirmishes of various sorts not far from these you see the ascetic books or books of devotion then follow the books of morality which are of much greater utility theological tracts doubly intelligible both on account of the subject there treated of and the manner in which it is treated the works of the mystics that is of such devotees as have hearts addicted to love and tenderness hold reverend father one moment said i let me hear something of those mystics sir said he devotion warms a heart naturally inclined and causes the animal spirits to mount up to the brain so as to warm it in the same manner from hence proceed ecstasies and ravishing visions this state may be called the delirium of devotion it often attains to the perfection of or rather degenerates into quietism you cannot be ignorant that a quietist is nothing else but a man that is at once mad devout and a libertine behold there the casuists who reveal the secrets of the night who form in their imagination all the monsters     that the dæmon of love is capable of producing combine compare them and make them the constant objects of their thoughts happy is it for them if their heart is not catched in the snare and does not itself become an accomplice in so many debaucheries so exactly and so plainly described you see sir that i think freely and that i freely discover my thoughts i am naturally of an open disposition and more with you who are a stranger and who desire to understand things and know their true nature if that was my way of thinking i should speak of all these things with a tone of astonishment i should every moment use the terms that is divine that is excellent this abounds with the marvellous and the consequence would be that i should either impose upon you or lessen myself in your opinion there our conversation ended it was suddenly interrupted by the dervises being called upon about some business of the convent paris the   d of the moon rhamazan      rica

makers and the commentators my reverend father said i have not all these a dispensation from having common sense yes answered he they have and nobody is ever the wiser their works are neither the better nor the worse for it and this is a great privilege they are invested with that is very just said i and i know many philosophers who would do wisely to attach themselves to sciences of this nature here continued he you may     see the orators who are endowed with the talent of persuading without ratiocination and the geometricians who force a man to assent to their arguments whether he will or no and convince him by downright force here you see the metaphysical treatises which turn upon interests so important and in which infinity every where occurs and the treatises upon natural philosophy the authors of which can discover no more of the marvellous in the œconomy of the vast universe than in one of the most simple machines made by human art books of physic those monuments of the frailty of human nature and the power of art which fill us with terror even in treating of the slightest disorders they bring death so near our view but which renders us equally secure when they treat of the virtues of remedies as if they could confer immortality upon us near them are the books of anatomy which do not so properly contain the description of the parts of the human body as the barbarous names by which they are called which can never cure the sick man of his disease nor the physician of his ignorance here are the chymists who sometimes inhabit hospitals and sometimes madhouses which are dwellings equally well suited to them here again are the books which treat of the occult science or rather of occult ignorance such are those which contain something concerning the magic art these are execrable in the opinion of many altogether contemptible in mine such likewise are the books of judicial astrology how can you say that father the books of judicial astrology replied i with vivacity these are the very books which are most esteemed in persia they regulate all the actions of our lives and determine our will in all our undertakings the astrologers may properly be called our directors they do more than direct us they are concerned in the government of the state if that be the case said he you live under a government much     more severe than that of reason this must be the most capricious government imaginable i greatly pity a family and much more a nation that suffers the planets to have such powerful influence over it we use astrology answered i just in the same manner as you use algebra every nation has a peculiar science according to which it regulates its politics all our astrologers put together never committed so many absurdities in our persia as a single algebraist has done here can you think that the fortuitous meeting of the stars is not as sure a rule of conduct as all the fine reasoning of your builder of systems if the votes upon that subject were to be reckoned up both in france and persia astrology would soon triumph over algebra you would soon see the calculators greatly humbled what terrible inferences might be

interview my learned instructor conducted me into a separate apartment here said he are the books of modern history behold here the authors of church history and the lives of the popes these are books which i read for edification but which in me often produce a quite opposite effect in that place are those who have wrote concerning the decline of the formidable empire of the romans which sprung from the ruin of so many monarchies and upon the ruins of which so many new ones were founded an infinite number of barbarous nations as     little known as the countries which they inhabited appeared all of a sudden overrun it ravaged it tore it to pieces and founded all the kingdoms which you now see in europe these people cannot properly be called barbarians because they were free since being universally subjected to a despotic power they lost that delightful liberty which is so conformable to reason humanity and nature here you will see the historians of the german empire which is only a shadow of the first empire but which is i think the only power upon earth which has not been weakened by faction the only power i must repeat it which acquires strength from its losses and which slow in availing itself of its success becomes invincible by its defeats here are the french historians in which we first see the regal power form itself perish twice then recover itself again and languish during a succession of ages but collecting strength and being increased in every particular at last arrives at its final period like those rivers which in their course lose their waters or hide themselves under the earth then shewing themselves again and swelled by the rivers which flow into them rapidly hurry away whatever opposes itself to their passage there you see the spanish nation pour itself forth from certain mountains the mahometan princes subdued as slowly as they had rapidly conquered so many kingdoms united into one vast monarchy which became almost the only one till overwhelmed by its own greatness and its false opulence it lost its forced reputation and retained nothing but the pride with which it was inspired by its former power here are the english historians in which we constantly see liberty rekindled by the flames of discord and sedition the prince always tottering upon a throne not to be shaken a nation impatient but prudent even in its sallies of passion and which being possessed of the empire of the sea a thing unheard of till then unites commerce     with power not far from thence are the historians of that other queen of the sea the republic of holland so much respected in europe and so formidable in asia where its merchants see so many kings fall prostrate before them the italian historians represent to us a nation once mistress of the world become the slave of all the others its princes divided and weak and having nothing of sovereignty to boast besides its vain policy here are the historians of the republics of switzerland which is the emblem of liberty of venice whose only refuge is in its œconomy and of genoa that has nothing to boast of but its buildings here are those of the north and amongst others of poland which makes so bad a use of its liberty and the right it is possessed of of electing its kings that one would think its intention is thereby to console the neighbouring nations which have lost both hereupon

chief merit consists in putting good sense in shackles and in overwhelming reason by a heap of ornaments as the women were formerly incumbered by the parade of dress you are no stranger to them they

answered he i do not know the critics tell us that there     never were more than two and that the others which go by the same name are by no means worthy of it i cannot juge of this neither they say besides that it is impossible to compose any more this to me appears still more surprising here are the dramatic poets who i think hold the first place amongst those of their profession and may be justly looked upon as the masters of our passions there are two different species of dramatic poets the comic poets who stir our passions so gently and the tragic poets who rouse and agitate us with so much violence here are the lyric poets whom i despise as much as i esteem the others who convert their art into an harmonious extravagance next in order follow the authors of idyllium and eclogues who please even courtiers by exciting in them an idea of a certain tranquility which they do not possess which they present to their view in the condition of shepherds but here are authors more dangerous than any you have yet seen these are they who point epigrams little sharp arrows which make a deep wound that admits of no cure here you behold romances the authors of which may be in some measure considered as poets who are equally extravagant in their wit and in their representations of passion they pass their whole lives in seeking after nature and their research is always equally vain their heroes are no more in nature than the winged dragons and the hippocentaurs i have answered i seen some of your romances and if you had seen any of ours you would have been still more disgusted they are full as void of nature and lie under great constraints on account of our manners an amorous passion must have lasted ten years before the lover can see so much as his mistresss face yet the authors are under a necessity of making their readers pass through all these tedious preliminaries now as it is impossible to invent new incidents for ever these authors have recourse to an artifice which   0 has a worse effect than the inconvenience they mean to obviate by it they avail themselves of prodigies i am convinced that you cannot approve of a sorceress making an army rise out of the earth by the power of her art that a single hero should destroy a fleet consisting of an hundred thousand men yet in this taste our romances are wrote these cold adventures so often repeated

the sacred place where his heart reposes she proposed me many questions concerning the manners of the persians and the sort of life led by the women of persia it appeared to me that the seraglio was not to her taste and that it gave her great disgust to think that a man should be shared by ten or twelve women she could not think of the happiness of the men without envy nor of the wretched condition of the women without the utmost compassion as she loves reading in general but chiefly poems and romances she was desirous to hear some account of ours the account i gave her doubled her curiosity she begged the favour of me to translate a fragment of one of those i had brought with me i did so and sent her a few days after an oriental tale perhaps you will not be displeased to see it in disguise in the time of cheick ali can there was in persia a woman named zulima she had the sacred koran quite by heart no dervise could understand the traditions of the holy prophets better than she the arabian doctors never said any thing so mysterious but she could easily comprehend it and to such knowledge she joined a certain chearfulness of temper which put it out of the power of those she conversed with to guess whether she intended to instruct or please them one day whilst she was with her companions in one of the apartments of the seraglio one of them asked her what her sentiments     were concerning a life to come and whether she believed that ancient tradition of our doctors that paradise was made only for the men it is the general opinion said she they have done all that they could to degrade and villify our sex there is even a nation dispersed all over persia called the jewish that maintain by the authority of their sacred books that women have no souls these injurious opinions take their rise entirely from the pride of men who would willingly preserve their superiority over our sex even after death and do not consider that at the last great day all the creatures will appear as nothing before god and that one shall have no prerogative over another but that which it has acquired by superior virtue god will be unbounded in his recompenses and as the men who have lived a virtuous life and made a good use of their power over us upon earth will be admitted into a paradise filled with celestial and ravishing beauties beauties so brilliant that if a mortal could get a sight of them he would immediately put an end to his life through impatience to enjoy them in like manner virtuous women will enter a delightful abode where they will be glutted with the most exquisite enjoyments of all sorts with men of a divine nature who will be subjected to their command each of them will possess a seraglio in which they will be shut up and have eunuchs much more faithful than ours to guard them i have read continued she in an arabian author that a man named ibrahim was of a temper most insupportably jealous he had twelve women of the greatest beauty whom he treated with a brutality unparalleled he would not trust even his eunuchs or the walls of his seraglio he generally kept them under lock and key in their respective apartments so that they could neither see nor speak to each other for even an innocent friendship roused his jealousy all his actions discovered a tincture of his natural brutality his mouth     never pronounced an obliging word and his most trifling gestures never failed to aggravate the bitterness of their slavery one day when he had assembled them all in an apartment of his seraglio one of them more bold than the rest reproached him with his illnature those who take such pains to make themselves feared said she are generally speaking successful only in making themselves hated we are so very unhappy that we cannot possibly avoid wishing for a change of condition others would in my situation wish your death i only wish for my own and as i cannot hope to be separated from you except by death it will notwithstanding be a great happiness to me to be separated from you this discourse which should have given him some compunction made him on the contrary fly into a furious passion he drew his poignard and plunged it into her breast my dear companions said she with a dying voice if heaven has compassion for my virtue your sufferings will be revenged having uttered these words she left this unhappy world and passed immediately into that blessed abode where such women as have lived virtuous lives enjoy a neverfading happiness the first sight that presented itself to her eyes was a beautiful meadow whose verdure was set off by an enamel of flowers whose variegated colours vied with each other in loveliness a stream whose waters were more clear than chrystal ran there in a variety of meanders she then entered into delightful groves where nothing was heard but the harmonious songs of tuneful birds the finest gardens imaginable then offered themselves to her view nature had bestowed upon them all its lustre with its simplicity at last she came to a magnificent palace which was prepared for her and filled with men of a divine nature destined to be subservient to her pleasures two of them immediately advanced in order to undress her others conducted her to a bath and persumed her with the most delicious     essences they then presented her with clothes much more rich than her own after which they led her into a spacious hall where she found a fire made of odoriferous wood and a table covered with viands of the most exquisite flavour all things seemed to concur to fill her senses with rapture she heard on one side musick so much the more divine as it was more tender on the other she saw dances performed by those divine men whose sole occupation was to please her and yet such a variety of pleasure was intended only to conduct her by insensible degrees to pleasures infinitely greater they then conducted her to her apartment having again undressed her they then put her into a bed extremely rich where two divine men immediately received her in their arms she was then completely happy her ecstacy surpassed even her desires i am quite transported said she to them i should think myself dying if i was not sure of my immortality it is too much leave me i sink through the excess of pleasure yes you again restore a calm to my senses i am beginning to revive and come to myself why have they taken away the slambeaux why am i not permitted still to contemplate your divine charms why am i not allowed to see—but why do i talk of seeing you make me once more enter into my former transports gods how delightful this darkness is what shall i be immortal and immortal in your company i shall—but no—i beg a moments rest for i see you are but little disposed to ask it after reiterated commands she was at last obeyed but it was not till she appeared to desire it in good earnest she then gave way to soft repose and slumbered in their arms two moments of sleep restored her wasted strength twice they embraced her and thus the flame of love was rekindled she opened her eyes and said i am quite uneasy to find myself neglected thus i fear you have ceased to love me this was a doubt in which she was unwilling     to remain long and indeed she soon received convincing proofs of her mistake i am conscious of my error exclaimed she excuse me i now see i may depend upon you you do not utter a single word but your actions prove your love more strongly than it is in the power of words to do yes yes i own it no love could ever equal yours but how you vie with each other in endeavouring to convince me ah if you vie with each other if you join ambition to the pleasure of defeating me i am lost you will both be conquerors and i the only vanquished party but the victory shall cost you dear that you may depend upon their pleasures were not discontinued till day appeared her faithful and amiable domestics entered her apartment and caused the two young men to rise they were thereupon reconducted to the places wherein they were kept for her pleasures she then arose and made her appearance at that court by which she was idolized in the charms of a simple dishabille and then richly attired in the most sumptuous ornaments the past night had added new lustre to her beauties it had enlivened her complexion and given a stronger expression to her graces the whole day was divided between dances concerts festivals sports and other amusements of that kind and it was observed that anais often stept aside and flew to the embraces of her two lovers after having a short interview with them she returned to the company she had quitted always with a countenance more lively than before but about evening the company lost sight of her entirely she went and shut herself up in the seraglio where she was desirous as she said of cultivating her acquaintance with these immortal captives who were to live with her for ever she therefore visited the most retired and the most delightful apartments of these places where she reckoned fifty slaves of a most extraordinary beauty she wandered all day from apartment to apartment receiving every where a different     homage but one that was always of the same nature it was thus the immortal anais passed her days sometimes in all the dissipation and gaiety of pleasure and sometimes in solitary pleasures admired by a brillant assembly or adored by an ardent lover she often quitted an inchanted palace to repair to a rural grotto flowers seemed to spring under her feet and pleasures offered themselves to her in crowds she had been above eight days in this happy place in the hurry of a constant round of pleasure and without having ever made a single reflection she had enjoyed her felicity without knowing it and without having one of those moments of tranquility in which the soul settles with itself if i may be allowed the expression and attends to its own report in the silence of the passions happy souls have pleasures so lively that they can seldom enjoy that freedom of mind wherefore being invincibly attached to present objects they lose all memory of things past and have no longer the least concern about what they have loved or known in the other world but anais whose mind was of a truly philosophical turn had passed almost her whole life in meditation she had carried her reflections a great deal further than could be expected from a woman left to herself the close retirement in which her husband had left her had deprived her of every other advantage it was that strength of mind which had made her despise the fear that filled the souls of her companions with consternation as well as death by which her sufferings were to be terminated and her felicity to commence she therefore by degrees quitted the intoxication of pleasure and retired to an apartment in her palace she gave herself up to pleasing reflections upon her past condition and her present happiness she could not help compassionating the misery of her companions we are always affected with ills which we have partaken of anais did not stop within the limits of simple   0 compassion such was her tenderness for these unfortunate creatures that she found herself inclined to assist them in their distress she ordered one of the young men that was with her to assume the form of her husband to enter his seraglio to make himself master of it and to turn the former possessor out of doors and to remain there in his place till such time as she should think proper to recal him her orders were quickly put in execution he cut the air with rapid wings and quickly arrived at the door of ibrahims seraglio ibrahim happened not to be there the young man knocked every door flew open to him the eunuchs fell at his feet he flew to the apartments where the women of ibrahim were shut up he had as he passed stolen the keys from this monster of jealousy to him he found means to render himself invisible he entered and at first surprised them by his mild and affable air but soon after surprised them much more by his ardour and by his reiterated warm embraces they were all equally astonished at this event and they would have taken it for a dream had there been less reality in it whilst this extraordinary scene was played in the seraglio ibrahim knocked at it told his name and made a terrible outcry and disturbance after having surmounted a great many difficulties he entered and threw the eunuchs into a most terrible fright he walked on with great rapidity but he started back with great astonishment when he beheld the counterfeit ibrahim his perfect image taking all the liberties of master of the seraglio he calls out for help he calls upon the eunuchs to assist him in killing the impostor but he was not obeyed he has now but one refuge left and that a weak one he refers it to the judgment of his wives in the course of one hour the counterfeit ibrahim had corrupted all the judges the other was ignominiously dragged out of the seraglio and would inevitably have suffered death if his rival had not given     positive orders that his life should be spared in a word the new ibrahim remaining master of the field of battle gave every day new proofs that he was worthy of such a preference and signalized himself by feats unheard of before in the seraglio you are not like ibrahim said the women say rather answered the triumphant ibrahim that that impostor is not like me what must be done to deserve your favours if what i do is insufficient ah we shall take care how we doubt answered the women if you are not the true ibrahim it is enough for us that you have so well deserved to be so you show yourself more ibrahim in one day than he did in ten years you promise then returned he to declare in my favour and against that impostor doubt not of that answered they all with one unanimous voice we swear to be eternally faithful to you we have been too long imposed upon the villain did not suspect our virtue all his suspicions were occasioned by his own impotence we now see plainly that men are not made alike it is you doubtless they resemble if you but knew how much you make us hate him ah replied the counterseit ibrahim i will often give you fresh reasons to hate him you do not yet know how great an injury he has done you we judge of his injustice by the greatness of your revenge answered they you are in the right answered the divine man i have proportioned the expiation to the crime i am glad you like my manner of punishing but said the women if that impostor should return what shall we do i believe it would be a hard matter for him to deceive you answered he in the station which i hold with you no man can support himself by artifice besides i will send him so far off that you will never hear more of him i then will take upon myself the care of your happiness i will not be jealous i know how to secure your affections without laying you under any restraint i have not so     bad an opinion of my merit to think that you will not be faithful to me if your virtue is not secure with me with whom can it be secure the conversation lasted a long time between him and the women who more struck with the difference of the two ibrahims than with their resemblance were not in the least solicitous to have so many mysteries cleared up at last the husband quite desperate came again to disturb their repose he found his whole family in joy and his women more unwilling to believe him than ever it was become now no place for a jealous man he went away in a rage the very next moment the counterfeit ibraham followed him seized him hurried him through the air and left him at the distance of two thousand leagues from thence gods how disconsolate were the women in the absence of their dear ibrahim their eunuchs had already resumed their natural severity the whole family was in tears they thought sometimes that all that had happened to them was but a dream they looked often upon each other and recalled to their memories the most minute circumstances of these strange adventures at length the divine ibrahim returned more amiable than ever it appeared to the women that he had not been in the least fatigued by his journey the new master observed a conduct so opposite to that of the old one that all the neighbours were surprised at it he dismissed all the eunuchs made his house accessible to every body he would not even suffer the women to use veils it was something extraordinary to see them at feasts amongst the men and as free as they ibrahim thought and with reason that such citizens as he were not bound to observe the customs of the country yet he spared no expence he with the utmost profusion squandered the wealth of the jealous man who returning three years after from the remote countries to which he had been carried found     nothing at home but his women and thirtysix children paris the   th of

to make a good use of it i have no ambition nor taste for pleasures i am almost always shut up in a closet where i lead the life of a studious man it is in such a place as this that a virtuoso who loves venerable antiquity is to be found when my uncle expired i would gladly have had him interred with the ceremonies observed by the greeks and romans but i had neither antique mourning urns or lamps but since that time i have provided myself well with those precious rarities i not long age sold my plate to purchase an earthen lamp that had been used by a stoic philosopher i have disposed of all the pierglasses with which my uncle had covered his apartments to buy a little cracked looingglass that formerly belonged to virgil i am highly delighted to see it reflect my face instead of that of the swan of mantua this is not all i have given an hundred louis dors for five or six pieces of copper coin which were current a thousand years ago i do     not think i have now in my house a single moveable which was not made before the decline of the roman empire i have a little closet filled with manuscripts as precious as dear though by reading them i destroy my eyesight i had much rather use them than printed books which are not so correct and which are moreover in the hands of every body though i scarce ever stir out of my house i am extremely solicitous to know all the ancient roads which were made in the time of the old romans there is one not far from my house which was made by the orders of a proconsul of gaul twelve hundred years ago when i go to my countryhouse i always take care to pass it though it is very inconvenient and adds almost a league to my journey but what provokes me is that in several places they have fixed wooden posts to show the distances of the neighbouring towns i am quite in despair to see these miserable erections in the room of those military columns which were there before i doubt not but i shall cause them to be replaced by my heirs and shall be able to make a will of such a nature as will induce them to do it if you have got ever a persian manuscript by you sir i would be obliged to you for it i will pay you your own price

quarto which contains an explanation of a verse of the sixth book of virgil it will     be a few days before i can send you these at present all i can do is to send you this fragment of an ancient grecian mythologist which has not hitherto appeared in print and which i found in the dust of a library i must take my leave of you on account of an important affair that i have upon my hands the business is to restore a beautiful passage of pliny the naturalist which the copyists of the fifth century have strangely disfigured i am c fragment of an ancient mythologist in an island near the orcades a child was born who had æolus for his sire and for his mother a nymph of caledonia it is said of him that he without assistance learned to reckon upon his fingers and that even at four years of age he distinguished metals so well that his mother once offering him a tin ring instead of a gold one he perceived the deceit and threw it upon the ground as soon as he was grown up his father taught him to shut up the wind in buckets which he afterwards sold to the travellers who passed that way but as commerce was not much esteemed in his country he quitted it and began to roam the world in company with the blind god of chance in the course of his travels he had learned that gold glitters every where in betica he repaired thither with the utmost expedition he was very ill received by saturn who reigned there at that time but that god having left the earth he took it into his head to go about the streets every where crying continually with a hoarse voice people of betica you think yourselves rich because you are possessed of gold and silver your error raises my contempt be ruled by me quit the country of base metals enter the empire of imagination and i promise you     riches which will fill even you with astonishment he immediately opened several of the buckets which he had brought with him and he distributed his commodity to whoever was willing to take it the next day he entered the same streets and cried out people of betica do you desire to be rich fancy to yourselves that i am extremely rich and that you are so also take it for granted every morning that your wealth has been doubled during the night then rise and if you have creditors go and pay them with the imaginary treasure then bid them imagine in their turn he appeared again in a few days after and he spoke thus people of betica i see very well that your imagination is not as lively as it was yesterday let me regulate your imagination by mine i will every day place before your eyes a scroll which will be to you the source of great riches it will contain but four words but these words will be extremely significant for they will determine the portions of your wives the fortunes of your children and the number of your servants and as for you said he to such of the croud as were nearest to him as to you my dear children i may call you by that name for from me have you received a second birth my scroll shall decide the grandeur of your magnificent equipages the sumptuousness of your feasts and the number and pay of your mistresses a few days after he came into the public streets quite out of breath and in a violent passion cried out people of betica i advised you to imagine and i see that you do not follow my advice well then now i command you to do so thereupon he quitted them abruptly but reflection made him soon come back i hear said he that some of you are so detestable as to keep your gold and silver for the silver it is no great matter but gold gold—ah that makes me quite mad i swear by my sacred     buckets that if they do not bring it to me i will punish them severely he then added with the most persuasive air imaginable do you think i ask you for these wretched metals in order to keep them a proof of my candour is that when you brought them to me a few days ago i immediately returned you one half the next day they saw him at a distance they perceived that he endeavoured to insinuate himself into their favour by smooth and complaisant discourse people of betica i am informed that part of your treasure is in foreign countries i intreat you to send for them you will greatly oblige me and i shall eternally acknowledge the favour the son of æolus happened then to speak to people who were by no means in a merry mood they could not however help laughing which made him sneak off in great confusion he was not however quite discouraged he returned again and ventured to make another petition i know that you have precious stones dispose of them in the name of jupiter nothing can possibly impoverish you more than keeping such baubles dispose of them by all means if you cannot do it yourselves i will procure you excellent agents how you will wallow in riches if you but follow my advice i do assure you you shall have the richest treasures of my buckets at last he mounted a scaffold and with a more resolute voice spoke thus people of betica i have compared the happy state in which you are at present with that in which i found you upon my arrival in this country you are now the most opulent people upon earth but that i may make your good fortune compleat permit me to ease you of one half of your wealth having uttered these words the son of æolus soared up into the air and fled away upon rapid wings leaving his auditors in a consternation not to be expressed which occasioned his coming again the     next day when he delivered himself in these terms i perceived yesterday that my conversation displeased you highly well then suppose all i said unsaid it is true one half is too much let us have recourse to other expedients to attain the proposed end let us deposit all our riches in the same place it will be easily done for

for their sanctity are concealed in my clothes in above twenty places however i cannot entirely disapprove of the opinion of those who will not admit of this virtue annexed to certain words it is much more difficult for us to answer their arguments than for them to oppose our experience i carry all these sacred scrolls about me merely through habit and in order to conform to a     received custom i am of opinion that if they have not a greater virtue than rings and other ornaments of dress they cannot possibly be inferior to them in this respect but you put entire confidence in a few mysterious letters and without that defence you would be under continual apprehensions men are indeed unhappy they constantly float between fallacious hopes and absurd fears and instead of adhering to the dictates of reason they either form to themselves monsters that intimidate them or phantoms that seduce and mislead them what effect do you think the placing of a few letters can produce what evil can result from their being put into disorder what influence have they over the winds to calm tempests over gun powder to resist its force or over what physicians call peccant humour or the morbific cause of diseases to cure them what is most extraordinary is that those who puzzle their brains to account for certain events by occult virtues are obliged to take equal pains to avoid seeing the true cause you will tell me that certain enchantments have caused a battle to be won but for my part i cannot help telling you that you must be blind not to see in the situation of the field the number or courage of the soldiers or the experience of the generals causes capable of producing this effect whose real cause you wilfully shut your eyes to i will grant you for a moment that there may be enchantments grant me for a moment that there are none for that is possible it will not follow from your concession that two armies may not engage will you then maintain that in that case neither of the two can be victorious do you think their fate will continue doubtful till an invisible power comes to decide it that all their blows will be ineffectual all their conduct vain and all their courage fruitless do you think that death rendered present in a thousand different ways cannot produce those panics which you find   0 it so difficult to account for do you think that there may not be one coward in an army of two hundred thousand men do you think that the terror which may seize this one may not excite terror in another that the second who quits a third will not make him quit a fourth even that would be sufficient to throw a whole army into despair and the more numerous the army the more quickly it spreads all the world knows and all the world is sensible that men like all other creatures who are directed by nature to preserve their being are passionately fond of life this is a truth generally known how then can it be asked how they can be afraid of losing it upon a particular occasion though the sacred books of all nations abound with accounts of such panics or supernatural terrors i think there cannot be a more ridiculous notion for before we should admit that an effect which may be produced by an hundred thousand natural causes is supernatural one should before have examined whether none of these causes has operated which is impossible i shall say no more

together his physician prescribed him opium but he would never consent to take it and whilst he held the cup he was as little inclined to take it as ever at last he said to his physician sir i beg you will give me quarter till tomorrow i know a man who does not practise physic and yet he has an infinity of remedies against want of sleep give me leave to send for him and if i do not sleep tonight i will send for you again tomorrow the physician being gone the sick man ordered his curtains to be drawn and said to his footman go to mr anis and tell him i should be glad to see him mr anis came my dear mr anis i am in a dying condition i cannot sleep have you not in your shop the c of g or some book of devotion composed by some reverend father which still lies upon your hands for the remedies that have been the longest kept are generally the best sir answered the bookseller i have in my shop the holy court of father caussin at your service i will send it to you directly and i hope you will find yourself the better for it if you have a mind for the works of the reverend father rodriguez a portuguese jesuit they are very much at your service but take my advice and stick to father caussin i hope that with the assistance of god one period of father caussin will do you more good than a whole leaf of the c of g having spoke thus mr anis went out in order to search his shop for the remedy he soon returned with the holy court after having caused the dust to be rubbed off the patients son a schoolboy began to read he was the first to feel the effects of     it at the second page he could scarce pronounce with an articulate voice and all present began to feel themselves drowsy a few moments after they all began to snore except the sick man who after having long continued to listen to it awake at last was overpowered by sleep himself early in the morning the physician arrived well said he has my opium been taken to this question he received no answer but the wife the daughter and the child in transports of joy showed him father caussins work he asked what it was they answered o bless father caussin his book well deserves to be bound who would have said it who would have thought it it is a perfect miracle see here sir see father caussins treatise it was this that made my father sleep hereupon they informed him of all that had happened   the physician was a subtle man greatly attached to the mysteries of the cabala and who had much faith in the power of words and spirits this struck him so that upon mature deliberation he resolved to change his method of practice this is a very extraordinary effect said he this experiment is worth carrying further why may not a spirit have power to communicate to its works the qualities which it is itself possessed of do not we see this happen every day at least the experiment is very well worth trying i am tired of apothecaries their syrups their juleps and all their galenical drugs destroy the sick and quite ruin their health let us change the method of practice let us try the virtue of spirits with this view he drew up a new system of pharmacy as you will see by the account which i shall give of the new remedies which he made use of     purgative ptisan take three leaves of aristotles logic in greek two leaves of one of the most crabbed theological treatises as for instance that of the subtile scotus four of paracelsus one of avicenna six of avenoes three of porphyry as many of plotinus as many of jamblicus mix them all together and let them stand for fourandtwenty hours then take four doses of them at a time a more violent purgative take ten a    of c    concerning the b and the c of the j   cause them to be distilled in balnea marina put a drop of the sharp humour which it produces in a glass of water to deaden it then drink off the whole with confidence a vomit take six harangues the first dozen of funeral orations that comes to hand with this one restriction however that you do not make use of those of m de n a collection of new operas fifty romances and thirty sets of new memoirs put all these ingredients into a large glass bottle with a big belly and a little neck leave it to settle during two days then cause it to be distilled by a fire of ashes and if all this should prove ineffectual another more powerful vomit take a leaf of marble paper which has served as a cover to a collection of the pieces of j f let it be infused during the space of three minutes cause a spoonful of that infusion to be made hot and drink it up     a very simple remedy for an asthma read all the

patients employ remedies very hard to come at as for instance a dedication which had never made any body yawn too short a preface a bishops order wrote by himself and the work of a janesenist either despised by a janesenist or much admired by a jesuit it was his opinion that these remedies were calculated for nothing but to promote quackery which he professed to hold in the utmost abhorrence usbek      paris rica letter cxliv usbek to rica yesterday at a countryseat where i happened to visit i met with two learned men who have a great name in this part of the world i thought their characters somewhat singular the conversation of the first well weighed might be reduced to this what i have said is true because it is i that have said it the conversation of the second seemed to be founded upon another maxim what i have not said is not true because i have not said it the first i was tolerably well pleased with for it is nothing to me if another person shows himself to be quite positive and obstinate but the impertinence of another is not so easily borne with the first maintains his     opinions they may be considered as his property the second attacks those of others that is to say he invades the property of all mankind dear usbek how fortunate are those who have more vanity than is absolutely necessary for selfpreservation these people aspire to be admired by means which must make them give offence they aim at superiority and they can scarce ever attain to an equality with others oh you modest men approach that i may embrace you from you spring all the charms of society you think yourselves destitute of all sorts of merit but i cannot help saying that every merit is yours you think you humble nobody though you humble all the world and when i in idea compare you to those assuming persons whom i meet with every where i immediately pull them from their tribunal and make them fall prostrate at your feet paris the   d of the moon chahban      usbek  letter cxlv usbek to    a man of parts is generally untractable in society he chooses but few companions he is disgusted with that numerous body of people whom he is pleased to call bad company this disgust he cannot thoroughly conceal which brings upon him the hatred of numbers being sure to please whenever he thinks proper to exert himself he frequently neglects to do so he has a turn to criticising because he sees many things that escape another and is more sensibly affected by them he generally ruins his fortune because the fertility of his genius furnishes him with a variety of means so to do his enterprises miscarry because he risks a great deal his penetration which generally     causes him to see too far makes him often give attention to objects that are extremely remote add to this that at the formation of a project he is less occupied by the difficulties that grow out of the business than with the remedies to them which are of his own inventing he neglects minute particulars tho upon them the success of most great affairs depends on the other hand the man of more confined abilities endeavours to avail himself in every thing he is thoroughly sensible that he must not neglect even trifles the man of moderate abilities oftener meets with general esteem every body takes pleasure in raising the one whilst all are equally delighted to depress the other whilst envy falls foul upon one and excuses him nothing all the defects of the other are overlooked the vanity of others declares in his favour but if a man of genius lies under so many disadvantages what must we think of the wretched condition of the learned i can never think of it without recollecting the following letter wrote by one of them to his friend i send it to you herewith     0 paris  sir i am one of those who pass whole nights in contemplating through telescopes of thirty feet long those vast bodies that roll over our heads and when i am disposed to unbend my mind i take up a microscope and examine a maggot or a mite i am not rich and i have but one room i dare not even make a fire in it lest the warmth should make the mercury rise in my thermometer which i keep there last winter the cold almost killed me and though my thermometor was at the lowest and though my hands were almost frozen i still went on my own way thus i have the pleasure of knowing with the greatest exactness all the most inconsiderable changes of the weather for last year i     am very reserved and scarce know any body that i see but there is a person at stockholm another at leipsick and another at london whom i neither ever saw nor ever expect to see with whom i keep up a constant correspondence i write to them every post but though i have no connection with any body in the street where i live i have got so bad a character all over the neighbourhood that i believe i must soon change my lodging about five years ago i was treated very roughly by a woman in the neighbourhood for having dissected a dog which she said belonged to her the wife of a butcher who happened to be present took her part and whilst one poured out a torrent of abuse against me the other pelted me with stones as well as dr— who was with me who received a terrible blow upon the os frontal and os occipital by which the seat of reason is very much injured ever since that time if a dog happens to be missing in the street it is immediately taken for granted that it has passed through my hands a worthy citizens wife that had lost a lapdog which as she said herself was more dear to her than her own children came the other day and fainted away in my room and not having found her dog summoned me before a magistrate i believe i shall be for ever persecuted by the malice of these women who with their shrill voices stun me every day by making funeral orations upon all the automates who have died these ten years yours c all men of learning were accused of being magicians some ages past i am not at all surprized at it every one of them said within himself i have acquired as much knowledge as can be attained by the power of natural abilities and yet another philosopher has the advantage of me he must certainly deal with     the devil as accusations of this nature are out of date in the present age other means have been made use of and a man of learning can never escape being reproached with irreligion or heresy it avails him little to be deemed innocent by the people the wound once made will never perfectly close it remains a sore place ever after an adversary may come thirty years after and address him in these modest terms god forbid that i should imagine that the accusation against you is just but you have lain under the sad necessity of vindicating your character thus is his very justification turned against him if he writes a history and discovers an elevation of mind or integrity of heart he is liable to a thousand persecutions there will not be wanting persons to irritate the magistrate against him on account of a fact which has passed a thousand years ago and if his pen is not venal they would have it restrained their condition is however more happy than that of those men who violate their faith for an inconsiderable pension who by all their numerous impostures hardly gain a single farthing who subvert the constitution of an empire diminish the prerogatives of one power increase those of another give to princes take from their subjects revive antiquated duties encourage the passions which are in vogue in their age and such vices as receive a sanction from the throne imposing upon posterity in the more scandalous manner as it is not provided with means to detect their impostures but it is not enough that an author has all these insults to suffer it is not enough that he has lived in constant anxiety for the success of his work at length the work that cost him so much pains and trouble comes out it involves him in a thousand quarrels and how is it possible to avoid them the author has an opinion he maintains it in his writings without knowing that another man of learning who lives two hundred leagues distan from him had asserted the reverse yet this gives   0 rise to a paper war it would indeed be some consolation to him if he had any prospect of becoming famous but he has not even this alleviation of his distress he is at most esteemed by those who have applied themselves to the same studies with himself a philosopher holds nothing more in contempt than a man whose head is loaded with facts whilst he in his turn is considered as a visionary by the man that has a good memory with regard to those who take pride in their ignorance they would willingly have all mankind buried in that oblivion to which they are themselves consigned when a man is destitute of any particular talent he indemnifies himself by expressing his contempt for it he removes that obstacle which stood between merit and him and by that means raises himself to a level with those whom he before feared as rivals thus is an author obliged to abstain from pleasures and endanger his health to acquire a doubtful and precarious reputation paris the   th of the moon chahban    0 usbek    0 paris rhedi letter cxlvi usbek to rhedi at venice it is a maxim of long standing that sincerity is the soul of a great ministry an individual may avail himself of the obscurity in which he is placed his character is lessened only in the opinion of some particular persons he keeps himself masked before others but a minister who acts contrary to the rules of probity has witnesses of his bad conduct and judges as many in number as the people he governs shall i hazard a bold assertion the greatest mischief done by a minister without principle does not arise from his serving his prince unfaithfully or from his ruining     the people it arises from the bad example he sets you are not ignorant that i have a long time travelled up and down the indies i have there known a nation by nature generous debauched in an instant as it were by the bad example of a minister i have seen a whole people amongst whom generosity probity candour and uprightness had long been considered as qualities natural to them become all on a sudden the most despicable people upon the face of the earth i have seen the contagion spread and not spare even the most sacred members of the community i have known men famous for their virtue guilty of the most unworthy actions i have known them violate the first principles of justice alledging in excuse the frivolous pretext that they had been violated with respect to themselves they justified the basest actions by odious laws and made necessity a plea for their base and perfidious conduct i have seen faith banished from contracts the most solemn compacts rendered void and all the laws of families subverted i have seen avaritious debtors puffed up with pride in the midst of poverty unworthy instruments of the severity of the laws and the public distress pretend payment without ever having made it and plunge a dagger in the breast of their benefactors i have seen others still more unworthy buy for a trifle or rather as it were pick up oak leaves from the ground in order to supply the place of the substance of widows and orphans i have known an insatiable thirst for riches spring up on a sudden in the hearts of all men i have seen a detestable confederacy formed by several persons to enrich themselves not by an honest industry but by the ruin of the prince the state and their fellow citizens i have known a worthy citizen in these times of distress never go to bed without saying to himself i have ruined a family to day i will ruin another tomorrow i am going says another with a man in black who carries an inkhorn in his hand     to ruin all those to whom i have had anobligation another said i find i am beginning to thrive true it is when i went about three days ago to pay off some money i left a whole family in tears that i squandered the portions of two girls of condition that i deprived a young lad of the means of acquiring education his father will die of grief his mother pines away with sorrow but i have done nothing but what is allowed by the law what crime can be greater than that which a minister commits when he corrupts the manners of a whole nation debases the most noble souls stains the lustre of dignities makes virtue itself obscure and confounds the noblest birth in the general contempt what will posterity say when it finds itself under a necessity of blushing for the shame of its ancestors what will the people of the next age say when they compare the iron of their ancestors to the gold of those from whom they immediately derived their birth i doubt not but the nobility will retrench from their coats of arms an unworthy distinction which dishonours them and leave the present generation in the despicable state to which it has reduced itself paris the   th of the moon

from all the misfortunes which i foresee after my death may my threatening shade return to put these perfidious women in mind of their duty and intimidate them even then here are the keys of those awful places go carry them to the oldest of the black eunuchs but if after my death he should be deficient in diligence take care to let your master know having uttered these words he expired in my arms i am not ignorant of what he wrote to you concerning the conduct of your wives a little before his death there is a letter in the seraglio which would have occasioned general terror if it had been opened that which you wrote since was intercepted three leagues from hence i do not know what it is owing to but all things turn out unhappily your wives however no longer keep within the bounds of decency since the     death of the chief eunuch their behaviour is altogether licentious roxana is the only one that does her duty and continues to retain her modesty their morals grow more corrupt every day one can no longer discover in the countenances of your wives that severe and rigid virtue which might so easily be discerned there before an unusal joy which reigns in this place in my opinion proves some new satisfaction in those who live here in the most trifling circumstances i observe that they take liberties unknown to this place before there prevails even amongst your slaves an indolence in the discharge of their duty and a remissness in observing the rules of the seraglio which i am quite surprised at they are no longer inspired by that warmth of zeal which seemed to animate the whole seraglio your wives have been eight days in the country at one of your most neglected seats it is said that the slave who takes care of it was gained over by them and that two days before their arrival he caused two men to be hid in a hollow place in the wall of the principal chamber which they came out of in the evening after we had retired the old eunuch who is at present at the head of the seraglio is a dotard who believes whatever he is told such horrid perfidy excites my indignation and if heaven for the good of your service would make you think me capable of ruling i

attended i have just sent before me the sacrilegious guards who have shed the most precious blood in the world how couldst thou think me weak enough to consider myself as born only to adore thy caprice that whilst you allowed yourself the full indulgence of all your desires you had a right to thwart mine in every respect no though i have lived in a state of servitude i contrived means to be always free i reformed your laws by the laws of nature and my mind has always continued in a state of independency thou oughtest even to thank me for the sacrifice which i have made thee for having descended so low as to counterfeit a passion for you for having basely concealed within my breast what i should have published to thee in fine for having profaned virtue by suffering my bearing with your humours to be called by that name you were surprized at never observing in me the transports of love had you known me well you would have discovered in me all the violence of hatred but you have long enjoyed the happy deception of thinking yourself possessed of such a heart as     mine we were both satisfied you thought me deceived whilst i deceived you you must doubtless be surprized at my addressing you in such a stile as this is it possible then that after having overwhelmed thee with my affliction i should still have it in my power to make thee admire my resolution but all this is over now the poison wastes me away my strength forsakes me the pen drops from my hand i find even my hatred grow weaker i die from the seraglio at ispahan the  th of the moon of the  st rebiab    0     three letters of m de montesquieu to m le chevalier de bruant   letter i i was not at    when your letter came you embarrass me greatly i shall only answer you for the pleasure of entertaining myself with a man who is much better able to resolve the doubts which he proposed than the person to whom he sent them i am not of your opinion with regard to despotism and despotic princes it appears to me horrible and absurd to the last degree that a whole people should blindly subject themselves to the caprice of one even if he were an angel for my own part i would not live under him a single day this angel may become in a moment a monster thirsting after blood despotism is to me the most abominable and disgustful of all bad governments man is perpetually crushed debased and degraded by it look into history ancient and modern if ever there was one upon earth that was not an insult on mankind and the disgrace of human nature monarchy would doubtless be the best of governments if it was possible to find such kings as henry iv the only one who ever deserved the homage and veneration of his subjects kings should always be brought up in a school of affliction as this great man was such alone are truly great and     the lovers of mankind before we can feel for the misfortunes of others we must ourselves have been unfortunate but on the other hand the hearts of princes corrupted by prosperity and the slaves of pride and folly are inaccessible to pity and insensible to true glory i am not at all surprized that in monarchies and especially in our own there should be so few princes worthy of esteem incircled by corrupters knaves and hypocrites they accustom themselves to look upon their fellowcreatures with disdain and set no value on any but the sycophants who caress their vices and live in perpetual idleness and inactivity such is generally the condition of a monarch great men are always scarce and great kings still more so add to this that the splendor of a monarchy is short and transitory france is already sunk into misery and disgrace an age more will annihilate her or she will fall a prey to the first intrepid conqueror the english government has nothing to support it but a delusive outside extremely flattering to the people who fancy themselves the sole governors i do not know any country where it is more easy to create such open dissensions as may overthrow the state a man of sense and generosity may in ten years time erect himself into a despotic prince with more safety at london than at moscow remember cromwell money alone is sufficient to corrupt the whole parliament the great ever fond of riches and power and prostrate at the feet of fortune who always attend the throne will promote the views of their master and the great once gained over this phantom of liberty which appeared at intervals in the convulsive motions of the commons which awakens shakes itself and soon vanishes will be totally annihilated at the first signal given by the supreme ruler     i know indeed of no monarchy that is fixed constant and perfect the wisest kings oppress their subjects to arrive at despotism adieu my friend live in freedom and obscurity solitude will procure you the best and truest pleasure selfcontent the foolish and the wicked seen afar off will only excite your compassion to look nearly upon them would raise your contempt and indignation i write this in haste we will treat this matter more fully in the free intercourse of guiltless friendship   letter ii you ask me in what country a man may enjoy the most perfect liberty in every place my dear philintus where there are men and laws the wise man is free even in the court of a tyrant because his happiness depends on himself reason and conscience are the throne of his liberty it is not in the power of fortune injustice or any thing else to unhinge his soul or disturb his repose he rejoices in himself and his joy is always calm permanent and delightful would you my friend because you see violence and iniquity every day committed by wicked ministers by the rich and great by almost every man in place and power would you therefore entirely banish yourself from that society to which you are indebted for every thing and for which every honest and good member of it should yield up all without repining at the injuries which he suffers from it because a prince buries himself in sloth and debauchery because he perfecutes oppresses and destroys shall you become an exile from your country leave your friends and desert the poor and afflicted who apply to you for relief and rend your heart with their complaints no my friend you have too much sensibility despise     the unjust and cruel prince but love mankind and above all the unfortunate and distressed avoid the impetuous whirlwinds of a court forget if possible tha your king is surrounded with perverse wicked and oppressive men who laugh at his ignorance and avail themselves of his weakness fly to retirement in search of that repose friendship and felicity which are never to be found in the seats of power and grandeur or in the dangerous and delusive tumults of a noisy metropolis bring with you a few friends as worthy and sensible as yourself read plato montagne charron and rabellais exercise yourself in acts of kindness to the poor labourers the only creatures upon earth who are always miserable perpetually toiling to supply the necessities of nature and victims to the cruel rapacity of the farmers in general who grind and oppress them thus will you enjoy the most delicate and lively of all pleasures the pleasure of doing good the only consolation that can reconcile us to the miseries of human life when once you are habituated to a country life joy and peace will revive in your disquieted and uneasy mind which will grow strong and great raising itself by degrees to the celestial regions of genius and philosophy there free as the air you breathe throw out your thoughts as they arise your soul will then shoot forth such divine flames as shall warm and enlighten even the cold and ignorant when you have filled your paper arrange and correct the whole and i will tell you with the utmost freedom my opinion of it adieu my dear friend with a heart of such delicate sensibility as yours is youth health and a tolerable fortune you must be happy if happiness is the portion of virtue   0   letter iii you are right my dear philintus in believing and asserting to all your friends that education makes the man that alone is the parent of every virtue it is the most sacred the most useful and at the same time the most neglected thing in almost every country and in every station of life but too many vague and impracticable rules have been laid down on this important subject even the wise locke the great instructor of mankind is sometimes mistaken like other writers all education should have an eye to government or we lose our aim the man of patience and understanding will consider well the mind he has to form and instruct he will infuse by little and little maxims adapted to his age and suited to his genius rank and capacity i know that there are some soils barren and ungrateful and which will never answer the labour of the cultivator but besides that such are very uncommon i am inclined to suspect that frequently the tiller has neither strength nor skill enough to dig into and improve it as he ought there is one radical vice in france which may perhaps never be extirpated because it comes from the women who amongst us interfere in every thing and in the end ruin and destroy every thing a child is soon spoiled in their hands from two years old to six when he is delivered up without consideration to a man whom he has neither seen nor known the tutor perhaps a fellow of no character takes charge of him not from inclination but merely for his own interest for ten succeeding years he vegetates in the narrow circle of a college or in the unimproving converse and society of prating females of quality these tutors are generally appointed by the women who seldom look any further than the outside never considering personal merit which they have not sense enough     to distinguish having never habituated themselves to reflect one moment on any thing serious or useful another circumstance highly prejudicial to education and which disgusts and deters men of merit from engaging in it is the little regard paid to the tutor or preceptor who ought to be respected as a father whose place he is in a great measure intended to supply he to whom is intrusted the heir of an illustrious name and family he who is to form the worthy citizen and the good subject who is to do honour to his rank and character and become the glory of his country such are the men charged as they are with so important an office who in the fashionable world are so often despised and ill treated and even sometimes suffered to perish for want such abuses if they become general must point out a shameful and universal depravity of manners our nobility indeed are free from this reproach if they pay but indifferently they make amends by the weight of their interest and a thousand engaging civilities for the small appointment which their fortune will permit them to allow your rich financiers on the other hand who are naturally morose proud and ostentatious seldom pay a man without affronting him having nothing but money to give they gorge you with it in france the women ruin every thing because they think themselves fit for every thing and the men are weak and childish enough to humour their caprice nature notwithstanding made them but to obey and the weakness of their constitution every day points out to us the weakness of their sex with regard to education it is worse at court than in any other place the governor having a despotic power over his pupil suffers him to grow up in ignorance and idleness fills his head with the nonsense of fashion and puffs him up with the notion of his own rank and a contempt of the insignificant creatures that crawl beneath him every thing around him is made subservient to his     pleasure and advancement every thing is to fall down before him on the first notice he never talks to him concerning the royal virtues that adorn a throne justice courage beneficence intrepidity and the love of glory therefore it is that amongst our kings we never see a great man for i call not the conqueror by that name but rather consider him as the terror scourge and disgrace of human kind one whom the people are bound by their own interest to destroy as soon as the flame of his ambition breaks forth in projects of slaughter and oppression lewis xii was honest and just but weak and ignorant francis i a vain boaster cruel and a pretender to wit henry iv brave and magnanimous but too much given to women ever to become a philosopher lewis xiv at once the greatest and meanest of mankind would have excelled all the monarchs in the universe if he had not been corrupted in his youth by base and ambitious flatterers a slave during his whole life to pride and vainglory he never really loved his subjects even for a moment yet expected at the same time like a true arbitrary prince that they should sacrifice themselves to his will and pleasure intoxicated with power and grandeur he imagined the whole world was made but to promote his happiness he was feared obeyed idolized hated mortified and abandoned he lived like a sultan and died like a woman his reign was immortalized by the lowest of his subjects it is therefore my dear philintus impossible there should ever be a great man amongst our kings who are made brutes and fools of all their lives by a set of infamous wretches who surround

instance they alone were permitted to triumph since they alone could be consuls and generals  zonaras lib ii † origin of the tribunes of the people  the people had so great a veneration for the chief families that although they had obtained the privilege of creating plebeian military tribunes who were invested with the same power as the consuls they nevertheless always made choice of patricians for this employment they were obliged to put a constraint upon themselves and to enact that one consul always should be a plebeian and when some plebeian families were raised to offices the way was afterwards open to them without intermission it was with difficulty that the people notwithstanding the perpetual desire they had to depress the nobility depressed them in reality and when they raised to honours some person of mean extraction as varro and marius it cost them very great struggles † the patricians to defend themselves used to create a dictator which proved of the greatest advantage to them but the plebeians having obtained the privilege of being elected consuls could also be elected dictators which quite disconcerted the patricians see in livy lib viii in what manner publius philo depressed them in his dictatorship he enacted three laws by which they received the highest prejudice  the patricians reserved to themselves only a few offices belonging to the priesthood and the privilege of creating a magistrate called interex † as saturninus and glaucias ‡ when the people of rome had obtained the privilege of sharing the patrician magistracies it was natural to think that the flatterers of them would immediately become arbiters of the government but no such thing—it is observable that the very people who had rendered the plebeians capable of public offices fixed notwithstanding their choice constantly on the patricians because they were virtuous they were magnanimous and because they were free they had a contempt of power but when their morals were corrupted the more power they were possessed of the less prudent was their conduct till at length upon becoming their own tyrants and slaves they lost the strength of liberty to fall into the weakness and impotency of licentiousness lesprit des loix lib viii c    § the census or survey of the citizens was a very prudent institution in itself it was a survey of the state of their affairs and an inquiry into their power it was founded by servius tullius before whom according to eutropius book i the census was unknown  the reader may see in what manner those were degraded who after the battle of cannæ were for leaving italy those who had surrendered to hannibal those who by an insiduous and false interpretation had forfeited their word † the plebians obtained in opposition to the patricians that the laws and elections of magistrates should be made by the people assembled by tribes and not by centuries there were thirtyfive tribes each of whom gave its vote four belonging to the city and thirtyone to the country as there were but two protessions among the romans that were honourable war and husbandry the country tribes were had in greatest consideration and the four remaining ones admitted into their body that contemptible part of the citizens who having no lands to cultivate were if we may so say but citizens by halves the greatest part of them did not even go to war for in the enlisting of soldiers the divisions of centuries was observed and those who were members of the four city tribes were very near the same with those who in the division by centuries were of the sixth class in which no person was enrolled thus it was scarce possible for the suffrages to be in the hands of the populace who were consined to their four tribes but as every one committed a thousand frauds for the sake of getting out of them the censors had an opportunity of reforming this abuse every five years and they incorporated into any tribe they pleased not only a citizen but also bodies and whole orders see the first remark of chapter xi see also livy lib i decad i in which the different divisions of the people made by servius tullius are very well explained it was the

uncertain whether the whole body or only a part of the people have voted at sparta the number was fixed to ten thousand but at rome a city designed by providence to rise from the weakest beginning to the highest pitch of grandeur rome a city fated to experience all vicissitudes of fortune rome that had sometimes all its inhabitants without its walls and sometimes all italy and a great part of the world within them at rome i say this number was never fixed which was one of the principal causes of its ruin lesprit des loix book ii ch   our author observes from cicero de leg lib i and iii that another cause of its ruin was in making towards the close of the republic the suffrages secret the people in a democracy ought always to be public who are to be directed by those of higher rank but

canton of bern  the roman government has been thought defective by some because it was an intermixture of monarchy aristrocracy and popular authority but the perfection of a government does not
