an explanatory defense of the estimate etc  an explanatory defense of the estimate of the manners and principles of the times being an appendix to that work occasioned by the clamours lately raised against it among certain ranks of men  written by the author of the estimate in a series of letters to a noble friend  london printed for l davis and c reymers against graysinngate holborn mdcclviii  an explanatory defense of the estimate etc letter i my lord that friendship with which you have so long honored me was never more clearly proved or more nobly exercised than in the free and candid account you lately gave me of some exceptions taken against the estimate among certain ranks of men in town more particularly on the publication of the second volume and since the authors retirement into the country  this intelligence has indeed alarmed the writer and set him to review his work with greater circumspection even than that with which he writ it it is certain that no man can expect to hear the frank opinions of the world from the world itself it is therefore an office of the truest friendship in your lordship to communicate all you have heard on this subject the objections which you have so fairly stated i shall answer in their order and with equal pleasure vindicate where i think myself right or retract where i am wrong  on this occasion your lordship may expect a series of letters this method will equally alleviate my trouble in writing and yours in reading  letter ii before i proceed to your objections you will give me leave my lord briefly to state the main intent or scheme of the estimate in such a manner as may prove a sort of general key to the objections you have made for i perceive plainly that many of them proceed from a mere inattention to or a total misunderstanding of the leading principles of the work  and that i may give your lordship a just idea of its main design i will give you a short account of the accidental rise and occasion of this work the leading principles of which are indeed no more than a small part of a much larger design of a much more extensive nature  the writer being convinced both from books and observation that the happiness and duration of states depends much less on mere law and external institution and much more on the internal force of manners and principles than has been commonly imagined and being of opinion that the fundamental and leading causes of the happiness and duration of states had not as yet been enquired into or pointed out with that particularity of proof circumstance and illustration which so important a subject might demand had for some time bent his thoughts on a design of considerable extent which might be called a history and analysis of manners and principles in their several periods his general plan begins with the examination of savage life and proceeds through the several intermediate periods of rude simple civilized polished effeminate corrupt profligate to that of final declension and ruin  in the course of this plan too extensive indeed for the mediocrity of the writers talents a diversity of circumstances almost infinite have presented themselves the rise changes and progress of commerce arts science religion laws their mutual influence and effects on each other and on manners and principles the characters virtues and vices of rank office and profession in each of the periods thus delineated the natural means by which these periods generate each other the advantages and disadvantages strengths and weaknesses which mark and distinguish these several periods the most practicable means of bringing forward the savage and rude periods toward polished life and of bringing back the effeminate and corrupt periods to the same salutary medium above all the regulation and strong establishment of manners and principles to this important end  these with other subordinate articles of research proved and illustrated by facts drawn from history form the substance of the writers general design  on this design he was intent when the war broke out between britain and france which being very unsuccessful in its beginnings on the part of britain he thought he could not in his private station do a better service to his country than in pointing out what to him appeared the fundamental and latent causes of this ill success to this end he singled out so much of his main design as immediately related to the present state of his own times and country endeavoring to convince his fellow citizens that the source of our public miscarriages did not lie merely in the particular and incidental misconduct of individuals but in great part in the prevailing character of that period in which we live that is in the manners and principles of the times  hence alone the estimate had its accidental birth let it be chiefly remembered then that the main subject of this estimate is solely the effects of present manners and principles on the duration of the state this the writer insisted on so strongly and repeated so often that he thought his readers would certainly carry it along with them yet he finds he was mistaken  the leading truths therefore which in the course of his work he has attempted to prove are these that exorbitant trade has produced exorbitant wealth that this has naturally produced a high degree of luxury and a general attention to pleasurable enjoyment among the higher ranks among whom the effects of luxury must of course first appear that these natural effects of wealth have been naturally attended with public consequences which tend to the weakening or dissolution of the state by turning that general attention upon pleasurable enjoyment which in simpler times was bent on views of duty that hence a general defect of capacity fortitude and principle did naturally rise such as in its end must be fatal if unchecked in its progress and that all the leading ranks were of course infected with these natural consequences in some degree or other from their very situation  that another evil has conspired with this and that as this arose from the abuse of wealth so the other was inflamed by this and arose from the abuse of liberty that our constitution excellent in its nature was liable to an abuse which arose even from its excellence that the principle of parliamentary influence which was thought or found necessary at the revolution in eightyeight as a new principle of government had conspired with the luxury and ruling manners of the times to weaken the national powers by raising many men to places of the most important trust who were in some respect or other unequal to the task and hence the accumulated danger to the stability of the commonwealth  this is the main outline of the authors design stripped of that particularity and variety of coloring which it was necessary to give it ere it could be made a just and striking picture of the times all that circumstantial delineation of the ruling character of each rank condition order or profession of men being indeed no more than what the writer intended as a proof in detail of these general principles  the reception which the work has met with in the world is a proof sufficient how thoroughly the main body of the nation is convinced of the general truth and utility of the plan as to the execution of it whoever considers the nature of the work and that in the course of particular proof it was necessary to speak with uncommon freedom concerning the real state of all ranks and orders of men will easily see that numbers must be displeased at a freedom which was perhaps new but which the very genius of the work rendered necessary  what foundation this particular displeasure of individuals may have had in reason and what in passion and selfpartiality i will now calmly consider in weighing those objections which your lordship has laid before me  letter iii you say my lord that many good and well meaning people have taken offense as being involved in the blameable manners of the times and therefore charged with guilt as the enemies of their country while they are not conscious of acting intentionally amiss   in reply to this my lord let me briefly quote my vindication from some passages in the book itself it is not affirmed or implied in this general review that every individual has assumed the garb and character of false delicacy  as in manly ages some will be effeminate so in effeminate times the manly character will be found  but from the general combination of manners and principles in every period of time will always result one ruling and predominant character vol   p      yet although it be true that the character of guilty effeminacy belongs not to all it seems to the writer that none are exempt from some degree or other of those ruling manners which when indulged beyond a certain degree constitute the character of guilty effeminacy he cannot acquit his best and worthiest friends of some participation with the defects of their time and country nor does he pretend to be exempt from them himself alas if he did he must be the blindest and most selfignorant of all mortals these manners are in a certain degree inwrought into our very nature by the force of early habit then become as it were a part of us and we might as well attempt to divest ourselves of the modes of speech as of the modes of thought and action which are peculiar to our time and country virtuous and vicious every man must be few in the extreme but all in the degree the rogue and fool by fits is fair and wise and even the best by fits what they despise    thus as no period is without its defects so by early habit we are all necessarily doomed to a participation of these defects hence all characters are imperfect not only from their internal frame and passions but from their external habits of education but where the scales fairly preponderate on the side of reason and virtue there though the character be imperfect it is not vicious  nay not only the worthiest are in some degree necessarily tinctured with the ruling errors of the times but i will go a step further my lord and affirm that men may be involved in the manners of the times to a degree that is even pernicious and yet not be justly stigmatized as immoral or unworthy characters so as to become justly the objects of hatred or detestation  to prove that i am not cooking up a new system in my own defense different from the principles of the estimate i must again have recourse to the estimate itself the following paragraph is decisive several habits qualities and actions which seem innocent in themselves as they affect or influence private life are equally or more hurtful than others of a more odious appearance if we consider them as they affect the public strength and welfare this comes to pass because the ill consequences of some actions are immediate of others more distant the first strike the imagination and are seen by all the latter must be traced up to their causes by the use of reason and to do this exceeds the talents of the many vol    p       give the author leave now my lord to apply this truth fairly and heartily in his own defense a use which he little dreamt when he writ it that he should ever have occasion to apply it to  when therefore the author charged his contemporaries with indulging manners pernicious to the public welfare he never intended to charge all who thus indulged them with any designed immorality or guilt these manners it appears do not necessarily imply an immoral character in the strictest sense because tho they be attended with distant consequences which are bad nay perhaps fatal yet these consequences are not always perceived or suspected by those who are involved in them there is in this case no idea no suspicion of any violation of duty the consequences are perhaps too distant to be seen by every eye and therefore strictly speaking no moral guilt or demerit can arise yet these manners to cite another passage which may convince you that the writers defense is built on his first principles though in appearance they are too trite to merit notice and too trifling for rebuke may in their tendency be as fatal to the stability of a nation as maxims and manners more apparently flagitious vol i p      now these manners my lord which are thus fraught with hidden and unseen mischief ought surely to be laid open in all their consequences no less than manners more apparently flagitious nay there is indeed the greater necessity for such a developement because without it even the worthy and wellintentioned may be drawn in while they suspect no such consequence to adopt a system of manners destructive to their country  let the following paragraph applied indeed in the book itself to a different purpose serve as a concurrent proof of what is here asserted the more trite and trifling the facts may seem the more their consequences are likely to escape notice for attention is naturally fixed only on things of manifest importance now if indeed notwithstanding this they be in their tendency as fatal to the stability of a nation as maxims and manners more apparently flagitious then it may be not only a task of some importance but of some delicacy too to trace them to their consequences and sources vol ii p      this my lord may be called the second degree in which the writer esteems his country very generally infected with that system of manners which he has attempted to disgrace but neither in this degree does he think that moral guilt is chargeable on the delinquents nor did he ever charge them with it so as to enendeavour to render individuals the objects of hatred and detestation  but there is a third degree of degeneracy which the writer esteems the proper object of severe censure and reproof and that is when through a determined pursuit of gain or pleasure manifest ill consequences are wilfully overlooked and seasonable admonitions neglected or when these consequences are seen and admonitions attended to yet deliberately despised and set at defiance now this degree of degeneracy my lord the author believes and hopes is not very common indeed the very tenor of his work the very essential principles on which he set out imply and affirm the contrary for if this had been the representation he had designed to make of his times and country he must have regarded and branded them as profligate now so far from this that he has expressly afmed as a fundamental principle of his work that the character of the times is not that of profligacy the slightest observation if attended with impartiality may convince us that the character of the manners of this age and nation is by no means that of abandoned wickedness and profligacy this degree of degeneracy indeed is often imputed vol i p    to the times but to what times has it not been imputed again if the previous estimate already given be just if the spirit of liberty humanity and equity be in a certain degree yet left among us some of the most essential foundations of abandoned wickedness and profligacy can have no place ib p      yet my lord though these atrocious crimes have no place among us so as to form the character of a people the writer can entertain no doubt but there are characters in every rank and station of life who may justly deserve the style of profligate this is often supposed in the course of the estimate these characters with their effects on the public welfare are incidentally touched on but as the general tenor and complexion of the work supposes that the general character of the times is totally different from this no candid reader sure will charge the writer with imputing this profligacy to any particular character unless where it is particularly affirmed and imputed  letter iv such then my lord is the general foundation of the writers main defense a defense which if every one had known his sentiments of men and things as well as your lordship he is persuaded he never could have had occasion to make and he has only to apply these general principles of defense to all those ranks conditions orders and professions which he has scrutinized in his estimate in order to clear himself of this capital objection  thus when he affirms that the leading ranks in general are infected with the manners of the times he means not to charge the leading ranks with a general profligacy or deliberate guilt he believes them involved from their situation in a system of manners and in very various degrees of these manners which if not attended to and curbed in their excess will soon or late endanger the stability of the commonwealth but he believes at the same time nay and knows it too that many among these leading ranks are possessed of qualities truly amiable he only thinks and has asserted what he thinks that they extend not their views to distant or future consequences but heedlessly adopt a system of manners which if unchecked in their progress will be attended with such effects as they themselves would tremble to behold  he regards the armies of great britain as being less grossly vicious than in former times he applauds their valor in particular instances but he points out what all indifferent people acknowledge that the ruling character of the times has naturally drawn them into a system of manners which tends to the destruction of military spirit  of the same kind are his strictures on the navy nay here he acknowledges instances of the most consummate bravery he laments the public act of their country which conspired with the manners of the times and exposed these gentlemen to the temptations of gain in preference to views of duty he affirms that their remissness is not properly a personal guilt but the natural effect of their situation in such a period and in such a nation for that they are brave hardy and intrepid till they rise to the higher commands and then the example and manners of the time infect them  he has treated his own profession with the same freedom and impartiality but what is remarkable here is that while some cry aloud against him for his ill usage of his own profession others affirm he has done it more than justice for it seems he has affirmed that in the middle ranks of this profession there are more good qualities found than in any other this indeed he thinks is true and resolves it not into the superior personal virtue of the professors but into the nature of the profession itself which among the middle ranks contains and presents stronger motives to virtue and more effctual bars to vice than any other profession he knows of now as he judges of the virtues so does he judge of the failings or if you will the vices of this order personal vices he never thought of meddling with but only the vices of rank and profession especially such as the manners of the times inflame now it is manifest that all those of this profession who converse with the world and are supposed to make part of it without regard to their particular rank stand exposed to temptations follies and vices which the more retired part of the profession are not exposed to in such a case it is hard to say where personal and moral guilt begins but this he adventures to say that many wellmeaning men in the profession may be involved in manners and habits which are consequentially pernicious though seemingly innocent this conduct is often the effect of inattention doubtless it is sometimes the result of deliberate design where the boundaries lie the writer pretends not to determine neither indeed is it necessary for his main purpose that he should determine because his main purpose was only to point out and prevent consequences and consequences will equally arise from any supposed system of conduct whether that conduct arises from mere inattention or from moral depravity of heart  with regard to the political leaders of the people every man who reads his work with an eye of candor and impartiality will see that the general drift of his reasoning is of the same kind he has represented the great as being too generally immersed in the pursuit of pleasure or of wealth for the sake of pleasure inattentive to the interests of the public but far from being void of private moral and personal virtues he acknowledges there are kind fathers mothers sisters brothers friends vol i part i  humanity to distress he insists on as a ruling feature of the times ib  and a general spirit of equity in all things that relate to private property between man and man these virtues yet left among us do not only form amiable characters in the common intercourses of private life but in his opinion may form a fair foundation on which to build those public virtues the loss of which he affirms and laments ib  it is the idea of a public that in his opinion is too generally lost it is the force of religion that is too generally no more it is the principle of virtuous and public honor that in his estimation is too generally dwindled into unmanly vanity thus while the manners of the times are in many instances amiable and alluring as they regard private life and particular connexions the great bonds of public strength the sinews of the commonwealth the manners and principles which should be the soul of the state should unite all its members into one body vigorous strong and terrible to its enemies these in his opinion have been relaxed into weakness and dissolution  nay even the great ruling evil of parliamentary influence whose effects on the national strength he has been so bold in disclosing and at which he believes the great have taken most offense  even this ruling evil he believes has made its progress in many instances through the mere blindness and inattention of the parties concerned who bent only on private advantage or perhaps actuated only by the reputation and honor annexed to an extensive influence a view no ways blameable while consistent with the welfare of the public and not conscious of those effects which naturally arose from such a conduct have often immersed themselves in all the wretchedness of party violence and boroughjobbing without any ill intention to the state nay in many cases he makes no doubt but the very private virtues of the man have given birth to the vices of the politician and a misguided love to sons daughters friends and dependants been the source of political servitude and attachments which in their unseen or unregarded effects have been of the most fatal consequence to the commonweal by raising men to public offices of trust and importance who were unequal to their station both in capacity public spirit and other necessary qualifications but although he thinks thus of many of his fellow subjects he cannot be so blindly credulous as to think thus of all he cannot doubt but there are some who would hire themselves out to sale would obstruct wholesome measures would forward bad ones in order to force themselves into lucrative employments and enrich themselves their families and dependants though the disorder or the ruin of the state were the foreseen and certain consequence yet how many of these characters may infest the nation or where such characters are to be looked for he neither has affirmed nor even insinuated his design was of a far different nature not to make personal applications but to trace acknowledged facts to their unseen consequences whether therefore dishonest intentions were concerned or not was of no essential import to his capital design which was only to point out the dangerous effects of such a ruling system of policy whether it was founded in blameless or in wicked intention  on these foundations then my lord the author of the estimate rests his defense he affirms what indeed the greater part of his readers are well satisfied of that he never meant to stigmatize or point out personal defects or vices but only those of rank of profession of the times he has in consequence of this principle endeavored to lay open the peculiar defects incident to each rank and profession but no where has he designedly pointed out the particular men which are chargeable with these defects so far is he from resolving these general defects or vices into personal and deliberate guilt that he thinks it possible that if the leading ranks and the middle ranks of the nation were to change places they might change characters too that many of those who are now borne down by the manners of the times might through such a change of situation stand entirely clear of them and many of those who now stand clear of them might be overwhelmed by their prevailing influence but if the writer was to estimate the moral merit or demerit of private and personal characters a thing which came not within his design he would surely go another way to work he would not weigh consequences so much as intentions he would consider who were delinquent through inadvertence and who through deliberate design as he never did this as nothing of this kind makes any part of his work as he has in many places declared the very contrary it is evident that he never meant to charge individuals with moral guilt but in one word to estimate the consequences of those manners and principles in which the particular state of the times has naturally in some degree or other involved himself his friends and his country  i foresee my lord an objection may rise to the propriety of this defense it may be asked if these manners and principles of the times are properly treated here with gentleness why in the estimate itself are they often treated with severity  the reply to this objection my lord is easy and not only consistent with the nature of the defense but indeed essentially founded on it in this defense the author has considered the manners and principles of the times as they affect the intentions of those who are involved in them their intentions he supposes to be in many instances void of deliberate guilt therefore when he regards them in this light he regards them as not chargeable with moral profligacy and therefore to be treated with gentleness  but in the estimate itself he considered the manners and principles of the times solely with regard to their consequences these he thought were pernicious and fatal and therefore the manners and principles which led to them were in his opinion to be displayed as being pernicious and fatal and therefore in this regard to be treated with severity  it is farther urged it seems that the writer has acted with a blameable partiality in painting the ruling follies and vices of the times with the utmost and even aggravated severity but has given few or no virtues to compensate whereas an estimator of the times ought to have been impartial and should have commended as well as blamed  that men of sense and knowledge should raise this objection is not so easily accounted for i can only suppose they take things upon trust and have not read the book my lord the writer has given a catalogue of virtues which adorn our times and country so very favorable that the only candid and decent adversary who has yet appeared against him thinks the picture in one circumstance rather flattering characteristics of the present political state of great britain p  0   hear what the writer himself adds on this subject in the second volume let us do justice to our age and country in every regard a political constitution superior to all that history has recorded or present times can boast a religious establishment which breathes universal charity and toleration a spirit of liberty yet unconquered a general humanity and sincerity beyond any nation upon earth an administration of justice that has even silenced envy  these are blessings which every englishman feels and ought to acknowledge  sure my lord these are far from general and undistinguishing invectives against our times and country beyond this the writer has expressly affirmed that in every rank order and profession there are men who stand distinguished by their capacity and virtue this catalogue he could have drawn out by particular panegyric but in the view of things and with the intentions with which he writ a general acknowledgment was sufficient and such an enlarged panegyric however just would have been highly blameable it could have answered but two purposes to make himself a favored writer among the great when he meant to be an honest one and to lull the higher ranks in that flattering stupor in which they were already sunk the first of these he was not sollicitous about the second he held dishonest mankind were to be awakened and alarmed this could not be done by dwelling on obsequious representations soft and gentle touches had been ineffectual the success of the stroke depended on the strength and boldness this was one of those particular occasions when it became his duty not only to cry aloud but to spare not the diseases of the times called for such a conduct the season was favorable it was the hour of sickness and the time to alarm the national distresses and disgraces had already awakened the fears of serious men this then was the time to point out the causes of the mischief and its cure these fears were not confined to men of speculation and the closet but public men and ministers saw and avowed the ruling evils which were freely and boldly exposed in the senate as they have been by the writer from the press this was the time for honest men of every rank to join with those men of public station in so laudable a work and to second and support their endeavors for a general reformation the great then were to be rouzed from their lethargy the people led to see the source of danger and to prevent it the view therefore was honest and laudable the means dangerous only to him that used them the writer may be found indeed to have judged ill for himself in the language of worldly prudence but a man who risks what is commonly held most dear from a conscientious and fixed resolve to do what he thinks his duty may seem reasonably entitled at least to the excuse of those who wish to see good manners and principles prevail some no doubt may think he has acted an imprudent part and sacrificed his chief interests but it is a mistake my lord for he has ever held his chief interests to lie in a perseverance in the paths of duty  letter v so much for the writers general defense you tell me next my lord that some people have found the appearance of an inconsistency while he delineates the times as selfish and yet admits them to be friendly charitable and humane  this objection arises like most of the rest from a misapprehension of his plan his design was to consider the general character of his contemporaries as they stand related to the public now in this light he cannot but regard the general character of the times as selfish we have not that real and generous concern for the national welfare which we discover in behalf of our friends or individuals in distress does not the following circumstance demonstrate the truth of this character that while large and generous subscriptions are carried on for the relief of all manner of private distress most men grudge what they are called upon to contribute toward the public exigencies they pay when they are compelled to pay with murmurs and reluctance i mean this of the superior ranks the poor farmer labourer and mechanic pays without repining the taxes on his candles his salt and his shoes though they are articles necessary to his subsistence but did the higher ranks show their public zeal when the wisdom of the legislature chose that article of luxury a coach or chariot as proper to support a moderate tax did each man press forward to take his trifling share of the general burden and to contribute a mite from his abundance when the pomp of the loaded sideboard became another object of a moderate tax did the owners rejoice in this opportunity of contributing to the wants of the public yet this was not only called by those who projected it a tax upon honor but in reality it was so since in the very nature of it it could not be made compulsory those who knew the manners of the age foresaw and fore told the consequences of it and in fact the public honor of some among the great was found on this occasion so equal to their public spirit that the tax has produced a mere trifle yet it seems the sense of shame could produce what public honor and public spirit failed to produce for i am told that the revenue arising from one of these taxes received a sudden and most astonishing increase from an order of the house of c that the names of those who had paid it should be laid before them those who would neither obey the law nor support the public were afraid of being exposed to the shame of having discovered that they failed in either they were content to do what they were ashamed to have it said they had done it is in truth owing in great part to the same turn of thought that so much offense has been taken amongst the higher ranks at the truths delivered in the estimate they see the representations there made are unfavourable to the conduct perhaps of themselves but at least of many of their friends whose private qualities they esteem and love how their public conduct affects the interests of their country they seldom enlarge their views so far as to consider and hence a writer who separates their public conduct from their private and considers the actions of men only as they regard his country cannot possibly fail of incurring their displeasure the reason my lord was assigned in the second volume enlarged views of benevolence are quite beyond the reach of such a people  letter vi your objections which follow next are chiefly personal however as they have been made they shall be answered you say my lord it has been asked who appointed this man a national preacher  now this expression is in truth metaphorical the literal and proper manner of putting the question if any doubt arises on the matter is this who gave this man authority to speak his thoughts on national affairs  when the thought is thus divested of figure and given in mere literal expression you see that any modest and sensible englishman would blush to ask the question it is doubting of that common right which every englishman demands and is possessed of this privilege the writer has exerted in common with hundreds of his time and nation by what motives other men may have been determined he leaves to themselves for his own part he spoke because he thought he saw the ruling errors of his country it is certain that in point of opinion he has a great majority in his favor but he never expected to find that majority among those ranks where the ruling errors are supposed to lie and if it be true as the writer often suggests that all national failures begin among the higher ranks it is certain that a declining nation may slide down to ruin before a national preacher be in form appointed or if he was it may be presumed his system of manners and principles would be somewhat curiously modeled and prescribed and would be more likely to help forward the ruling evils than to cure them  let us conclude then my lord that whoever has the power has likewise the right to command the national attention there never was any period in any state where reformations of some kind were not wanting the great point is not as is commonly done and with great applause to declaim in a vague manner against the iniquity of the times a kind of rhetoric which strikes the ear but never the heart but to point out the ruling errors and corruptions with such a particularity of circumstance that every delinquent in every rank shall see and be made to feel his own this my lord is the way to awaken to convince thus alone the mind and conscience is turned upon itself few men are so deliberately vile as to withstand the convictions of their own reason the great source of wickedness is selfdeceit but this method of convincing the writer was well aware is a task which however useful to the public will bring no favor to the individual who undertakes it  the next objection you tell me of my lord may seem to wear a little more than this the face of reason the objection is that considering the writers private station he takes too much upon himself in his censures on the great that he is insolent dogmatical arrogant assuming  with regard to this my lord the writer protests that so far as concerns himself he is content to be thought as inconsiderable as every reader chooses to make him in his own eyes he never obtruded any authority but that of reason he desired the world only to read the book and weigh the truth of it if to be the means of conveying some plain and necessary truths to the world without attacking the private character of individuals be insolence arrogance and dogmatism the writer stands guilty of the charge but if this be not the case if the accusation be founded in the mere want of those frequent and common apologies reserves exceptions salvos and douceurs by which writers are apt to court the selflove or malice of the world and by which every reader is happily prevented from applying any thing to himself the writer apprehends that in this case he is not assuming but that he did his duty in being explicit and intelligible  there is in this respect an essential difference between writing and speaking the speakers private rank and character is necessarily attended to because from his personal presence personal considerations will contrary to what is right intermix themselves a writer it has been generally supposed has the privilege to be exempt from these personal distinctions and restraints and if he loses the benefits of superior station on one hand on the other the want of them ought not to be imputed on the public stage all those who address the public are in rank equal or rather it is the province of reason and not of norroy king at arms to determine their superiority are the follies and vices attacked of a public or private nature if public they are of public cognizance and the accuser is not to be told that he has no right to accuse because he is of an inferior station it is enough that he is a fellowmember of the community if the happiness of his country be at stake it matters not whether it be endangered by the defects of the great or vulgar in such a case the point of ceremony must give way to the public welfare and the sole question worth debating is only whether the author speaks the truth in such a manner as may be of most effectual service to his country he gives in his evidence and proof to the great court of judicature the world and this he has a right to do in the same unreserved manner whether the ranks accused wear aprons bands cockades or coronets in a word the writer of the estimate and the private man are in this respect two different characters the latter knows his station and hopes he conducts himself in it with humility and propriety the persons of the great he treats with due respect and in point of decency and perhaps of dignity too maintains his distance as a writer he is a little more familiar with their vices when they interfere with the welfare of his country because these are not the objects of his reverence not even of his external reverence as they have no place rank or titles of honor legally annexed to them that he knows of in this kingdom as his censures therefore are general and nor particular he thinks he may arraign the vice and yet preserve due respect to the man  however though he held this principle of conduct to be necessary and therefore just yet like every other principle it certainly has its proper bounds nor does the writer pretend to erect himself into an absolute judge of the propriety of his own conduct in every instance all that he is sure of is only this that what he writ in this kind was the pure result of his prefering truth and public utility to the favor of any ranks or individuals whatever and if in the rapidity of composition any seeming excesses of this kind fell from his pen whoever may think they see such excesses will do him no more than justice if they ascribe them to the warmth of a wellintentioned mind heated with the importance of its subject  letter vii but you add my lord that supposing the representations just which the writer of the estimate has given of his times and country it is farther objected that as the book has been translated into foreign tongues and made its way on the continent it has given advantage and encouragement to our enemies by painting this nation as being sunk in effeminacy  alas my lord our enemies knew our weakness and degeneracy before the national disgraces had proclaimed it as to the causes and remedies of this political degeneracy the knowledge of these could only affect ourselves we might reap advantage if we so pleased by being led to the knowledge and sense of these our enemies had already reaped all the advantages of information from the mere knowledge of the fact is a nation to go quietly down to ruin without one awakening voice to rouse it from its fatal lethargy merely through fear that our enemies should take advantage they saw we were asleep they had surprised and attacked us in our slumber sure it could not be dangerous or hurtful to awaken from its dream a nation so exposed and attacked nor could it lessen that nation in anothers eyes to see there was one bold enough to attempt it  but it seems the alarm was so strong that it was in danger of throwing the nation from a state of blind security into a state of despair  this my lord is the vague language of undistinguishing objectors and savours little of the knowledge of human nature would to god the feelings of the guilty were so delicate but to bring that part of the nation which was sunk in blind security to the opposite extreme of despair is by no means an easy task there are many intermediate periods to be gone through of doubt suspicion fear despondency ere the dissolute mind can arrive at this extreme rouse the secure and luxurious as severely as you can you will hardly awaken them into the first stage of doubt a twitch by the ear or the scratch of a pin may be felt by a people whose sensibility is strong while their lethargic leaders sunk in indolence of manners may be proof against the application of redhot pincers  this my lord is a clear reply with regard to the higher ranks and leaders of the people with respect to the people themselves the thinking part had already been awakened into fear if not to despondency by the public disgraces i repeat it my lord that the nation stood aghast at its own misfortunes but like a man starting suddenly from sleep by the noise of some approaching ruin knew neither whence it came nor how to avoid it vol i p   0  what then was the consequence of this book it was to investigate the real causes of those national disgraces which had alarmed us and together with the causes to suggest the cure could this tend to drive a people to despair on the contrary it naturally led them to a rational and lively hope for together with the ruling evils the natural remedy was pointed out my lord the nation saw the remedy they have claimed it and already feel its powerful effects  letter viii your lordship says it is farther objected that if the substance of the work was true whence could such clamours arise against it even among any rank or party of men  the objections already stated by your lordship afford a reply in part to this general question  worthy men may have taken offense at the work from a consciousness of their own innocent intentions and a misapprehension of the authors main design they see not the consequences of those manners in which they are involved and therefore may think it unjust that these consequences should be charged upon their conduct which is intentionally blameless  farther that sparing hand with which the author thought it necessary to mingle panegyric in his work has undoubtedly been the occasion of much discontent  again the open and unreserved manner in which the estimate is written the seeming danger of telling so much political truth to the world supposing the representations true  all these my lord have been undoubtedly regarded as improper or imprudent steps and declaimed against as such by men of good intentions  for a reply to these objections your lordship is referred to the preceding letters there are other causes of clamor i apprehend of a very different nature and i will point out these with the same freedom  one source of clamor has been the obstinate blindness of the dissolute in every rank and station who being determined to proceed in the beaten track of pleasure without regard to consequences do therefore naturally dislike those who display them  again my lord the more truth appears in a work of this nature by which the interests of individuals are so nearly affected the more enemies the work must have among a certain party of men i mean all that party who look no farther than themselves and are watching to plunder the public for their own private emolument how large a party this may be or where they may lie the writer leaves to your lordship to determine it is enough to observe here that these men seeing their own plans of selfish interest obstructed by the open avowal of the truths thrown out so freely to the public in this estimate must naturally rise against the author and fasten upon him like a nest of hornets  besides these causes of offense and clamor i will beg leave to whisper another in your lordships ear it is a secret my lord which you great people are not often given to hear or understand many of the dependants of the great and whom they are pleased to call their friends are in truth no more than their flatterers in disguise they have not that generous regard to the real advantage of their lords and masters which they so zealously pretend their own interest is the compass they steer by they are therefore glad to take advantage of the common partialties of human nature to disgrace all men in the opinions of those whom they seem to serve who dare point out to them even the semblance of an error  letter ix you tell me farther my lord that a particular passage has given much offense to the universities and their friends in which a general censure is thrown on the heads of colleges  on this therefore the author thinks it necessary to explain himself more particularly as no man entertains a truer regard to the real honor and welfare of these learned bodies than himself  with regard therefore to what he apprehends to be the most material part of the supposed charge against these gentlemen that is their not sufficiently recollecting the original purpose of college government he finds that his meaning has been strangely mistaken or perverted he was not in that passage questioning the legal and statutable administration but pointing out the defective form of our collegeinstitutions and proposing a method by which their defects might in some measure be remedied through the voluntary care and superintendance of the heads in certain circumstances to which he believes they are not obliged by statute he had been pointing out the use and necessity of a subordination of instructors in which one party should be an assistance and a check to another and brought the great schools as examples in some degree of this proposed method of instruction whoever considers this circumstance here insisted on will find it of the last consequence in all public institutions it keeps all parties alive and active in their respective spheres who without these awakening checks are apt to slide down into unsuspected negligence now the general want of these continued and subordinate checks are in his opinion a capital defect in our university establishments he therefore took what he thinks an allowable freedom in pointing out this ruling defect which as it is not generally obviated by the governors of colleges as they do not regard it as a part of their office to instruct either the tutors or the pupils he could not resolve this omission into any cause more excusable than their not recollecting the orginal purpose of college government  as to the general causes of this inattention which in the writers opinion implies no positive demerit this was manifestly implied in the subsequent paragraph where the author declared he meant no personal invective  he supposes it to arise from imperfections common to men and to men of worth and probity as explained in the beginning of this defense see letter iii  with regard to certain particular attentions hinted at more especially to cards and entertainments if formerly some growing attentions of this kind fell under his observation in one of the universities such as the worthiest men might inadvertently fall into he is informed that they are now ceased his remark therefore not being applicable to the present time becomes a mistake in point of fact and as such he freely devotes and offers it up a voluntary sacrifice to truth and justice leaving it to those who are infallible to upbraid him with the acknowledgment of an error  letter x i proceed my lord to your last objection it seems the freedom with which the character of a famous minister is treated has been the occasion of much offense to his friends and adherents which form a large and powerful party in this kingdom  as to the mere matter of offense my lord there is no preventing it in certain cases but if the writer was to calculate numbers on this occasion he finds the majority would consist of those who think he has treated the character of this minister at least with sufficient lenity it is certainly a kind of presumption in his favor that one part of the nation thinks he has allowed too little and others too much to this deceased minister  be that as it may the investigation of this ministers principles and conduct is certainly of national concern it is of great importance to this kingdom that it be known whether his political system be salutary or destructive therefore the character of his administration not only may but ought to be freely and fairly canvassed for the conviction and benefit of the whole  had the writer treated this ministers character with contempt there had been some pretense for blame as he studiously avoided every thing of this kind he cannot but be astonished that men of candor and fair intentions can be offended at his cool and dispassionate reasonings on this subject he never entertained any personal dislike to this minister his friends or adherents on the contrary he knows some of them to be men of worth and honor the friends of liberty and their country and for whose characters he were both unjust and insensible if he had not the highest deference if he differs from these gentlemen in point of opinion they are satisfied he does it from the convictions of his own reason they know he proceeds on the same principles of liberty with themselves that he only dissents in his conclusions and are too just and generous to dislike him for throwing out his sentiments so freely on a subject of such importance  is the writer mistaken in his opinions concerning the conduct of this minister the press is open to every body why then is clamor spread instead of rational confutation to tie down the nation to this system to forbid or discourage rational inquiry into its tendency would be to erect a political tyranny in the state if it is clear then that the writers intentions are honest the friends of this minister will find it equitable to make allowance for difference in opinion what they contend for in religion will they deny in politics certainly my lord the maxims of arbitrary power sit with the worst grace on the declared patrons of freedom  it were perhaps unfair to charge any of the more generous part of this deceased ministers friends with joining in the clamours raised on this occasion that no candid and equitable mind can be disgusted at his conduct he concludes from the generous professions of a late writer so nearly connected with this minister that his evidence must be allowed above all suspicion this freedom of discussion on the dead of any rank or however consecrated by the authority of great names or even by the esteem of ages every man ought to be at liberty to exercise the greatest men certainly may be mistaken so may even the judgment of ages which often takes opinions upon trust no authority under divine is too great to be called in question and however venerable monarchy may be in a state no man ever wished to see the government of letters under any form but that of a republic as a citizen of that commonwealth i propose my sentiments for the revision of any decree of any honorary sentence as i think fit my fellow citizens equally free will vote according to their opinions preface to mr walpoles catalogue of royal and noble authors   such are this gentlemans free and generous principles on the like occasion and the writer is well persuaded that this honorable person is too equitable to refuse that privilege to another which he so rationally assumes to himself  letter xi others it seems my lord think it somewhat strange that a man should step out of his own profession and engage in a province in which he was no way particularly bound to concern himself  in reply to this my lord several considerations may be alleged the writer perhaps might content himself with the old apology of  homo sum humani nihil a me alienum puto he may allege that as the causes of the duration of the state are the main object of his enquiry the preservation of the christian and protestant religion become among other things the natural objects of his attention and pursuit above all my lord he insists that the system of policy which he recommends and enforces is not only religious but moral and therefore to endeavor to establish this system is to endeavor to establish the public happiness of mankind on the solid basis of virtue which is the end of religion itself he therefore thinks that both in this and in the pursuit of his greater plan he is to the utmost of his power serving the cause and end of religion and christianity the main drift of his general design being only to prove that the most effectual way to render kingdoms happy great and durable is to make them virtuous just and good in this point he confirms himself on the authority of an excellent prelate whose political researches were of like tendency as the sum of human happiness is supposed to consist in the goods of mind body and fortune i would fain make my studies of some use to mankind with regard to each of these three particulars and hope it will not be thought faulty or indecent in any man of what profession soever to offer his mite toward improving the manners health and prosperity of his fellow creatures dr berkleys misc p       letter xii such then my lord is the writers reply to the several objections which you tell me have been urged against his estimate how far it may be satisfactory he pretends not to determine but leaves every man to weigh it with candid freedom  give me leave now my lord to close this defense with a few observations which may still farther tend to clear the doubts of those who have started the objections  let them consider my lord that in a subject so wide multifarious and complicated as that of the manners and principles of a wealthy and luxurious nation there are not perhaps two individuals of that nation whose opinions do altogether coincide every man that examines such a subject proceeds not only on a view of facts but on a set of principles too in some degree different from those of every other the body of the nation which has been so partial in favor of this estimate should they compare their particular opinions would find them widely different in many circumstances and those among the higher ranks who have dissented should they enter into the same critical and minute comparison of each others thoughts would find them equally discordant if so my lord is not here a manifest reason for mutual forbearance where opinions clash and who will deny that it was a task of the greatest difficulty to steer through such a sea of doubt where though the facts lie open to every mans observation every man forms an opinion peculiar to himself the great outlines the essential truths the leading principles of such a work may be acknowledged to be just by thousands who amidst that infinite variety of circumstances glanced at in the course of it may have particular opinions different from the author and each other all therefore that a modest writer will pretend in such a case to give or a modest reader expect to find will be a good deal of truth and a little error  in consequence of this my lord consider farther how often and how naturally particular passages must necessarily be objected to in such a work while the general truths and leading principles on which the work is founded are totally overlooked for every reader erects himself into a judge of the particular remarks made and pronounces on them by the standard of his own judgment formed upon his own observation and principles while among the multitude of readers even of those who mean well an extended discernment of things and the comprehension of a general plan is not always to be found how easy a task then my lord and how natural to weak to vain or ungenerous minds to throw out objections to particular parts without any regard had to the main tenor extent and disposition of the whole  besides the nature of the subject there was a farther difficulty arising from the danger either of too general or too particular expression had the writer declaimed in a vague and undistinguishing manner on the errors and vices of the times he had failed of his main intent which was to point out where the ruling errors and vices lay had he singled out individuals he had justly incurred the censure of personal invective what then was left for him to do he only saw one proper expedient which was to give the predominant or leading character of the several ranks concerned yet to admit in general terms that in each rank there were exceptions to this leading character the very intention of his work forbad him to dwell at large on these exceptions see above letter iv p     and besides this main reason another presented itself had he professedly singled out every individual in every rank and station whose conduct deserved praise those who had been passed in silence might probably have upbraided him with personal reproach he judged it best therefore in general terms to admit exceptions but to leave it to every mans particular judgment to determine where these exceptions lay  letter xiii thus my lord the writer has endeavored to explain and defend his estimate in which he needed not to have been so sollicitous had it been true what it seems has been insinuated to your lordship that the work is not properly his own that he has only delivered the sentiments of other men and been the mere instrument of conveying their principles to the public but he here assures your lordship in the most solemn manner that the whole of this estimate was the sole result of his own reason uninfluenced by the advice or direction of any friend whatever and that indeed he thought the subject of so delicate a nature that it would have been ungenerous to have involved any friend in the personal consequences which he foresaw it might produce had no disagreeable effects attended the publication he should not have judged it necessary to make this avowal but as the clamor and displeasure of certain ranks have been the consequence of its appearance and success he thinks it a duty incumbent on him to clear every friend of this groundless imputation and declares that whatever may appear in it either inadvertent or erroneous the whole is to be attributed to himself alone to the overflowings of his own zeal thrown out to the world without disguise expectation or fear and bent not against persons but against the predominant errors follies and vices of his time and country his work has had the fate which might reasonably be expected it has been read approved dissented from and reviled for the conviction of those who have heartily dissented the publication of these letters may be of use but when the writer considers by whom his work has been approved and by whom reviled as the first of these parties desire no reply so the latter deserve none they have both done his work all the honor that is in their power to give and he cannot but esteem its fate to have been peculiarly happy the worst that he wishes to his worst enemy is honesty and a better mind  upon the whole my lord the writer can but declare his upright intentions and leave the world to judge of their propriety and success he would desire his countrymen to remember the generous maxim of a true politician that a patriot will admit there may be honest men and that honest men may differ and that where the heart is right there is true patriotism dr berkleys maxims  he knows it is the principle of many good men that all attempts toward innovation of whatever kind are dangerous for himself he is of a different opinion he thinks that seeming innovation is in many cases no more than the necessary means of preventing a gradual and unsuspected change of things for the worse which inevitably steals on in every state if not checked by timely and resolute applications  so far is the writer from imagining with the herd of politicians that there is no virtue nor good intention in any but those who approve that system of politics which he espouses that on the contrary he makes no doubt but some of the great who had not the courage to combat the ruling evils of the times wished sincerely to compass such an end but judged the end unattainable he is therefore the more surprised that individuals should take offense at this part of his work because it is pointed not against the conduct of individuals but against the common and ruling errors of the times he believes there are upright men of all parties and only wishes they would believe so of one another his approbation or disapprobation is not of men but measures and he is well persuaded that many of those who once thought the present measures of government impracticable begin now to see the possibility as well as the great importance of carrying on the public affairs on a higher principle than that of venal influence  so sudden and so great is the change in the appearance of our public affairs in consequence of this sudden and courageous check given to the ruling manners and principles of the times that the writer has been seriously asked whether the rising courage of the nation our formidable armaments and the gallant spirit of several young men of fashion and fortune are not so many confutations of the principles advanced in the estimate seriously my lord the writer of the estimate is right glad to be so confuted had these appearances risen before the publication of his work he might justly have been accused of partiality and misrepresentation but as it is confessed that these appearances are but now rising he will only desire his objectors to look back to the estimate itself and consider whether they are not rising on the very principles there urged delineated and foretold the writer did indeed believe he foresaw nay he foretold that necessity alone could bring back effeminate and unprincipled minds from their attachments to gain and pleasure vol i p   0  nay he foretold the very means the voice of an incorrupt people and a great minister vol i p      cast your eye back my lord to no very distant day and be you the judge what was the distress and what the necessity of the time had not a general dissolution of manners and of principle disordered nay almost unhinged the state this it was that united the voice the legal representations of an uncorrupted people that united voice steady not factious  loyal yet courageous  was heard and approved by a gracious sovereign the expected minister was found and a coercive power has thus appeared from the throne sufficient to control the blindness and folly of the dissolute and thoughtless among the higher ranks and to lead them to salutary measures and their own safety  mark the effects of this uniting power private good gives way to public the several ranks assume a spirit and fervor unknown before fear of shame and thirst of honor begin to spread through our fleets and armies and our growing youth seem already to catch the kindling fire in a word the national strength is awakened and called forth into action the genius of britain seems rising as from the grave he shakes himself from the dust assumes his ancient port and majesty of empire and goes forth in his might to overwhelm our enemies  i cannot conclude my lord without seriously recommending to your particular notice and regard two observations which contain indeed the substance and end of the estimate itself arising from the present state of our public affairs the first is that by proper exertions and welldirected applications the ruling evils of an effeminate period may be controuled the second is that under our present constitution the national affairs may be carried on with honor to the crown and success to the kingdom a truth which not long ago many serious men did not believe on a higher principle than that of corrupt influence  however let us not be intoxicated with the appearances of success the tree may blossom and yet be blasted the ruling defects and evils of the times are for the present controuled indeed but not extirpated the remedy though it begins to take effect is yet no more than temporary the distemper lurks though the symptoms begin to vanish let those who wish well to their country then be watchful and prepared against a relapse it is something to have checked the disease at its crisis the perfect cure will require the attention and labor of an age  finis
