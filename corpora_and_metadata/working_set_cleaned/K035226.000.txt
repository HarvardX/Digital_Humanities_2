a discourse on ancient and modern learning by the late right honorable joseph addison esquire published from an original manuscript of mr addisons prepared and corrected by himself  london printed for t osborne in grays inn mdccxxxiv  a discourse on ancient and modern learning the present age seems to have a very true taste of polite learning and perhaps takes the beauties of an ancient author as much as it is possible for it at so great a distance of time it may therefore be some entertainment to us to consider what pleasure the cotemporaries and countrymen of our old writers found in their works which we at present are not capable of and whether at the same time the moderns may not have some advantages peculiar to themselves and discover several graces that arise merely from the antiquity of an author  and here the first and most general advantage the ancients had over us was that they knew all the secret history of a composure what was the occasion of such a discourse or poem whom such a sentence aimed at what person lay disguised in such a character for by this means they could see their author in a variety of lights and receive several different entertainments from the same passage we on the contrary can only please ourselves with the wit or good sense of a writer as it stands stripped of all those accidental circumstances that at first helped to set it off we have him but in a single view and only discover such essential standing beauties as no time or years can possibly deface  i dont question but homer who in the diversity of his characters has far excelled all other heroic poets had an eye on some real persons who were then living in most of em the description of thersites is so spiteful and particular that i cannot but think it one of his own or his countrys enemies in disguise as on the contrary his nestor looks like the figure of some ancient and venerable patriot an effeminate fop perhaps of those times lies hid in paris and a crafty statesman in ulysses patroclus may be a compliment on a celebrated friend and agamemnon the description of a majestic prince ajax hector and achilles are all of em valiant but in so different a manner as perhaps has characterised the different kinds of heroism that homer had observed in some of his great cotemporaries thus far we learn from the poets life that he endeavored to gain favor and patronage by his verse and it is very probable he thought on this method of ingratiating himself with particular persons as he has made the drift of the whole poem a compliment on his country in general  and to show us that this is not a bare conjecture only we are told in the account that is left us of homer that he inserted the very names of some of his cotemporaries tychius and mentor in particular are very neatly celebrated in him the first of these was an honest cobbler who had been very kind and serviceable to the poet and is therefore advanced in his poem to be ajaxs shieldmaker the other was a great man in ithaca who for his patronage and wisdom has gained a very honorable post in the odysses where he accompanies his great countryman in his travels and gains such a reputation for his prudence that minerva took his shape upon her when she made herself visible themius was the name of homers schoolmaster but the poet has certainly drawn his own character under when he sets him forth as a favorite of apollo that was deprived of his sight and used to sing the noble exploits of the grecians  virgil too may well be supposed to give several hints in his poem which we are not able to take and to have lain many bye designs and underplots which are too remote for us to look into distinctly at so great a distance but as for the characters of such as lived in his own time i have not so much to say of him as of homer he is indeed very barren in this part of his poem and has but little varied the manners of the principal persons in it his aeneas is a compound of valor and piety achates calls himself his friend but takes no occasion of showing himself so mnesteus sergestus gyas and cloanthus are all of em men of the same stamp and character   fortemque gyan fortemque cloanthum besides virgil was so very nice and delicate a writer that probably he might not think his compliment to augustus so great or so artfully concealed if he had scattered his praises more promiscuously and made his court to others in the same poem had he entertained any such design agrippa must in justice have challenged the second place and if agrippas representative had been admitted aeneas would have had very little to do which would not have redounded much to the honor of his emperor if therefore virgil has shadowed any great persons besides augustus in his characters they are to be found only in the meaner actors of his poem among the disputers for a petty victory in the fifth book and perhaps in some few other places i shall only mention iopas the philosophical musician at didos banquet where i cannot but fancy some celebrated master complimented for methinks the epithet crinitus is so wholly foreign to the purpose that it perfectly points at some particular person who perhaps to pursue a wandering guess was one of the grecian performers then at rome for besides that they were the best musicians and philosophers the termination of the name belongs to their language and the epithet is the same  that homer gives to his countrymen in general  now that we may have a right notion of the pleasure we have lost on this account let us only consider the different entertainment we of the present age meet with in mr drydens absalom and achitophel from what an english reader will find a hundred years hence when the figures of the persons concerned are not so lively and fresh in the minds of posterity nothing can be more delightful than to see two characters facing each other all along and running parallel through the whole piece to compare feature with feature to find out the nice resemblance in every touch and to see where the copy fails and where it comes up to the original the reader cannot but be pleased to have an acquaintance thus rising by degrees in his imagination for whilst the mind is busy in applying every particular and adjusting the several parts of the description it is not a little delighted with its discoveries and feels something like the satisfaction of an author from its own composure  what is here said of homer and virgil holds very strong in the ancient satirists and authors of dialogues but especially of comedies what could we have made of aristophaness clouds had he not told us on whom the ridicule turned and we have good reason to believe we should have relished it more than we do had we known the design of each character and the secret intimations in every line histories themselves often come down to us defective on this account where the writers are not full enough to give us a perfect notion of occurrences for the tradition which at first was a comment on the story is now quite lost and the writing only preserved for the information of posterity  i might be very tedious on this head but i shall only mention another author who i believe received no small advantage from this consideration and that is theophrastus who probably has shown us several of his cotemporaries in the representation of his passions and vices for we may observe in most of his characters something foreign to his subject and some other folly or infirmity mixing itself with the principal argument of his discourse his eye seems to have been so attentively fixed on the person in whom the vanity reigned that other circumstances of his behavior besides those he was to describe insinuated themselves unawares and crept insensibly into the character it was hard for him to extract a single folly out of the whole mass without leaving a little mixture in the separation so that his particular vice appears something discolored in the description and his discourse like a glass set to catch the image of any single object gives us a lively resemblance of what we look for but at the same time returns a little shadowy landscape of the parts that lie about it  and as the ancients enjoyed no small privilege above us in knowing the persons hinted at in several of their authors so they received a great advantage in seeing often the pictures and images that are frequently described in many of their poets when phidias had carved out his jupiter and the spectators stood astonished at so awful and majestic a figure he surprised them more by telling them it was a copy and to make his words true showed them the original in that magnificent description of jupiter toward the latter end of the first iliad the comparing both together probably discovered secret graces in each of em and gave new beauty to their performances thus in virgils first aeneid where we see the representation of rage bound up and chained in the temple of janus  furor impius intus saeva sedens super arma et centum vinctus ahenis post tergum nodis fremit horridus ore cruento   though we are much pleased with so wonderful a description how must the pleasure double on those who could compare the poet and the statuary together and see which had put most horror and distraction in his figure but we who live in these lower ages of the world are such entire strangers to this kind of diversion that we often mistake the description of a picture for an allegory and dont so much as know when it is hinted at juvenal tells us a flatterer will not stick to compare a weak pair of shoulders to hercules when he lifts antaeus from the earth now what a forced unnatural similitude does this seem amidst the deep silence of scholiasts and commentators but how full of life and humor if we may suppose it alluded to some remarkable statue of these two champions that perhaps stood in a public place of the city there is now in rome a very ancient statue entangled in a couple of marble serpents and so exactly cut i laccoons posture and circumstances that we may be sure virgil drew after the statuary or the statuary after virgil and if the poet was the copyer we may be sure it was no small pleasure to a roman that could see so celebrated an image outdone in the description  i might here expatiate largely on several customs that are now forgotten though often intimated by ancient authors and particularly on many expressions of their cotemporary poets which they had an eye upon in their reflections though we at present know nothing of the business thus ovid begins the second book of his elegies with these two lines haec quoque scribebam pelignis natus aquosis ille ego nequitiae naso poeta meae   how far these may prove the four verses prefixed to virgils aeneid genuine i shall not pretend to determine but i dare say ovid in this place hints at em if they are so and i believe every reader will agree that the humor of these lines would be very much heightened by such an allusion if we suppose a love adventure ushered in with an ille ego and taking its rise from something like a preface to the aeneid guesses might be numberless on this occasion and though sometimes they may be grounded falsely yet they often give a new pleasure to the reader and throw in abundance of light on the more intricate and obscure passages of an ancient author  but there is nothing we want more direction in at present than the writings of such ancient authors as abound with humor especially where the humor runs in a kind of cant and a particular set of phrases we may indeed in many places by the help of a good scholiast and skill in the customs and language of a country know that such phrases are humorous and such a metaphor drawn from a ridiculous custom but at the same time the ridicule flags and the mirth languishes to a modern reader who is not so conversant and familiar with the words and ideas that lie before him so that the spirit of the jest is quite palled and deadend and the briskness of an expression lost to an ear that is so little accustomed to it this want of discerning between the comical and serious style of the ancients has run our modern editors and commentators into a senseless affectation of terences and plautuss phrases when they desire to appear pure and classical in their language so that you often see the grave pedant making a buffoon of himself where he least designs it and running into light and trifling phrases where he would fain appear solemn and judicious  another great pleasure the ancients had beyond us if we consider em as the poets countrymen was that they lived as it were on the spot and within the verge of the poem their habitations lay among the scenes of the aeneid they could find out their own country in homer and had every day perhaps in their sight the mountain or field where such an adventure happened or such a battle was fought many of em had often walked on the banks of helicon or the sides of parnassus and knew all the private haunts and retirements of the muses so that they lived as it were on fairy ground and conversed in an enchanted region where every thing they looked upon appeared romantic and gave a thousand pleasing hints to their imaginations to consider virgil only in this respect how must a roman have been pleased that was well acquainted with the capes and promontories to see the original of their names as they stand derived from misenus palinurus and cajeta that could follow the poets motions and attend his hero in all his marches from place to place that was very well acquainted with the lake amsanctus where the fury sunk and could lead you to the mouth of the cave where aeneas took his descent for hell their being conversant with the place where the poem was transacted gave em a greater relish than we can have at present of several parts of it as it affected their imaginations more strongly and diffused through the whole narration a greater air of truth the places stood as so many marks and testimonies to the veracity of the story that was told of em and helped the reader to impose upon himself in the credibility of the relation to consider only that passage in the  th aeneid where the poet brings his hero acquainted with evander and gives him a prospect of that circuit of ground which was afterward covered with the metropolis of the world the story of cacus which he there gives us at large was probably raised on some old confused tradition of the place and if so was doubly entertaining to a roman when he saw it worked up into so noble a piece of poetry as it would have pleased an englishman to have seen in prince arthur any of the old traditions of guy varied and beautified in an episode had the chronology suffered the author to have led his hero into warwickshire on that occasion the map of the place which was afterward the seat of rome must have been wonderfully pleasing to one that lived upon it afterward and saw all the alterations that happened in such a compass of ground two passages in it are inimitably fine which i shall here transcribe and leave the reader to judge what impressions they made on the imagination of a roman who had every day before his eyes the capitol and the forum hinc ad tarpeiam sedem et capitolia ducit aurea nunc olim silvestribus horrida dumis jam tum religio pavidos terrebat agrestes dira loci jam tum silvam faxumque tremebant hoc nemus hunc inquit frondoso vertice collem quis deus incertum est habitat deus arcades ipsum credunt se vidisse jovem cum saepe nigrantem aegida concuteret dextra nimbosque cieret   and afterward  ad tecta subibant pauperis evandri passimque armenta videbant romanoque foro et lautis mugire carinis   there is another engaging circumstance that made virgil and homer more particularly charming to their own countrymen than they can possibly appear to any of the moderns and this they took hold of by choosing their heroes out of their own nation for by this means they have humored and delighted the vanity of a grecian or roman reader they have powerfully engaged him on the heros side and made him as it were a party in every action so that the narration renders him more intent the happy events raise a greater pleasure in him the passionate part more moves him and in a word the whole poem comes more home and touches him more nearly than it would have done had the scene lain in another country and a foreigner been the subject of it no doubt but the inhabitants of ithaca preferred the odysses to the iliad as the myrmidons on the contrary were not a little proud of their achilles the men of pylos probably could repeat word for word the wise sentences of nestor and we may well suppose agamemnons countrymen often pleased themselves with their princes superiority in the greek confederacy i believe therefore no englishman reads homer or virgil with such an inward triumph of thought and such a passion of glory as those who saw in them the exploits of their own countrymen or ancestors and here by the way our milton has been more universally engaging in the choice of his persons than any other poet can possibly be he has obliged all mankind and related the whole species to the two chief actors in his poem nay what is infinitely more considerable we behold in him not only our ancestors but our representatives we are really engaged in their adventures and have a personal interest in their good or ill success we are not only their offspring but sharers in their fortunes and no less than our own eternal happiness or misery depends on their single conduct so that every reader will here find himself concerned and have all his attention and solicitude raised in every turn and circumstance of the whole poem  if the ancients took a greater pleasure in the reading of their poets than the moderns can their pleasure still rose higher in the perusal of their orators though this i must confess proceeded not so much from their precedence to us in respect of time as judgment every city among them swarmed with rhetoricians and every senate house was almost filled with orators so that they were perfectly well versed in all the rules of rhetoric and perhaps knew several secrets in the art that let em into such beauties of demosthenes or cicero as are not yet discovered by a modern reader and this i take to have been the chief reason of that wonderful efficacy we find ascribed to the ancient oratory from what we meet with in the present for in all arts every man is most moved with the perfection of em as he understands em best now the rulers of greece and rome had generally so well accomplished themselves in the politer parts of learning that they had a high relish of a noble expression were transported with a well turned period and not a little pleased to see a reason urged in its full force they knew how proper such a passage was to affect the mind and by admiring it insensibly begot in themselves such a motion as the orator desired the passion arose in em unawares from their considering the aptness of such words to raise it accordingly we find the force of tullys eloquence showed itself most on caesar who probably understood it best and cicero himself was so affected with demosthenes that it is no wonder when he was asked which he thought the best of his orations he should reply the longest but now the generality of mankind are so wholly ignorant of the charms of oratory that tully himself who guided the lords of the whole earth at his pleasure were he now living and a speaker in a modern assembly would not with all that divine pomp and heat of eloquence be able to gain over one man to his party the vulgar indeed of every age are equally moved by false strains of rhetoric but they are not the persons i am here concerned to account for  the last circumstance i shall mention which gave the ancients a greater pleasure in the reading of their own authors than we are capable of is that knowledge they had of the sound and harmony of their language which the moderns have at present a very imperfect notion of we find even in music that different nations have different tastes of it and those who most agree have some particular manner and graces proper to themselves that are not so agreeable to a foreigner whether or no it be that as the temper of the climates varies it causes an alteration in the animal spirits and the organs of hearing or as such passions reign most in such a country so the sounds are most pleasing that most affect those passions or that the sounds which the ear has been most accustomed to insensibly conform the secret texture of it to themselves and wear in it such passages as are best fitted for their own reception or in the last place that our national prejudice and narrowness of mind makes every thing appear odd to us that is new and uncommon whether any one or all of these reasons may be looked upon as the cause we find by certain experience that what is tuneful in one country is harsh and ungrateful in another and if this consideration holds in musical sounds it does much more in those that are articulate because there is a greater variety of syllables than of notes and the ear is more accustomed to speech than songs but had we never so good an ear we have still a faultring tongue and a kind of impediment in our speech our pronunciation is without doubt very widely different from that of the greeks and romans and our voices in respect of theirs are so out of tune that should an ancient hear us he would think we were reading in another tongue and scarce be able to know his own composure by our repetition of it we may be sure therefore whatever imaginary notions we may frame to ourselves of the harmony of an author they are very different from the ideas which the author himself had of his own performance  thus we see how time has quite worn out or decayed several beauties of our ancient authors but to make a little amends for the graces they have lost there are some few others which they have gathered from their great age and antiquity in the world and here we may first observe how very few passages in their style appear flat and low to a modern reader or carry in em a mean and vulgar air of expression which certainly arises in a great measure from the death and difuse of the languages in which the ancients compiled their works most of the forms of speech made use of in common conversation are apt to sink the dignity of a serious style and to take off from the solemnity of the composition that admits them nay those very phrases that are in themselves highly proper and significant and were at first perhaps studied and elaborate expressions make but a poor figure in writing after they are once adopted into common discourse and sound over familiar to an ear that is every where accustomed to them they are too much dishonored by common use and contract a meanness by passing so frequently through the mouths of the vulgar for this reason we often meet with something of a baseness in the styles of our best english authors which we cannot be so sensible of in the latin and greek writers because their language is dead and no more used in our familiar conversations so that they have now laid aside all their natural homeliness and simplicity and appear to us in the splendour and formality of strangers we are not intimately enough acquainted with them and never met with their expressions but in print and that too on a serious occasion and therefore find nothing of that levity or meanness in the ideas they give us as they might convey into their minds who used em as their mother tongue to consider the latin poets in this light ovid in his metamorphosis and lucan in several parts of him are not a little beholden to antiquity for the privilege i have here mentioned who would appear but very plain men without it as we may the better find if we take em out of their numbers and see how naturally they fall into low prose claudian and statius on the contrary whilst they endeavor too much to deviate from common and vulgar phrases clog their verse with unnecessary epithets and swell their style with forced unnatural expressions till they have blown it up into bombast so that their sense has much ado to struggle through their words virgil and horace in his odes have run between these two extremes and made their expressions very sublime but at the same time very natural this consideration therefore least affects them for though you take their verse to pieces and dispose of their words as you please you still find such glorious metaphors figures and epithets as give it too great a majesty for prose and look something like the ruin of a noble pile where you see broken pillars scattered obelisks maimed statues and a magnificence in confusion  and as we are not much offended with the low idiotisms of a dead language so neither are we very sensible of any familiar words that are used in it as we may more particularly observe in the names of persons and places we find in our english writers how much the proper name of one of our own countrymen pulls down the language that surrounds it and familiariseth a whole sentence for our ears are so often used to it that we find something vulgar and common in the sound and cant but fancy the pomp and solemnity of style too much humbled and depressed by it for this reason the authors of poems and romances who are not tied up to any particular set of proper names take the liberty of inventing new ones or at least of choosing such as are not used in their own country and by this means not a little maintain the grandeur and majesty of their language now the proper names of a latin or greek author have the same effect upon us as those of a romance because we meet with em no where else but in books cato pompey and marcelles sound as great in our ears who have none of their families among us as agamemnon hector and achilles and therefore though they might flatten an oration of tully to a roman reader they have no such effect upon an english one what i have here said may perhaps give us the reason why virgil when he mentions the ancestors of three noble roman families turns sergius memmius and ciuentius which might have degraded his verse too much into sergestes mnestheus and cloanthus though the three first would have been as high and sonorous to us as the other  but though the poets could make thus free with the proper names of persons and in that respect enjoyed a privilege beyond the prose writers they lay both under an equal obligation as to the names of places for there is no poetical geography rivers are the same in prose and verse and the towns and countries of a romance differ nothing from those of a true history how oddly therefore must the name of a paultry village sound to those who were well acquainted with the meanness of the place and yet how many such names are to be met with in the catalogues of homer and virgil many of their words must therefore very much shock the ear of a roman or greek especially whilst the poem was new and appear as meanly to their own countrymen as the duke of buckinghams putney pikes and chelsea curiaseers do to an englishman but these their catalogues have no such disadvantageous sounds in em to the ear of a modern who scarce ever hears of the names out of the poet or knows any thing of the places that belong to them london may sound as well to a foreigner as troy or rome and islington perhaps better than london to them who have no distinct ideas arising from the names i have here only mentioned the names of men and places but we may easily carry the observation further to those of several plants animals etc thus where virgil compares the flight of mercury to that of a waterfowl servius tells us that he purposely omitted the word mergus that he might not debase his style with it which though it might have offended the niceness of a roman ear would have sounded more tolerable in ours scaliger indeed ridicules the old scholiast for his note because as he observes the word mergus is used by the same poet in his georgics but the critic should have considered that in the georgics virgil studied description more than majesty and therefore might justly admit a low word into that poem which would have disgraced his aeneid especially when a god was to be joined with it in the comparison  as antiquity thus conceals what is low and vulgar in an author so does it draw a kind of veil over any expression that is strained above nature and recedes too much from the familiar forms of speech a violent grecism that would startle a roman at the reading of it sounds more natural to us and is less distinguishable from other parts of the style an obsolete or a new word that made a strange appearance at first to the readers eye is now incorporated into the tongue and grown of a piece with the rest of the language and as for any bold expressions in a celebrated ancient we are so far from disliking em that most readers single out only such passages as are most daring to commend and take it for granted that the style is beautiful and elegant where they find it hard and unnatural thus has time mellowed the works of antiquity by qualifying if i may so say the strength and rawness of their colors and casting into shades the light that was at first too violent and glaring for the eye to behold with pleasure  finis
