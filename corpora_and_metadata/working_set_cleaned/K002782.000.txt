indigestion that particular state of the alimentary canal which is termed indigestion is known to subsist by the following  symptoms diminution or total loss of appetite nausea sometimes retching and vomiting especially in the morning bad taste in the mouth foul tongue flatulency distention pain and uneasiness in the stomach and bowels particularly after meals acid and windy eructations heartburn and flushings in the face sometimes a lax habit takes place at other times an obstinate costiveness supervenes  causes intemperance in eating and drinking with the immoderate use of spices strong rich sauces wines and ardent spirits these by violently stimulating and distending the fibers of the stomach and bowels destroy their natural elasticity and the sensibility of their nerves by which the blood becomes vitiated and a disordered state of the whole body is frequently produced  defect in either the quantity or quality of the food  moist warm confined or impure air  living in low damp houses and in the neighborhood of marshes and stagnant waters  want of due exercise  a sedentary life  intense study  the abuse of mercury is another and frequent cause of indigestion many constitutions have suffered more from the injudicious use of this most valuable medicine than by the very discase it was intended to cure when taken improperly it injures the nerves as well as the stomach and bowels and subjects the patient to the gout dbility consumption nervous disorders loss of memory lowness of spirits and often induces premature old age  the use of tobacco may be also ranked among the causes of indigestion it frequently prves injurious to the stomach when first made use of either in smoking or chewing owing to the profuse discharge of saliva or spittle it occasions the injury sustained by the use of tobacco will always be in proportion to the loss of saliva and its narcotic power upon the nerves  effects i accumulation of indigestible matter in the stomach and bowels hence proceed  vomiting and purging  colic flatulent or bilious  worms  intermitting fevers  large bellies in children  ii debility of the general system producing  agues  fevers  gout  scrofula  rickets  and jaundice  iii irregular performance of the secretions and excretions from whence arise  catarrhal defluxions  asthma  consumption  diabetes  fluor albus or whites  iv debility of the absorbent system whereby the lymphatic exhalation is not taken up so quick as excreted by the exhalent arteries hence  leucophlegmacy  dropsy partial and general  v debility of the nerves in general producing  pains in the head especially periodical  spasms of the stomach and bowels  hysteric disease  hypochondriasis  lethargy  apoplexy  palsy  after enumerating these effects it must evidently appear that the cause of almost every obstinate complicated and incurable disease originates in the stomach and therefore though indigestion has been treated as a trifling complaint it certainly demands our most serious attention  in order to illustrate more fully how indigestion becomes the primary cause of most disorders to which the human body is subject and to account for those symptoms which constitute that morbid state i shall here describe  the process of digestion or the progress of the aliment from the mouth to the heart and lungs with the changes it undergoes in its passage until it is converted into blood showing by what law of the animal economy the body is maintained and supported in a natural healthy state after the masticated food is conveyed into the stomach it is there reduced into a soft pulpy mass the stomach then more strongly contracts and forces out at every such contraction a portion of its contents until the whole is evacuated into the first bowel called by anatomists duodenum hence arises the true sensation of hunger but if the stomach through weakness is unable either properly to digest the aliment or to contract with sufficient force so as to evacuate its contents in due time an unnatural fermentation with an increased secretion take place which produce the symptoms of indigestion such as flatulency distention eructations acidity great uneasiness fickness vomiting pain and spasm or cramp of the stomach loss of appetite flushing heats pain and giddiness of the head with sometimes a palpitation of the heart etc  when the food thus partially dissolved gets into the first bowel it there meets with the bile or gall and the pancreatic juice intended to answer some unknown purpose in the act of digestion these fluids being intimately combined with this alimentary pulp which they further attenuate and dissolve and into which they seem to infuse new properties is pushed forward through the bowels by their frequent contractions and the more fluid part called chyle being separated in this progression is absorbed and conveyed to the blood by the lacteals while the more solid part thus deprived of every nutritious particle is evacuated from the body as useless but when the bowel are become weak through the stomach remaining so for a length of time this must be the case they will be unable to contract sufficiently as either perfectly to separate the fluid from the solid part or to evacuate their contents in due time hence arise crude chyle a costive habit piles flatulent colic head ach and collections of slimy matter in the bowels from which many diseases are derived especially worms  the liquid part of the digested aliment being separated from the solid part by the natural contractile power of the bowels becomes a mild sweet and whitish fluid termed chyle which the lacteals absorb and convey to the mesenteric glands and afterward to the thoracic duct from which it is poured into the left subclavian vein and by that into the heart and lungs here the chyle is mixed with the blood which changes and assimilates that fluid into its own nature this is called sanguification it is from this fluid that the blood is made and this affords that supply of nutrition which the continual waste of the body is found to require i shall now point out  the offices of the blood the blood supplies every waste of the body made by the different secretions the secretid fluids therefore certainly are all formed from the blood such as the perspiration urine saliva bile etc it forms every part of the body both solids and fluids it repairs diseased parts it forms that hard substance or cement in fractures which unites the ends of broken bones so firmly together in short it regenerates all the solid parts of the animal system and replenishes all the waste of the fluids such being the important offices of the blood it is universally allowed to be and it most certainly is the principle or pabulum of life but unless the blood is constantly recruited by a fresh supply of good chyle from which as before observed it is made an impoverished and vitiated state of that vital fluid must ensue consequently these offices so essential to health cannot be duly performed nor that waste occasioned by the different secretions be properly supplied hence arise general debility nervous disorders gout dropsy jaundice and cutaneous eruptions  though it is evident that the chyle supplies the blood with its nutrition and that is the former is vitiated the latter must sooner or later become so too yet it is necessary to remark that besides the chyle the blood in its passage through the lungs receives from the external air during the act of inspiration another principle which is called oxygen air this is the source of animal heat as well as the cause of sensibility irritability and motion  it is this which empowers the blood to stimulate the heart and arteries into action  it is this which gives the blood its florid c lour in short this imparts to it the vital principle  in order to render the last paragraph more perspicuous i shall specify the component parts of the atmosphere this is a body consisting of two species of airs namely oxygen and azot which bear a certain proportion to each other that is about twentyeight parts of oxygenated vital or dephlogisticated air which supports life and flame and seventy two parts of azotic commonly called phlogisticated air which destroys both this atmospheric air being inspired by the lungs meets there with the blood passing through them to which the oxygenated or vital air having a greater affinity than to the azotic or phlogisticated air disengages itself from the azot and combines with the blood which at the same time parts with another species of air that has a greater affinity to the azot than it has to the blood these two extricated fluids to wit that escaping from the blood and the azotic air combining together are expelled from the lungs in the form of vapor termed breath this constant action of the lungs constitutes what is called respiration  but whenever the oxygen or dephlogisticated air becomes much diminished according to the proportion which it ought to bear to the other component part of the atmosphere in order to answer the purposes of life  or in other words where the atmosphere is lowered or contaminated  the blood loses its natural stimulus hence arises a diminished action of the heart and arteries the consequences of which are fainting languor head ach difficulty of breathing general relaxation and if it continues long in that state cutaneous eruptions and especially the sea scurvy  the necessity of obtaining the air in as pure a state as the atmosphere will admit must appear obvious from what has been said respecting its wonderful effects this is quite as requisite to be attended to as preserving the strength of the digestive organs for while the chyle which is prepared by them from the food is supplying the waste occasioned by the different offices of the blood the oxygen received by the lungs from the atmosphere at the same time is supporting its heat and action without which life cannot subsist  the following circumstances produce a diminution of oxygen in the air  first a great number of people being assembled together in any place in which the air has not a free circulation or where its equilibrium is not restored so quickly as it is destroyed by respiration  secondly large fires in rooms from whence the external air is in a great measure excluded for the fire in order to support itself attracts the oxygen and consumes it whereby the vital property of the air is decreased and the larger the sire the greater quantity of air must necessarily be consumed hence the impropriety of great fires in small rooms or bedchambers  thirdly burning many candles renders the air foul from the beforementioned cause because the flame destroys the purity of the air it has been ascertained that each person destroys the vivifying principle of a gallon of air in one minute also that a single candle consumes a similar quantity in the same space of time which shows that oxygen or pure air equally support animal life and flame for where a candle will not burn owing to the want of a supply or it an animal cannot live these three circumstances are therefore such as destroy the purity of the air and render that element unfit for the purposes of life so that in a very short time and even in a spacious apartment any of them must prove destructive to the vital principle of a large column of air hence where these unavoidably take place ventilators absolutely become requisite  it may be necessary here to observe that water and vegetables have a contrary effect for they attract and absorb the impure air and consequently increase the vital property thereof hence the air in the country and that on the sea coast is more salubrious than that of cities and large towns  cure of indigestion i have made use of various medicines for the cure of this complaint which are usually prescribed in the common routine of the practice of physic such as bark bitters preparations of steel or iron joined with carminatives or aromatics and every other remedy applied for debility of the stomach and bowels but none of these have acted with so much safety or have been attended with such beneficial effects either as an aperient sedative or tonic as i have uniformly experienced during an extensive practice of many years from the use of  the tonic powders and drops it may therefore be necessary that some remarks should be made on the admirable properties of these valuable medicines more especially with regard to  their general effects the tonic powders evacuate bile phlegm and water which are the greatest impediments to health hence they become highly useful whenever there is a redundancy of bile or phlegm or any dropfical swelling especially in the feet or legs  they promote the natural action of the stomach and howels  they obviate costiveness and prevent those complaints dependant thereon hence they are of the utmost service in costive habits  they render the body cool and comfortable hence they are of the greatest benefit where there are feverish hectic or flushing heats  many families of the highest respectability are ready to testify that both they and their children have enjoyed much better health in every respect ever since they were recommended to take the tonic powders and also that the expense of medicines has been very trifling since they made use of these in comparison to what it had been before that period  by having recourse to them occasionally when costive and when any uneasiness or pain of the stomach and bowels or feverish heat etc take place the constitution will be preserved from a variety of complaints that otherwise would happen what adds much to the value of these powders is  that no age sex or constitution nor any circumstance whatever can render them objectionable  while the powders evacuate the indigestible matter the tonic drops strengthen the stomach and bowels and thereby prevent a return of the complaints  they likewise strengthen the general and nervous system hence their great utility in nervous diseases and debility of every kind however induced  they create an appetite and also expel wind  they have frequently removed the gout in the stomach after many other medicines had been given without effect  when these powders and drops are properly taken together they promote the secretions and effectually cure all the complaints of the stomach and bowels which no single medicine could accomplish alone because the drops are regularly and uninterruptedly taken in the complaint and the powders only conditionally during their use so that they jointly remove the disorder and restore to the habit its pristine healthy state  diet the diet in indigestion should be particularly attended to which will not only facilitate its cure but will also be the means of preventing complaints in general  the best food for breakfast during this disorder provided is agrees with the patients stomach is  milk which is easy of digestion and affords a greater supply of nourishment to the body when the digestive organs are weak and with much more certainty than any other kind of food in cases of emaciation and general debility also when the powers of nature or the vigor of the constitution begin to decline milk is a most excellent restorative diet it gives to the fluids both quantity and quality in the most perfect manner this valuable fluid however certainly does not agree with every constitution for the gastric juice renders it more or less coagulated in every stomach and so firmly in some as even to resist the solvent power of that organ consequently a variety of complaints must ensue it has never been ascertained from what particular cause this unnatural coagulation happens neither has the prevention of it been yet discovered therefore the best way is to avoid milk entirely where it is found to disagree for with some especially children it produces flatulency distention and pain in the stomach and bowels great difficulty of breathing fever etc when these cases have occurred without any evident cause i have ordered the breakfast of milk to be changed to common tea with only a little milk in it or water gruel in consequence of which the children have become more healthy in every respect and have required much less medicine than before  tea the quality and effects of common tea have employed many ingenious pens and most agree that it has some peculiar effects on the nervous system producing tremors etc but for my own part i believe that in nine hundred and ninety nine cases out of a thousand it agrees very well especially the black sort after study or fatigue tea is a most grateful repast as it quenches thirst and cheers the spirits without heating the body whatever bad effects have been apparently produced by the use of this valuable plant they have evidently arisen from drinking it too strong too hot in too large a quantity or in too great a hurry whereby a temporary relaxation is induced over the whole system and consequently faintness and trembling may ensue however when neither milk nor common tea are perfectly agreeable to the patient  ginger or orangepeel tea may be substituted these are made by putting so much of either in a teapot of boiling water as will just give it an agreeable flavor not too strong to which a suitable quantity of milk and sugar may be added it is necessary to caution the patient against the too liberal use of hot watery fluids as that would increase the debility of the stomach already subsisting  coffee strengthens the stomach assists digestion is grateful to the whole nervous system and serviceable in head achs and languor from overexercise either of body or mind to those of lax fibers and to cold phlegmatic constitutions coffee will be found more beneficial than tea being warmer and more aromatic but on the contrary with such as are of a dry sanguineous habit of body it is less proper  for abating the fits of a periodical asthma strong coffee is recommended by sir john pringle which he affirms to be the best remedy he was ever acquainted with for which purpose he directs an ounce of the best mocha coffee to be made into a single dish and this is to be repeated after the interval of a quarter or half an hour but it must be drank without milk or sugar sir john floyer who wrote a very ingenious treatise on the asthma was long afflicted with that disorder but during the latter years of his life he was kept free from or at least lived more easy under that complaint by the use of very strong coffee  chocolate is well known to be the fruit of a tree growing in the west indies ground into a paste with other ingredients and serves as a grateful repast to multitudes of people it may be considered as a wholesome kind of breakfast to those who like it and with whom it agrees it is of an unctuous nature therefore little or no butter should be used with it  the dinner should consist of that kind of food which affords the most nourishment and is at the same time easy of digestion  animal food a mixture of animal and vegetable food affords the most wholesome diet and the greatest nourishment animal food tends to induce corpulency and too great a fullness of the blood vessels vegetable food on the contrary is sound too weak a diet for many constitutions and therefore would be improper to live upon alone though it would be much the safest of the two but in regulating the exact proportion that animal and vegetable food should bear to each other regard should be had to the season of the year the state of the weather the constitution of the body etc for in hot weather infectious air or in full habits in persons subject to feverish heats and those who live a studious or sedentary life much animal food is improper but when the weather is cold the constitution strong and much exercise used animal food should preponderate  people who are afflicted with indigestion general relaxaation nervous diseases and gouty complaints should ever remember that the body is not nourished in proportion to the quantity of food received into the stomach but according to the degree of perfection with which it is digested and therefore however simple the food may be more should never be eaten than will sit perfectly easy on the stomach overloading that organ disturbs the process of digestion and prevents the proper returns of appetite nothing is of so much importance to invalids and persons of weak or debilitated constitutions as a proper attention to the quantity of their food though many people appear to be possessed of such powers of digestion that they never seem to be incommoded therewith yet the generality of mankind are affected with uneasiness and how often do we hear such persons complaining of the ill effects of this or that particular kind of food when the quantity of all rather than the disagreement of any is the cause of their complaints the author of nature has so formed us that it is evident we are designed to live on any part of the globe our organs of digestion are so constructed that we may gradually accommodate ourselves to aliment of every quality but this is not the case in regard to quantity nature by degrees may be accustomed to subdue and change into nutriment almost every part of the a creation but to quantity she yields  mutton venison beef veal and lamb  these are very wholesome meats and if roasted and eaten with such vegetables as are found to agree with the stomach the better  broths or soups scarcely ever agree with weak stomachs because they relax that organ therefore they are digested flower and with more difficulty and are of a less nutritious quality than solid animal food i have frequently observed that meat even difficult of digestion will sit much easier upon a debilitated stomach than any watery or spoon diet  fried meat or that baked in a pie is more difficult of solution than that which is moderately roasted or boiled  animal food if kept some time after it is killed before it is used becomes more tender and easier of digestion meat somewhat rare is more soluble in the stomach and affords more nourishment than that which is perfectly or over done  it is a common notion that the gravy of meat is unwholesome on the contrary it is very nutritive and is always proper when animal food is necessary  the fat of meat is nutritious and more soluble than the lean but like butter and oil it is apt to disorder the stomach  salted meat when frequently used is unwholesome being very difficult of digestion it vitiates the blood and other circulating fluids but a moderate quantity of salt taken with our food seems necessary to assist digestion  highseasoned food should be avoided because it excites an unnatural appetite stimulates and heats the stomach and eventually destroys its tone pepper and ginger are the most heating spices therefore they should be used with great moderation  fish in general i light and wholesome and is very proper for those who are not able to digest stronger food and who require aliment neither stimulant nor heavy  shell fish of every kind are the most nourishing salt fish like other substances preserved by salt is unwholesome  pork and bacon it is remarked generally disorder those persons who have weak organs of digestion however some people find them wholesome young sucking pigs are heavier than full grown pork because they are fatter  rabbit and hare are readily digested  geese and ducks are heavy food and hard of digestion turkey is much lighter than either but rather heavier than the common fowl and pheasant partridge quail moorgame the woodcock and pigeons are all easily digested and afford much nourishment  mastication or chewing the food properly very much assists the stomach in digesting it therefore should never be performed in a slight or hasty manner  vegetable food taste and smell generally direct our choice of vegetables and it may be asserted with very few exceptions that those which are agreeable to these senses are the most salutary and vice versa but it frequently happens that both taste and smell are vitiated therefore when this is the case those vegetables which sit easiest on the stomach are the most proper  as vegetables tend to reduce plethora and abate heat they are very proper for corpulency and plethoric habits and for those who are troubled with feverish heats and distention of the blood vessels and when accompanied with sufficient exercise and such medicines as preserve the natural state of the bowels this diet will remove that inflammatory habit of body which medicines alone could not effect at the same time it should be remembered that sudden changes in the mode of living are generally dangerous therefore when an alteration becomes requisite it should be made gradually  vegetables ate less stimulant and less nourishing but more cooling than animal food they are generally considered as flatulent as this quality however is never perceived by persons whose stomach and bowels are in a healthy state flatulency may reasonably be imputed to debility of these organs rather than to the aliment itself  i shall now consider a few of those vegetable substances which are chiefly employed as food  bread affords more nourishment than most other vegetable substances but it it inferior to animal food both in this respect and in facility of digestion it should not be eaten till twentyfour hours after it is baked  rice is highly nutritious and more easily digested than bread seldom occasions acidity or flatulency and perhaps is the most wholesome grain that is used by man the universal opinion that rice is of an astringent nature is founded in error it is generally prescribed very judiciously as a diet in purgings and debility of the digestive organs because it produces less disturbance to the stomach and bowels in digesting than any other aliment  potatoes are more easily digested than bread but they afford less nourishment than either rice or bread owing chiefly to the large quantity of water contained in their substance potatoes asparagus and artichokes often agree with weak stomachs when cabbage carrots and onions etc will not  parsnips are agreeable to most palates and are very nourishing and easy of digestion some people indeed dislike them on account of their sweetness but this is a proof of their nutritious quality the poor people in some part of ireland it is said make beer from this root  turnips not only afford wholesome nourishment for man but also furnish the principal food for cattle in the winter and the sprouts if gathered very young make an excellent salad  biet root contains a considerable quantity of sugar consequently it is nourishing and easy of digestion  celery lettuce endive raddish cucumber and melon which have not been subjected to the action of fire contain the whole quantity of their fixed air and are therefore more difficult of solution than other vegetables  it is a fact worthy of remark that the boiling of vegetables thoroughly extricates a quantity of fixed air which renders them less liable to produce flatulency or wind  butter and the expressed oil of vegetables are extremely nutritive but they are difficult of digestion  eggs are nutritious and are very light food when moderately boiled  fruits  these in general afford a mild and wholesome nourishment and a proper use of them greatly contributes to the preservation of health it is a mistaken notion that those complaints of the stomach and bowels which happen in summer and autumn arise from the quantity of fruit taken at that time when we consider the nature of the secreted fluids which at those seasons of the year have a putrid tendency together with a similar disposition in the state of the air we must reasonably conclude from the acescent quality of fruits that a moderate use of them would not only tend to cure but would in a great measure prevent those bilious disorders so usual at the latter end of summer ripe fruit extinguishes thirst moderates heat opens the body and affords a most grateful sensation to the stomach dried fruits are more nutritive than the green though less soluble in the stomach fruit of every kind is very improper after a full meal  acids when moderately used are grateful to the stomach assist the appetite and promote digestion but the too liberal use of them often disorders the stomach and bowels and it has been asserted occasions a return of the gout  sugar is the most nutritive thing in nature therefore the saccharine part of vegetables is very justly thought to afford the greatest nourishment honey and sugar possess this saccharine principle in its most concentrated state and where they agree if used in moderation are very wholesome  nuts are certainly nourishing but difficult of digestion  hence the impropriety of introducing such substances in deserts when the stomach is sufficed with other food nuts should always be eaten in great moderation for too large a quantity of them oppresses the stomach excites pain and disturbs the process of digestion  a variety of food at one meal is unwholesome because it induces the person to eat more than the stomach can digest with facility  drinks these must be of that hind which will best agree with the patients stomach and produces the least heat wind or distention  malt liquors are certainly the most salutary as well as the most natural to the constitution they are perfectly well calculated to dilute the food and quench thirst and when they agree with the stomach they promote digestion and procure sleep they should be taken cold because when drank warm they are the most apt to produce wind  table beer well brewed and of a due strength and age in my opinion is the best drink in the world for general use and it was strongly recommended by the great dr sydenham but where it cannot be kept long without turning four it generates flatulency or wind and is therefore improper  porter or homebrewed ale of a moderate strength is a very good drink at meal times especially at supper  wine  if malt liquors cannot be admitted owing to their producing an unnatural fermentation in the stomach and causing wind white wine and water is an excellent light liquor and if it does not turn acid on the stomach may be allowed for common drink after dinner a few glasses of wine may be taken provided the patient has been accustomed to a full diet wine moderately used is not only of service to those who are troubled with indigestion but also to persons advanced in life or where nature is on the decline in general relaxation and in all low nervous paralytic and dropsical cases where the patient has been in the habit of living very freely the quantity of wine should be diminished by degrees wines of good body and proper age should be chosen such as madeira port sherry etc the small wines being more apt to turn acid in the stomach and interrupt digestion it may be necessary here to observe that the quality of wine chiefly depends on the state in which the grape is gathered which is always influenced by the season the produce of one year therefore is frequently preferable to that of another when the wine is made from unripe fruit it will be productive of bad consequences to the constitution this often gives rise to a suspicion of its being sophisticated  the immoderate use of wine is injurious to every person more particularly to studious men as it increases those complaints of the stomach and head which study may have induced those who drink too freely of wine are particularly subject to the gout while on the contrary those who confine themselves to drinking malt liquors or water are seldom affected with that complaint a bottle of wine a day is certainly too much for any person who prefers health to pleasure  it is necessary here to observe that the stomach should be preserved from the action of strong stimulants and every thing which produces an unnatural heat of the body should be avoided these precautions should be minutely attended to not only in cases of indigestion but also in nervous diseases debility the gout etc and even in perfect health  spirituous liquors  if neither malt liquors nor wine agree with the stomach a little brandy rum or geneva properly diluted with water as they retard fermentation and tend to prevent acidity may prove a beneficial drink but the too liberal use of spirituous liquors accustoms the stomach to an unnatural stimulus which increases its action and destroys its proper tone produces sickness and retching a depression of spirits loss of memory confusion of ideas and nervous tremors in hot climates they occasion phrenzy  in cold ones stupidity a man may appear very sober and yet drink a large quantity of these liquors so as greatly to quicken the pulse and to excite an unnatural heat which is hurtful to every body particularly to a sedentary or studious man  one of the most extraordinary effects produced by the immoderate use of spirits is the following case communicated to the royal society by mr wilmer  a woman who had every day for many months drank a great quantity of spirituous liquors was discovered burnt to death at coventry though the fire in the grate had been small and the furniture of the room had suffered but little the greatest part of her body was consumed and even the bones were completely calcined  an italian countess is said to have met with a similar sat in consequence of drinking immoderately of brandy  water this is not only a proper drink when acidity and flatulency prevail but also where the bile has acquired too much acrimony cold water strengthens the stomach assists digestion prevents obstructions renders sleep more calm and cheerfulness more regular and lasting it has been observed that water drinkers have their understandings more clear their memory more steady their senses more quick and their manners more gentle  water is the drink nature has given to all nations made it agreeable to all palates and is the only liquor to satisfy thirst of all the brute creation and some part of mankind during their whole lives take no other and the state of health those persons enjoy the hard labor and fatigue they are able to undergo show that water is well suited as a drink to answer every purpose of the animal economy that kind which has no impregnation sensible to the sight taste or smell is the best for use  supper the patient should take very light suppers and must not go to bed immediately afterward bread and good cheshire cheese in my opinion is not inferior to any thing yet there can be no objection to a small quantity of animal food taken with the liquors before proposed  rest and exercise respecting these the following mode may be adopted as a good one namely that of allowing eight hours for labor or exercise eight hours for pleasure or amusement and the same length of time for sleep or rest though some people require more of the latter the patient should pay great attention to natural rest for by the want of this the tone of the nervous system is greatly diminished and a weak circulation produced hence paleness languor coldess and dejection of spirits no pleasure whatever can in any measure compensate for the loss of natural hours of sleep  exercise promotes a mutual action of both solids and fluids it increases animal heat it invigorates the heart and occasions an equal distribution of the blood and other circulating fluids through the whole system it increases the action of the stomach with respect to appetite and digestion and therefore is of the utmost service in cases of indigestion and general weakness it likewise renders the body less liable to the malignant influence of the weather and to the attacks of putrid diseases  the salutary power of exercise and good air is particularly exemplified in the laborious country people who notwithstanding their indifferent food are generally healthy and strong  walking is the most natural as well as the most wholesome of all exercise but when this cannot be complied with riding on horseback or in a carriage should be substituted  friction if the region of the stomach and bowels be well rubbed with the flesh brush or flannel every morning and evening it will be found of greater benefit to those who are troubled with indigestion nervous diseases and general relaxation than is generally imagined it will occasion a discharge of wind by consent of parts merely from the principle of irritability or that property of the muscular fibers to react when acted upon by a gentle stimulus and by which the contiguous parts are brought into action if the whole body is wellrubbed perspiration will be encouraged and the general circulation quickened the ancients who were sensible of the advantages resulting from this practice not only used it as a remedy but also as a daily method of preserving health  swinging this kind of exercise is productive of great benefit to the constitution  study excess of study is so powerful a cause of indigestion nervous diseases and the gout that i find very few men of learning are free from these complaints intense thinking wears out the constitution more than the most laborious exercise  the brain which is the immediate seat of thought the nerves which arise from it and the stomach which is furnished with many nerves of an exquisite sensibility are the parts first attacked and commonly most injured by the immediate labor of the mind and if it should continue for any length of time almost all the parts of the body become partakers of the injury natural history the history of men and manners rhetoric belleslettres and experimental philosophy together with other subjects of amusement may be moderately pursued without the smallest detriment to health for the mind of the reader on these subjects is generally passive and chiefly engaged in attending to facts  air the patient should reside in a pure dry atmosphere because pure air increases the elasticity of the muscular fibers braces and invigorates the whole system supports the vitality of the blood and greatly contributes to the restoration and preservation of that principle in the animal economy called irritability on which health wholly depends hence it facilitates the cure not only of indigestion but also of nervous diseases and general relaxation if the air which is either one of the most salutary or pernicious agents be moist or contaminated with noxious effluvia it will render the constitution unhealthy and also considerably impede the good effects of the remedy let it be ever so powerful  foul air is peculiarly inimical to the nervous system it relaxes and enfeebles the general habit and often produces diseases of the lungs in great cities the air is vitiated by being impregnated with smoke and various exhalations arising from putrid substances hence many persons who are under the necessity of living some time in the unwholesome atmosphere of this great metropolis suffer materially in their health those persons therefore who are obliged to spend the day in close towns ought if possible to sleep in the country breathing pure air in the night will compensate in some measure for the want of it during the day the patient s chamber should be cool and spacious the curtains of the bed kept constantly open and the bed clothes so regulated as to maintain only a moderate degree of warmth  places where a number of persons are crowded together ought always to be well ventilated especially schools and it is the duty of parents to pay particular attention to the manner in which their children are accommodated in this respect the same caution is necessary with regard to nurseries servants being in general fond of hot and close apartments a few years ago a remarkable instance occurred which shows the dangerous effects of foul stagnant air eighteen children and a servant slept in one apartment in king street goldensquare to render the room warmer they shut up the chimney and used every other expedient to exclude the cold air the consequences of which were that the servant and ten of the children were seized with excruciating pains in the pit of the stomach and back violent head ach delirium and convulsions  a very general error prevails among mankind in exposing the body too much to the action of heat with a view to preserve it from the pernicious effects of cold the influence of the latter will be the least considerable on those persons who are most frequently but prudently exposed to its action those who keep themselves and their children constantly in a warm room become greatly relaxed and are seldom without a cold or cough from which most of the consumptions in this country originate for if in addition to the general debility arising from such neglect of air and exercise we consider the effects of the medicines usually prescribed to cure the cough which being generally composed of syrups and oils must it long continued relax the stomach and pall the appetite we need not wonder if instead of the cold being removed an incurable consumption is induced this observation applies also to studious men who live a sedentary life in an atmosphere which being seldom renewed is inelastic and full of noxious vapors by this they are relaxed and rendered heavy and low spirited and the bad effects arising from study and want of exercise are greatly increased  sea or cold bathing bathing being one of the principal remedies for indigestion general debility and nervous diseases i shall here make a few observations respecting its use  nothing affords more strength to the nervous system or produces a greater elasticity of the muscles and vessels than sea or cold bathing it accelerates the motion of the blood and promotes the different secretions for though the water only acts immediately on the cutaneous nerves and blood vessels yet its benign influence by sympathy is communicated to every part of the machine but this as well as all other grand remedies when improperly applied will frequently produce the most baneful effects it will radicate more deeply in the habit those complaints which it was intended to cure and render them for ever incurable  indeed on reflection this is not to be wondered at for most persons imagine themselves qualified to judge and boldly venture their opinion of the propriety of bathing who have not the smallest acquaintance with anatomy physiology the history of diseases the science of medicine or philosophy in general and who consequently are incapable of discriminating in respect to the disease or the constitution of the patient and certain it is that no remedy whatever can require a more accurate knowledge of these than bathing  under these considerations therefore the following remarks are offered to the public in order to obviate those pernicious effects which too frequently arise from an indiscriminate use of bathing  previous to laying down particular rules it may be necessary to premise the two following general ones that people may be able to form a judgment whether bathing is likely to be useful or to prove injurious to the constitution  first where the patient on coming out of the bath feels an universal pleasant sensation of glowing warmth the elasticity of the muscular sibres seems increased and the nervous system strengthened and as it were reanimated these are proofs that it agrees perfectly well with the constitution and if properly continued will be of infinite service because it thereby evidently appears that the reaction of the heart and arteries is increased and consequently an equal distribution of the blood and other fluids to every minute vessel is produced  second but on the contrary where on coming out of the bath the patient feels a sensation of cold attended with shivering depression of spirits pain in the head or in any other part of the body universal lassitude or weariness as though just come from hard labor these are signs that bathing does not agree with the constitution because they evidently show that there is such a defect of irritability in the habit that the heart and arteries are unable to overcome that constriction of the cutaneous vessels which is the primary effect always produced by the application of cold to the surface of the body  these two general rules should be particulary attended to for by an accurate observance thereof either a great deal of good may be done by bathing or much mischief prevented  cases in which bathing will be beneficial whenever there are symptoms of universal debility arising from inanition or want of due nourishment such as loose or flabby muscles weariness or languor over the whole body a sense of fatigue upon the slightest exertion of the muscular system and an inclination to sweat upon very little exercise etc  in all nervous diseases especialy where there is an increased sensibility as faintings tremblings depression of spirits alarm on every trifling occasion nervous headache etc  the cold or sea bathing should be used in general in the morning before any food has been taken though at the same time it may be necessary to observe that some constitutions cannot bear it previous to a light breakfast with such it should be used between breaksast and dinner but not so soon after the first meal as to interfere with digestion  the frequency of bathing and the time of continuing in the water can only be determined by the nature of the complaint and the strength of the patient it should not be used oftener than three or four times a week by persons of a spare and naturally delicate habit and these persons should only make a single immersion and come out immediately those of greater strength may use the bath more freely  the best time for bathing in general is to commence about the middle of april or beginning of may according to the temperature of the season and to continue it no longer than a month or six weeks at most omitting it totally during the very sultry months of summer but it should never be employed later in the season than the beginning of november by thus allowing an interval between the bathings a salutary change may be induced in the solids and fluids whereas had it been persisted in many months without intermission it would not only have lost its tonic power but debilitating effects might have been produced i have frequently observed that the good effects of other tonic remedies as well as the cold bath are not always to be perceived during their use for after taking them regularly about three weeks or a month with little or no apparent benefit yet en discontinuing them i have been surprised at the very rapid manner in which the patient has recovered his health which serves to prove that strengthening remedies extend their effects much beyond the time during which they are employed  a day or two previous to bathing a proper dose of the tonic powders should be taken two papers will generally be sufficient so as to procure two or three motions in order to evacuate the crudities of the bowels which would if allowed to remain there prevent the bathing having the desired effect  likewise during the use of bathing particular attention should be paid to the state of the stomach and bowels especially in those persons who are troubled with a superfluous quantity of bile for if this is neglected many bad consequences may ensue as a congestion in the abdominal viscera fevers violent pain in the head and even apoplexy may be produced for this purpose i recommend the tonic powders because they operate without producing any uneasiness either in the alimentary canal or the system in general and do not like most purgatives as i have before noticed induce a constipation of the bowels or languid state of the body after their operation but by their tonic quality they tend to strengthen the digestive organs and consequently the whole habit thereby favoring the intention with which the bath is employed  immediately on coming out of the bath the body should be wiped perfectly dry as expeditiously as possible  this promotes the circulation to the surface and thereby assists in regulating the secretions upon which most of the good effects of bathing depend  the sea bath is found more efficacious than the cold bath owing to the water being impregnated with salt which stimulates the cutaneous vessels and causes an increased determination of the fluids to the surface of the body upon this principle i frequently order a quantity of salt to be added to the water in which the patient is to bathe at home with very good effect it has been computed that every gallon of sea water contains five ounces and a half of salt this therefore is the proportion which the salt should bear to the water in which the patient is to bathe the water and salt should be renewed every other or third day  i have frequently known the beneficial effects of bathing greatly promoted especially in weakly nervous habits by taking two teaspoonfuls of the tonic drops in a glass of water as soon as the patient comes out of the bath and in the course of my practice i have often observed that universal pleasant glowing sensations etc take place by the assistance of this medicine where without its salutary influence bathing would have been prejudicial  having described the particular cases in which sea or cold bathing will be found of the utmost benefit i shall now point out those particular states of the system in which its use would be very injurious   st when the patient labors under any actual disease or obstruction of any of the viscera either of the abdomen or thorax  hence bathing is extremely improper in consumption of the lungs asthma jaundice or in a diseased state of the liver kidneys bladder or womb i have seen many dreadful effects produced by bathing when the womb was diseased  about two years ago i attended a lady with an eminent surgeon for a complaint of that part of which she was cured apparently in two months except sometimes a small degree of pain the following summer she consulted me about the air on the sea coast and bathing i advised her to go to margate for the benefit of the air during the season but in the strongest terms dissuaded her from bathing however not being satisfied wish my opinion as it did not accord with her own she consulted anher genleman who was unacquainted with her complaint by whose advice she bathed in the sea which caused a return of the complaint with great violence and of which she soon died  because by the gravity and coldness of the water the blood and other fluids are driven from the extremities and surface of the body toward the internal parts and occasion an increase of the diameter of the vessels which being already in a state of disease are unable to bear so great and sudden a determination and owing to the resistanse they are compelled to make by a certain law of the animal economy an inflammation or rupture of those vessels may ensue or at least the existing disorder may be greatly aggravated this observation holds good with respect to the effects of the atmosphere in winter and spring for by reason of its coldness and pressure inflammatory complaints are more frequent at those seasons than in summer and also consumptive and asthmatic disorders are rendered more violent by the same means   dly while the body is in a coive state  because bathing by constringing the cutaneous pores throws back the fluids upon the bowels thereby increasing the distention already subsisting there and in the neighboring parts and of course must inevitably debilitate instead of strengthen the digestive organs even sometimes apoplexy and many other complaints of the head may be the consequence   dly when there is an intermitting remitting or hectic fever or during the presence of any periodical disease whatsoever because the sudden and great change poduced by the coldness of the water aggravates these complaints it has been said that the ague has been perfectly cured by plunging into the cold bath at the commencement of the fit but this is by no means a safe experiment for if the disease should not be cured by it the violence thereof will be greatly aggravated   thly when there is an increased determination of blood to the head or breast  hence people should be very cautious of bathing who are disposed to inflammation of the lungs consumption or headache or subject to a cough because the cold or sea bath by its principal and natural effect of repelling the blood to the internal parts must increase the congestion already present and accelerate the coming on of the disease this is not the only evil that may be induced for apoplexy inflammation of the membranes of the brain or what is yet more dreadful insanity may be occasioned which i have good reason to believe has more frequently taken place from this cause than is generally known or imagined   thly while there is an increased or preternatural heat of the body  because by the sudden check given to the circulation the vismedicatrixnaturae may be excited to such a degree as to produce a fever or local inflammation   thly while there is a diminution of heat or sensation of cold present  because the constriction of the extreme vessels already taken place would be so increased by the immersion as to excite a violent degree of reaction in the heart and arteries which might produce effects similar to those last mentioned   thly while there exists a plethoric state of the body or too great a fullness of the blood vessels  because an increased quantity of blood would be sent to those vessels already too much distended so that there would be danger of rupturing them or of exciting inflammation of the brain or some of the viscera instances daily occur where inflammations boils abscesses and ulcerations of the external parts very difficult to heal are in that particular state of the constitution above specified occasioned by bathing for although there may be evident signs of universal debility which seem to indicate the propriety of bathing yet it should be remembered that this debility may arise from general distention and not from want of nutrition  these two species of debility require quite opposite remedies therefore they should be distinguished from each other with the utmost accuracy previous to bathing by which means much mischief may be prevented  instead of cold of sea bathing in this last case the use of the tonic powders will be of infinite service owing to their combining an evacuant power with their tonic quality they should be taken so as to procure three or four motions daily and should be persisted in for ten or twelve days or while any uneasy sensation remains   thly during the presence of the haemorrhoids or piles  because the cold bath will most probably repel the blood suddenly from the haemorrhoidal veins where nature had deposited it in order to relieve the general habit so that by the interruption given to her salutary operations a determination to the head and lungs may ensue and in consequence many disorders of those parts as well as a train of diseases may arise i have known many instances where people have died of inflammation of the lungs arising from the application of cold by sitting upon damp ground at that particular time or by putting on a pair of small clothes not properly aired   th while any natural periodical discharge continues  because many complaints of the most malignant nature may be produced this observation should be particularly attended to by women whom it more immediately concerns   0th bathing should not be made use of very soon after mebriation or any other irregularity because the body would be too weak to bear the shock    th it should not be used but with the utmost caution during the whole period of gestation or pregnancy  because during that time especially in the first months the patient is seldom able to bear so sudden a shock to the system in general or so great a determination to the womb in particular therefore abortion as well as great mischief to the constitution may be expected from the indiscriminate use of bathing under that circumstance    th women in general should never bathe but upon the most urgent necessity and then not without proper advice  because very few of them can bear so sudden or so great a shock owing to the exquisite sensibility of their nerves and the irritability of their general system which exceeds those of men the same observation holds good with regard to children many of whom i have known thrown into convulsions as well as women into hysteric fits by the very sudden and violent shock given to the nervous system by immersion in cold water  i am much against accustoming children to the cold bath as the ingenious dr buchan advises in his domestic medicine at a very early age unless necessity absolutely requires it or continuing it too long i have for my own part no notion of endeavoring to prevent complaints which in all probability would never happen unless some or all of the occasional causes on which most of the diseases of children depend were applied such as food in too great a quantity or of a pernicious quality want of due exercise or cleanliness and sometimes confined air by removing these causes or what is still better never applying them we should in ninetynine cases out of a hundred find the cold bath as well as all other remedies unnecessary at the same time i wish it to be understood that i have a very high opinion of cold bathing when there is a real indication for its use but on the other hand i think it extremely cruel to be teazing a child with a pretended remedy while it is in perfect health i have more exalted ideas of the great author of nature than for one moment to imagine that it is in the power of any remedy to render the constitution more perfect than it was intended by him   for health on exercise and food depend god never made his works for man to mend cold bathing is likewise improper at or near the time when a return of the gout is expected for a little before the recurrence of this disease irregular determinations generally take place sometimes to the head affecting it with pain and giddiness sometimes to the lungs producing a difficulty of breathing and sometimes to the stomach and bowels causing sickness and pain bathing at this time would encourage these determinations and prevent the gout from fixing in its proper feat the extremities in consequence of which violent inflammations and the most fatal effects may follow  it should also be used with great circumspection after the gout is gone off  because in general the body is too much debilitated by that disease to be able to bear the violence of the shock for the same reason bathing is improper in all cases of extreme debility from whatever cause it may arise  cold or sea bathing cannot be safely employed during the action of any irritating cause in the system  because that irritation would be much increased by the strong reaction of the heart and arteries which is one of the secondary effects of bathing hence it is improper in glandular obstructions when they have arrived to a certain pitch it can only be used with advantage in an incipient state of the disease and even then should be employed with great caution  the sea air and exercise contribute greatly to the good effects of bathing and very frequently prove extremely beneficial to those persons in whose cases bathing according to the foregoing rules is strictly prohibited in my opinion the recovery of the patient has been often attributed to bathing when in reality it was merely owing to the following circumstances  st the purity and coolness of the sea air  d the mind being totally disengaged from anxiety and business  d the amusements and company of the place joined with exercise   the sea air is rendered by the water  first more pure second more cool  the first by the sea water absorbing those impurities or noxious particles with which the air in large towns and cities is replete for which reason it must be better adapted to the purposes of respiration as the oxygen or basis of vital air thereby becomes increased in proportion by which means the blood is more fully impregnated with the vital principle  second the air is rendered more cook by its passing over so large a tract of water hence near the sea are felt none of those unpleasant sensations which arise from the heat of the air in summer in large cities or inland places but a constant cooling refreshing breeze is perceived so congenial to the feelings and so advantageous to the health of man which moderates the excess of heat prevents its irritating and debilitating effects and produces the most salutary consequences  habitual costiveness diseases more frequently originate from costiveness than has hitherto been imagined and the success i have met with in practice by obviating this circumstance i am convinced justifies the remark  a great variety of aperient medicines have been prescribed to remove costiveness such as lenitive electuary infusion of senna aloes daffys elixir sulphur etc these i have used with many others but never yet found a medicine that will act with so much certainty and safety as the tonic powders because as observed before they may be taken by persons of any age sex or under every circumstance of the constitution as they do not like other opening medicines excite an unnatural stimulus of the stomach and bowels in order to produce their effect nor does their operation which is both mild and effectual interfere with the occupations of life  there is a peculiar costiveness affecting studious people and those advanced in years which very frequently causes inflammation in the bowels often terminating fatally in the course of a few days such persons should never be without the tonic powers but should take them occasionally as circumstances may require i have every reason to believe that with these powders i have preserved the health of hundreds as they are so benign in their effects that they have invariably improved the constitution of those who have taken them  these powders are widely different in their effects from andersons commonly called scotch pills which are injurious to the constitution in the following respects  st andersons pills after their purgative operation is over leave a constipated state of the bowels  dly they heat the body therefore cannot be employed with propriety in every constitution  dly they stimulate the rectum or lower bowel thereby producing the piles  a highly disagreeable and painful disorder which often terminates in fistula  thly they have a peculiar effect in making women unwell at an improper time owing to their stimulating the part mentioned before and are not only unsafe but extremely dangerous during pregnancy  thly aloes of which these pills are composed is of such a nature that when the bowels become habituated to its use they will not act properly without it therefore when once become a custom it must generally be continued through life   on the contrary the tonic powders have quite different effects  st they induce a natural state of the bowels after they have operated as a purgative  dly instead of heating the body they abate irritation and render the patient cool and comfortable  dly instead of producing the piles they prevent or cure them as numbers have experienced who have taken them by my direction  thly i have had repeated opportunities of proving the good effects of these powers in pregnancy wherein they alleviate or prevent all the uncomfortable symptoms especially the sickness and retching which occur during that particular period with the utmost safety  thly the tonic powders have quite a contrary tendency to the aloes they not only produce a natural action of the bowels after being taken a little time but may be left off without the least inconvenience   giddiness and pain of the head these in general originate in a debility of the digestive organs but ultimately arise from too great a determination of blood to the head soul stomach costive habit an exquisite sensibility of the nerves etc the tonic powders have repeatedly cured these complaints after other medicines have proved ineffectual  where the pain of the head is periodical or returns at regular stated times from fifteen to twentyfive drops of tincture of opium taken in water half an hour before its return or exactly at the time of its coming on has cured this complaint after the peruvian bark had been tried in vain the body should be kept open with the tonic powders during the use of the opium or it will not have the desired effect  persons afflicted with pain of the head whether constant or periodical ought to apply for a remedy in due time for if it continues long it will destroy the sensibility of the nerves the common effect of pain and terminate in a privation of some one or more of the senses as sight smelling hearing or taste even a palsy or apoplexy has too often been the consequence of neglect in these cases  sick head ach though this complaint has not been take notice of by writers yet i have very frequently met with it in practice the studious sedentary and inactive people and those troubled with stomach complaints and of a relaxed habit are most exposed to this disorder  this complaint for the most part proceeds from inattention to diet either in respect to quantity or quality or both  there are some things which unless taken with the utmost caution in some constitutions frequently occasion the sick head ach such are melted butter fat meats and spices especially pepper meat pies often contain all these things united and are as fertile a cause of this disease as anything i know strong liquors will produce similar distresses to those who are not accustomed to them want of sleep or uneasiness of mind are very common causes of this disease a costive habit is also another cause of this malady  for the cure of this disorder i have prescribed the tonic powders with the utmost success  piles this disorder is occasioned by complaints of the stomach  determination of blood to the parts an increased heat of the body or a costive habit and also by those medicines which are composed of aloes  the tonic powders will not only cure this complaint but also remove those causes from whence it originates  nervous disorders whenever the patient has been troubled with faintings depressions of spirits alternate shiverings and flushing heats the tonic powders and drops have cured great numbers of people after various other methods had proved ineffectual  the following rules should be attended to during the cure of nervous diseases  the causes of indigestion must be avoided  the quantity and quality of the food should be regarded more must never be eaten than will fit perfectly easy on the stomach and that quality must be avoided which is known to disagree spoon diet should be taken sparingly because it weakens more than strengthens the body in short the solid food should be increased and the fluid aliment diminished  animal food should bear a greater proportion than vegetable especially in winter particularly in those persons who are troubled with wind or acidity in the stomach roast meat is preferable to boiled  the drink must not be heating or stimulating to the stomach  i have known several people prevent the return of nervous complaints by taking no other drink than water drams must be avoided for though they may raise the spirits and give present ease to a disordered stomach yet they will ultimately increase the complaint  the sleep and rest should be at least eight hours out of the twentyfour sometimes nine will be requisite for those afflicted with these complaints require a great deal of rest and some people hurt themselves by a contrary practice  exercise must be regularly used but not a very fatiguing degree the stomach and bowels should be well rubbed every night and morning with the flesh brush or flannel which will prove of great service to such persons as are afflicted with nervous complaints or wind in the stomach  the mind should be kept serene and tranquil and study and disputes upon every consideration avoided  a comfortable warmth ought always to be preserved but much heat should be avoided  moist contaminated or confined air produces debility and depression of spirits therefore it should be exchanged for a dry and pure atmosphere hence the propriety of the country air or that on the sea coast those nervous persons therefore who are obliged to live always in london or in close towns should if possible reside for one or two months in the summer on the sea coast which will increase the vitality of the blood brace the relaxed nerves and give tone to the muscular fibers  the sea or cold bath should be used though with great judgment and discretion  the reason why a remedy for nervous complaints has not been more frequently obtained is because the patient becomes unsteady owing to the length of time necessary to complete a cure and runs from one physician to another till at last he becomes dissatisfied and loses confidence in every medicine though it may be calculated upon the best principle for curing the complaint  for a fuller account of foods drinks exercise and air see the remarks on these under indigestion and for the use of the sea or cold bath see remarks on that head  colic whether bilious or flatulent bilious disorders are very frequent about the latter end of summer or beginning of autumn arising from an increased secretion of bile usual at that time of the year inducing violent pain of the stomach and bowels a sometimes vomiting and purging the tonic powders gently though effectually evacuate the bile or the morbid contents of the stomach and bowels while the drops restore their due tone  a particular attention should always be paid to keeping the bowels in a regular state in all bilious and flatulent habits by the use of the tonic powders  gout i shall give the history of this disease exactly as it has occurred in my practice  it is distinguished into the regular and irregular gout  though the regular gout sometimes seizes suddenly without any signs of its approach when seemingly the patient is in the most perfect health yet the fit is often preceded by some of the following symptoms loss of appetite acidity flatulency uneasiness and fullness of the stomach general languor various nervous symptoms and a sensation as if cold water was trickling down the thighs sometimes a keen appetite takes place the day before the fit  the patient at the commencement of the regular gout is waked about midnight or one or two in the morning with a very violent pain of the foot generally in the great toe but sometime in the ancle often attended with chilliness and shivering which are succeeded by some degree of fever the pain increases every hour and comes to its height toward evening which becomes so exquisite that the patient is scarce able to endure the weight of the bed clothes nor the shaking of the room from a persons walking across it and hence the night is not only passed in pain but likewise with a restless removal of the part affected from one place to another and a continual change of its posture the pain commonly remits in about twentyfour hours from the first approach of the fit and then the patient falls asleep and a gentle moisture comes over the whole body as well as on the pained part which then appears swelled and red  in general the pain abates when the part swells the patient continues easier through the day the pain with some degree of fever increases toward evening and after a restless night they both remit in the morning with a gentle sweat the pain after being for sometime fixed in one place shifts to another and in this way visits most parts of the foot and in a few days removes to the other foot and affects it in the same manner  the urine is high colored and not in the usual quantity but in the decline of the fit it becomes copious with a large sediment  during the fit there is usually an uncommon flow of spirits and clearness of understanding  when the fit is going off the parts affected become violently itchy especially between the toes the cuticle falls off and a lameness is left proportioned to the severity and length of the disease  the duration of the sit is uncertain but in general when the pain is most violent it is of the shortest continuance and the interval between the fits is longest  having described the regular gout i shall now mention those symptoms which constitute the irregular or flyinggout  the irregular seizes the hands wrists elbows knees and other parts as severely as the regular gout did the seet it often affects the stomach with very violent pain sickness distention and wind the bowels with griping and fullness the head with pain and giddiness the lungs with difficulty of breathing and the kidneys with pain of the back all of which alternate with pain and swellings of the joints  it frequently produces disorders of the nervous system consequently the mind becomes affected which sympathises with the body so that it is not easy to determine which of the two is most affected  in feeble or broken constitutions or when the disease has been of long duration the fits become less severe but continue longer and the disease becomes more moveable  after a regular fit of the gout the patient enjoys perfect health which is not the case after an irregular fit  when the gout has continued long it often produces chalky concretions weakness rigidity or stiffness of the joints and sometimes absolute lameness  this disease is not dangerous while confined to the extremities but often proves fatal when it shifts from them and falls upon any of the internal parts or where from a deficiency of vigor of the constitution it cannot be propelled to its proper seat the feet  the causes which produce indigestion also occasion the gout  authors in general have certainly been greatly mistaken with regard to the treatment of the gout some have pretended to cure it by regimen alone declaring that patience good nursing and the application of flannel to the parts were all that possibly could be done during the fit and that diet air and exercise were only to be depended upon to prevent a return this doctrine has much influenced our present trifling mode of practice and has occasioned the ruin of many constitutions for consonant to this opinion they have laid down rules respecting diet quite opposite to those the patient had been accustomed to and those persons who have adhered thereto have suffered more by intervening diseases than they would have done had they persisted in their usual mode of high living for sudden changes in that respect in the intervals are always attended with some degree of hazard and when the constitution is debilitated with the utmost danger whenever a change therefore in point of regimen is necessary it should be made gradually  those authors again who have relied on medicines alone for a cure have been nder as great an error as those who have wholly depended on regimen although medicines may remove the present symptoms yet while the cause of the disease is acting the effect must again recur and in all probability with redintegrated strength when the patient returns to his former habits  in order to cure the gout on a true principle the following rules must be strictly adhered to  st the action of the stomach and bowels should be affisted and the indigestible matter from time to time gently evacuated downwards which these organs are not able to do of themselves owing to the contractile power thereof being so much diminished  d the tone of the digestive organs should be increased  d the general and nervous system should be strengthened   these are to be accomplished by medicines joined to the following rules respecting regimen  st proper diet both in quantity and quality should be adopted vegetables should be taken sparingly in proportion to animal food by those persons who are troubled with wind and acidity in the stomach  d exercise according to the strength of the patient should be regularly performed universal experience of this disease being unknown to laboring people is sufficient to prove that exercise is a good assistant in the prevention and cure of the gout  d wholesome air and natural rest should be duly attended to  th cold or sea bathing should be judiciously employed  th the causes of this disease mentioned under indigestion ought to be avoided   the tonic powders and drops are a safe and efficacious remedy for the gout and i can affirm that in my practice which has been upwards of sixteen years during which time i have attended great numbers of gouty patients they have always produced the following effects   st they lengthen the interval between the fits   dly they shorten the duration of the fit when present   dly they abate the violence of the pain   thly they take off the inflammatory diathesis of the system consequently they tend to remove the topical inflammation  th during the fit they prevent the usual debility taking place and strengthen the constitution in the intervals   th when the gout seizes the stomach that organ becomes so cold and torpid that neither wine nor spirits seem stronger than water in this case the tonie drops have most admirable effects  though i do not pretend with these medicines to perform impossibilities yet my experience of their effects induces me to believe that by the use of the tonic powders and drops the gout may be erased from the list of those diseases which have hitherto obtained the appellation of opprobria medicina or incurable  where the pain and inflammation of the feet are violent i have experienced the good effects of the application of leeches either on the inflamed part or as near to it as possible the latter generally answers better than when applied immediately on the part itself dr dover strongly recommends a thin beef steak to be applied to the affected part as a topical remedy for the gout and dr williams who has written a very ingenious treatise has ordered it with very extraordinary good effects where the inflammation has not been too great or the parts too much debilitated it opens the pores and discharges the gouty matter so plentifully by perspiration that if it is not changed at least every two hours it grows putrid and becomes offensive in fact it appears to have all the good effects of a warm cataplasm without irritating the affected parts  the affected parts should not be kept too warm at the same time a comfortable warmth should by all means be preserved  the treatment respecting food and drink during the fit must be suited to the patients age constitution and the violence of the disorder the accustomed mode of living should likewise be attended to for example if the patient is young the constitution strong the general and local inflammation high solid animal food fermented and other strong liquors must be avoided and a cooling farinacious diet and diluting drinks made use of this will cooperate with the medicine in lessening the violence and shortening the duration of the sit  but on the contrary if the patient be advanced in years or the constitution much debiliated or if there be the least apprehensin of the internal parts being affected by the disease a more generous diet must be adopted with the liberal use of madeira wine sherry etc being very abstemious in this case would be highly dangerous to the patient  the present mode of treating the gout indiscriminately with wine hot cordials and rich food must be reprobated by every judicious practitioner as it tends to increase the inflammation already in the blood to heighten the fever and to render the fit more severe as well as of longer duration and at the same time strengthens the popular opinion of the gout being incurable  as soon as the fit is over means should be used to brace and strengthen the relaxed fibers to give force to the weakened muscles and to put the constitution into a state capable of resisting the disorder for the future for this purpose the tonic powders and drops i have found preferable to every other medicine especially when united to a proper regimen  exercise should also be employed in the intervals of the gout together with these medicines which in conjunction with temperance have been frequently known radically to cure the disease even in cases where a strong hereditary disposition had previously existed  during the intervals of the fit the diet air and exercise should be the same as recommended under indigestion  for the use of the sea and cold bathing the reader is referred to the general remarks on that subject  dropsy before i enter upon the cure of the dropsy it will be necessary to premise a few remarks in order to show the manner in which this disease is produced and to point out the true principle upon which the tonic powders and drops act in effecting the cure  this disease is primarily occasioned by indigestion and debility but ultimately it is produced  either by the exhalent vessels pouring a superfluous quantity of watery fluid into the cavities of the body  or by the absorbents being rendered unable to take up the proper quantity of fluid which should be re conveyed into the circulation  and sometimes the dropsy is the effect of both of these causes  i should have observed before in order to render this matter more perspicuous that the peculiar use of the exhalents is to pour a fluid into every cavity of the system designed by the great author of nature to lubricate the parts in order to facilitate motion  it is a wellknown fact in philosophy that the action and reaction of all solid bodies are much facilitated by an intervening fluid without which attrition would soon destroy that power of cohesion and attraction by which all bodies are held together and consequently motion would be totally impeded  the office of the absorbents is to take up that portion of the fluid which remains after answering the purpose above mentioned and to convey it into the general mass in order to give room for a fresh supply  where these two sets of vessels viz the exhalents and absorbents do not act in equilibrium a dropsy partial or general must ensue  the tonic powders as i have before observed empower the animal machine to regulate every secretion and in this disease they increase the action of the absorbents by which means that superabundant fluid is taken up which had been left by the exhalents in the cavities of the body at the same time assisted by the tonic drops they strengthen the digestive organs and corroborate the general habit upon these principles they not only cure the disease but prevent its return  with regard to exercise and air during the use of these medicines what has been said under indigestion applies also to this case  i have known the tonic powders and drops to succeed in the cure of jaundice in many instances after other remedies had been tried to no purpose  the tonic powders will not only be found efficacious in confirmed jaundice but also in those slighter cases where the skin assumes a temporary yellow cast frequently arising from too great a quantity of bile perturbation of mind want of natural rest or the too liberal use of spirits  worms or big bellies in children the cause of the above is indigestion or weakness of the stomach and bowels arising from too great indulgence in improper food want of due exercise unwholesome or confined air  these causes are sometimes all united but the first errors in diet are by far the most frequent  whenever children are affected with diminished strength and spirits with reluctance to exercise the appetite decreased at one time voracious at another swelled belly starting in the sleep fever difficulty of breathing convulsions thirst costiveness strong disagreeable breath etc the tonic powders i have found to answer every wished for purpose as they evacuate whatever indigestible matter may be lodged in the stomach and bowels whether worms slime or phlegm they relieve the difficulty of breathing take off the fever aad remove costiveness they restore the appetite strengthen the constitution and also are very successful in reducing the big bellies which are so frequently observed in children in these eases after every thing else had been tried in vain and the childs life absolutely despaired of i have known this medicine with proper diet wholesome air and due exercise perform a cure  the stomach of children should be preserved from strong diet by the neglect of this precaution they are found to labor under indigestion worms rickets and universal debility  every year for a long time past nearly a thousand children have been brought to me for advice in different complaints but threefourths of that number are afflicted in the manner above described these i have generally been successful enough to cure  as grown up persons are frequently troubled with worms as well as children i shall mention those symptoms by which their presence may be known  when worms are in the stomach they produce an inexpressible pain anxiety inquietude nausea and a flux of spittle a foetid breath grinding of the teeth the countenance is now pale then red there is an itching of the nostrils with an inclination to vomit and a dry and troublesome cough by fits and sometimes fainting  when they are contained in the intestines they produce the following symptoms  the belly is much distended as though the patient was afflicted with a windy dropsy with now and then a purging but sometimes a costiveness is present the upper parts waste away insomuch that the bones are visible and yet the appetite is great the face is generally pale and tumid and a cough fever and pleuritic pains are often produced  the small like book worms called ascarides are contained in the rectum or lower bowel and are sometimes thrown out in great quantities they produce inflation of the belly leanness and nausea they are attended with great itchings of the nus and cause foetid excrements  this kind of worm though s difficult to cure as any yet it is the least dangerous of all  it may be necessary to observe that there are three particular ymptoms which distinguish three different kind of worms viz udden gripings about the navel denote the presence of the ound worm a weight in the belly as if a ball were rolling about in it is a sign of the toenia or tape worm and an itching about the anus is a sign of the ascarides or small worms  the diet during the cure of worms should be light and easy  digestion  medicines of various kinds are prescribed for the cure of worms such as the different preparations of mercury sulphur oils tin powdered indian pink male fern etc etc of these i i have had little experience always finding a remedy in the tonic powders  female complaints there are two critical periods in the life of females in which the general habit undergoes a material change namely the commencement and cessation  the first happens between the age of fourteen and sixteen years and the latter commonly from the age of fortyfive to fifty i shall make a few remarks respecting the management necessary to be observed at both these particular times as on this frequently depends a good or bad state of health  i shall begin with that period which commences at the early part of life  indigestion and general debility are the causes of this salutary change not happening in due time because the juices derived from the food being crude and watery are insufficient to supply the body with due nourishment hence the heart which is the principal instrument of circulation can hardly drive forward the blood in its vessels or distribute that vital fluid to the different parts of the body therefore its due offices cannot be accomplished hence proceed obstructions attended with sickness flatulency palpitation of the heart headache and a throbbing or tremulous motion of the internal parts especially after exercise or sudden surprise heartburn and a swelling of the stomach the patients appetite is whimsical and much impaired often directing her to things void of nourishment and improper such as chalk cinders sour raw fruits and the like the countenance is sometimes wan and sallow with a remarkable paleness of the lips and gums and excessive coldness of the feet weariness depression of spirits reluctance to exercise wandering pains and slow fever  in order to promote this salutary alteration the whole constitution must be strengthened which will aid the powerful efforts of nature a circumstance of the utmost censequence to the patients future welfare though too generally disregarded which can only be done by such medicines as are calculated to give strength to the digestive organs and tone to the general system united to proper diet moderate exercise and natural rest which will inevitably empower the animal economy to effect this grand office by the same means the secretions will be promoted and those disorders which before had resisted the most powerful medicines nature will be enabled to remedy herself but unless the debility be removed it will be impossible to remedy these complaints  whenever therefore this salutary alteration does not take place in due time or an accidental obstruction has been produced i have prescribed the tonic powders and drops with the happiest effect even after the usual course of medicines had been administered without any benefit  parents and guardians or those entrusted with the important office of superintending the health and education of young ladies should direct their conduct with the utmost care and attention at this critical juncture for on the seasonable commencement and regular returns of nature depends their future health   the engagement of the mind the degree of exercise the quantity and quality of the food together with the nature of the air they breathe should be regarded with the most prudent caution  the quantity and quality of food should be suited to the digestive power of the stomach  she should eat often and in small quantities of what is light and simple and thoroughly masticate or chew it which is a circumstance of much more consequence to those who have weak stomachs than is generally imagined the drink should be light and rather nourishing but not heating no heat should be thrown into the habit but what is obtained from exercise this promotes the natural action of the heart and lungs whereby a quantity of air will be taken into the blood which will produce all the beneficial effects of a gentle stimulus without preternaturally heating the system she should abstain from the immoderate use of watery fluids coffee is more wholesome than tea drunk with the addition of milk  moderate exercise in the open air should be used this will at first fatigue the weak patient and put her out of breath but when steadily persisted in she will daily gain strength and spirits so that what was before a punishment will afterward become a pleasing amusement she should walk or ride in the air an hour or two every day before dinner when the weather will admit  the cold bath where there is no decay of the lungs or other internal parts will greatly assist the cure by bracing the solids but this being a remedy of a powerful kind ought never to be used without proper advice as many instances have occurred where such as labored under consumptive symptoms with weak ulcerated lungs etc have been destroyed by its unseasonable use  though forcing and heating medicines are prescribed indiscriminately to every female at this time and believed by mothers to be specifics and infallible yet they are dangerous and unnatural and have ruined the health of thousands for they act either by stimulating the lower bowel or heating the body in some such as the aloes both these effects are united which instead of diminishing tends to increase the cause from whence the complaint originated nature on the contrary accomplishes her designs by slow degrees and consequently without violence to the constitution  for a fuller account of food air and exercise see the remarks under indigestion also for the use of the cold bath see the observations on that head  i shall now treat of those complaints which happen between the commencement and cessation of these two periods in which the tonic medicines will be of infinite service i have attended a great number of ladies who owing to their ill state of health were either never pregnant at all or else could never arrive at the full time by strengthening the whole constitution with the tonic medicines joined to a proper diet and exercise with a discreet use of the cold bath i have had the satisfaction of recovering the health of my patients and afterward of delivering them of very fine healthy children  the following case often occurs in practice which is very difficult to remedy if not attended to in proper time  a woman apparently of a healthy constitution is seized with a total suppression obstruction or discontinuance for many months some women feel very little inconvenience under this circumstance while others soon grow big with tension and pain in the belly and some enlargement of the breasts sickness in the mornings dislike to particular foods and other symptoms similar to pregnancy  and married women believe themselves in this situation and imagine that they actually perceive the child and are sometimes not undeceived till the time of gestation is much exceeded  the tonic powders and proper attention to diet will effectually remove these complaints  another case has often occurred to me in practice namely  a violent spasmodic pain apparently in the stomach and bowels takes places in both married and single women previous to every time of their being unwell and sometimes during the whole time of their being so nothing is more excruciating to the patient it greatly impairs the health and predisposes the body to dangerous diseases  this is a most serious evil and should be particularly attended to by the following method i have been happy enough to prevent a return  the moment the pain is coming on i always give fifteen or twenty drops of tincture of opium and if needful repeat it every four hours it is scarcely ever necessary to give more than two doses before it answers every wishedfor purpose the patient should keep in or upon the bed at least in a recumbent posture and drink moderately of any diluting warm liquor such as black tea weak whey thin broth etc i have in this case also prescribed the tonic powders with the most happy effect  i shall now treat of the management necessary to be observed at the cessation or that particular period when nature is about to make that change in the constitution which generally happens about the age of fortyfive or from thence to fifty some women at this time feel no material alteration in their health others after a total cessation have experienced much greater vigor of constitution than they had known for many years before but there are others who suffer so much inconvenience from this source as to render some assistance necessary  about the time when this particular change in the habit takes place many women experience complaints which prove extremely troublesome and if neglected very dangerous  such as flushing heats restlessness want of sleep troublesome or frightful dreams spasmodic pains of the stomach and bowels and sometimes swelled ancles with pain and inflammation after this alteration has taken place sometimes women suddenly grow bigger and grow unwieldy their legs swell their body is costive the urine in small quantities and often discharged with every appearance of the dropsy  the tonic powders and drops in the two last cases with regular exercise i have never known to fail in effecting a cure strong purgatives which are generally prescribed prove extremely injurious  a proper regimen at this period should be attentively observed  those females who are of a full habit of body subject to feverish heats and of a strong constitution should adhere to a moderately cooling and light diet every thing that is heating should be religiously avoided especially spirits and even wine ought to be taken in great moderation the patient should lessen the usual quantity of animal food and abstain from meat suppers the liberal use of vegetables with a proper degree of exercise and pure cool air should be attended to large assemblies or hot close rooms should be avoided as the mind has great influence over bodly health it is essentially necessary to keep that as tranquil as possible  but where the patient is weakly and not troubled with feverish heats and is of a thin habit of body a more generous diet should be allowed a glass or two of wine after dinner and supper may be needful at the same time whatever will induce an unnatural heat especially spirituous liquors must be avoided proper exercise and wholesome air should be attended to the sea or cold bathing may be used with great advantage where the lungs or other internal parts are sound  those medicines on which females place great reliance usually taken at this period being very injurious i shall enumerate some of their baneful effects  these are not only extremely pernicious to the constitution but produce most dreadful disorders of the womb  the scotch pills hoopers female pills analeptic and in short the whole tribe of pills in general use for this purpose are all detrimental to the animal economy aloes of which these pills are composed though a good medicine in itself has been fatally abused and has done more mischief than any other drug whatever its operation is diametrically opposite to the real intention of nature for it determines the blood to the womb and strongly stimulates it and the contiguous parts which consequently promotes the periodical discharge at a time when naturally it is about to cease whatever tends to encourage the flow when it is the law of nature to decline that particular office must certainly be injurious inflammation ulceration and cancer of the womb with floodings more frequently arise from the effects of these pills than have been hitherto known or imagined  during suckling many persons are in the habit of taking scotch and hoopers pills with a view to keep the body open  but this practice tends to interrupt the natural process by lessening the quantity of milk and injuring its quality in these cases lenitive electuary senna tea with cream of tartar and castor oil are preserable to either the scotch or hoopers pills but the tonic powders are for this purpose far superior to any other medicine  my worthy friend the late dr fothergill whose abilities honor and veracity no one with justice ever disputed has made many judicious remarks respecting the injurious effects of those medicines which are composed of aloes and prescribed for women at this particular time he says   an opinion generally prevails among the sex that purgatives are particularly necessary at this juncture preparations of aloes are therefore recommended from one to another as proper purgatives to be used at this particular period  but if we reflect upon the known effects of this drug in all its preparations we shall find it almost uniformly producing the piles if taken long together from its stimulating the vessels at the extremity of the rectum called the hemorrhoidal veins and the contiguous parts  instead therefore of countenancing a treatment which is not only unreasonable in theory but injurious in practice  every opportunity ought to be embraced to expose and correct a popular error than which there perhaps are few in the circle of medicine that are more mischievous repeated instances have occurred in my practice of grievous inconveniences arising from these heating medicines the piles strangury racking pains in the loins representing labor pains and other similar complaints  in order to accommodate the public at large with these medicines dr squirrell has been induced to prepare them in proper proportions with ample directions for taking them wellsuited to the convenience of every class of the community viz  the tonic powders in packets at   s   d and   s

expressing my gratitude at the expeditious manner in which you relieved my pain and cured me of the gout when i first sent for you to attend me in that disease i had not the least idea of your curing
