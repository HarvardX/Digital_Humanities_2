original letters of the late reverend mr laurence stern  original letters of the late reverend mr laurence stern never before published  london printed at the logographic press and sold by t longman paternoster row j robson and w clarke new bond street and w richardson under the royal exchange       letters of the late mr laurence stern to w c esquire coxwould july        i am safe arrived at my bower  and i trust that you have no longer any doubt about coming to embower it with me having for six months together been running at the ring of pleasure you will find that repose here which all young as you are you ought to want we will be witty or classical or sentimental as it shall please you best my milkmaids shall weave you garlands and every day after coffee i will take you to pay a visit to my nuns do not however indulge your fancy beyond measure but rather let me indulge mine or at least let me give you the history of it and the fair sisterhood who dwell in one of it is visionary corners now what is all this about you will say  have a few moments patience and i will tell you  you must know then that on passing out of my back door i very soon gain a path which after conducting me through several verdant meadows and shady thickets brings me in about twenty minutes to the ruins of a monastery where in times long past a certain number of cloistered females had devoted their  lives  i scarce know what i was going to write  to religious solitude  this saunter of mine when i take it i call paying a visit to my nuns  it is an awful spot  a rivulet flows by it and a lofty bank covered with wood that rises abruptly on the opposite side gives a gloom to the whole and forbids the thoughts if they were ever so disposed from wandering away from the place solitary sanctity never found a nook more appropriated to her nature  it is a place for an antiquary to sojourn in for a month  and examine with all the spirit of rusty research but i am no antiquary as you well know  and therefore i come here upon a different and a better errand  that is  to examine myself  so i lean lackadaysically over a gate and look at the passing stream  and forgive the spleen the gout and the envy of a malicious world and after having taken a stroll beneath mouldering arches i summon the sisterhood together and take the fairest among them and sit down with her on a stone beneath a bunch of alders  and do  what you will say  why i examine her gentle heart and see how it is attuned i then guess at her wishes and play with the cross that hangs at her bosom  in short  i make love to her  fie for shame tristram  that is not as it ought to be  now i declare on the contrary that it is exactly what it ought to be for though philosophers may say among the many other foolish things philosophers have said that a man who is in love is not in his right senses  i do assert in opposition to all their saws and seesaws that he is never in his right senses or i would rather say his right sentiments but when he is pursuing some dulcinea or other if that should be the case with you at this moment i will forgive your staying from me but if this letter should find you at the instant when your last flame is blown out and before a new one is lighted up and you should not take post and come to me and my nuns i will abuse you in their name and my own to the end of the chapter  though i believe after all at the end of the chapter i should feel myself  affectionately yours l stern  letter ii coxwould july         and so you have been at the seats of the learned  if i could have guessed at such an intention i would have contrived that something in an epistolary shape should have met you there with half a dozen lines recommending you to the care of the master of jesus  he was my tutor when i was at college and a very good kind of man he used to let me have my way when i was under his direction and that showed his sense for i was born to travel out of the common road and to get aside from the highway path and he had sense enough to see it and not to trouble me with trammels i was neither made to be a thillhorse nor a forehorse in short i was not made to go in a team but to amble along as i liked and so that i do not kick or splash or run over any one who in the name of common sense has a right to interrupt me  let the good folks laugh if they will and much good may it do them indeed i am persuaded and i think i could prove nay and i would do it if i were writing a book instead of a letter the truth of what i once told a very great statesman orator politician and as much more as you please  that every time a man smiles  much more so  when he laughs  it adds something to the fragment of life  but the staying five days at cambridge does not come within the immediate reach of my crazy comprehension and you might have employed your time much much better in urging your mettlesome tits to wards coxwould  i may suppose that you have been picking a hole in the skirts of gibbs cumbrous architecture or measuring the facade of trinity college library or peering about the gothic perfections of kings college chapel or which was doing a better thing sipping tea and talking sentimentally with the miss cooks or disturbing mr gray with one of your enthusiastic visits  i say disturbing him for with all your own agreeableness and all your admiration of him he would rather have your room than your company but mark me i do not say this to his glory but to his shame for i would be content with any room so i had your company  but tell me i beseech you what you did with s  all this time the looking at the heavy walls of muzzing colleges and gazing at the moldy pictures of their founders is not altogether in his way nor did he wander where i have whilom wandered on cams all verdant banks with willows crowned and call the muse alas he would rather call a waiter  and how such a milksop as you could travel  i mean be suffered to travel two leagues in the same chaise with him i know not  but from that admirable and kind pliability of spirit which you possess whenever you please but which you do not always please to possess i do not mean that a man should wear a court dress when he is going to a puppetshow but on the other hand to keep the best suit of embroidery for those only whom he loves though there is something noble in it will never do the world my dear friend will not let it do for while there are such qualities in the human mind as ingratitude and duplicity unlimited confidence and this patriotism of friendship which i have heard you rave and rant about is a very dangerous business  i could preach a sermon on the subject  to say the truth i am got as grave as if i were in my pulpit thus are the projects of this life destroyed when i took up my pen my humor was gay frisky and fanciful  and now i am sliding into all the seesaw gravity of solemn councils i want nothing but an ass to look over my pales and set up a braying to keep me in countenance  leave leave your lincolnshire seats and come to my dale s  i know is heartily tired of you besides i want a nurse for i am not quite well and have taken to milkcoffee remember me however to him kindly and to yourself cordially for  i am yours most truly l stern  letter iii to w c esquire coxwould aug        and so you sit in s  s temple and drink tea and converse classically  now i should like to know what is the nature of this disorder which you call classicality  if it consists in a rage to converse on ancient subjects in a modern manner or on modern subjects in an ancient one  or are you both out of your senses and do you fancy yourselves with virgil and horace at sinuessa or with tully and atticus at tusculum oh how it would delight me to peep at you from behind a laurel bush and see you surrounded with columns and covered by a dome quaffing the extract of a chinese weed and talking of men who boasted the inspiration of the falernian grape  what a couple of vapid inert beings you must be  i should really give you up for lost if it were not for the confidence i have in the reinvigorating powers of my society to which you must now have immediate recourse if you wish for a restoration make haste then my good friend and seek the aid of your physician ere it be too late  you know not the interest i take in your welfare have i not ordered all the linen to be taken out of the press and rewashed before it was dirty that you may have a clean table cloth every day with a napkin into the bargain and have i not ordered a kind of windmill that makes my head ach again with its clatter to be placed in my fine cherrytree that the fruit may be preserved from the birds to furnish you a desert and do you not know that you will have curds and cream for your supper think on these things and let s  go to lincoln sessions by himself and talk classically with country justices in the mean time we will philosophize and sentimentalize  the last word is a bright invention of the moment in which it was written for yours or dr johnsons service  and you shall sit in my study and take a peep into the world as into a showbox and amuse yourself as i present the pictures of it to your imagination thus will i teach you to laugh at its follies to pity its errors and despise its injustice  and i will introduce you among the rest to some tenderhearted damsel on whose cheeks some bitter affliction has placed a tear  and having heard her story you shall take a white handkerchief from your pocket to wipe the moisture from her eyes and from your own  and then you shall go to bed not to the damsel but with an heart conscious of those sentiments and possessed of those feelings which will give softness to your pillow sweetness to your slumbers and gladness to your waking moments  you shall sit in my porch and laugh at attic vestibules i love the classics as well as any man ought to love them  but among all their fine sayings their fine writings and their fine verses their most enthusiastic admirer would not be able to find me half a dozen stories that have any sentiment in them  and so much for that  if you dont come soon i shall set about another volume of tristram without you so god bless you for  i am yours most truly l stern  letter iv to   coxwould near easingwould august        i am grieved for your downfall though it was only out of a parkchair  may it be the last you will receive in this world though while i write this wish my heart heaves a deep sigh and i believe it will not be read by you my friend without a similar accompaniment  alas alas my dear boy you are born with talents to soar aloft with but you have an heart which my apprehensions tell me will keep you low  i do not mean you know i do not any thing base or grovelling  but instead of winging your way above the storm i am afraid that you will calmly submit to its rigours and house yourself afterward in some humble shed and there live contented and chaunt away the time and be lost to the world  how the wind blows i know not and i have not an inclination to walk to my window where perhaps i might catch the course of a cloud and be satisfied  but here i am up to my knees  i should rather say up to my heart in a subject which is ever accompanied with some afflicting vaticination or other i am not afraid of your doing any wrong but to yourself a secret knowledge of some circumstances which you have never communicated to me have alarmed my affection for you  not from any immediate harm they can produce but from the conviction they have forced upon me concerning your disposition and the nicer parts of your character if you do not come soon to me i shall take the wings of some fine morning and fly to you but i should rather have you here for i wish to have you alone and if you will let me be a mentor to you for one little month i will be content  and you shall be a mentor to me the rest of the year or if you will the rest of my days  i long most anxiously my dear friend to teach you  not to give an opiate to those sensibilities of your nature which make me love you as i do nor to check your glowing fancy that gives such grace to polished youth nor to yield the beverage of the fountain for the nectar of the cask but to use the world no better or to please you a very little better than it deserves  but think not i beseech you that i would introduce my young telemachus to such a foul and squinteyed piece of pollution as suspicion avaunt to such a base ungenerous passion i would sooner carry you to calypso at once and give you at least a little pleasure for your pains but there is a certain little spot to be found somewhere in the midway between trusting every body and trusting nobody and so well am i acquainted with the longitudes latitudes and bearings of this world of ours that i could put my finger upon it and direct you at once to it and i think i could give you so many good reasons why you should go there that you would not hesitate to set off immediately and i would accompany you thither and serve as a cicerone to you i wish therefore much very much to talk with you about that and other serious matters  as for your bodily infirmity never mind it you may come here by gentle stages and without inconvenience and i will be your surgeon or your nurse and warm your verjuice every evening and bathe your sprain with it and talk of these things so tell me i pray you the day that i am to meet you at york in the mean time and always may a good providence protect you  it is the sincere wish of  your affectionate l stern  letter v to w c  esquire wednesday morning this letter will meet you at hewits instead of myself for i have taken some how or other and i know not how a very violent cold and cannot come and as i would receive you with my best looks if possible as well as my best welcome i am nursing myself into some sort of restoration against your arrival though my cough torments me without mercy and i am so hoarse at this moment that i can scarce make myself heard across my table  this phthisic of mine will sooner or later and perhaps sooner than either i or you my friend may think bear me to my last asylum from a splenetic world you will say perhaps that i am splenetic also in my turn by writing thus gravely  but as i well know this vile cough is the engine which that scarecrow death employs to shatter my poor frame and bring it to his dominion how can i be merry or satisfied  it is true i love laughing and merrymaking and all that as well as any soul upon earth nevertheless i cannot think of piping and taboring it out of the world like the figures in holbeins dance besides i have been so used to my own way that i dont like to be put out of it by being made to cough so villainously as i do more than half my time it is most inurbane in him  by heaven it is cowardly in the rascal to rob me of those spirits with which i have so often defeated him  and this is not all  for i have forty volumes more to write nay and have absolutely promised the world to do it and i have my engagements to you as well as to the world  and to myself as well as to you both and how shall i keep my word as an author and a gentleman and what is of more consequence than either  as a friend  if i cannot shake off this piece of anatomy besides no one can do these things for me but myself the business is beyond all power of attorney for if i were to leave fifty executors to my last will and testament and if they were to be joined by a regiment of administrators and assigns they could not take up their pens and do as i would do  but what a wayward fancy mine is  and with what a seducing pen am i writing  for i am got leagues without number from the idea which danced before me when i first began this letter and here i am wrong again  for what great distance can there be between the grave of my grandfather and my own and it was to his tomb that i wished to conduct you  i know full well that all sprained your ancle may be it will be wholly impossible for you to pass through york without popping your head into its cathedral and indulging your mind with a few of those reflections which such a building is calculated to inspire now when you are there tell a verger to conduct you to the tomb of archbishop stern he is the same whose picture you saw at cambridge and which you were pleased to say bore so strong a resemblance to me in the marble whole length figure which dignifies the monument you will find the likeness still stronger and if i drop in this corner of the world i should like to be deposited in that corner of the church and sleep out my last sleep beside my pious ancestor  he was an excellent prelate and an honest man  i have not half his virtues if report speaks true of us both which for his sake i hope it does  and for my own i hope it does not though to use an expression which dropped from the lips and at the table of a brother archprelate of his and one of his successors my ideas are sometimes rather too disorderly for a man in orders in his graces concio ad clerum i do not find myself a very principal figure but in his private hours he is always most cordial to me  the day after tomorrow i shall hope to embrace you at my gate till then my dear friend may god bless you  and always  yours most affectionately l stern  letter vi to   coxwould monday morning i shall forgive the tardiness of your passage hither if it be true as a still small voice of a york gossip has informed me that you repose with your infirm limb on a sofa in mrs  s withdrawing room and have your coffee and tea handed you by her two daughters and one of them has charms enough for the three graces  and that they play on their harpsichord and with voices stolen from heaven sing duets to you while you stretched on damask command as it were that little world of beauty and good sense which surrounds you  you cannot my good friend have known the charming people with whom you are so happy more than eight and forty hours at most now i make this observation merely to have the pleasure of making another which is that you have learned the art and a very comfortable one it is of setting yourself at ease with worthy spirits when you have the good fortune to meet them indeed i may claim the credit of having taught you the maxim that life is too short to be long in forming the tender and happy connections of it it is a miserable waste of time as well as a very base business to be looking at each other as an usurer looks at a security to find a flaw in it no  if you meet a heart worth being admitted into and you really feel yourself worthy of admission the matter is arranged in five hours as well as five years  hail ye gentle sympathies that can approach two amiable hearts to each other and chase every discordant idea from an union that nature has designed by the same happy coloring of character that she has given them  but lucus a non lucendo  i have received a kind of dish dash sort of letter from garrick  out of which all my chemistry cannot extract a sympathetic atom i am glad however to have an opportunity of writing a short answer to him that i may address a long postscript to his cara sposa  i love garrick on the stage better than any thing in the world except mrs garrick off it and if there is any one heart in the world i should like to get a corner of  it would be hers but i am too great a sinner to do more than approach the portal of so much excellence  there to bend one knee at least and ejaculate at a distance from the altar  i have often thought on what this spirit of idolatry which is continually bearing me to the feet of some fair image or other will do with me twenty years hence and whether after having had during my younger days a damsel to smooth my pillow  i should find one in my age to put on my slipper however i need not trouble myself or you about these conjectures for i well know there is not life in me to make the experiment  this instant brings me a letter from your kind hostess who is determined not to let you go till i come to fetch you  tomorrow by noon therefore i shall embrace you and her  and  the damsels  i am most cordially yours l stern  lettter vii to   esquire crazy castle though i hope and trust you believe that i am not only disposed to laugh with those who laugh but to weep with those who weep  yet it is most true my dear friend that i could not but smile as i read the account you sent me of your distress and disappointment and when i gave your letter to hall for you see i am at crazy castle he laughed the tears into his eyes  now you must not suppose nor can you imagine that either of us trifled with your sufferings for you know i love you and hall says you are a lad of promise but we were merry at the amiable simplicity of your nature in wondering that there is ever any villainy in a villainous world and at the idea how little a time you were destined to possess that delicious  for i will call it with all its scrapes and duperies a delicious sentiment you have just opened the volume of life and startle to find a blot in the first page alas alas as you proceed you will find whole pages so blotted and blurred that you will scarce be able to distinguish the characters it is a sorry business i must confess to plant suspicion in a breast that has never known it and to check the glow of hope which animates the beginning of the journey by pointing out the interruptions and dangers that will be necessarily encountered in the course of it but this is the duty of friendship and arises from the nature of our existence and the state of the world if however after all you can acquire an useful experience and be taught to put yourself on your guard at the expense of a few score guineas you have made a good bargain  so be content and no more of your complainings  but you will tell me perhaps that it is not the matter of the loss but the manner of it that you consider as a misfortune the being treated so ill and with so much ingratitude is the business that afflicts you hall who is still laughing bids me tell you for your comfort that he who dupes must be a rascal and he who is duped may be an honest man but he is a cynic and administers his dose in his own way now was i to console you in mine i should tell you that gratitude is not so common a virtue in the world as it ought to be for all our sakes but ingratitude my dear friend is not an offspring of the present moment it seems to have existed from the beginning and will continue to disgrace the world when we have long been in the valley of jehosaphat  nay you must have read  indeed i know that i have written a sermon upon the subject  that of the lepers who were healed but one returned to give thanks for his restoration i do not however tell you these things that you may find consolation in the miserable habits of mankind but that you may not suppose yourself worse used than the rest of the world which is very common with young men like yourself who feel at every pore and have not yet had that collision with untoward circumstances which awakens caution or begets patience  and so much for you and your miseries which i doubt not will have been dissipated by the bewitching smiles of some fair damsel or other before my grave seesaw letter shall reach you let me know i beg of you your plan of operations for the winter if you have one you may i think  though you may think otherwise  fly from the joys and damps of this ungenial climate and winter serenely with me in languedoc your company would do me good and mine would do you no harm  at least i think so and we shall return to london time enough to peep in at ranelagh and look at the birthday in short write to me upon the subject and direct to me here for here i am to be during this shooting month of september so god bless you and give you patience if you want it  i remain yours most cordially l stern  letter viii to w  c  esquire coxwould june         so burton the late amiable and excellent lord cunningham really told you with a grave face and an apparent mortification that i had ridiculed my irish friends at bath for an hour together and had made a large company merry at lady lepels the late lady mulgrave table during an whole afternoon at their expense by heavens it is false as misrepresentation can make it it is not in my nature i trust to be so ungrateful as i should be if absent or present i were to be ungracious to them that i should make burton look grave whose countenance is formed to mark the smiles of an amiable and an honest heart is not within my chapter of possibilities  i am sure it is not in that of my intentions to say any thing that is inurbane of such a man as he is  for in my life did i never communicate with a gentleman of qualities more winning and dispositions more generous he invited me to his house with kindness and he gave me a truly graceful welcome for it was with all his heart he is as much formed to make society pleasant as any one i ever saw and i wish he were as rich as croesus that he might do all the good an unbounded generosity would lead him to do i never passed more pleasant hours in my life than with him and his fair countrywomen and foul befall the man who should let drop a word in dispraise of him or them  and there is the charming widow moor where if i had not a piece of legal meadow of my own i should rejoice to batten the rest of my days  and the gentle elegant gore with her fine form and grecian face and whose lot i trust it will be to make some man happy who knows the value of a tender heart  nor shall i forget another widow the interesting mrs vesey with her vocal and fifty other accomplishments  i abuse them  it must not be told  for it is false  and it should not be believed for it is unnatural  it is true i did talk of them for an hour together but no sarcasm or unlucky sallies mingled with my speech  yes i did talk of them as they would wish to be talked of  with smiles on my countenance praise on my tongue hilarity in my heart and the goblet in my hand  besides i am myself of their own country  my father was a considerable time on duty with his regiment in ireland and my mother gave me to the world when she was there on duty with him i beg of you therefore to make all these good people believe that i have been at least misunderstood for it is impossible that lady barrymore could mean to misrepresent me  read burton this letter if you have an opportunity and assure him of my most cordial esteem and respect for him and all his social excellencies and whisper something kind and gentle for me as you well know how to my fair countrywomen and let not an unmerited prejudice or displeasure against me remain any longer in their tender bosoms  when you get into disgrace of any kind be assured that i will do as much for you  i am here as idle as ease of heart can make me  i shall wait for you till the beginning of next month when if you do not come i shall proceed to while away the rest of the summer at crazy castle and scarborough in the beginning the very beginning of october i mean to arrive in bondstreet with my sermons and when i have arranged their publication then  hey go mad for italy  whither you would do well to accompany me  in the mean time however i hope and wish to see you here it will after all be much better than playing the strephon with phthisical nymphs at the bristol fountain but do as you may   i am most sincerely yours l stern  letter ix to   i did not answer your letter as you desired me for at the moment i received it i really thought all my projects for some time to come were burned to a cinder or which is the better expression of the two had evaporated in smoke  for not half an hour before an affrighted messenger on a breathless horse had arrived to acquaint me that the parsonage house at  was on fire when he came away and burning like a bundle of faggots and while i was preparing to set off to see my house after it was burned down your letter arrived to console me on my way for it gave me every assurance that if i were left without an hole to put my head into or a rag to cover my  body you would give me a comfortable room in your house and a clean shirt into the bargain  in short by the carelessness of my curate or his wife or some one within his gates i am an house out of pocket  i say literally out of pocket for i must rebuild it at my own costs and charges or the church of york who originally gave it me will do those things which in good sense ought not to be done but which the wiseacres who compose it will tell me they have a right to do my loss will be upwards of two hundred pounds with some books etc etc  so that you may now lay aside all your apprehensions about what i shall do with the wealth that my sermons have brought and are to bring to me  i told you then that some devilish accident or other would provide me with the ends of getting rid of the means and i had a cross accident in my head at the time which i did not communicate to you but it is not that which has fallen out nor any thing like it  though this may fall out too for aught i know and then the fee simple of my sermons will be gone for ever  now these sermons of mine were most of them written in the very house that is burned down and all of them preached i fear again and again in the very church to which it belonged and they now answer a purpose i never dreamed or thought of but so it is in this world and thus are things hinged and hung together  or rather unhinged or unhung for i have my doubts at present whether we shall see the dying gladiator next winter the matter however that concerns me most in the business is the strange unaccountable conduct of my poor unfortunate curate not in setting fire to the house for i do not accuse him of it god knows nor any one else but in setting off the moment after it happened and flying like paul to tarsus through fear of a prosecution from me  that the man should have formed such an idea of me as to suppose me capable if i did not sooth his sorrows of adding another to their number wounded me sorely for amidst all my errors and sollies i do not believe there is any thing in the color or complexion of any part of my life that would justify the shadow of such an apprehension  besides he deprived me of all the comfort i made out to myself from the misfortune which was as it pleased heaven to deprive him of one house to take him and his wife and his little one into another  i mean into that where i lived myself and he who now reads my heart and will one day judge me for the secrets of it  he well knows that it did not grow cold within me on account of the accident till i was informed that this silly man was a fugitive from the fear of my wrath  the family of the c  s were kind to me beyond measure as they have always have been they are a sort of people that you would like extremely and before the summer is past i hope to present you to them though if i recollect aright you know the charming damsel of the house already and the rest of it though not so young or so fair are as amiable as she is  as i cannot leave you in possession of a better subject for your reflection etc i shall say adieu and god bless you  in a few days you shall hear again from  your affectionate and faithful l stern i write this from york  where you may write to me    letter x to   esquire i have received my dear friend your kind answer to my letter and you must know that it was just such an one as i wished to receive from you  nay it was just such an one as i expected you would write to me i should have been disappointed if it had been in any other sorm or shape of friendship but understand me if you please i should have been disappointed for your sake and not for my own for though i am charmed that you should have made me those unreserved offers of friendship which are so gracious in you i am almost as much pleased that my exchequer is in that slate of sufficiency as not to require them  i have made my bargain for rebuilding my parsonage and settled all arrangements with all parties concerned in a manner more to my satisfaction than i could have expected i was rather in haste to settle this account that there might be no risque of leaving my wife and lydia a dilapidation for their fortune for i have no reason to believe that the  of  would be more kind to them when friendless and unprotected than they had been to the husband of the one and the father of the other who when he was a poor curate had pride enough to despise their reverences and wit enough to make others laugh at them but may god forgive them as i do  amen  i wrote to hall an account of my disaster  and his answer bid me find out a conceit on the occasion and comfort myself with it tully the orator the politician the philosopher the moralist the consul etc etc etc adopted as he heartily tells us every one who reads his works this mode of consolation when he lost his daughter and if we may believe him with success now this same tully you must know was like my father i mean mr shandy of shandy hall who was as well pleased with a misfortune that gave him an opportunity of displaying his eloquence as with a blessing that obliged him to hold his tongue both these great men were fond of conceits i mean their own so i will tell you a story of a conceit not of ciceros nor my fathers but of the lord of crazy  you must know then that this same friend of mine and i may add of yours also in a moment of lazy pride took it into his head that he would have a town chariot to save his feet by day and to carry him to ranelagh in the evening for this purpose after consulting a coachmaker he had allotted one hundred and forty pounds and he wrote me word of it on my arrival in town about three months after this communication i found a card of invitation from lord spencer to dine with him on the following sunday and i had no sooner read it than halls fine craneneckd chariot came bounce as it were upon my recollection so i sallied forth to ask him how he did and to borrow his carriage that i might pay my visit in pomp as well as pontificalibus i found him at home made a friendly enquiry or two and told him of the little arrangement i had formed when he replied with one of his cynical smiles that his mortification was in the extreme for that his chariot was gone post to scotland i stared and he laughed  not at me but at his own conceit and you shall have it such as it is  i must inform you then that at the moment when the coachmaker was receiving his last instructions he himself received a letter which letter acquainted him that his son who was quartered at edinburgh had got into a terrible riot there to get out of the consequences of which demanded almost the precise sum that had been destined for the chariot so that the hundred and forty pounds which had been set a part to build a chariot in london were employed to repair broken windows broken lamps and broken heads in edinburgh and hall comforted himself with the conceit that his chariot was gone post to scotland so much for comforts and conceits  and happy is it for us when we can by any means conceit ourselves into comfort i could say more upon this matter but my paper is almost filled and i have only space to express a wish that your life may never want any of these petty helps to make it as happy as if i greatly mistake not it must be honorable  let me see you soon and in the mean time and at all times may god be with you  yours most affectionately l stern  letter xi to   esquire coxwould near easingwould you are not singular in your opinion about my wonderful capacity for poetry  beauclerk and lock and i think langton have said what you have said on the subject and founded their opinion as you have done on the sragment of an introduction to the ode to julia in tristram shandy the unity of the episode would have been wounded if i had added another line and if i had added a dozen my character as a poetical genius which by the bye i never had would have been lost for ever  or rather would never have been suspected  hall had also similar ideas on this very matter and on the strength of his opinion ventured once to giveme an unfinished poem of his own and bade me go on with it  and so i did heltering and skeltering at a most terrible rate  in short i added some sixty or fourscore lines to the business which he called doggrel and which i think he called rightly however he chose to let them stand to use his own phrase as a curiosity so into the press they went and helped to compose the worst squib our crazy friend ever let off i do not however mention these things to lessen the merit of your opinion by pointing out its similarity to that of others you need not be ashamed to think with such men if even they should be wrong which on this particular subject i most solemnly believe you all to be cum his errare is something  and all that   i once it is true wrote an epitaph which i liked myself but the person at whose request i did it sacrificed it to one of his own which he liked better but which i did not  so my lines were thrown aside and his own nerveless rhyme was engraved on a marble which deserved a better inscription for it covered the dust of one whose gentle nature and amiable qualities merited more than common praise or commonplace eulogium however i shed a tear over the sepulcher which if the dead could have known it would have been more acceptable than the most splendid diction that ever glared on monumental alabaster  i also wrote a kind of shandean singsong dramatic piece of rhyme for mr beard  and he sung it at ranelagh as well as on his own stage for the benefit of some one or other he asked for something of the kind and i knew not how to refuse him for a year before he had in a very respectful manner and without any previous acquaintance presented me with the freedom of covent garden theater the act was gracious and i liked it the better because the monarch of drury lane had known me for some years and besides had for some time occupied a front seat in my page before he offered me the freedom  not of drury lane house but of drury lane pit i told him on the occasion that he acted great things and did little ones  so he stammered and looked foolish and performed at length with a bad grace what his rival manager was so kind as to do with the best grace in the world  but no more of that  he is so complete on the stage that i ought not to mention his patchwork off it  however to return to my subject  if i can for digression is interwoven with my nature and to get to my point or find my way back to it when i have wandered aside as other men do is not in the line of my faculties  but though i may not be a poet the clerk of my parish is  not absolutely in my conceit  but which is better in that of his neighbors and which is the best of all  in his own his muse is a professional one for she only inspires him to indite hymns and it is appropriate for she leads him to such subjects as are suitable to his spiritual office and which like those of his brethren sterald and hopkins may be said or sung in churches in short there had been a terrible disease among the cattle and our parish had suffered greatly so that this parochial bard thought it a proper subject for a spiritual song which he accordingly composed and gave it out on the sunday following to the praise and glory of god as an hymn of his own composing not only the murrain itself but the sufferers by the calamity were vociferated through the aisles in all the pomp and devotion of rustic psalmody the last stanza which is the only one i recollect rather unhinged my devotion but it seemed to rivet that of the congregation and therefore i had no right to complain i leave it with you as a bonne bouche and wish you a good night  here is jemmy how has lost a cow and so has johnny bland therefore well put our trust in god and not in any other man yours l s  letter xii to   esquire coxwould wednesday night i sent you my dear friend as you request it the epitaph which i mentioned in my last epistle to you i write it from recollection and though it may not contain the precise expression it will certainly possess the sentiment of the original composition  and that is of the most consequence i remember well it came from the heart for i most sincerely loved the amiable person whose virtues deserved a better inscription and according to a very common course of things found a worse but here it is   columns and labored urns but vainly show an idle scene of fabricated woe  the sweet companion and the friend sincere need no mechanic arts to force the tear in heartfelt numbers never meant to shine twill flow eternal over an hearse like thine twill flow while gentle goodness has one friend or kindred tempers have a tear to lend hall liked it i remember  and hall always knows what ought to be liked and in certain humors will be candid upon these sentimental subjects and acknowledge that he feels them he is an excellent scholar and a good critic but his judgment has more severity than it ought to have and his taste less delicacy than it should possess he has also great humanity but somehow or other there is so often such a mixture of sarcasm in it that there are many who will not believe he has a single scruple of it in his composition  nay i am acquainted with several who cannot be persuaded but that he is a very insensible hardhearted man which i who have known him long and known him well assure you he is not  he may not always possess the grace of charity but he feels the reality of it and continually performs benevolent actions though not always i must confess in a benevolent manner and here is the grief of the business he will do a kindness with a sneer or a joke or a smile when perhaps a tear or a grave countenance at least would better become him but this is his way it is the language of his character and though one might wish it to be otherwise yet i cannot tell what right any of us have to pass a severe sentence upon it for no other reason in the world but because our own failings are of a different complexion and so much for all that  i am preparing to prance it for a week or ten days at scarborough if you pass your autumn at mulgravehall take that place in your way and i will accompany you on your visit and then to crazy castle and so home and then to london  and then god knows where  but it shall be where it pleases him this is clerically said however and it would be well for the best of us if it were thought and considered as often as it was said but so it is that the lips and the heart which ought never to be asunder are sometimes wandering at different corners of the earth mine however are in the closest conjunction when i offer you my most affectionate regard so good night and may the visions of a good spirit attend you  most truly yours l stern  lettter xiii to   esquire scarborough i shall not reply my dear friend to all the kind things you think and say of me  i trust indeed that i deserve some of them and i am well pleased to find that you think i deserve them all  but however that may be i desire you to cherish those benevolent sentiments which you have so warmly expressed in the paper before me both for your own sake and that of the person who is the subject of them  your commands in general should be obeyed without reflection  but in this particular instance a rare gleam of prudence has shot across me and i beg leave to reflect for a few moments on the subject  and were i to take wisdom upon me and reflect for a few days  the result i am sure would be that i should not obey your commands at all  the giving advice my good friend is the most thankless generosity in the world  because in the first place it costs you nothing and in the next it is just such a thing as the person to whom you present it will think that he does not want this you see is my way of reasoning but i believe from my heart that it will apply too well to the subject between us  there are such things in the world as wrong heads and right hearts  and wrong hearts and right heads  now for myself and speaking under the influence of my own particular feelings i would rather be of the right heart family with all their blunders errors and confusions but if i want a business to be done or a plan to be executed give me the right head  if there is a right heart into the bargain so much the better but it is upon the former that i must rely  and whether the latter be right or wrong is not a matter of absolute consideration this is not my dear friend quite orthodox according to your system but as you proceed every day will tend to increase the propinquity of this opinion to your own  now i am rather disposed to think without leaning to the uncharitable side of the question that poor  is of the wronghead family  i know his heart  and i am sure his present scrape arises from the good dispositions of it nevertheless though i think myself a dab at giving good counsel in such cases as his i cannot bring myself to prescribe on the occasion  it is impossible to do it without informing him of the nature of his disease which is neither more nor less than absolute wrongheadedness and were i to do it he would exhibit another symptom of his disorder by throwing my prescription out of the window and perhaps threatening the same mischief to the physician himself  if you have influence sufficient to induce him to apply to me i will most readily exert my best for him and i can then do the bitter business and give the the unpalatable dose with a good grace here then we will if you please let the matter rest for the present  i write in haste and on my pillow that you may as soon as possible be acquainted with my sentiments in a matter wherein you have a greater dependence upon me than i fear the event will justify  so good morning and god bless you   i received a letter yesterday from poor dear lydia  it is an amiable madcap  and god bless her also  once more adieu  yours etc l stern  letter xiv scarborough aug         you refine too much my dear friend  you do indeed  your reasoning is ingenious and produces a neat pretty plausible train of argument that would make a figure in a company of female philosophers but if committed to paper would be pardonable only when written on the fan of some pedantic dulcinea you run into divisions when a simple modulation would answer better that is would produce more pleasing effects both in yourself and the sentimental spirit whom you might wish to please  opinion my dear fellow somehow or other rules all mankind and not like a kind master or which would be more congenial a gentle mistress but like a tyrant whose wish is power and whose gratification is servility  opinion leads us by the ears the eyes  and i had almost said by the nose it warps our ununderstandings confounds our judgments dissipates experience and turns our passions to its purpose in short it becomes the governess of our lives and usurps the place of reason which it has kicked out of office  this is among the strange truths which cannot be explained but by that mortifying description which time will display to your experience hereafter with ten times the credit that would accompany any present endeavors of mine to the same purpose  if you would know more of the matter and can bring yourself to risque the opinion which by the bye i do not advise you to do ask a  why he submits with such a placid subservience to the little wench who lives with him you know  and all his friends know  that he has but half nay not half the enjoyments of life through the fear of her vengeance whatever it may be he has fortune understanding and courage  he loves society and adds greatly to the pleasures of it  and yet how often does he leave it halfenjoyed nay to come more home to the business how often has he left our pleasant classical meetings before they have arisen to their usual glow in order to humor this little piece of disgrace whom he has not the resolution to send back to the banks of the wye where the fifty pounds a year he might give her would make her queen of the village  we pity poor a  we argue with him we wonder at him  do we not  but in this we deceive ourselves  for the wisest and best of us are governed by some little dirty drab of an opinion whose governance is equally disgraceful and may be much more injurious  as it will perhaps give a color to the whole current of our lives a mistress with all her arts and fascinations may in time be got rid of but opinion once rooted becomes a part of ourselves  it lives and dies with us  it must be acknowledged that i have been rather sermonic this fine morning but you know how and where to apply what has been written and i leave the whole to your practice if you think proper and if you do not  but what have i to do with ifs  it is an exceptious monosyllable and i fling it from me  b  is here and tells me that he left you continually driving between london and richmond  what beauty of the hill has enchanted you there or what swan of the silver thames are you dying for  i take it very ill of you that you never favor me with a single communication concerning your dorothies or your delias i protest most seriously that i will never write to you again till you give me an history of your chains and who it is has bound you at present on the rivers bank  tell me who the naiad is  mr f  the apostolic f  as lady  calls him in his way to  hinted to me something serious he talked of a marriage  to which i replied god forbid  but do not i pray be angry with my exclamation for it was neither a thoughtless or a peevish one but an impulse of that sincere regard which you more than deserve from me  with your dispositions and in your situation i hardly think there is a woman in the kingdom who would be an happy match for you and if you think proper to ask me i will hereafter tell you why  at present i shall content myself with telling you that  i am most cordially yours l stern  letter xv september        i mean my dear friend that this epistle should meet you and greet you a day or two at least before you leave town and i wish it from that spirit of miserable selfinterest which you know governs and directs me in all i do  but lest you should not like this reason i will give you another and which may be ncarer the truth at least i hope so  i want very much to know whether b  has arranged the matter with foley the banker at paris about mrs sternes remittance as i ordered him you must know that i suspect he has been dilatory not from dishonesty for i believe him to be as honest a poor creature as was ever vamped into the form he wears but perhaps his exchequer might not be in a convenient state to answer my orders and if so i only beg to be informed of the truth which as he does not answer my letters he appears to be afraid to tell  i have received a letter from toulouse which does not comfort my spirits and i have reason to apprehend from thence that there is some neglect at the fountain head of my treasury which i must beg you to enquire into and if you see occasion to correct in order that the little rill of ways and means may not be interrupted between london and languedoc  that is between me and mrs stern and my poor dear lydia  they write me word that they have drawn upon foley as i desired who tells them he has no effects to answer the bill but that if they are in distress he will accommodate them for my sake this is very handsome dealing and i am rather proud of it  but in the mean time there is an uncertainty which is very unpleasant  i mean to the poor women who are at such a distance that a great deal of anxious suspense must be suffered before the mistake can be rectified  besides  these things breed words and questions as well as suspicions and all that  my dear lydia contents herself with a gentle complaint or so but her mother does not hesitate to discharge a volume of reproaches now the truth is that i deserve neither the one nor the other  and had managed the matter for the supply of their wants and the ridding myself of all future anxiety in the business in as plain a manner as my handwriting and spirit of calculation could make it  however it has abated the ardour of my knight errantry for the present and thrown more than a sickly thought or two on my imagination  i am prodigal of words my dear friend in a matter wherein a mere hint is all that would be necessary for you to exert yourself so do me the honor to see that it is absolutely done without a moments delay and if b  should hesitate the tithe of an instant  do that for me my friend which i would do for you on a similar occasion  so god bless you  my heart will not suffer me to offer you an apology because i know it will be ungracious to yours  once more farewell  most cordially yours l stern  letter xvi to   esquire coxwould wednesday evening i have received the letter which you informed me i should receive from doctor l  and return you both my best thanks for it  he is certainly a man of learning and an excellent critic and would do well to employ his leisure hours on virgil or rather if i understand him well on horace and he would give us such a commentary on both those authors as we have not and perhaps may never have if he does not set about it  but tristram shandy my friend was made and formed to baffle all criticism  and i will venture to rest the book on this ground  that it is either above the power or beneath the attention of any critic or hypercritic whatsoever  i did not fashion it according to any rule  i left my fancy or my genius or my feelings  call it what you may  to its own free course without a single intruding reflection that there ever had been such a man as aristotle in the world  when i mounted my hobby horse i never thought or pretended to think where i was going or whether i should return home to dinner or supper the next day or the next week  i let him take his own course and amble or curvet or trot or go a sober sorrowful lackadaysical pace as it pleased him best  it was all one to me for my temper was ever in unison with his manner of coursing it  be it what it might i never pricked him with a spur or struck him with a whip but let the rein lay loosely on his neck and he was wont to take his way without doing injury to any one  some would laugh at us as we passed along  and some seemed to pity us  and now and then a melancholy tender hearted passenger would look at us and heave a sigh  thus have we traveled together  but my poor rosinante did not like balaams ass stand still if he saw an angel in the way but directly pushed up to her  and if it were but a damsel sitting by a fountain who would let me take a refreshing draught from her cup she was surely an angel to me  the grand error of life is that we look too far  we scale the heavens  we dig down to the center of the earth for systems  and we forget ourselves  truth lies before us it is in the high way path and the ploughman treads on it with his clouted shoon  nature defies the rule and the line  art raises its structures and forms its works on their aid  but nature has her own laws which art cannot always comprehend and criticism can never reach  doctor l  acknowledges however that my sermon on conscience is a most admirable composition but is of opinion that it is degraded by being made a part of tristram shandy  now if you please be so good as to note my answer  if this sermon is so excellent and i myself believe it to be so  because judge burnet who was a man of taste and erudition as well as law desired me to print it  i say if it be a good sermon it ought to be read and since it appeared in the pages of tristram shandy it has been read by thousands whereas the fact is that when it was published by itself it was read by no one  i have answered doctor l  with all the respect which his amiable character and admirable talents deserve but i have told him at the same time that my book was not written to be tried by any known laws of scholastic criticism and that if i thought any thing i might hereafter write would be within their reach i would throw the manuscript that is now before me into the fire and never dip my pen into my inkstand again but for the purpose of assuring some uncritical and uncriticising friend like yourself of my sincere and cordial regard  at this moment i make that offering to you  so god be with you  l s i begin to peep out of my hermitage a little for lord and lady fauconberg are come down and bring with them as usual a large store of amiable easy and hospitable virtues  i wish you were here to partake of and add to them    letter xvii to   esquire monday evening you have hit my fancy most wonderfully in the account you have given me of lady  the juno character not only prevails but absolutely predominates the minerva qualities are all secondary  and as to any cyprian dispositions i know nothing about them  she certainly possesses a very good understanding and is not without seize but both the one and the other derive all their consequence from her manners  she has somewhat of an imperious disposition which would be either silently despised by some or violently opposed by others if she did not give a grace to it that annihilates any unpleasant sensation that might attempt to rise in the breast of a bystander or which is better bysitter but this is not all for it calls forth also that kind of respectful submission which does not lessen us in our own opinion for having practiced it  i never in my life felt the merit of exterior decoration so much as in my conversations and communications with this lady and i really do not know any position in the present school of fashion where a young man might learn so much as in her drawing room or without meaning any mischievous equivoque her dressing room  it is really no common satisfaction to me to reflect that my young friend is an eleve of such an instructress  there is a time and circumstance of life and that period and circumstance are now yours when nothing but the easy society and little tender friendships of an accomplished woman are wanting to render a character complete  and without saying a word more than i think on the business  i cannot but express my satisfaction that you are in such hands as will probably produce the very effects which so sincere a friend as myself can wish and desire  it has ever been a maxim with me since i knew any thing of the world that we are all of us as much in want of a schoolmistress at the finish as we do at the commencement of our education and as you are so fortunate as to have lady  to teach you the hornbook of high life you will bid fair to spell it and put it together so as to become the charm of all society  and you will lose what i so much wish you to lose the attention to one and the neglect of the many which though there may be something amiable in the principle is not adapted to the general intercourse of life  lady m  f  might forward business and lady c  i am sure is ready to do it  so that in such a soil in such a season and with such cultivations what has not partial friendship a right to expect and now what can i do better than leave you in such good and excellent company and desire you in return to present my respectful compliments to them all  and to receive yourself the most cordial regard of  your very sincere and affectionate l stern  letter xviii to   coxwould wednesday noon i understand from mr phipps the late lord mulgrave that you are absolutely engaged to pass the summer or rather the autumn with him at mulgravehall so that i now consider a previous visit to me as a matter on which i may depend and to which believe me i look with real satisfaction we will while away a month or six weeks at my vicarage in a manner which i trust will not be unpleasing or unprofitable to you  however in saying this or rather writing it i address myself to the excellence of your heart which i cannot enough admire and that cultivated understanding of which i have the greatest hopes  i know the pleasures you will quit and the societies you must sacrifice to come and pass any part of the summer with me but at the same time i do not doubt of your visit  and that a shande an tete a tete has its charms for you  i remember a circumstance which i shall never think of without the utmost pride in my own heart and the most sincere affection for yours  but besides that it flattered me in the highest degree it proved that you possessed a source of sentiment which whatever may befall you in life must preserve you in honor and happiness  with such a delicious quality misfortune will never be able to bear you down nor will folly passion or even vice though they may for a time obscure or lessen the excellence of your character possess the power of destroying it  i allude to a little delicate touch of sentiment that escaped you last winter  which though i have mentioned it with every possible eulogium to others again and again i have never before hinted it even to you the moment however is now come when my spirit urges me to speak of it and i do it with those dispositions which are congenial to the subject and i trust natural to myself  you cannot absolutely have forgotten an evening visit which you paid me last january in bond street when i was ill in bed  nor ought it to escape your occasional reflection that you sat by my bedside the whole night performing every act of the most friendly and pious attention  i then thought that the scarecrow death was at my heels  nay i thought the villain had got me by the throat  and i told you as much  however it pleased heaven that i should not be snatched from the world at that moment though i spoke my own honest opinion when i vaticinated my destiny by expressing little hopes of getting to the winters end  i believe my dear friend said i that i shall soon be off  i hope not you replied with a squeeze of my hand and a sigh of your heart which went to the very bottom of mine  but  you were pleased to add lest that should be the case i hope you will do me the favor to let me be always with you that i may have every atom of advantage and comfort your society may afford me while heaven permits it to last   i spoke no reply for i could not  but my heart made one then and will continue to do so  till it is become a clod of the valley  hence it is that i do not doubt but you will quit the ring of pleasure without regret to come and sit with me beneath my honeysuckle which is now flaunting like a ranelagh beauty and accompany me in paying my nuns their pensive evening visit  we can go to vespers with them and return home to our curds and cream with more delicious sentiments than all the pleasures of the world and the beauties thereof in their vainest moments can truly afford  i am busy about another couple of volumes to amuse and as i hope to instruct a gouty and a splenetic world  in which i solemnly declare i have no ambition to remain but for the love i bear to such friends as you and perhaps the vanity which i am vain enough not to call an idle one of adding a few more leaves to the wreath which i have been able to weave for my own little glory  come then and let me read the pages to you as they fall from my pen and be a mentor to tristram as you have been to yorick  at all events  i am sure you cannot come to york without coming to me and i shall triumph completely over lady lepel etc if i draw you for a month from the bright center to which you are so naturally attracted so god bless you  and believe me with all sincerity to be  most affectionately yours l stern  letter xix to   bishopthorp thursday night i saw the charming mrs vesey but for a moment and she contrived with her voice and her thousand other graces to dis  order me and what she will have to answer for on the occasion i shall not employ my casuistry to determine  nor shall i ask my good friend the archbishop from whose house and amidst whose kindness and hospitality i address this to you  i envy however your saunter together round an empty ranelagh though i should have liked it the better because it was empty and would give the imagination and every delicious feeling opportunity to make one forget there was another being in the room  but ourselves  you will i am sure more than understand me when i mention that sense of female perfection  i mean however when the female is sitting or walking beside you  which so possesses the mind that the whole globe seems to be occupied by none but two  when your hearts in perfect unison or i should rather say harmony with each other produce the same chords  and blossom with the same flowers of thought and sentiment  these hours  which virtuous tender minds have the power of separating from the melancholy seasons of life  make ample amends for the weight of cares and disappointments which the happiest of us are doomed to bear  they cast the brightest sunshine on the dreary landscape  and form a kind of refuge from the stormy wind and tempest  with such a companion is not the primrose bank and the cottage which humble virtue has raised on its side superior to all that splendor and wealth has formed in the palaces of monarchs  the scented heath is then the perfumed araby and though the nightingale should refuse to lodge among the branches of the poor solitary tree that overshadows us  if my fair minstrel did but pour forth the melting strain i would not look to the music of the spheres for ravishment  there is something my dear friend most wonderfully pleasant in the idea of getting away from the world  and though i have ever found it a great comfort yet i have been more vain of the business when i have done it in the midst of the world  but this aberration from the crowd while you are surrounded and pressed by it is only to be accomplished by the magic of female perfection  friendship with all its powers  mere friendship cannot do it  a more refined sentiment must employ its influence to wrap the heart in this delicious oblivion  it is too pleasing to last long  for envious sleepless care is ever on the watch to awake us from the bewitching trance  you my friend possess something of the reality of it and i while i enjoy your happiness apply to fancy for the purpose of creating a copy of it  so i sit myself down upon the turf and place a lovely fair one by my side  as lovely if possible as mrs v  and having plucked a sprig of blossoms from the maybush i place it in her bosom and then address some tender tale to her heart  and if she weeps at my story i take the white handkerchief she holds in her hand and wipe the tears from off her cheek and then i dry my own with it  and thus the delightful vision gives wing to a lazy hour calms my spirits and composes me for my pillow  to wish that care may never plant a thorn upon yours would be an idle employment of votive regard  but that you may preserve the virtue which will blunt their points and continue to possess the feelings which will sometimes pluck them away is a wish not unworthy of that friendship with which  i am your most affectionate l stern ps lydia writes me word she has got a lover  poor dear girl     letter xx to   sunday evening do not imagine my dear boy  and do not suffer i beseech you any pedantic coldhearted fellow to persuade you  that sensibility is an evil you may take my word on this subject as you have been pleased to do on many others  that sensibility is one of the first blessings of life  as well as the brightest ornament of the human character  you do not explain matters to me which by the bye is not fair but i suppose from the tenor of your letter which is now beside me that you have been made a dupe of by some artful person  who i am disposed to think is some cunning baggage  and that under the impressions of this game that has been played you your vanity is alarmed and your understanding piqued and then you lay all this dire grievance in a very pettish manner let me tell you at the door of your sensibility and which is worse than all the rest you write to me as if you really believed yourself to be in earnest in all the seesaw observations you have written to me on the subject  be assured my dear friend if i thought the sentiments of your last letter were not the sentiments of a sickly moment  if i could be made to believe for an instant that they proceeded from you in a sober reflecting condition of your mind  i should give you over as incurable and banish all my hopes of your rising into that proud honor and brilliant reputation which i trust you will one day possess  i was almost going to write  and wherefore should i not  that there is an amiable kind of cullibility which is as superior to the slow precaution of worldly wisdom as the sound of abels viol di gamba to the braying of an ass on the other side of my paling  if i should at any time hear a man pique himself upon never having been a dupe  i should grievously suspect that such an one will some time or other give cause to be thought at best a meanspirited dirty rascal  you may think this a strange doctrine  but be that as it may  i am not ashamed to adopt it  what would you say of any character who had neither humanity generosity nor confidence  why you would say  i know you would  such a man is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils  and yet imposition  dupery  deception  call it by what name you will  attends upon these virtues like their shadow for virtue my dear friend like every other possession in this world though it is the most valuable of all  is of a mixed nature and the very inconveniences of it if they deserve that name form the basis on which its importance and natural excellence is established  sensibility is oftentimes betrayed into a foolish thing  but its folly is amiable and some one or other is the better for it i am not for its excesses  or a blind submission to its impulse which produces them  yet some how or other i should be strongly disposed to hug the being who would take the rag off his back  to place it on the shivering wretch who had naught to cover him  discretion is a cold quality  but i have no objection to the possessing as much of it  as will direct your finer feelings to their proper objects  but here let its office finish if it proceeds a step further there may be mischief  it may cool that currrent which is the lifeblood of all virtue and will i trust warm your heart till it is become a clod of the valley  sensibility is the source of those delicious feelings which give a brighter color to our joys and turn our tears to rapture  though it may now and then lead us into a serape as we pass through life  you may be assured my dear friend it will get us out of them all at the end of it  and that is a matter which wiser men than myself will tell you is well worth thinking about  so leaving you to your contemplations  and wishing them and every thing you do an happy issue  i remain with great truth  your affectionate l stern  letter xxi to   bond street thursday morning so my dear friend you are pleased to be very angry with the reviewers  so am not i  but as your displeasure proceeds from your regard for me  i thank you as i ought to do  again and again  i really do not know to whom i am personally indebted for so much obliging illiberality  nor can i tell whether it is the society at large or a splenetic individual to whom i am to acknowledge my obligation  i have never enquired who it is or who they are  and if i knew him or them  what would it signify  and wherefore should i give their names immortality in my writings which they will never find in their own  let the asses bray as they like  i shall treat their worships as they deserve in my own way and manner  and in a way and manner that they will like less than any other  there is a certain race of people who are ever aiming to treat their betters in some scurvy way or other  but it has ever been a practice with me not to mind a little dirt thrown upon my coat  so that i keep my lining unrumpled  and so much for that envy ignorance and ill nature for which what i have written is far too much  i am rejoiced however for twenty good reasons which i will tell you hereafter that london lies in your way between oxforshire and suffolk and one of them i will tell you now  which is that you can be of very great service to me so i would desire you to prepare yourself to do me a kindness if i did not know that you are always in such a state of preparation  the town is so empty that though i have been in it full four and twenty hours i have seen only three people i know  foot on the stage  sir charles davers at st jamess coffeehouse and williams who was an hasty bird of passage on his flight to brigthelmstone where i am told he is making love in right earnest to a very fine woman and with all the success his friends can wish him our races at york were every thing we could desire them to be in the ballroom and every thing we did not desire them to be on the ground the rain said nay with a vengeance to the sports of the course for all the waterspouts of the heavens seemed to be let loose upon it however in the amusements under cover we were all as merry as heart could wish i had promised a certain person that you should be there and was obliged to parry a score or two of reproaches on your account  but though i forgot to tell it you before i am by no means well and if i do not get away from this climate before winter sets in i shall never see another spring in this world and it is to forward my journey to the south that i request you to make haste to me from the west  alas alas my friend i begin to feel that i lose strength in these annual struggles and encounters with that miserable scarecrow who knows as well as i do that do what i can he will finally get the better of me and all of us indeed he has already beat the vizard from my helmet and the point of my spear is not as it was wont to be but while it pleases heaven to grant me life it will i trust grant me spirits to bear up against the sawey circumstances of it and preserve to my last separating sigh that sensibility to whatever is kind and gracious which when once it possesses the heart makes i trust ample amends for a large portion of human error  you may indeed believe that while i am sensible of any thing i shall be sensible of your friendship and i have every reason to think that should my term be drawing nigh to its period you will continue to love me while i live and when i am no more to cherish the memory of  your ever faithful and affectionate l stern  letter xxii to   sunday morning if you wish to have the representation of my spare meagreform  which by the bye is not worth the canvas it must be painted on  you shall be most welcome to it and i am happy in the reflection that when my bones shall be laid low there may be any resemblance of me which may recall my image to your friendly and sympathizing recollection  but you must mention the business to reynolds yourself for i will tell you why i cannot he has already painted a very excellent portrait of me which when i went to pay him for he desired me to accept as a tribute to use his own elegant and flattering expression that his heart wished to pay to my genius that mans way of thinking and manners are at least equal to his pencil  you see therefore the delicacy of my situation as well as the necessity if the genius of reynolds is to be employed in the business of your taking it entirely upon yourself or if your friendly impatience which you express with so much kindness will let you wait till we make our tour to bath your favorite gainshorough may do the deed  or why not your little friend cosway who is rising fast into fame and fortune but be it as you please and arrange it according to your own fancy  at all events i shall treat myself when i get to rome with my own busto if nollikens does not make a demand for it that may be inconsistent with my exchequer the statuary decorations of my grandfather the archbishops monument in the cathedral at york which you admire so much have given birth i believe to this whim of mine and this piece of marble which my vanity  for let it be vanity if you please  destines for myself may be placed by the hand of friendship and by yours perhaps near my grave  and so much for that  but i was born for digressions and i therefore tell you at once not rashly or prematurely but with all due sobriety and reflection that lord  is of a low base pimping nature if he had been nothing but a fool i should have said  have mercy upon him but he has just understanding sufficient to make him answerable for what he does and not sufficient to perceive the superiority of what is great over what is little  if ever that man rises into a good or a noble action i would be bound to be considered as a retailer of scandal and an illnatured man as long as i live and as long as my memory lives but no more of him i beseech you  and the hour tells me to write no more of any thing for i must hasten where i ought to have been half an hour ago  so god bless you and believe me where ever i am to be  most cordially yours l stern  letter xxiii to   monday morning the story my dear friend which you heard related with such an air of authority is like many other true stories absolutely false mr hume and i never had a dispute  i mean a serious angry or petulant dispute in our lives  indeed i should be most exceedingly surprised to hear that david ever had an unpleasant contention with any man  and if i should be made to believe that such an event had happened nothing would persuade me that his opponent was not in the wrong for in my life did i never meet with a being of a more placid and gentle nature and it is this amiable turn of his character that has given more consequence and force to his skepticism than all the arguments of his sophistry  you may depend on this as a truth  we had i remember well a little pleasant sparring at lord hertfords table at paris but there was nothing in it that did not bear the marks of good will and urbanity on both sides  i had preached that very day at the ambassadors chapel and david was disposed to make a little merry with the parson and in return the parson was equally disposed to make a little mirth with the infidel we laughed at one another and the company laughed with us both  and whatever your informer might pretend he certainly was not one of that company  as for his other history that i preached an offensive sermon at the ambassadors chapel  it is equally founded in truth for lord hertford did me the honor to thank me for it again and again the text i will own was an unlucky one and that was all your informer could have heard to have justified his report  if he fell asleep immediately after i repeated it  i will forgive him  the fact was as follows  lord hertford had just taken and furnished a magnificent hotel and as every thing and any thing gives the fashion of the moment at paris it had been the fashion for every one to go to see the english ambassadors new hotel  it occupied the curiosity formed the amusement and gave a subject of conversation to the polite circles of paris for a fortnight at least  now it fell to my lot that is to say i was requested to preach the first day service was performed in the chapel of this new hotel  the message was brought me when i was playing a sober game of whist with the thornhills and whether it was that i was called rather abruptly from my afternoons amusement to prepare myself for this business for it was to be on the next day or from what other cause i do not pretend to determine but that unlucky kind of fit seized me which you know i can never resist and a very unlucky text did come into my head  and you will say so when you read it and hezekiah said unto the prophet i have shown them my vessels of gold and my vessels of silver and my wives and my concubines and my boxes of ointment and whatever i have in my house have i shown unto them and the prophet said unto hezekiah thou have done very foolishly  now as the text is a part of holy writ that could not give offense though wicked wits are sometimes disposed to illtreat it with their own scurvy misrepresentations  and as to the discourse itself nothing could be more innocent and david hume favored it with his grace and approbation  but here i am got i know not how writing about myself for whole pages together  whereas the only part of my letters that can justify my being an egotist is when i assure any gentle spirit or faithful friend as i now do you that i am her or his or your  most affectionate humble servant l stern  letter xxiv to   wednesday noon believe me my dear friend i have no great faith in doctors some eminent ones of the faculty assured me many years ago that if i continued to do as i was then doing i should not live three months now the fact is that i have been doing exactly what they told me i ought not to do for thirteen years together  and here i am as thin it is true but as saucy as ever and it will not be my fault if i do not continue to give them the lie for another period of equal duration  it is lord bacon i think who observes  at least be it who it may that made the observation it is not unworthy the great man whose name i have just written  that physicians are old women who sit by your bedside till they kill you or nature cures you  there is an uncertainty in the business that often baffles experience and renders genius abortive  though i mean not believe me to be severe on a science which is sometimes made the means of doing good nay the science itself considered naturally and physically is the eye of all the rest but i do not always hold my peace when i reflect on those selfconceited upstart professors of it who fly and bounce and give themselves airs if you do not read the directions upon the label of a phial which contains the matter of their prescriptions with as much reverence as if it had been penned by st luke himself  goddess of health  let me drink thy healing and sustaining beverage at the pure fountain which flows at thy command give me to breathe the balmy air and to feel the enlivening sun  and so i will  for if i do not see you in fifteen days i will on the sixteenth step quickly into the dover coach and proceed without you to the banks of the rhone where you may follow me if you please  and if you do not the difference between us will be  that while you are passing your christmas day in fencing against fogs by warm clothes and large fires i shall be sitting on the grass courting no warmth but the allcheering one which proceeds from the grand luminary of nature  so think on these things i beseech you  and let me know about it for i will not remain gasping another month in london even for your sake  or for your company which  i might add would be for my own sake  in the mean time and at all times may god bless you  i am most cordially yours l stern  letter xxv to   wednesday noon i am always getting into a scrape not from a carelessness of offending as some goodhumoured people have suspected for i do not wish to give offense but from the want of being understood  pope has well expressed the hardship of being forced  to trudge without a second and without a judge   i think the quotation is correct  indeed a man may proceed well enough without a second genius is oftentimes so far from wanting such an assistant that it is frequently clogged by it  but to be without a judge is a mortification which comes home with much severity to the bosoms of those who feel or fancy which is pretty near the same thing that judgment  i mean impartial adequate judgment would be their reward  to be eternally misunderstood and which naturally follows to be eternally misrepresented by ignorance is far far worse than to be slandered by malice  calumny is more than oftentimes for it is almost always the sacrifice which vice pays to virtue and folly offers up to wisdom  a wise man while he pities the efforts of slander will feel a kind of consequence from the exertion of them  like the philosopher who is said to have raised a monument to his own fame with the stones which the malignity of his competitors had thrown at him  the divorce between virtue and reputation is too common to be wondered at  though it is too unjust not to be lamented but that being a circumstance which connects itself with something like the general order of providence we are able to console ourselves under it by hope and resignation but in the little and comparatively speaking the petty business of human fame  the mind may be justified in kicking at the perversions to which its honest and best endeavors are so continually subject  i do most sincerly assure you that i have seldom been so proud of myself and the little display of my talents  whatever they may be  as i was in the very circumstance which has given so much uneasiness i intended no severity  i was all complacency and good humor  my spirits were in unison with every generous and gracious thought  and so far was i from possessing the idea of giving offense  and to a lady  that there never was a moment of my life perhaps when i was so disposed to buckle on my armor and mount my rosinante to go and fight the cause of injured or captive beauty  but instead of all this here am i considered as the very monster whom i myself was ready to combat and to destroy  you will therefore be so good as to communicate these thoughts in as much better a manner as you please to mrs h  and assure her that she has only done what so many have done before her  that is she has misconceived or as that word may produce a misconception  she has misunderstood me  so far i am most willing to travel in the highway of apology and if she is disposed to smile i will receive her returning favor with all due acknowledgments but if she should think it clever or witty or consequential to continue to be offended  i will not fail to remember her in a postscript to my chapter on the right and wrong end of a woman which though my uncle toby from a certain combination of circumstances could never be made to understand i will explain to the world in such a manner that they who run may read  i am not however unintelligible to all there are some spirits who want no key either to my speech or my writings and they  i mean the spirits  are of the first order this is some comfort and that comfort increases both in its weight and measure on the reflection that you are one of them  but my paper and postmans bell both warn me to do  what i ought to have done at least a page ago  and that is to write adieu so adieu and god bless you  i am most cordially yours l stern  letter xxvi to   thursday nov   were i a minister of state  instead of being a countryparson  or rather though i do not know that it is the better thing of the two  were i king of a country not like sanchopancha without a will of my own but with all the rights privileges and immunities belonging to such a situation i would not suffer a man of genius to be pulled to pieces or pulled down or even whistled at by any man who had not some sort of genius of his own  that is to say i would not suffer blockheads of any denomination to show their heads in my territories  what  will you say  is there no saving clause for the ignorant and the unlettered  no spot set apart for those on whom science has not beamed or the current of whose genius poverty has frozen  my dear friend you do not quite understand me  and i beg of you not to suppose  that all men are blockheads who are not learned  and that no man who is learned can be a blockhead  my definitions are not borrowed from the common room of a college or the dull muzzing pericranium of a wordmongering dictionary maker but from the book of nature the volume of the world and the pandects of experience there i find a blockhead to be a man for i am not at present in a humor to involve the poor women in the definition who thinks he has what in fact he has not  and who does not know how to make a right use of that which he has  it is the mode of applying means to ends that marks the character of superior understanding  the poor scarecrow of a beast that yorick rode so long and to the last being once set in the right road will sooner get to the end of his journey than the fleetest racehorse of newmarket who has taken an opposite direction  wisdom very often cannot read or write and folly will often quote you passages from all the dead and half the living languages i beg therefore you will not sorm a bad  that is to say a false idea of this kingdom of mine  for whenever i get it you may be sure of being well appointed and living at your ease as every one must do there who lives to his honor  but to the point  to the point did i say  alas there is so much zigzag in my destiny that it is impossible for me to keep going on strait through one poor letter  and that to a friend but so it is  for here is a visitor arrived to whom i cannot say nay  and who obliges me to write adieu a page or two or three perhaps before i intended to do it i must therefore fold up my paper as it is  and shall only add god bless you  which however is the constant and sincerest wish of  your affectionate l stern  letter xxvii to   dijon nov        my dear friend i recommend it to you  not perhaps above all things but very assuredly above most things  to stick to your own understanding a little more than you do for believe me an ounce of it will answer your purpose better than a pound weight of other peoples there is a certain timidity which renders early life amiable as a matter of speculation but is very inconvenient indeed not to say dangerous according to the present humor of the world in matters of practice  there is a manly confidence which as it springs from a consciousness of possessing certain excellent qualities and valuable seize we cannot have too early and there is no more impropriety in offering manifestations of it to the world than the putting on your helmet in the day of battle we want it as a protection  i say as a protection from the insults and injuries of others for in your particular circumstances i consider it merely as a defensive quality  to prevent you from being run down or run over by the first ignorant blockhead or insolent coxcomb who perceives your modesty to be a restraint on your spirit  but this by the way  the application of it is left to your own discernment and good sense of which i shall not write what i think and what some others think whose testimony will wear well  i am so much better pleased since i set my foot on the continent that it would do you good to see  and more good still to hear me for i have recovered my voice in this genial climate and so far am i now from finding a difficulty to make myself heard across the table that i am almost fit to preach in a cathedral  here they are all hey  go  mad  the vintage has been abundant and is now at the close every eye beams delight and every voice is attuned to joy  though i am running away as fast as i can well go and am withal so pressed by the rascal death that i ought not in prudence to take time to look behind me yet cannot i resist the temptation of getting out of my chaise and sitting for a whole evening on a bank to see those happy people dance away the labors of the day and thus they contrive for two or three hours at least out of the four and twenty to forget god bless em that there are such things as labor and care in the world  this innocent oblivion of sorrow is one of the happiest arts of life and philosophy in all its storehouse of human remedies has nothing like unto it indeed i am persuaded that mirth  a sober well regulated mirth  is perfectly acceptable to the kind being that made us  and that a man may laugh and sing and dance too  and after all go to heaven  i never could  and i never can  nay i positively never will believe that we were sent into this world to go sorrowing through it on the contrary every object around me  the rural dance and the rustic minstrelsy that i behold and hear from my window tell me that man is framed for joy nor shall any crackbrained carthusian monk  or all the carthusian monks in the world  persuade me to the contrary  swist says vive la bagatelle i say vive la joie which i am sure is no bagatelle but as i take it a very serious thing and the first of human possessions  may your treasury my dear friend continue to have good store in it  and like the widows cruse may it fail not  at lions i expect to find some tidings of you and from thence i will dispatch some further tidings of myself  so in the mean time and at all times may god bless you  believe me  i shall ever remain most truly and affectionately yours l stern  letter xxviii to   lions nov    i have traveled hither most deliciously  though i have made my journey in a desoblegeant and of course alone but when the heart is at rest and the mind is in harmony with itself and every subordinate feeling is well attuned not an object offers itself to the attention but may be made to produce pleasure  besides such is the character of this happy people that you see a smile on every countenance and hear the notes of joy from every tongue  there is an old woman at this moment playing on the viol before my window and a groupe of young people are dancing to it with more appearance and i believe more reality of pleasure than all your brilliant assemblies at almacks can boast  i love my country as well as any of her children  and i know the solid characteristic virtues of its people  but they do not play the game of happiness with that attention or success which is practiced and obtained here  i shall not enter into the physical or moral difference between the two nations  but i cannot however help observing that while the french possess a gaity of heart that always weakens and sometimes baffles sorrow the english still answer the description of the old frenchman and really continue to divert themselves moult tristement  nay how often have i seen at a york assembly two young people dance down thirty couple with as grave countenances as if they did it for hire and were after all not sure of being paid and here have i beheld the sunburned sons and daughters of labor rise from their scanty meal with not a pulse in their hearts that did not beat to pleasure  and with the brightest looks of satisfaction make their wooden shoes responsive to the sound of a brokenwinded hautboy  all the world shall never persuade me there is not a providence and a gracious one too which governs it with every blessing under the sun we look grave and reason ourselves into dissatissaction while here  with scarce any blessing but the sun  on est content de son etat  but the kind being who made us all gives to each the portion of happiness according to his wise and good pleasure for no one  and nothing is beneath his allprovidential care  he even tempers the wind to the shorn lamb  by such reflections and under such influences i am perverted from my purpose for when i drew my chair to the table and dipped my pen into the inkhorn i breathed nothing but complaint and it was my sole design to tell you so  for i have sent  a la post restante again and again and there is no letter from you but though i am impatience itself to continue my journey toward the alps and cannot possibly indulge my curious spirit till i hear from you yet such is the effect of my sympathetic nature that i have caught all the ease and good humor of the people about me and seem to be sitting here in my black coat and yellow slippers as contented as if i had not another step to take and god knows i have a pretty circuit to make my friend before i may embrace you again  it is not as you well know my practice to icratch out any thing i write or i would erase the last dozen lines as the very moment i had concluded them your letter and two others arrived and brought me every thing i could wish  i would really linger if i thought you would overtake me at all events we shall meet at rome  at rome  and i shall now take the wings of tomorrow morning to forward my progress thither  i sincerely hope this paper may be thrown away upon you  that is i wish you may be come away before it has made its passage to england  at all events my dear boy we shall meet at rome so till then  fare thee well  there and every where  i shall be  your most faithful and affectionate ls l stern  letter xxix to   bond street i have a great mind to have done with joking laughing and merrymaking for the rest of my days with either man woman or child and set up for a grave formal seesaw character and dispense stupid wisdom as i have hitherto been said to have done sensible nonsense to my countrymen and countrywomen  to tell you the truth  i began this letter yesterday morning and was interrupted in getting to the end of it by half a dozen idle people who called upon me to lounge and to laugh though one of them forced me home with him to dine with his sister whom i found to be a being of a superior order and who has absolutely made the something like a resolution with which i began this letter not worth the feather of the quill with which it was written  she is in good faith charming beyond my powers of description and we had such an evening as made the cup of tea she gave me more delicious than nectar  by the bye she wishes very much to become acquainted with you  not believe me from any representations or biography of mine but from the warm encomiums she has received of you from others and those as she says of the first order after all this however you may be sure that my testimony was not wanting  so that when you will give an opportunity i shall have the honor of presenting you to kiss her hand and add another devout worshipper at the temple of such transcendant merit  i am really of opinion that if there is a woman in the world formed to do you good and to make you love her into the bargain  which i believe is the only way of doing you any good  this is the preeminent and bewitching character  indeed were you to command my seeble powers to deliniate the lovely being whose affections would well repay thee for all the heartachs and disquieting apprehensions that may and will afflict thee in thy passage through life it would be this fair and excellent creature my knight errant spirit has already told her that she is a dulcinea to me  but i would most willingly take off my armor and break my spear and resign her as an angel to you  i need not say any thing i trust of my affection for you and i have just now some singular ideas on your subject which kept me awake last night when i ought to have been found asleep  but i shall reserve them for the communication of my fireside or yours as it may be and i wish as devoutly as ever i wished any thing in my life that my fire was to brighten before you this very evening  in the name of fortune  for want of a better at the moment  what business have you to be fifty leagues from the capital at a time when i stand so much in need of you for your own sake  i hear you exclaim  whom is all this about  and i see you half determined to throw my letter into the fire because you cannot find her name in it this is all my good friend as it ought to be  for you may be assured that i never intended to write her name on this sheet of paper i have told you of the divinity and you will find the rest inscribed on the altar  i was never more serious in my life so let the wheels of your chariot roll as rapidly as posthorses can make them toward this town where if you come not soon i shall be gone and then i know not what may become of all my present good intentions toward you  future ones it is true i shall have in plenty  for at all events in all circumstances and every where  i am most cordially and affectionately yours l stern  letter xxx to   friday these may be piping times to you my dear friend and i rejoice at it  but they are not dancing ones to me  you will perceive by the manner in which this letter is written that if i dance  holbeins piper must be the fiddler  since i wrote to you last i have burst another vessel of my lungs and lost blood enough to pull down a very strong man what it has done then with my meagre form clad as it is with infirmities may be better imagined than described  indeed it is with difficulty and some intervals of repose that i can trail on my pen and if it were not for the anxious forwardness of my spirits which aids me for a few minutes by their precious mechanism i should not be able to thank you at all  i know i cannot thank you as i ought for your four letters which have remained so long unanswered and particularly for the last of them  i really thought my good friend that i should have seen you no more the grim scarecrow seemed to have taken post at the foot of my bed and i had not strength to laugh him off as i had hitherto done  so i bowed my head in patience without the least expectation of moving it again from my pillow  but somehow or other he has i believe changed his purpose for the present  and we shall i trust embrace once again i can only add that while i live i shall be  most affectionately yours l stern  letter xxxi to   bondstreet may   i felt the full force of an honest heartach on reading your last letter  the story it contains may be placed among the most affecting relations of human calamity and the happiest efforts of human benevolence i happened to have it in my pocket yesterday morning when i breakfasted with mrs m  and for want of something so good of my own i read the whole of your letter to her  but this is not all for what is more to the purpose that is to the purpose of your honor she desired to read it herself and then she entreated me not to delay the earliest opportunity to present you to her breakfasttable and the mistress of it to you i told her of the awkward distance of an hundred miles at least that lay between us but i promised and vowed  for i was obliged to do both  that the moment i could lay hold of your arm i would lead you to her vestibule  i really begin to think i shall get some credit by you  love i most readily acknowledge is subject to violent paroxysms as well as slow fevers but there is so much pleasure attendant upon the passion in general and so many amiable sympathies are connected with it nay  it is sometimes so suddenly and oftentimes so easily cured that i cannot for the life of me pity its disasters with the same tone of commiseration which accompanies my consolatory visits to other less oftensible sources of distress  in the last sad separation of friends hope comforts us with the prospect of an eternal reunion and religion encourages the belief of it  but in the melancholy history which you relate i behold what has always appeared to me to be the most affecting sight in the gloomy region of human misfortune i mean the pale countenance of one who has seen better days and sinks under the despair of seeing them return the mind that is bowed down by unmerited calamity and knows not from what point of the compass to expect any good is in a state over which the angel of pity sheds all his showers  unable to dig and to beg ashamed  what a description  what an object for relief  and how great the rapture to relieve it  i do not my dear boy  indeed i do not  envy your feelings for i trust that i share them but if it were possible for me to envy you any thing that does you so much honor and makes me love you if possible so much better than i did before  it is the little fabric of comfort and happiness which you have erected in the depths of misery the whole may occupy perhaps but little space in this world  but like the mustard seed it will grow up and rear its head toward that heaven to which the spirit that planted it will finally conduct you  robinson called upon me yesterday to take me to dinner in berkeleysquare  and while i was arranging my drapery i gave him your letter to read he felt it as he ought and not only desired me to say every handsome thing on his part to you but he said a great many handsome things of you himself during dinner and after it and drank your health nay as his wine warmed him he talked loud and threatened to drink water  like you  the rest of his days  but while i am relating so many fine things to flatter your vanity let me i beseech you mention something to flatter my own  and this is neither more or less than a very elegant silver standish with a motto engraved upon it which has been sent me by lord spencer this mark of that noblemans good disposition toward me was displayed in a manner which enhanced the value of the gift and heightened my sense of the obligation i could not thank him for it as i ought but i wrote my acknowledgements as well as i could and promised his lordship that as it was a piece of plate the shandy family would value the most it should certainly be the last they will part with  i had another little business to communicate to you but the postmans bell warns me to write adieu  so god bless you and preserve you as you are  and this wish by the bye is saying no small matter in your favor but it is addressed for and to you with the same truth that guides my pen in assuring you that i am most sincerely and cordially your faithful friend  l stern  letter xxxii to   bond street there is a certain pliability of the affections my dear friend which with all its inconveniences  and i will acknowledge a thousand  forms a wonderful charm in the human character  to become a dupe to others who are almost always worse and very often more ignorant than yourself is not only mortifying to ones pride but frequently destructive to ones fortune nevertheless there is something in the very face and which is worse in the mind of suspicion of such a detestable complexion and character that i could never bear it and whenever i have observed mistrust in the heart i would never rap at the door of it even to pay if i could help it a morning visit much less to take my lodging there  niger est hune tu roman caveto this sort of cullibility most certainly lays you open to the designs of knaves and rascals and they are alas to be found in the hedges and highway sides and will come in without the trouble of sending for them  the happy mean between mad goodnature and mean selflove is of difficult attainment though mr pope says  that lord bathurst possessed it in an eminent degree  and i believe it indeed it is for my honor that i should believe it as i have received much kindness and many generous attentions from that venerable and excellent nobleman  as i never possessed this happy quality myself i can only recommend it to you without offering any instructions on a duty of which i cannot offer myself as an example  this is not altogether clerical  i mean as clergymen do  but no matter  b  is exactly one of these harmless inoffensive people who never frets or fumes but bears all his losses with a most christian patience and settles the account in this manner  that he had rather lose any thing than that benevolence of disposition which forms the happiness of his life but how will all this end  for you know as i know that when once you have won his good opinion you may impose upon him ten times a day  if nine did not suit your purpose the real friends of virtue of honor and what is best in the human character should form a phalanx round such a man and preserve him from the harpy plottings of sharpers and villains  but there is another species of cullibility that i never can be brought to pity which arises from the continual aim to make culls of others it is not that gentle confidential unsuspicious spirit which i have already hinted to you but an overweening wicked insidious disposition which by being continually engaged in the miserable business of deceiving others either outwits itself or is outwitted by the very objects of its own fallacious intentions  there is not believe me a more straight way to the being a dupe yourself than the resting your hopes or pleasure in making dupes of others  cunning is not an honorable qualification it is a kind of left handed wisdom which even fools can sometimes practice and villains always make the foundation of their designs  but alas how often does it betray its votaries to their dishonor if not to their destruction  though an occasional stratagem may be sometimes innocent i am ever disposed to suspect the cause where it must be employed for after all you will i am sure agree with me that where artifice is not to be condemned as a crime the necessity which demands it must be considered as a misfortune  i have been led to write thus socratically from the tenor of your letter though if my paper would allow me i would take a frisk and vary the scene but i have only room to add that i dined in brookstreet last sunday where many gracious things were said of you not only by the old folks but which is better by the young virgins i went afterward not much to my credit to argyle buildings but there were no virgins there so may god forgive me and bless you  now and at all times  amen  i remain most truly and cordially yours l stern  letter xxxiii to   coxwould august         among your whimsicalities my dear friend for you have them as well as tristram  there is not one of them which possesses a more amiable tendency than that gentle spirit of modern romance which had thou lived in days of yore would have made thee the veriest knight errant that ever brandished a spear or wore a vizard  the very same spirit that has led thee from hence to the bristol fountain for no other earthly purpose but to let a phthysical maiden lean upon thine arm and receive the healing waters from thine hand would in a former age have urged thee to traverse forests and fight with monsters for the sake of some dulcinea whom thou had never seen or perhaps have made a redcrossknight of thee and carried thee over lands and seas to palestine   for to tell thee the truth enthusiasm is in the very soul of thee  if thou were born to live in some other planet i might encourage all its glowing highcolored vulgarities  but in this miserable backbiting cheating pimping world of ours it will not do  indeed indeed it will not  and full well do i know nor does this vaticination escape me without a sigh that it will lead thee into a thousand scrapes  and some of them may be such as thou will not easily get out of  and should the fortunes of thine house be shaken by any of them  with all thy pleasant enjoyments  what then you may say nay i think i hear you say so  why thy friends will then lose thee  for if foul fortune should take thy stately palfrey with all its gay and gilded trappings from beneath thee or if while thou art sleeping by moonlight beneath a tree  it should escape from thee and find another master  or if the miserable banditti of the world should plunder thee  i know full well that we should see thee no more  for thou would then find out some distant cell and become an hermit and endeavor to persuade thyself not to regret the separation from those friends who will ever regret their separation from thee  this enthusiastic spirit is in itself a good spirit  but there is no spirit whatever  no not a termagant spirit that requires a more active restraint or a more discreet regulation  and so we will go next spring if you please to the fountain of vauclusa and think of petrarch and which is better apostrophise his laura  by that time i have reason to think my wife will be there who by the bye is not laura  but my poor dear lydia will be with her and she is more than a laura to her fond father  answer me on these things and may god bless you   i remain with the most cordial truth your affectionate l stern  letter xxxiv to   sunday evening there is a certain kind of offense which a man may  nay which he ought to forgive  but such is the jealous honor of the world that there is a sort of injury commonly called an affront which if it proceeds from a certain line of character must be revenged  but let me entreat thee to remember that hardness of heart is not worth thine anger and would disgrace thy vengeance  to turn upon a man who possesses it would not like saint paul be kicking against the pricks  but which is far worse against a flint  thou did right therefore my dear boy  in letting the matter pass as thou have done  as far as my observation has reached and the circle of it is by no means a narrow one  an hard heart is always a cowardly heart  generosity and courage are associate virtues and the character which possesses the former must in the nature of mental arrangements be adorned with the latter  if i perceive a man to be capable of doing a mean action  if i see him imperious and tyrannical if he takes advantage of the weak to oppress or of the poor to grind or of the downcast to insult  or is continually on the hunt after excuses not to do what he ought  i determine such a man though he may have fought fifty duels to be a coward  it is by no means a proof that a man is brave because he does not refuse to fight  for we all know that cowards have fought nay  that cowards have conquered  but a coward never performed a generous or a noble action  and thou have my authority to say  and thou might find a worse that a hardhearted character never was a brave one i say thou may justly call such a man a coward  and if he should be spirited into a resentment of thy words  fear him not  tristram shall brighten his armor and scour the rust from off his spear and aid thee in the combat  and now let me ask thee my good friend how it happens that thy fancy has of late taken to the dormitory  i thought the very names of petrarch and laura and the enchanting scene of vauclusas fountain which is such a classical spot to all tender minds must have inspired thee with a flow of sentiment that would have meandered through every page of thy last letter  but instead of it here have i been saluted with a string of stiff starched notions of honor and god knows what  that you could have found no where but in conversing with the young lords in great periwigs  and the old ladies in bouncing fardingals  who have so long inhabited  s long long gallery  however when you are tired of such company and stalking about upon a matted floor you may come here and contemplate the autumn leaf and relax yourself with looking at me while i prepare another volume or two to lessen the spleen of a splenetic world  for with all its faults i am willing to do it that good at least  if it will let me  and if it will not  i shall leave you to pity it so fare thee well  and god bless you  i remain thine most affectionate l stern  letter xxxv to lady c  h  saturday noon here am i now actually at my writing table  shall i divulge the secret  in something between the fortieth and fortyfifth year of my life  i shall leave your ladyship if you please to imagine all the rest  and in this advancing state of my age am i to address myself to all those charms which are composed by the happiest combination of youth and beauty   but if you should consider this as a presumption i will quit those beauties which belong only to early life and make my application to qualities which are of every period and possess that lengthened charm which makes one overlook the wrinkles of age and turns the hoary hair into auburn tresses that you will always possess the one as you now do the other i have heard acknowledged wherever i have heard your name mentioned nor do i remember that your praise was ever accompanied with the exception of a single but  from any of the many various forms and shapes which envy plants in every corner to snarl at excellence  but while your ladyship by a kind of miraculous power can subdue envy with respect to yourself  you many sometimes without meaning it encourage its attacks upon others  for my part nothing can be more certain than that i shall be envied with a vengeance when it is known with what a gracious condescension you have indulged my request but envy on such an occasion will add to my laurels instead of withering them  it is like the scar of glory and i am as proud of the one as the patriot hero has reason to be of the other  to confine myself however to the purpose of this paper  permit me to thank your ladyship most cordially for permiting me to solicit the honor of your protection  as for attempting to thank you for having granted it that is not in my power both my pen and my lips find it impossible to obey the impulse of my heart on the occasion  perhaps the time may come when some of the shandy family may possess a sufficient eloquence to offer you that homage which is very devoutly felt but cannot be adequately expressed  indeed it cannot by  your ladyships most faithful and obedient humble servant l stern  letter xxxvi to   wednesday  past   at night  and not very well that woman is a timid animal i am most ready my dear friend to acknowledge  but like other timid animals is more dangerous in certain situations than those who possess a greater degree of natural courage  i would therefore counse thee for this among a thousand other reasons never to make a woman thine enemy if thou can possibly help it  not that i suspect thee to be capible of an uncourteous act to any of the lovelier sex  on the contrary i think thee qualified and disposed too beyond most men i ever knew to charm them and do them good and it is perhaps on that as much as any other account that i warn thee against giving them offense  for i have more than once observed and mentioned with some concern a propensity in thy character to collect thy warm affections in one particular circle and to be careless of which as it relates to women is the same thing as to be ungracious to those who are not included in it  there is something amiable  nay there may be something noble in the principle of such a conduct but it is too refined for a world like ours in which short as life is we may easily live long enough to find the inconvenience and distress of it he who attaches himself entirely to one object  or even to a few  may from ingratitude caprice or death be soon left alone and he will come with an illgrace when necessity compels him to seek for kindness and society where he formerly appeared to disdain both  if a small cohort of friends could be certain of continuing together till they all sunk into one common grave your present theory might form not only a gallant and a pleasant but a practicable system this however my dear fellow cannot be and as for living alone when all our friends are gone it is neither more or less than making life a living tomb which in my mind is far  far worse than a dead one  but to return to my subject  woman is a timid animal  and therefore i trust and am sure thy generous nature laying aside every other consideration will never do any thing designedly to distress it  indeed it does not appear to me that there can be a possible situation which will justify any kind of inattention to the sex that may give them pain  for be assured and i will rest my experience of woman kind of which i am not a little proud on the opinion that the passion for any individual of the sex whatever her perfections may be which makes thee relax in thy gracious behavior to the rest will never promote thy real happiness  it may afford thee a certain season though i believe a very short one of tumultuous rapture and then thou will awake from thy delirium to all the grievances of a fretful spirit  women look at least for attentions  they consider them as an inherent birthright given to their sex by the laws of polished society and when they are deprived of them they most certainly have a right to complain  and will be one and all disposed to practice that revenge which is not by any means to be treated with contempt it would be very unpleasant for me to hear in any female society that my friend was a strange eccentric singular unpleasant character  and i rather think that he himself would not be pleased to find that such a description was given and believed of him  i do not mean to urge  indeed i well know you cannot suspect me of so gross an error  that the same regard is to be equally dealt to all this is far from being my system  but i affirm on the other hand  that all are not to be disregarded for one for it will seldom happen that the affection of that one will recompense thee for the enmity of all the rest  love one if you please and as much as you please  but be gracious to all  affection may surely conduct thee through an avenue of women to her who possesses thy heart without tearing the flounces of any of their petticoats the displaying courtesy to all whom you meet will delay you very little in your way to the arms of her whom you love  and if i mistake not will attune your sensibilities to the higher enjoyment of the raptures you will find there  we have all of us enemies enough my good friend from the inevitable course of human events without our increasing the number by so strange and unprofitable conduct as that of neglecting any of the most trifling offices of familiar life  besides  to come more home to thine heart  let me observe to thee  that charity and humanity which by the bye are one and the same thing are said to be the foundation of those qualities which form what is called a wellbred man  if therefore you should on any account get into the habit of neglecting the latter  you may stand more than a chance of its being said that you do not possess the former which you know to be the brightest jewel in the human character  and this i am certain would wound thee in thy very soul   my dear boy neglect not these and other things which thou may call little things  for little things believe me are oftentimes of great importance in the arrangements of life  you have been frequently pleased to tell me as a matter of praise that in my descriptions i am natural to a nicety  and when i tell of picking up an handkerchief or wiping a tear from the cheek of a distressed damsel with a white one  or the sticking a pin into a pincushion  and such things i am far superior to any other writer  apply then i beseech thee this observation to thyself and give me an opportunity of retorting the eulogium upon thee this is the sincere wish of thy friend  so may god bless thee and direct the best feelings of thy heart to the best purposes of thy life  i am yours most affectionately l stern the postmans bell tells me i have not time to read what i have written but i will trust to both our hearts that there is nothing which either ought to be ashamed of    letter xxxvii to mrs v  monday morn when all the crowd my fair lady was hurried into the gardens to hear the music of squibs and crackers  and to see the air illuminated by rockets and balloons  i was flattered exquisitely flattered to find you contented to saunter lackadaysically with me round an exhausted ranelagh and give me your gentle amiable elegant sentiments in a tone of voice that was originally intended for a cherub how you got it i know not  nor is it my business to enquire i am ever rejoiced to find any emanation of the other world in any corner of this be it where it may  but particularly when it proceeds through any female organ  where the effect must be more powerful because it is always most delicious  now after this little emanation of my spirit which may not be quite so celestial as it ought i trust you will not think me ungracious in desiring you to excuse my promised duties at your drawing room this evening the truth is  my cough has seized me so violently by the throat that though i could hear you sing i should not be able to tell you the effects of your music upon my heart indeed  i can scarce produce a whisper loud enough to make the servant bring my gruel  i have now been so long acquainted with this crazy frame of mine that i know all its tricks  and i foresee that i have a weeks indulgence at least to bestow upon it  however on sunday next i trust  i may becassock myself in my cloak and be chaired to your warm cabinet where i hope to possess voice enough to assure you of the sincere esteem and admiration i feel for you  whether i can tell you so or no colds and coughs and catarrhs may tie up the tongue but the heart is above the little inconveniences of its prisonhouse and will one day escape from them all till that period i shall beg leave to remain with great truth  your most faithful and obedient humble servant l stern  letter xxxviii to   sunday evening the poor in spirit and the poor in purse with nine out of ten  nay with ninetynine in an hundred of the world are so alike that by practicing the virtues of the former a man generally gets all the credit or rather discredit of the latter  here are very few my friend who have that nice insight into characters as to be able to discern the various but approaching shades that distinguish them from each other  and sorry am i to say it but there are still fewer who have the humanity to make them employ their discernment where it ought to be employed in favor of the heart  this moderation of temper which is always associated to sterling merit is made to win the love of the few but is too apt at the same time to be not only the dupe but the contempt of the many he who comes not forward with his pretensions is either supposed to possess none  or to be prevented by some awkward or disgraceful circumstances from offering them  the ignorant the upstart and the assuming will not be made to believe that the humble can have merit  as they themselves wear the tinsel suit of tawdry qualifications upon their backs they look no further for the qualities of others  which by the bye is natural enough  the wicked and the knavish will not suppose that a man on the score of conscience or virtue can be such an idiot as to practice submission and keep back brilliant talents from exercise because he cannot enlist them in an honest cause  or that when he is employing them in an humble way  it is not with some design of artifice or from some motive that is base  so that the modest diffident and christian character stands but little chance of what is called good fortune in the world  indeed christianly speaking there is no great promise made to it in this petty circle of time  such virtues are to look to more durable honors when this world is faded away  and it is their consolation and their delight here that such a reward awaits them alas  without this hope how could the good bear as they do the thousand untoward circumstances that are continually pressing upon them  and chasing away the smile from the cheeks and placing tears in their stead  but i am interrupted  or i believe  instead of a letter  you would have had a sermon but it is sunday evening  and therefore with  a god bless you  i conclude myself  your affectionate  l stern  letter xxxix to   saturday evening i have had my friend another attack and though i am in a great measure recovered it has hinted to me one thing at least which is  that if i am rash enough to risk the winter in london i shall never see another spring in the very beginning of the following spring he died at his lodgings in bondstreet   but be that as it may  as my family is now in england and as i have my sentimental journey  which i think with you will be the most popular of my works to give to the world  i know not how it will be possible for me to run so counter to my interest my affections and my vanity  as to set my face southward before march  and i think if i get to that period i may bid the scarecrow defiance for another seven or eight months  and then i may leave him in the fogs and go where as he so often followed me in vain he will not follow me again and this idea cheers my spirit  not believe me that i am uneasy about death as death  but that i think for a dozen years to come  i could make a very tolerable good use of life  but be that as it pleases god  besides i have promised your  and sure i may add my charming friend mrs v to pay her a visit in ireland  which  i mean that you should do with me  it is not that you introduced me to her acquaintance  which is something it is not her enchanting voice which humanly speaking may be more  nor that she has come herself in the form of a pitying angel and made my tisan for me during my illness  and played at picquet with me in order to prevent my attempt to talk as she was told it would do me harm  which is most of all  that makes me love her so much as i do  but it is a mind attuned to every virtue and a nature of the first order  beaming through a form of the first beauty in my life did i never see any thing  so truly graceful as she is nor had i an idea till i saw her  that grace could be so perfect in all its parts and so suited to all the higher ordinances of the first life from the superintending impulse of the mind for i will answer for it that education though called forth to the utmost exertions has played a very subordinate part in the composition of her character all its best efforts are  as it were  in the back ground or rather are lost in the general mass of those qualities which predominate over all her accessory accomplishments  in short if i had ever so great an inclination to cross the gulf while such a woman beckoned me to stay  i could not depart  the world however has absolutely killed me and should such a report have reached you i know full well that it would have grieved you sorely  and i wish you not to shed a tear for me in vain  that you will drop more than one over thy friend yorick when he is dead sooths him while he is yet alive  but i trust that though there may be something in my death whenever it happens  to distress you there will be something also in the remembrance of me to comfort you when i am laid beneath the marble  but why do i talk of marble  i should say beneath the sod  for cover my head with a turf or a stone twill be all one  twill be all one till then at least i shall be with great truth  your most affectionate l stern  finis
