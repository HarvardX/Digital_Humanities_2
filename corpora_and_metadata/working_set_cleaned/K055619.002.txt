the life of samuel johnson ll d comprehending an account of his studies and numerous works in chronological order a series of his epistolary correspondence and conversations with many eminent persons and various original pieces of his composition never before published the whole exhibiting a view of literature and literary men in great britain for near half a century during which he flourished in two volumes by james boswell esquire   quo fit ut omnis votiva pateat veluti descripta tabella vita senis  horat volume the second  london printed by henry baldwin for charles dilly in the poultry m dcc xci  the life of samuel johnson ll d   to james boswell esquire dear sir i have at last sent you all lord hailess papers while i was in france i looked very often into henault but lord hailes in my opinion leaves him far and far behind why i did not dispatch so short a perusal sooner when i look back i am utterly unable to discover but human moments are stolen away by a thousand petty impediments which leave no trace behind them i have been afflicted through the whole christmas with the general disorder of which the worst effect was a cough which is now much mitigated though the country on which i look from a window at streatham is now covered with a deep snow mrs williams is very ill every body else is as usual  among the papers i found a letter to you which i think you had not opened and a paper for the chronicle which i suppose it not necessary now to insert i return them both  i have within these few days had the honor of receiving lord hailess first volume for which i return my most respectful thanks  i wish you my dearest friend and your haughty lady for i know she does not love me and the young ladies and the young lord all happiness teach the young gentleman in spite of his mamma to think and speak well of  sir your affectionate humble servant sam johnson jan  0       at this time was in agitation a matter of great consequence to me and my family which i should not obtrude upon the world were it not that the part which dr johnsons friendship for me made him take in it was the occasion of an exertion of his abilities which it would be injustice to conceal that what he wrote upon the subject may be understood it is necessary to give a state of the question which i shall do as briefly as i can  in the year   0  the barony or manor of auchinleck pronounced affleck in ayrshire which belonged to a family of the same name with the lands having fallen to the crown by forfeiture james the fourth king of scotland granted it to thomas boswell a branch of an ancient family in the county of fife stiling him in the charter dilecto familiari nostro and assigning as the cause of the grant pro bono et fideli servitio nobis praestito thomas boswell was slain in battle fighting along with his sovereign at the fatal field of floddon in       from this very honorable founder of our family the estate was transmitted in a direct series of heirs male to david boswell my fathers great grand uncle who had no sons but four daughters who were all respectably married the eldest to lord cathcart  david boswell being resolute in the military feudal principle of continuing the male succession passed by his daughters and settled the estate on his nephew by his next brother who approved of the deed and renounced any pretensions which he might possibly have in preference to his son but the estate having been burdened with large portions to the daughters and other debts it was necessary for the nephew to sell a considerable part of it and what remained was still much encumbered  the frugality of the nephew preserved and in some degree relieved the estate his son my grandfather an eminent lawyer not only repurchased a great part of what had been sold but acquired other lands and my father who was one of the judges of scotland and had added considerably to the estate now signified his inclination to take the privilege allowed by our law acts of the parliament of scotland      cap     to secure it to his family in perpetuity by an entail which on account of marriage articles could not be done without my consent  in the plan of entailing the estate i heartily concurred with him though i was the first to be restrained by it but we unhappily differed as to the series of heirs which should be established or in the language of our law called to the succession my father had declared a predilection for heirs general that is males and females indiscriminately he was willing however that all males descending from his grandfather should be preferred to females but would not extend that privilege to males deriving their descent from a higher source i on the other hand had a zealous partiality for heirs male however remote which i maintained by arguments which appeared to me to have considerable weight as first the opinion of some distinguished naturalists that our species is transmitted through males only the female being all along no more than a nidus or nurse as mother farth is to plants of every sort which notion seems to be confirmed by that text of scripture he was yet in the loins of his father when melchisedeck met him heb vi  0 and consequently that a mans grandson by a daughter instead of being his surest descendant as is vulgarly said has in reality no connection whatever with his blood  and secondly independent of this theory which if true should completely exclude heirs general that if the preference of a male to a female without regard to primogeniture as a son though much younger nay even a grandson by a son to a daughter be once admitted as it universally is it must be equally reasonable and proper in the most remote degree of descent from an original proprietor of an estate as in the nearest because  however distant from the representative at the time  that remote heir male upon the failure of those nearer to the original propfietor than he is becomes in fact the nearest male to him and is therefore preferable as his representative to a female descendant  a little extension of mind will enable us easily to perceive that a sons son in continuation to whatever length of time is preferable to a sons daughter in the succession to an ancient inheritance in which regard should be had to the representation of the original proprietor and not to that of one of his descendants  i am aware of blackstones admirable demonstration of the reasonableness of the legal succession upon the principle of there being the greatest probability that the nearest heir of the person who last dies proprietor of an estate is of the blood of the first purchaser but supposing a pedigree to be carefully authenticated through all its branches instead of mere prbability there will be a rtainty that the nearest heir male at whater period has the same right of blood with the first heir male namely the original purhars eldest son    and in the particular case of our family i apprehended that we were under an implied obligation in honor and good faith to transmit the estate by the same tenure which we held it which was as heirs male excluding nearer females i therefore as i thought conscientiously objected to my fathers scheme  my opposition was very displeasing to my father who was entitled to great respect and deference and i had reason to apprehend disagreeable consequences from my noncompliance with his wishes after much perplexity and uneasiness i wrote to dr johnson stating the case with all its difficulties at full length and earnestly requesting that he would consider it at leisure and favor me with his friendly opinion and advice  to james boswell esquire dear sir i was much impressed by your letter and if i can form upon your case any resolution satisfactory to myself will very gladly impart it but whether i am quite equal to it i do not know it is a case compounded of law and justice and requires a mind versed in juridical disquisitions could you not tell your whole mind to lord hailes he is you know both a christian and a lawyer i suppose he is above partiality and above loquacity and i believe he will not think the time lost in which he may quiet a disturbed or settle a wavering mind write to me as any thing occurs to you and if i find myself stopped by want of facts necessary to be known i will make enquiries of you as my doubts arise  if your former resolutions should be found only fanciful you decide rightly in judging that your fathers fancies may claim the preference but whether they are fanciful or rational is the question i really think lord hailes could help us  make my compliments to dear mrs boswell and tell her that i hope to be wanting in nothing that i can contribute to bring you all out of your troubles  i am dear sir most affectionately your humble servant sam johnson london jan          to the same dear sir i am going to write upon a question which requires more knowledge of local law and more acquaintance with the general rules of inheritance than i can claim but i write because you request it  land is like any other possession by natural right wholly in the power of its present owner and may be sold given or bequeathed absolutely or conditionally as judgment shall direct or passion incite  but natural right would avail little without the protection of law and the primary notion of law is restraint in the exercise of natural right a man is therefore in society not fully master of what he calls his own but he still retains all the power which law does not take from him  in the exercise of the right which law either leaves or gives regard is to be paid to moral obligations  of the estate which we are now considering your father still retains such possession with such power over it that he can sell it and do with the money what he will without any legal impediment but when he extends his power beyond his own life by settling the order of succession the law makes your consent necessary  let us suppose that he sells the land to risk the money in some specious adventure and in that adventure loses the whole his posterity would be disappointed but they could not think themselves injured or robbed if he spent it upon vice or pleasure his successors could only call him vicious and voluptuous they could not say that he was injurious or unjust  he that may do more may do less he that by selling or squandering may disinherit a whole family may certainly disinherit part by a partial settlement  laws are formed by the manners and exigencies of particular times and it is but accidental that they last longer than their causes the limitation of feudal succession to the male arose from the obligation of the tenant to attend his chief in war  as times and opinions are always changing i know not whether it be not usurpation to prescribe rules to posterity by presuming to judge of what we cannot know and i know not whether i fully approve either your design or your fathers to limit that succession which descended to you unlimited if we are to leave sartum tectum to posterity what we have without any merit of our own received from our ancestors should not choice and free will be kept unviolated is land to be treated with more reverence than liberty  if this consideration should restrain your father from disinheriting some of the males does it leave you the power of disinheriting all the females  can the possessor of a feudal estate make any will can he appoint out of the inheritance any portions to his daughters there seems to be a very shadowy difference between the power of leaving land and of leaving money to be raised from land between leaving an estate to females and leaving the male heir in effect only their steward  suppose at one time a law that allowed only males to inherit and during the continuance of this law many estates to have descended passing by the females to remoter heirs suppose afterward the law repealed in correspondence with a change of manners and women made capable of inheritance would not then the tenure of estates be changed could the women have no benefit from a law made in their favor must they be passed by upon moral principles for ever because they were once excluded by a legal prohibition or may that which passed only to males by one law pass likewise to females by another  you mention your resolution to maintain the right of your brothers which term i applied to all the heirs male  i do not see how any of their rights are invaded  as your whole difficulty arises from the act of your ancestor who diverted the succession from the females you enquire very properly what were his motives and what was his intention for you certainly are not bound by his act more than he intended to bind you nor hold your land on harder or stricter terms than those on which it was granted  intentions must be gathered from acts when he left the estate to his nephew by excluding his daughters was it or was it not in his power to have perpetuated the succession to the males if he could have done it he seems to have shown by omitting it that he did not desire it to be done and upon your own principles you will not easily prove your right to destroy that capacity of succession which your ancestors have left  if your ancestor had not the power of making a perpetual settlement and if therefore we cannot judge distinctly of his intentions yet his act can only be considered as an example it makes not an obligation and as you observe he set no example of rigorous adherence to the line of succession he that overlooked a brother would not wonder that little regard is shown to remote relations  as the rules of succession are in a great part purely legal no man can be supposed to bequeath any thing but upon legal terms he can grant no power which the law denies and if he makes no special and definite limitation he confers all the powers which the law allows  your ancestor for some reason disinherited his daughters but it no more follows that he intended his act as a rule for posterity than the disinheriting of his brother  if therefore you ask by what right your father admits daughters to inheritance ask yourself first by what right you require them to be excluded  it appears upon reflection that your father excludes nobody he only admits nearer females to inherit before males more remote and the exclusion is purely consequential  these dear sir are my thoughts immethodical and deliberative but perhaps you may find in them some glimmering of evidence  i cannot however but again recommend to you a conference with lord hailes whom you know to be both a lawyer and a christian  make my compliments to mrs boswell though she does not love me  i am sir your affectionate servant sam johnson feb         i had followed his recommendation and consulted lord hailes who upon this subject had a firm opinion contrary to mine his lordship obligingly took the trouble to write me a letter in which he discussed with legal and historical learning the points in which i saw much difficulty maintaining that the succession of heirs general was the succession by the law of scotland from the throne to the cottage as far as we can learn it by record observing that the estate of our family had not been limited to heirs male and that though an heir male had in one instance been chosen in preference to nearer females that had been an arbitrary act which had seemed to be best in the embarrassed state of affairs at that time and the fact was that upon a fair computation of the value of land and money at the time applied to the estate and the burdens upon it there was nothing given to the heir male but the skeleton of an estate the plea of conscience said his lordship which you put is a most respectable one especially when conscience and self are on different sides but i think that conscience is not well informed and that self and she ought on this occasion to be of a side  this letter which had considerable influence upon my mind i sent to dr johnson begging to hear from him again upon this interesting question  to james boswell esquire dear sir having not any acquaintance with the laws or customs of scotland i endeavored to consider your question upon general principles and found nothing of much validity that i could oppose to this position he who inherits a fief unlimited by his ancestor inherits the power of limiting it according to his own judgment or opinion if this be true you may join with your father  further consideration produced another conclusion he who receives a fief unlimited by his ancestors gives his heirs some reason to complain if he does not transmit it unlimited to posterity for why should he make the state of others worse than his own without a reason if this be true though neither you nor your father are about to do what is quite right but as your father violates i think the legal succession least he seems to be nearer the right than yourself  it cannot but occur that women have natural and equitable claims as well as men and these claims are not to be capriciously or lightly superseded or infringed when fiefs implied military service it is easily discerned why females could not inherit them but that reason is now at an end as manners make laws manners likewise repeal them  these are the general conclusions which i have attained none of them are very favorable to your scheme of entail nor perhaps to any scheme my observation that only he who acquires an estate may bequeath it capriciously i had reminded him of his observation mentioned in vol i page      if it contains any conviction includes this position likewise that only he who acquires an estate may entail it capriciously but i think it may be safely presumed that he who inherits an estate inherits all the power legally concomitant and that he who gives or leaves unlimited an estate legally limitable must be presumed to give that power of limitation which he omitted to take away and to commit future contingencies to future prudence in these two positions i believe lord hailes will advise you to rest every other notion of possession seems to me full of difficulties and embarrassed with scruples  if these axioms be allowed you have arrived now at full liberty without the help of particular circumstances which however have in your case great weight you very rightly observe that he who passing by his brother gave the inheritance to his nephew could limit no more than he gave and by lord hailess estimate of fourteen years purchase what he gave was no more than you may easily entail according to your own opinion if that opinion should sinally prevail  lord hailess suspicion that entails are encroachments on the dominion of providence may be extended to all hereditary privileges and all permanent institutions i do not see why it may not be extended to any provision but for the present hour since all care about futurity proceeds upon a supposition that we know at least in some degree what will be future of the future we certainly know nothing but we may form conjectures from the past and the power of forming conjectures includes in my opinion the duty of acting in conformity to that probability which we discover providence gives the power of which reason teaches the use  i am dear sir your most faithful servant sam johnson february        i hope i shall get some ground now with mrs boswell make my compliments to her and to the little people  dont burn papers they may be safe enough in your own box  you will wish to see them hereafter     to the same dear sir to the letters which i have written about your great question i have nothing to add if your conscience is satisfied you have now only your prudence to consult i long for a letter that i may know how this troublesome and vexatious question is at last decided the entail framed by my father with various judicious clauses was executed by him and me settling the estate upon the heirs male of his grandfather which i found had been already done by my grandfather imperfectly but so as to be defeated only by selling the lands i was freed by dr johnson from scruples of conscientious obligation and could therefore gratify my father but my opinion and partiality for male succession in its full extent remained unshaken yet let me not be thought harsh or unkind to daughters for my notion is that they should be treated with great affection and tenderness and always participate of the prosperity of the family  i hope that it will at last end well lord hailess letter was very friendly and very seasonable but i think his aversion from entails has something in it like superstition providence is not counteracted by any means which providence puts into our power the continuance and propagation of families makes a great part of the jewish law and is by no means prohibited in the christian institution though the necessity of it continues no longer hereditary tenures are established in all civilized countries and are accompanied in most with hereditary authority sir william temple considers our constitution as defective that there is not an unalienable estate in land connected with a peerage and lord bacon mentions as a proof that the turks are barbarians their want of stirpes as he calls them or hereditary rank do not let your mind when it is freed from the supposed necessity of a rigorous entail be entangled with contrary objections and think all entails unlawful till you have cogent arguments which i believe you will never find i am afraid of scruples  i have now sent all lord hailess papers part i found hidden in a drawer in which i had laid them for security and had forgotten them part of these are written twice i have returned both the copies part i had read before  be so kind as to return lord hailes my most respectful thanks for his first volume his accuracy strikes me with wonder his narrative is far superior to that of henault as i have formerly mentioned  i am afraid that the trouble which my irregularity and delay has cost him is greater far greater than any good that i can do him will ever recompense but if i have any more copy i will try to do better  pray let me know if mrs boswell is friends with me and pay my respects to veronica and euphemia and alexander  i am sir your most humble servant sam johnson feb          mr boswell to dr johnson edinburgh feb  0      you have illuminated my mind and relieved me from imaginary shackles of conscientious obligation were it necessary i could immediately join in an entail upon the series of heirs approved by my father but it is better not to act too suddenly   dr johnson to mr boswell dear sir i am glad that what i could think or say has at all contributed to quiet your thoughts your resolution not to act till your opinion is confirmed by more deliberation is very just if you have been scrupulous do not now be rash i hope that as you think more and take opportunities of talking with men intelligent in questions of property you will be able to free yourself from every difficulty  when i wrote last i sent i think ten packets did you receive them all  you must tell mrs boswell that i suspected her to have written without your knowledge a letter to him on the interesting subject of the family settlement which i had read  and therefore did not return any answer lest a clandestine correspondence should have been perniciously discovered i will write to her soon  i am dear sir most affectionately yours sam johnson feb          having communicated to lord hailes what dr johnson wrote concerning the question which perplexed me so much his lordship wrote to me your scruples have produced more fruit than i ever expected from them an excellent dissertation on general principles of morals and law  i wrote to dr johnson on the  0th of february complaining of melancholy and expressing a strong desire to be with him informing him that the ten packets came all safe that lord hailes was much obliged to him and said he had almost wholly removed his scruples against entails  to james boswell esquire dear sir i have not had your letter half an hour as you lay so much weight upon my notions i should think it not just to delay my answer  i am very sorry that your melancholy should return and should be sorry likewise if it could have no relief but from my company my counsel you may have when you are pleased to require it but of my company you cannot in the next month have much for mr thrale will take me to italy he says on the first of april  let me warn you very earnestly against scruples i am glad that you are reconciled to your settlement and think it a great honor to have shaken lord hailess opinion of entails do not however hope wholly to reason away your troubles do not feed them with attention and they will die imperceptibly away fix your thoughts upon your business fill your intervals with company and sunshine will again break in upon your mind if you will come to me you must come very quickly and even then i know not but we may scour the country together for i have a mind to see oxford and lichfield before i set out on this long journey to this i can only add that  i am dear sir your most affectionate humble servant sam johnson march         to the same dear sir very early in april we leave england and in the beginning of the next week i shall leave london for a short time of this i think it necessary to inform you that you may not be disappointed in any of your enterprises i had not fully resolved to go into the country before this day  please to make my compliments to lord hailes and mention very particularly to mrs boswell my hope that she is reconciled to  sir your faithful servant sam johnson march          above thirty years ago the heirs of lord chancellor clarendon presented the university of oxford with the continuation of his history and such other of his lordships manuscripts as had not been published on condition that the profits arising from their publication should be applied to the establishment of a manege in the university the gift was accepted in full convocation a person being now recommended to dr johnson as fit to superintend this proposed ridingschool he exerted himself with that zeal for which he was remarkable upon every similar occasion but on enquiry into the matter he found that the scheme was not likely to be soon carried into execution the profits arising from the clarendon press being from some mismanagement very scanty this having been explained to him by a respectable dignitary of the church who had good means of knowing it he wrote a letter upon the subject which at once exhibits his extraordinary precision and acuteness and his warm attachment to his alma matter  to the reverend dr wetherell master of universitycollege oxford dear sir few things are more unpleasant than the transaction of business with men who are above knowing or caring what they have to do such as the trustees for lord cornburys institution will perhaps appear when you have read dr s letter  the last part of the doctors letter is of great importance the complaint i suppose the complaint was that the trustees of the oxford press did not allow the london booksellers a sufficient profit upon vending their publications which he makes i have heard long ago and did not know but it was redressed it is unhappy that a practice so erroneous has not yet been altered for altered it must be or our press will be useless with all its privileges the booksellers who like all other men have strong prejudices in their own favor are enough inclined to think the practice of printing and selling books by any but themselves an encroachment on the rights of their fraternity and have need of stronger inducements to circulate academical publications than those of one another for of that mutual cooperation by which the general trade is carried on the university can bear no part of those whom he neither loves nor fears and from whom he expects no reciprocation of good offices why should any man promote the interest but for profit i suppose with all our scholastic ignorance of mankind we are still too knowing to expect that the booksellers will erect themselves into patrons and buy and sell under the influence of a disinterested zeal for the promotion of learning  to the booksellers if we look for either honor or profit from our press not only their common profit but something more must be allowed and if books printed at oxford are expected to be rated at a high price that price must be levied on the public and paid by the ultimate purchaser not by the intermediate agents what price shall be set upon the book is to the booksellers wholly indifferent provided that they gain a proportionate profit by negociating the sale  why books printed at oxford should be particularly dear i am however unable to find we pay no rent we inherit many of our instruments and materials lodging and victuals are cheaper than at london and therefore workmanship ought at least not to be dearer our expenses are naturally less than those of booksellers and in most cases communities are content with less profit than individuals  it is perhaps not considered through how many hands a book often passes before it comes into those of the reader or what part of the profit each hand must retain as a motive for transmitting it to the next  we will call our primary agent in london mr cadell who receives our books from us gives them room in his warehouse and issues them on demand by him they are sold to mr dilly a wholesale bookseller who sends them into the country and the last seller is the country bookseller here are three profits to be paid between the printer and the reader or in the style of commerce between the manufacturer and the consumer and if any of these profits is too penuriously distributed the process of commerce is interrupted  we are now come to the practical question what is to be done you will tell me with reason that i have said nothing till i declare how much according to my opinion of the ultimate price ought to be distributed through the whole succession of sale  the deduction i am afraid will appear very great but let it be considered before it is refused we must allow for profit between thirty and thirtyfive per cent between six and seven shillings in the pound that is for every book which costs the last buyer twenty shillings we must charge mr cadell with something less than fourteen we must set the copies at fourteen shillings each and superadd what is called the quarterlybook or for every hundred books so charged we must deliver an hundred and four  the profits will then stand thus  mr cadell who runs no hazard and gives no credit will be paid for warehouse room and attendance by a shilling profit on each book and his chance of the quarterlybook  mr dilly who buys the book for fifteen shillings and who will expect the quarterlybook if he takes fiveand twenty will sell it to his country customer at sixteen and sixpence by which at the hazard of loss and the certainty of long credit he gains the regular profit of ten per cent which is expected in the wholesale trade  the country bookseller buying at sixteen and sixpence and commonly trusting a considerable time gains but three and sixpence and if he trusts a year not much more than two and sixpence otherwise than as he may perhaps take as long credit as he gives  with less profit than this and more you see he cannot have the country bookseller cannot live for his receipts are small and his debts sometimes bad  thus dear sir i have been incited by dr s letter to give you a detail of the circulation of books which perhaps every man has not had opportunity of knowing and which those who know it do not perhaps always distinctly consider  i am etc sam johnson i am happy in giving this full and clear statement to the public to vindicate by the authority of the greatest author of his age that respectable body of men the booksellers of london from vulgar reflections as if their profits were exorbitant when in truth dr johnson has here allowed them more than they usually demand  march          having arrived in london late on friday the   th of march i hastened next morning to wait on dr johnson at his house but found he was removed from johnsonscourt no   to boltcourt no   still keeping to his favorite fleet street my reflection at the time upon this change as marked in my journal is as follows i felt a foolish regret that he had left a court which bore his name but it was not foolish to be affected with some tenderness of regard for a place in which i had seen him a great deal from whence i had often issued a better and a happier man than when i went in and which had often appeared to my imagination while i trod its pavement in the solemn darkness of the night to be sacred to wisdom and piety being informed that he was at mr thrales in the borough i hastened thither and found mrs thrale and him at breakfast i was kindly welcomed in a moment he was in a full glow of conversation and i felt myself elevated as if brought into another state of being mrs thrale and i looked to each other while he talked and our looks expressed our congenial admiration and affection for him i shall ever recollect this scene with great pleasure i exclaimed to her i am now intellectually hermippus redivivus i am quite restored by him by transfusion of mind there are many she replied who admire and respect mr johnson but you and i love him  he seemed very happy in the near prospect of going to italy with mr and mrs thrale but said he before leaving england i am to take a jaunt to oxford birmingham my native city lichfield and my old friend dr taylors at ashbourne in derbyshire i shall go in a few days and you boswell shall go with me i was ready to accompany him being willing even to leave london to have the pleasure of his conversation  i mentioned with much regret the extravagance of the representative of a great family in scotland by which there was danger of its being ruined and as johnson respected it for its antiquity he joined with me in thinking it would be happy if this person should die mrs thrale seemed shocked at this as feudal barbarity and said i do not understand this preference of the estate to its owner of the land to the man who walks upon that land johnson nay madam it is not a preference of the land to its owner it is the preference of a family to an individual here is an establishment in a country which is of importance for ages not only to the chief but to his people an establishment which extends upwards and downwards that this should be destroyed by one idle fellow is a sad thing  he said entails are good because it is good to preserve in a country serieses of men to whom the people are accustomed to look up as to their leaders but i am for leaving a quantity of land in commerce to excite industry and keep money in the country for if no land were to be bought in a country there would be no encouragement to acquire wealth because a family could not be founded there or if it were acquired it must be carried away to another country where land may be bought and although the land in every country will remain the same and be as fertile where there is no money as where there is yet all that portion of the happiness of civil life which is produced by money circulating in a country would be lost boswell then sir would it be for the advantage of a country that all its lands were sold at once johnson so far sir as money produces good it would be an advantage for then that country would have as much money circulating in it as it is worth but to be sure this would be counterbalanced by disadvantages attending a total change of proprietors  i expressed my opinion that the power of entailing should be limited thus that there should be one third or perhaps one half of the land of a country kept free for commerce that the proportion allowed to be entailed should be parcelled out so as that no family could entail above a certain quantity let a family according to the abilities of its representatives be richer or poorer in different generations or always rich if its representatives be always wise but let its absolute permanency be moderate in this way we should be certain of there being always a number of established roots and as in the course of nature there is in every age an extinction of some families there would be continual openings for men ambitious of perpetuity to plant a stock in the entail ground the privilege of perpetuating in a family an estate and arms indefeasibly from generation to generation is enjoyed by none of his majestys subjects except in scotland where the legal fiction of a five and recovery is unknown it is a privilege so proud that i should think it would be proper to have the exercise of it dependent on the royal prerogative it seems absurd to permit the power of perpetuating their representation to men who having had no eminent merit have truly no name the king as the impartial father of his people would never refuse to grant the privilege to those who deserved it  johnson why sir mankind will be better able to regulate the system of entails when the evil of too much land being locked up by them is felt than we can do at present when it is not felt  i mentioned dr adam smiths book on the wealth of nations which was just published and that sir john pringle had observed to me that dr smith who had never been in trade could not be expected to write well on that subject any more than a lawyer upon physic johnson he is mistaken sir a man who has never been engaged in trade himself may undoubtedly write well upon trade and there is nothing which requires more to be illustrated by philosophy than trade does as to mere wealth that is to say money it is clear that one nation or one individual cannot increase its store but by making another poorer but trade procures what is more valuable the reciprocation of the peculiar advantages of different countries a merchant seldom thinks but of his own particular trade to write a good book upon it a man must have extensive views it is not necessary to have practiced to write well upon a subject i mentioned law as a subject on which no man could write well without practice johnson why sir in england where so much money is to be got by the practice of the law most of our writers upon it have been in practice though blackstone had not been much in practice when he published his commentaries but upon the continent the great writers on law have not all been in practice grotius indeed was but puffendorf was not burlamaqui was not  when we had talked of the great consequence which a man acquired by being employed in his profession i suggested a doubt of the justice of the general opinion that it is improper in a lawyer to solicit employment for why i urged should it not be equally allowable to solicit that as the means of consequence as it is to solicit votes to be elected a member of parliament mr strahan had told me that a countryman of his and mine who had risen to eminence in the law had when first making his way solicited him to get him employed in city causes johnson sir it is wrong to stir up lawsuits but when once it is certain that a lawsuit is to go on there is nothing wrong in a lawyers endeavoring that he shall have the benefit rather than another boswell you would not solicit employment sir if you were a lawyer johnson no sir but not because i should think it wrong but because i should disdain it this was a good distinction which will be felt by men of just pride he proceeded however i would not have a lawyer to be wanting to himself in using fair means i would have him to inject a little hint now and then to prevent his being overlooked  lord mounstuarts bill for a scotch militia in supporting which his lordship had made an able speech in the house of commons was now a pretty general topic of conversation  johnson as scotland contributes so little land tax toward the general support of the nation ought not to have a militia paid out of the general fund unless it should be thought for the general interest that scotland should be protected from an invasion which no man can think will happen for what enemy would invade scotland where there is nothing to be got no sir now that the scotch have not the pay of english soldiers spent among them as so many troops are sent abroad they are trying to get money another way by having a militia paid if they are afraid and seriously desire to have an armed force to defend them they should pay for it your scheme is to retain a part of your little land tax by making us pay and clothe your militia boswell you should not talk of we and you sir there is now an union johnson there must be a distinction of interest while the proportions of land tax are so unequal if yorkshire should say instead of paying our land tax we will keep a greater number of militia it would be unreasonable in this argument my friend was certainly in the wrong the land tax is as unequally proportioned between different parts of england as between england and scotland nay it is considerably unequal in scotland itself but the land tax is but a small part of the numerous branches of public revenue all of which scotland pays precisely as england does a french invasion made in scotland would soon penetrate into england  he thus discoursed upon supposed obligations in settling estates  where a man gets the unlimited property of an estate there is no obligation upon him in justice to leave it to one person rather than to another there is a motive of preference from kindness and this kindness is generally entertained for the nearest relation if i owe a particular man a sum of money i am obliged to let that man have the next money i get and cannot in justice let another have it but if i owe money to no man i may dispose of what i get as i please there is not a debitum justitiae to a mans next heir there is only a debitum caritatis it is plain then that i have morally a choice according to my liking if i have a brother in want he has a claim from affection to my assistance but if i have also a brother in want whom i like better he has a preferable claim the right of an heir at law is only this that he is to have the succession to an estate in case no other person is appointed to it by the owner his right is merely preferable to that of the king  we got into a boat to cross over to blackfriars and as we moved along the thames i talked to him of a little volume which altogether unknown to him was advertised to be published in a few days under the title of  johnsoniana or bon mots of dr johnson johnson sir it is a mighty impudent thing boswell pray sir could you have no redress if you were to prosecute a publisher for bringing out under your name what you never said and ascribing to you dull stupid nonsense or making you swear profanely as many ignorant relaters of your bon mots do johnson no sir there will always be some truth mixed with the falsehood and how can it be ascertained how much is true and how much is false besides sir what damages would a jury give me for having been represented as swearing boswell i think sir you should at least disavow such a publication because the world and posterity might with much plausible foundation say here is a volume which was publicly advertised and came out in dr johnsons own time and by his silence was admitted by him to be genuine johnson i shall give myself no trouble about the matter  he was perhaps above suffering from such spurious publications but i could not help thinking that many men would be much injured in their reputation by having absurd and vicious sayings imputed to them and that redress ought in such cases to be given  he said the value of every story depends on its being true a story is a picture either of an individual or of human nature in general if it be false it is a picture of nothing for instance suppose a man should tell that johnson before setting out for italy as he had to cross the alps fat down to make himself wings this many people would believe but it would be a picture of nothing  naming a worthy friend of ours used to think a story a story till i showed him that truth was essential to it i observed that foot entertained us with stories which were not true but that indeed it was properly not as narratives that footes stories pleased us but as collections of ludicrous images johnson foot is quite impartial for he tells lies of every body  the importance of strict and scrupulous veracity cannot be too often inculcated johnson was known to be so rigidly attentive to it that even in his common conversation the slightest circumstance was mentioned with exact precision the knowledge of his having such a principle and habit made his friends have a perfect reliance on the truth of every thing that he told however it might have been doubted if told by many others as an instance of this i may mention an odd incident which he related as having happened to him one night in fleet street a gentlewoman said he begged i would give her my arm to assist her in crossing the street which i accordingly did upon which she offered me a shilling supposing me to be the watchman i perceived that she was somewhat in liquor this if told by most people would have been thought an invention when told by jnson it was believed by his friends as much as if they had seen what passed  we landed at the templestairs where we parted  i found him in the evening in mrs williamss room we talked of religious orders he said it is as unreasonable for a man to go into a carthusian convent for fear of being immoral as for a man to cut off his hands for fear he should steal there is indeed great resolution in the immediate act of dismembering himself but when that is once done he has no longer any merit for though it is out of his power to steal yet he may all his life be a thief in his heart so when a man has once become a carthusian he is obliged to continue so whether he chooses it or not their silence too is absurd we read in the gospel of the apostles being sent to preach but not to hold their tongues all severity that does not tend to increase good or prevent evil is idle i said to the lady abbess of a convent madam you are here not for the love of virtue but the fear of vice she said she should remember this as long as she lived i thought it hard to give her this view of her situation when she could not help it and indeed i wondered at the whole of what he now said because both in his rambler and idler he treats religious austerities with much solemnity of respect  finding him still persevering in his abstinence from wine i ventured to speak to him of it  johnson sir i have no objection to a mans drinking wine if he can do it in moderation i found myself apt to go to excess in it and therefore after having been for some time without it on account of illness i thought it better not to return to it every man is to judge for himself according to the effects which he experiences one of the fathers tells us he found fasting made him so peevish that he did not practice it  though he often enlarged upon the evil of intoxication he was by no means harsh and unforgiving to those who indulged in occasional excess in wine one of his friends i well remember came to sup at a tavern with him and some other gentlemen and too plainly discovered that he had drunk too much at dinner when one who loved mischief thinking to produce a severe censure asked johnson some days afterward well sir what did your friend say to you as an apology for being in such a situation johnson answered sir he said all that a man should say he said he was sorry for it  i heard him once give a very judicious practical advice upon this subject a man said he who has been drinking wine at all freely should never go into a new company with those who have partaken of wine with him he may be pretty well in unison but he will probably be offensive or appear ridiculous to other people  he allowed very great influence to education i do not deny sir but there is some original difference in minds but it is nothing in comparison of what is formed by education we may instance the science of numbers which all minds are equally capable of attaining yet we find a prodigious difference in the powers of different men in that respect after they are grown up because their minds have been more or less exercised in it and i think the same cause will explain the difference of excellence in other things gradations admitting always some difference in the first principles  this is a difficult subject but it is best to hope that diligence may do a great deal we are sure of what it can do in increasing our mechanical force and dexterity  i again visited him on monday he took occasion to enlarge as he often did upon the wretchedness of a sealife a ship is worse than a gaol there is in a gaol better air better company better convenience of every kind and a ship has the additional disadvantage of being in danger when men come to like a sealife they are not fit to live on land  then said i it would be cruel in a father to breed his son to the sea johnson it would be cruel in a father who thinks as i do men go to sea before they know the unhappiness of that way of life and when they have come to know it they cannot escape from it because it is then too late to choose another profession as indeed is generally the case with men when they have once engaged in any particular way of life  on tuesday march    which was fixed for our proposed jaunt we met in the morning at the somerset coffeehouse in the strand where we were taken up by the oxford coach he was accompanied by mr gwyn the architect and a gentleman of merton college whom we did not know had the fourth seat we soon got into conversation for it was very remarkable of johnson that the presence of a stranger was no restraint upon his talk i observed that garrick who was about to quit the stage would soon have an easier life johnson i doubt that sir boswell why sir he will be atlas with the burden off his back johnson but i know not sir if he will be so steady without his load however he should never play any more but be entirely the gentleman and not partly the player he should no longer subject himself to be hissed by a mob or to be insolently treated by performers whom he used to rule with a high hand and who would gladly retaliate boswell i think he should play once  year for the benefit of decayed actors as it has been said he means to do johnson alas sir he will soon be a decayed actor himself  johnson expressed his disapprobation of ornamental architecture such as magnificent columns supporting a portico or expensive pilasters supporting merely their own capitals because it consumes labor disproportionate to its utility for the same reason he satyrised statuary painting said he consumes labor not disproportionate to its effect but a fellow will hack half a year at a block of marble to make something in stone that hardly resembles a man the value of statuary is owing to its difficulty you would not value the finest head cut upon a carrot here he seemed to me to be strangely deficient in taste for surely statuary is a noble art of imitation and preserves a wonderful expression of the varieties of the human frame and although it must be allowed that the circumstances of difficulty enhances the value of a marble head we should consider that if it requires a long time in the performance it has a proportionate value in durability  gwyn was a fine lively rattling fellow dr johnson kept him in subjection but with a kindly authority the spirit of the artist however rose against what he thought a gothic attack and he made a brisk defense what sir will you allow no value to beauty in architecture or in statuary why should we allow it then in writing why do you take the trouble to give us so many fine allusions and bright images and elegant phrases you might convey all your instruction without these ornaments johnson smiled with complacency but said why sir all these ornaments are useful because they obtain an easier reception for truth but a building is not at all more convenient for being decorated with superfluous carved work  gwyn at last was lucky enough to make one reply to dr johnson which he allowed to be excellent johnson censured him for taking down a church which might have stood many years and building a new one at a different place for no other reason but that there might be a direct road to a new bridge and his expression was you are taking a church out of the way that the people may go in a straight line to the bridge  no sir said gwyn i am putting the church in the way that the people may not go out of the way johnson with a hearty loud laugh of approbation speak no more rest your colloquial fame upon this  upon our arrival at oxford dr johnson and i went directly to university college but were disappointed on finding that one of the fellows his friend mr scott who accompanied him from newcastle to edinburgh was gone to the country we put up at the angel inn and passed the evening by ourselves in easy and familiar conversation talking of constitutional melancholy he observed a man so afflicted sir must divert distressing thoughts and not combat with them boswell may not he think them down sir johnson no sir to attempt to think them down is madness he should have a lamp constantly burning in his bedchamber during the night and if wakefully disturbed take a book and read and compose himself to rest to have the management of the mind is a great art and it may be attained in a considerable degree by experience and habitual exercise boswell should not he provide amusements for himself would it not for instance be right for him to take a course of chemistry johnson let him take a course of chemistry or a course of ropedancing or a course of any thing to which he is inclined at the time let him contrive to have as many retreats for his mind as he can as many things to which it can fly from itself burtons anatomy of melancholy is a valuable work it is perhaps overloaded with quotation but there is great spirit and great power in what burton says when he writes from his own mind  next morning we visited dr wetherell master of university college with whom dr johnson conferred on the most advantageous mode of disposing of the books printed at the clarendon press on which subject his letter has been inserted in a former page i often had occasion to remark johnson loved business loved to have his wisdom actually operate on real life dr wetherell and i talked of him without reserve in his own presence wetherell i would have given him a hundred guineas if he would have written a preface to his political tracts by way of a discourse on the british constitution boswell dr johnson though in his writings and upon all occasions a great friend to the constitution both in church and state has never written expressly in support of either there is really a claim upon him for both i am sure he could give a volume of no great bulk upon each which would comprise all the substance and with his spirit would effectually maintain them he should erect a fort on the confines of each i could perceive that he was displeased by this dialogue he burst out why should i be always writing i hoped he was conscious that the debt was just and meant to discharge it though he disliked being dunned  we then went to pembroke college and waited on his old friend dr adams the master of it whom i found to be a most polite pleasing communicative man before his advancement to the headship of his college i had intended to go and visit him at shrewsbury where he was rector of st chads in order to get from him what particulars he could recollect of johnsons academical life he now obligingly gave me part of that authentic information which with what i afterward owed to his kindness will be found incorporated in its proper place in this work  dr adams had distinguished himself by an able answer to david humes essay on miracles he told me he had once dined in company with hume in london that hume shook hands with him and said you have treated me much better than i deserve and that they exchanged visits i took the liberty to object to treating an infidel writer with smooth civility where there is a controversy concerning a passage in a classick author or concerning a question in antiquities or any other subject in which human happiness is not deeply interested a man may treat his antagonist with politeness and even respect but where the controversy is concerning the truth of religion it is of such vast importance to him who maintains it to obtain the victory that the person of an opponent ought not to be spared if a man firmly believes that religion is an invaluable treasure he will consider a writer who endeavors to deprive mankind of it as a robber he will look upon him as odious though the infidel may think himself in the right a robber who reasons as the gang do in the beggars opera who call themselves practical philosophers and may have as much sincerity as pernicious speculative philosophers is not the less an object of just indignation an abandoned profligate may think that it is not wrong to debauch my wife but shall i therefore not detest him and if i catch him making an attempt shall i treat him with politeness no i will kick him down stairs or run him through the body that is if i really love my wife or have a true rational notion of honor an infidel then should not be treated handsomely by a christian merely because he endeavors to rob with ingenuity i do declare however that i am exceedingly unwilling to be provoked to anger and could i be persuaded that truth would not suffer from a cool moderation in its defenders i should wish to preserve good humor at least in every controversy nor indeed do i see why a man should lose his temper while he does all he can to refute an opponent i think ridicule may be fairly used against an infidel for instance if he be an ugly fellow and yet absurdly vain of his person we may contrast his appearance with ciceros beautiful image of virtue could she be seen johnson coincided with me and said when a man voluntarily engages in an important controversy he is to do all he can to lessen his antagonist because authority from personal respect has much weight with most people and often more than reasoning if my antagonist writes bad language though that may not be essential to the question i will attack him for his bad language adams you would not jostle a chimneysweeper johnson yes sir if it were necessary to jostle him down  dr adams told us that in some of the colleges at oxford the fellows had excluded the students from social intercourse with them in the common room johnson they are in the right sir for there can be no real conversation no fair exertion of mind amongst them if the young men are by for a man who has a character does not choose to stake it in their presence boswell but sir may there not be very good conversation without a contest for superiority johnson no animated conversation sir for it cannot be but one or other will come off superior i do not mean that the victor must have the better of the argument for he may take the weak side but his superiority of parts and knowledge will necessarily appear and he to whom he thus shows himself superior is lessened in the eyes of the young men you know it was said mallem cum scaligero errare quem cum clavio recte sapere in the same manner take bentleys and jason de neres comments upon horace you will admire bentley more when wrong than jason when right  we walked with dr adams into the masters garden and into the common room johnson after a reverie of meditation aye here i used to play at drafts with phil jones and fludyer jones loved beer and did not get very forward in the church fludyer turned out a scoundrel a whig and said he was ashamed of having been bred at oxford he had a living at putney and got under the eye of some retainers to the court at that time and so became a violent whig but he had been a scoundrel all along to be sure boswell was he a scoundrel sir in any other way than being a political scoundrel did he cheat at drafts johnson sir we never played for money  he then carried me to visit dr bentham canon of christchurch and divinity professor with whose learned and lively conversation we were much pleased he gave us an invitation to dinner which dr johnson told me was a high honor sir it is a great thing to dine with the canons of christchurch we could not accept his invitation as we were engaged to dine at university college we had an excellent dinner there with the master and fellows it being st cuthberts day which is kept by them as a festival as he was a saint of durham with which this college is much connected  we drank tea with dr horn president of magdalen college now bishop of norwich of whose abilities in different respects the public has had eminent proofs and the esteem annexed to whose character was increased by knowing him personally he had talked of publishing an edition of waltons lives but had laid aside that design upon dr johnsons telling him from mistake that lord hailes intended to do it i had wished to negociate between lord hailes and him that one or other should perform so good a work johnson in order to do it well it will be necessary to collect all the editions of waltons lives by way of adapting the book to the taste of the present age they have in a later edition left out a vision which he relates dr done had but it should be restored and there should be a critical catalogue given of the works of the different persons whose lives were written by walton and therefore their works must be carefully read by the editor  we then went to trinity college where he introduced me to mr thomas warton with whom we passed a part of the evening we talked of biography  johnson it is rarely well executed they only who live with a man can write his life with any genuine exactness and discrimination and few people who have lived with a man know what to remark about him the chaplain of a late bishop whom i was to assist in writing some memoirs of his lordship could tell me almost nothing  i said mr robert dodsleys life should be written as he had been so much connected with the wits of his time and by his literary merit had raised himself from the station of a footman mr warton said he had published a little volume under the title of the muse in livery johnson i doubt whether dodsleys brother would thank a man who should write his life yet dodsley himself was not unwilling that his original low condition should be recollected when lord lytteltons dialogues of the dead came out one of which is between apicius an ancient epicure and darteneuf a modern epicure dodsley said to me i knew darteneuf well for i was once his footman  biography led us to speak of dr john campbell who had written a considerable part of the biographia britannica johnson though he valued him highly was of opinion that there was not so much in his great work a political survey of great britain as the world had been taught to expect and had said to me that he believed campbells disappointment on account of the bad success of that work had killed him he this evening observed of it that work was his death mr warton not adverting to his meaning answered i believe so from the great attention he bestowed on it johnson nay sir he died of want of attention if he died at all by that book  we talked of a work much in vogue at that time written in a very mellifluous style but which under pretext of another subject contained much artful infidelity i said it was not fair to attack us thus unexpectedly he should have warned us of our danger before we entered his garden of flowery eloquence by advertising springguns and mantraps set here the author had been an oxonian and was remembered there for having turned papist i observed that as he had changed several times  from the church of england to the church of rome  from the church of rome to infidelity  i did not despair yet of seeing him a methodist preacher johnson laughing it is said that his range has been more extensive and that he has once been mohammedan however now that he has published his infidelity he will probably persist in it boswell i am not quite sure of that sir  i mentioned sir richard steel having published his christian hero with the avowed purpose of obliging himself to lead a religious life yet that his conduct was by no means strictly suitable johnson steel i believe practiced the lighter vices  mr warton being engaged could not sup with us at our inn we had therefore another evening by ourselves i asked johnson whether a mans being forward in making himself known to eminent people and seeing as much of life and getting as much information as he could in every way was not yet lessening himself by his forwardness johnson no sir a man always makes himself greater as he increases his knowledge  i censured some ludicrous fantastic dialogues between two coachhorses and other such stuff which baretti had lately published he joined with me and said nothing odd will do long tristram shandy did not last i expressed a desire to be acquainted with a lady who had been much talked of and universally celebrated for extraordinary address and insinuation johnson never believe extraordinary characters which you hear of people depend upon it sir they are exaggerated you do not see one man shoot a great deal higher than another i mentioned mr burke johnson yes burke is an extraordinary man his stream of mind is perpetual it is very pleasing to me to record that johnsons high estimation of the talents of this gentleman was uniform from their early acquaintance sir joshua reynolds informs me that when mr burke was first elected a member of parliament and sir john hawkins expressed a wonder at his attaining a seat johnson said now we who know burke know that he will be one of the first men in this country and once when johnson was ill and unable to exert himself as much as usual without fatigue mr burke having been mentioned he said that fellow calls forth all my powers were i to see burke now it would kill me so much was he accustomed to consider conversation as a contest and such was his notion of burke as an opponent  next morning thursday march    we set out in a postchaise to pursue our ramble it was a delightful day and we drove through blenheim park when i looked at the magnificent bridge built by john duke of marlborough over a small rivulet and recollected the epigram made upon it  the lofty arch his high ambition shows the stream an emblem of his bounty flows and saw that now by the genius of brown a magnificent body of water was collected i said they have drowned the epigram i observed to him while in the midst of the noble scene around us you and i sir have i think seen together the extremes of what can be seen in britain  the wild rough island of mull and blenheim park  we dined at an excellent inn at chapelhouse where he expatiated on the felicity of england in its taverns and inns and triumphed over the french for not having in any perfection the tavern life there is no private house said he in which people can enjoy themselves so well as at a capital tavern let there be ever so great plenty of good things ever so much grandeur ever so much elegance ever so much desire that every body should be easy in the nature of things it cannot be there must always be some degree of care and anxiety the master of the house is anxious to entertain his guests the guests are anxious to be agreeable to him and no man but a very impudent dog indeed can as freely command what is in another mans house as if it were his own whereas at a tavern there is a general freedom from anxiety you are sure you are welcome and the more noise you make the more trouble you give the more good things you call for the welcomer you are no servants will attend you with the alacrity which waiters do who are incited by the prospect of an immediate reward in proportion as they please no sir there is nothing which has yet been contrived by man by which so much happiness is produced as by a good tavern or inn he then repeated with great emotion shenstones lines  whoever has traveled lifes dull round wherever his stages may have been may sigh to think he still has found the warmest welcome at an inn we happened to lie this night at the inn at henley where shenstone wrote these lines  in the afternoon as we were driven rapidly along in the postchaise he said to me life has not many things better than this  we stopped at stratforduponavon and drank tea and coffee and it pleased me to be with him upon the classick ground of shakspeares native place  he spoke slightingly of dyers fleece  the subject sir cannot be made poetical how can a man write poetically of serges and druggets yet you will hear many people talk to you gravely of that excellent poem the fleece having talked of dr graingers sugarcane i mentioned to him mr langtons having told me that this poem when read in manuscript at sir joshua reynoldss had made all the assembled wits burst into a laugh when after much blankverse pomp the poet began a new paragraph thus now muse let us sing of rats and what increased the ridicule was that one of the company who slily overlooked the reader perceived that the word had been originally mice and had been altered to rats as more dignified such is this little laughable incident which has been often related dr percy the bishop of dromore who was an intimate friend of dr grainger and has a particular regard for his memory has communicated to me the following explanation  the passage in question was originally not liable to such a perversion for the author having occasion in that part of his work to mention the havoc made by rats and mice had introduced the subject in a kind of mock heroic and a parody of homers battle of the frogs and mice invoking the muse of the old grecian bard in an elegant and wellturned manner in that state i had seen it but afterward unknown to me and other friends he had been persuaded contrary to his own better judgment to alter it so as to produce the unlucky effect above mentioned  the bishop gives this character of dr grainger  he was not only a man of genius and learning but had many excellent virtues being one of the most generous friendly and benevolent men i ever knew     johnson said that dr grainger was an agreeable man a man who would do any good that was in his power his translation of tibullus he thought was very well done but the sugarcane a poem did not please him for he exclaimed what could he make of a sugarcane one might as well write the parsleybed a poem or the cabbagegarden a poem boswell you must then pickle your cabbage with the sal atticum johnson you know there is already the hopgarden a poem and i think one could say a great deal about cabbage the poem might begin with the advantages of civilized society over a rude state exemplified by the scotch who had no cabbages till oliver cromwells soldiers introduced them and one might thus show how arts are propagated by conquest as they were by the roman arms he seemed to be much diverted with the fertility of his own fancy  i told him that i heard dr percy was writing the history of the wolf in great britain johnson the wolf sir why the wolf why does he not write of the bear which we had formerly nay it is said we had the beaver or why does he not write of the gray rat the hanover rat as it is called because it is said to have come into this country about the time that the family of hanover came i should like to see the history of the gray rat by thomas percy d d chaplain in ordinary to his majesty laughing immoderately boswell i am afraid a court chaplain could not decently write of the gray rat johnson sir he need not give it the name of the hanover rat thus could he indulge a luxuriant sportive imagination when talking of a friend whom he loved and esteemed  he mentioned to me the singular history of an ingenious acquaintance he settled as a physician in one of the leeward islands a man was sent out to him merely to compound his medicines this fellow set up as a rival to him in his practice of physic and got so much the better of him in the opinion of the people of the island that he carried away all the business upon which he returned to england and soon after died  on friday march    having set out early from henley where we had lain the preceding night we arrived at birmingham about nine oclock and after breakfast went to call on his old schoolfellow mr hector a very stupid maid who opened the door told us that her master was gone out he was gone to the country she could not tell when he would return in short she gave us a miserable reception and johnson observed she would have behaved no better to people who wanted him in the way of his profession he said to her my name is johnson tell him i called will you remember the name she answered with rustic simplicity in the warwickshire pronunciation i dont understand you sir  blockhead said he i will write i never heard the word blockhead applied to a woman before though i do not see why it should not when there is evident occasion for it he however made another attempt to make her understand him and roared loud in her ear johnson and then she catched the sound  we then called on mr lloyd one of the people called quakers he too was not at home but mrs lloyd was and received us courteously and asked us to dinner johnson said to me after the uncertainty of all human things at hectors this invitation came very well we walked about the town and he was pleased to see it increasing  i talked of legitimation by subsequent marriage which obtained in the roman law and still obtains in the law of scotland johnson i think it a bad thing because the chastity of women being of the utmost importance as all property depends upon it they who forfeit it should not have any possibility of being restored to good character nor should the children by an illicit connection attain the full rights of lawful children by the posteriour consent of the offending parties his opinion upon this subject deserves consideration upon his principle there may at times be a hardship and seemingly a strange one upon individuals but the general good of society is better secured and after all it is unreasonable in an individual to repine that he has not the advantage of a state which is made different from his own by the social institution under which he is born a woman does not complain that her brother who is younger than her gets their common fathers estate why then should a natural son complain that a younger brother by the same parents lawfully begotten gets it the operation of law is similar in both cases besides an illegitimate son who has a younger legitimate brother by the same father and mother has no stronger claim to the fathers estate than if that legitimate brother had only the same father from whom alone the estate descends  mr lloyd joined us in the street and in a little while we met friend hector as mr lloyd called him it gave me pleasure to observe the joy which johnson and he expressed on seeing each other again mr lloyd and i left them together while he obligingly showed me some of the manufactures of this very curious assemblage of artificers we all met at dinner at mr lloyds where we were entertained with great hospitality mr and mrs lloyd had been married the same year with their majestys and like them had been blessed with a numerous family of fine children their numbers being exactly the same johnson said marriage is the best state for man in general and every man is a worse man in proportion as he is unfit for the married state  i have always loved the simplicity of manners and the spiritualmindedness of the quakers and talking with mr lloyd i observed that the essential part of religion was piety a devout intercourse with the divinity and that many a man was a quaker without knowing it  as dr johnson had said to me in the morning while we walked together that he liked individuals among the quakers but not the sect when we were at mr lloyds i kept clear of introducing any question concerning the peculiarities of their faith but i having asked to look at baskervilles edition of barclays apology johnson laid hold of it and the chapter on baptism happening to open johnson remarked he says there is neither precept nor practice for baptism in the scriptures that is false here he was the aggressor by no means in a gentle manner and the good quakers had the advantage of him for he had read negligently and had not observed that barclay speaks of infant baptism which they calmly made him perceive mr lloyd however was in as great a mistake for when insisting that the rite of baptism with water was to cease when the spiritual administration of christ began he maintained that john the baptist said  my baptism shall decrease but his shall increase whereas the words are  he must increase but i must decrease john iii  0   one of them having objected to the observance of days and months and years johnson answered the church does not superstitiously observe days merely as days but as memorials of important facts christmas might be kept as well upon one day of the year as another but there should be a stated day for commemorating the birth of our savior because there is danger that what may be done on any day will be neglected  mr hector was so good as to accompany me to see the great works of mr bolton at a place which he has called soho about two miles from birmingham which the very ingenious proprietor showed me himself to the best advantage i wish that johnson had been with us for it was a scene which i should have been glad to contemplate by his light the vastness and the contrivance of some of the machinery would have matched his mighty mind i shall never forget mr boltons expression to me i sell here sir what all the world desires to have  power he had about seven hundred people at work i contemplated him as an iron chieftain and he seemed to be a father to his tribe one of them came to him complaining grievously of his landlord for having distrained his goods your landlord is in the right smith said bolton but i will tell you what find you a friend who will lay down one half of your rent and i will lay down the other half and you shall have your goods again  from mr hector i now learnt many particulars of dr johnsons early life which with others that he gave me at different times since have contributed to the formation of this work  dr johnson said to me in the morning you will see sir at mr hectors his sister mrs careless a clergymans widow she was the first woman with whom i was in love it dropped out of my head imperceptibly but she and i shall always have a kindness for each other he laughed at the notion that a man never can be really in love but once and considered it as a mere romantic fancy  on our return from mr boltons mr hector took me to his house where we found johnson sitting placidly at tea with his first love who though now advanced in years was a genteel woman very agreeable and wellbred  johnson lamented to mr hector the state of one of their schoolfellows mr charles congreve a clergyman which he thus described he obtained i believe considerable preferment in ireland but now lives in london quite as a valetudinarian afraid to go into any house but his own he takes a short airing in his postchaise every day he has an elderly woman whom he calls cousin who lives with him and jogs his elbow when his glass has stood too long empty and encourages him in drinking in which he is very willing to be encouraged not that he gets drunk for he is a very pious man but he is always muddy he confesses to one bottle of port every day and he probably drinks more he is quite unsocial his conversation is monosyllabical and when at my last visit i asked him what a clock it was that signal of my departure had so pleasing an effect on him that he sprung up to look at his watch like a greyhound bounding at a hare when johnson took leave of mr hector he said dont grow like congreve nor let me grow like him when you are near me  when he again talked of mrs careless tonight he seemed to have had his affection revived for he said if i had married her it might have been as happy for me boswell pray sir do you not suppose that there are fifty women in the world with any one of whom a man may be as happy as with any one woman in particular johnson aye fifty thousand boswell then sir you are not of opinion with some who imagine that certain men and certain women are made for each other and that they cannot be happy if they miss their counterparts johnson to be sure not sir i believe marriages would in general be as happy and often more so if they were all made by the lord chancellor upon a due consideration of characters and circumstances without the parties having any choice in the matter  i wished to have staid at birmingham tonight to have talked more with mr hector but my friend was impatient to reach his native city so we drove on that stage in the dark and were long pensive and silent when we came within the focus of the lichfield lamps now said he we are getting out of a state of death we put up at the three crowns not one of the great inns but a good old fashioned one which was kept by mr wilkins and was the very next house to that in which johnson was born and brought up and which was still his own property i went through the house where my illustrious friend was born with a reverence with which it doubtless will long be visited an engraved view of it with the adjacent buildings is in the gentlemans magazine for february       we had a comfortable supper and got into high spirits i felt all my toryism glow in this old capital of staffordshire i could have offered incense genio loci and i indulged in libations of that ale which bonniface in the beaux stratagem recommends with such an eloquent jollity  next morning he introduced me to mrs lucy porter his stepdaughter she was now an old maid with much simplicity of manner she had never been in london her brother a captain in the navy had left her a fortune of ten thousand pounds about a third of which she had laid out in building a stately house and making a handsome garden in an elevated situation in lichfield johnson when here by himself used to live at her house she reverenced him and he had a parental tenderness for her  we then visited mr peter garrick who had that morning received a letter from his brother david announcing our coming to lichfield he was engaged to dinner but asked us to tea and to sleep at his house johnson however would not quit his old acquaintance wilkins of the three crowns the family likeness of the garricks was very striking and johnson thought that davids vivacity was not so peculiar to himself as was supposed sir said he i dont know but if peter had cultivated all the arts of gaiety as much as david has done he might have been as brisk and lively depend upon it sir vivacity is much an art and depends greatly on habit i believe there is a good deal of truth in this notwithstanding a ludicrous story told me by a lady abroad of a heavy german baron who had lived much with the young english at geneva and was ambitious to be as lively as they with which view he with assiduous exertion was jumping over the tables and chairs in his lodgings and when the people of the house ran in and asked with surprise what was the matter he answered sh apprens tetre fif  we dined at our inn and had with us a mr jackson one of johnsons schoolfellows whom he treated with much kindness though he seemed to be a low man dull and untaught he had a coarse gray coat black waistcoat greasy leather breeches and a yellow uncurled wig and his countenance had the ruddiness which betokens one who is in no haste to leave his can he drank only ale he had tried to be a cutler at birmingham but had not succeeded and now he lived poorly at home and had some scheme of dressing leather in a better manner than common to his indistinct account of which dr johnson listened with patient attention that he might assist him with his advice here was an instance of genuine humanity and real kindness in this great man who has been most unjustly represented as altogether harsh and destitute of tenderness a thousand such instances might have been recorded in the course of his long life though that his temper was warm and hasty and his manner often rough cannot be denied  i saw here for the first time oat ale and oat cakes not hard as in scotland but soft like a yorkshire cake were served at breakfast it was pleasant to me to find that oats the food of horses were so much used as the food of the people in dr johnsons own town he expatiated in praise of lichfield and its inhabitants who he said were the most sober decent people in england the genteelest in proportion to their wealth and spoke the purest english i doubted as to the last article of this eulogy for they had several provincial sounds as there pronounced like fear instead of like fair once pronounced woonse instead of wunse or wonse johnson himself never got entirely free of his provincial accent garrick sometimes used to take him off squeezing a lemon into a punchbowl with uncouth gesticulations looking round the company and calling out who is for poonsh  very little business appeared to be going forward in lichfield i found however two strange manufactures for so inland a place sailcloth and streamers for ships and i observed them making some saddlecloths and dressing sheepskins but upon the whole the busy hand of industry seemed to be quite slackened surely sir said i you are an idle set of people sir said johnson we are a city of philosophers we work with our heads and make the boobies of birmingham work for us with their hands  there was at this time a company of players performing at lichfield the manager mr stanton sent his compliments and requested leave to wait on dr johnson johnson received him very courteously and he drank a glass of wine with us he was a plain decent wellbehaved man and expressed his gratitude to dr johnson for having once got him permission from dr tailor at ashbourne to play there upon moderate terms garricks name was soon introduced johnson garricks conversation is gay and grotesque it is a dish of all sorts but all good things there is no solid meat in it there is a want of sentiment in it not but that he has sentiment sometimes and sentiment too very powerful and very pleasing but it has not its full proportion in his conversation  when we were by ourselves he told me forty years ago sir i was in love with an actress here mrs emmet who acted flora in hob in the well what merit this lady had as an actress or what was her figure or her manner i have not been informed but if we may believe mr garrick his old masters taste in theatrical merit was by no means refined he was not an elegans formarum spectator garrick used to tell that johnson said of an actor who played sir harry wildair at lichfield there is a courtly vivacity about the fellow when in fact according to garricks account he was the most vulgar ruffian that ever went upon boards  we had promised mr stanton to be at his theater on monday dr johnson jocularly proposed me to write a prologue for the occasion a prologue by james boswell esquire from the hebrides i was really inclined to take the hint methought prologue spoken before dr samuel johnson at lichfield      would have sounded as well as prologue spoken before the duke of york at oxford in charles the seconds time much might have been said of what lichfield had done for shakspeare by producing johnson and garrick but i found he was averse to it  we went and viewed the museum of mr richard green apothecary here who told me he was proud of being a relation of dr johnsons it was truly a wonderful collection both of antiquities and natural curiosities and ingenious works of art he had all the articles accurately arranged with their names upon labels printed at his own little press and on the staircase leading to it was a board with the names of contributors marked in gold letters a printed catalogue of the collection was to be had at a booksellers johnson expressed his admiration of the activity and diligence and good fortune of mr green in getting together in his situation so great a variety of things and mr green told me that johnson once said to him sir i should as soon have thought of building a man of war as of collecting such a museum mr greens obliging alacrity in showing it was very pleasing his engraved portrait with which he has favored me has a motto truly characteristical of his disposition nemo sibi vivat  a physician being mentioned who had lost his practice because his whimsically changing his religion had made people distrustful of him i maintained that this was unreasonable as religion is unconnected with medical skill johnson sir it is not unreasonable for when people see a man absurd in what they understand they may conclude the same of him in what they do not understand if a physician were to take to eating of horseflesh nobody would employ him though one may eat horseflesh and be a very skilful physician if a man were educated in an absurd religion his continuing to profess it would not hurt him though his changing to it would  we drank tea and coffee at mr peter garricks where was mrs aston one of the maiden sisters of mrs walmsley wife of johnsons first friend and sister also of the lady of whom johnson used to speak with the warmest admiration by the name of molly aston who was afterward married to captain brodie of the navy  on sunday march    we breakfasted with mrs cobb a widow lady who lived in an agreeable sequestered place close by the town called the friary it having been formerly a religious house she and her niece miss adey were great admirers of dr johnson and he behaved to them with a kindness and easy pleasantry such as we see between old and intimate acquaintance he accompanied mrs cobb to st marys church and i went to the cathedral where i was very much delighted with the music finding it to be peculiarly solemn and accordant with the words of the service  we dined at mr peter garricks who was in a very lively humor and verified johnsons saying that if he had cultivated gaiety as much as his brother david he might have equally excelled in it he was today quite a london narrator telling us a variety of anecdotes with that earnestness and attempt at mimickry which we usually find in the wits of the metropolis dr johnson went with me to the cathedral in the afternoon it was grand and pleasing to contemplate this illustrious writer now full of fame worshipping in the solemn temple of his native city  i returned to tea and coffee at mr peter garricks and then found dr johnson at the reverend mr sewards canon residentiary who inhabited the bishops palace in which mr walmsley lived and which had been the scene of many happy hours in johnsons early life mr seward had with ecclesiastical hospitality and politeness asked me in the morning merely as a stranger to dine with him and in the afternoon when i was introduced to him he asked dr johnson and me to spend the evening and sup with him he was a genteel wellbred dignified clergyman had traveled with lord charles fitzroy uncle of the present duke of grafton who died when abroad and he had lived much in the great world he was an ingenious and literary man had published an edition of beaumont and fletcher and written verses in dodsleys collection his lady was the daughter of mr hunter johnsons first schoolmaster and now for the first time i had the pleasure of seeing his celebrated daughter miss anna seward to whom i have since been indebted for many civilities as well as some obliging communications concerning johnson  mr seward mentioned to us the observations which he had made upon the strata of earth in volcanos from which it appeared that they were so very different in depth in different periods that no calculation whatever could be made as to the time required for their formation this fully refuted an antimosaical remark introduced into captain brydones entertaining tour i hope heedlessly from a kind of vanity which is too common in those who have not sufficiently studied the most important of all subjects dr johnson indeed had said before independent of this observation shall all the accumulated evidence of the history of the world  shall the authority of what is unquestionably the most ancient writing be overturned by an uncertain remark such as this  on monday march    we breakfasted at mrs lucy porters he had sent an express to dr taylors acquainting him of our being at lichfield and tailor had returned an answer that his postchaise should come for us this day while we sat at breakfast dr johnson received a letter by the post which seemed to agitate him very much when he had read it he exclaimed one of the most dreadful things that has happened in my time the phrase my time like the word age is usually understood to refer to an event of a public or general nature i imagined something like an assassination of the king  like a gunpowder plot carried into execution  or like another fire of london when asked what is it sir he answered mr thrale has lost his only son this was no doubt a very great affliction to mr and mrs thrale which their friends would consider accordingly but from the manner in which the intelligence of it was communicated by johnson it appeared for the moment to be comparatively small i however soon felt a sincere concern and was curious to observe how dr johnson would be affected he said this is a total extinction to their family as much as if they were sold into captivity upon my mentioning that mr thrale had daughters who might inherit his wealth  daughters said johnson warmly he will no more value his daughters than   i was going to speak  sir said he dont you know how you yourself think sir he wishes to propagate his name in short i saw male succession strong in his mind even where there was no name no family of any long standing i said it was lucky he was not present when this misfortune happened johnson it is lucky for me people in distress never think that you feel enough boswell and sir they will have the hope of seeing you which will be a relief in the mean time and when you get to them the pain will be so far abated that they will be capable of being consoled by you which in the first violence of it i believe would not be the case johnson no sir violent pain of mind as violent pain of body must be severely felt boswell i own sir i have not so much feeling for the distress of others as some people have or pretend to have but i know this that i would do all in my power to relieve them johnson sir it is affectation to pretend to feel the distress of others as much as they do themselves it is equally so as if one should pretend to feel as much pain while a friends leg is cutting off as he does no sir you have expressed the rational and just nature of sympathy i would have gone to the extremity of the earth to have preserved this boy  he was soon quite calm the letter was from mr thrales clerk and concluded i need not say how much they wish to see you in london he said we shall hasten back from taylors  mrs lucy porter and some other ladies of the place talked a great deal of him when he was out of the room not only with veneration but affection it pleased me to find that he was so much beloved in his native city  mrs aston whom i had seen the preceding night and her sister mrs gastrel a widow lady had each a house and garden and pleasure ground prettily situated upon stowhill a gentle eminence adjoining to lichfield johnson walked away to dinner there leaving me by myself without any apology i wondered at this want of that facility of manners from which a man has no difficulty in carrying a friend to a house where he is intimate i felt it very unpleasant to be thus left in solitude in a country town where i was an entire stranger and began to think myself unkindly deserted but i was soon relieved and convinced that my friend instead of being deficient in delicacy had conducted the matter with perfect propriety for i received the following note in his handwriting mrs gastrel at the lower house on stowhill desires mr boswells company to dinner at two i accepted of the invitation and had here another proof how amiable his character was in the opinion of those who knew him best i was not informed till afterward that mrs gastrels husband was the clergyman who while he lived at stratford upon avon where he was proprietor of shakspeares garden with gothic barbarity cut down his mulberrytree and as dr johnson told me did it to vex his neighbors his lady i have reason to believe participated in the guilt of what the enthusiasts for our immortal bard deem almost a species of sacrilege  after dinner dr johnson wrote a letter to mrs thrale on the death of her son i said it would be very distressing to thrale but she would soon forget it as she had so many things to think of johnson no sir thrale will forget it first she has many things that she may think of he has many things that he must think of this was a very just remark upon the different effect of those light pursuits which occupy a vacant and easy mind and those serious engagements which arrest attention and keep us from brooding over grief  he observed of lord bute it was said of augustus that it would have been better for rome that he had never been born or had never died so it would have been better for this nation if lord bute had never been minister or had never resigned  in the evening we went to the town hall which was converted into a temporary theater and saw theodosius with the stratford jubilee i was happy to see dr johnson sitting in a conspicuous part of the pit and receiving affectionate homage from all his acquaintance we were quite gay and merry i afterward mentioned to him that i condemned myself for being so when poor mr and mrs thrale were in such distress johnson you are wrong sir twenty years hence mr and mrs thrale will not suffer much pain from the death of their son now sir you are to consider that distance of place as well as distance of time operates upon the human feelings i would not have you be gay in the presence of the distressed because it would shock them but you may be gay at a distance pain for the loss of a friend or of a relation whom we love is occasioned by the want which we feel in time the vacuity is filled with something else or sometimes the vacuity closes up of itself  mr seward and mr pearson another clergyman here supt with us at our inn and after they left us we sat up late as we used to do in london  here i shall record some fragments of my friends conversation during this jaunt  marriage sir is much more necessary to a man than to a woman for he is much less able to supply himself with domestic comforts you will recollect my saying to some ladies the other day that i had often wondered why young women should marry as they have so much more freedom and so much more attention paid to them while unmarried than when married i indeed did not mention the strong reason for their marrying  the mechanical reason boswell why that is a strong one but does not imagination make it seem much more important than it is in reality is it not to a certain degree a delusion in us as well as in women johnson why yes sir but it is a delusion that is always beginning again boswell i dont know but there is upon the whole more misery than happiness produced by that passion johnson i dont think so sir  never speak of a man in his own presence it is always indelicate and may be offensive  questioning is not the mode of conversation among gentlemen it is assuming a superiority and it is particularly wrong to question a man concerning himself there may be parts of his former life which he may not wish to be made known to other persons or even brought to his own recollection  a man should be careful never to tell tales of himself to his own disadvantage people may be amused and laugh at the time but they will be remembered and brought out against him upon some subsequent occasion  much may be done if a man puts his whole mind to a particular object by doing so norton has made himself the great lawyer that he is allowed to be  i mentioned an acquaintance of mine a sectary who was a very religious man who not only attended regularly on public worship with those of his communion but made a particular study of the scriptures and even wrote a commentary on some parts of them yet was known to be very licentious in indulging himself with women maintaining that men are to be saved by faith alone and that the christian religion had not prescribed any fixed rule for the intercourse between the sexes johnson sir there is no trusting to that crazy piety  i observed that it was strange how well scotchmen were known to one another in their own country though born in very distant counties for we do not find that the gentlemen of neighboring counties in england are mutually known to each other johnson with his usual acuteness at once saw and explained the reason of this why sir you have edinburgh where the gentlemen from all your counties meet and which is not so large but that they are all known there is no such common place of collection in england except london where from its great size and diffusion many of those who reside in contiguous counties of england may long remain unknown to each other  on tuesday march    there came for us an equipage properly suited to a wealthy wellbeneficed clergyman  dr taylors large roomy postchaise drawn by four stout plump horses and driven by two steady jolly postillions which conveyed us to ashbourne where i found my friends schoolfellow living upon an establishment perfectly corresponding with his substantial creditable equipage his house garden pleasuregrounds table in short every thing good and no scantiness appearing every man should form such a plan of living as he can execute completely let him not draw an outline wider than he can fill up i have seen many skeletons of show and magnificence which excite at once ridicule and pity dr tailor had a good estate of his own and good preferment in the church being a prebendary of westminster and rector of bosworth he was a diligent justice of the peace and presided over the town of ashbourne to the inhabitants of which i was told he was very liberal and as a proof of this it was mentioned to me he had the preceding winter distributed two hundred pounds among such of them as stood in need of his assistance he had consequently a considerable political interest in the county of derby which he employed to support the devonshire family for though the schoolfellow and friend of johnson he was a whig i could not perceive in his character much congeniality of any sort with that of johnson who however said to me sir he has a very strong understanding his size and figure and countenance and manner were that of a hearty english squire with the parson superinduced and i took particular notice of his upper servant mr peters a decent grave man in purple clothes and a large white wig like the butler or major domo of a bishop  dr johnson and dr tailor met with great cordiality and johnson soon gave him the same sad account of their schoolfellow congreve that he had given to mr hector adding a remark of such moment to the rational conduct of a man in the decline of life that it deserves to be imprinted upon every mind there is nothing against which an old man should be so much upon his guard as putting himself to nurse innumerable have been the melancholy instances of men once distinguished for firmness resolution and spirit who in their latter days have been governed like children by interested female artifice  dr tailor commended a physician who was known to him and dr johnson and said i fight many battles for him as many people in the country dislike him johnson but you should consider sir that by every one of your victories he is a loser for every man of whom you get the better will be very angry and will resolve not to employ him whereas if people get the better of you in argument about him they will think well send for dr  nevertheless this was an observation deep and sure in human nature  next day we talked of a book in which an eminent judge was arraigned before the bar of the public as having pronounced an unjust decision in a great cause dr johnson maintained that this publication would not give any uneasiness to the judge for said he either he acted honestly or he meant to do injustice if he acted honestly his own consciousness will protect him if he meant to do injustice he will be glad to see the man who attacks him so much vexed  next day as dr johnson had acquainted dr tailor of the reason for his returning speedily to london it was resolved that we should set out after dinner a few of dr taylors neighbors were his guests that day  dr johnson talked with approbation of one who had attained to the state of the philosophical wise man that is to have no want of any thing then sir said i the savage is a wise man sir said he i do not mean simply being without  but not having a want i maintained against this proposition that it was better to have fine clothes for instance than not to feel the want of them johnson no sir fine clothes are good only as they supply the want of other means of procuring respect was charles the twelfth think you less respected for his coarse blue coat and black stock and you find the king of prussia dresses plain because the dignity of his character is sufficient i here brought myself into a scrape for i heedlessly said would not you sir be the better for velvet and embroidery johnson sir you put an end to all argument when you introduce your opponent himself have you no better manners there is your want i apologized by saying i had mentioned him as an instance of one who wanted as little as any man in the world and yet perhaps might receive some additional luster from dress  having left ashbourne in the evening we stopped to change horses at derby and availed ourselves of a moment to enjoy the conversation of my countryman dr butter then physician there he was in great indignation because lord mountstuarts bill for a scotch militia had been lost dr johnson was as violent against it i am glad said he that parliament has had the spirit to throw it out you wanted to take advantage of the timidity of our scoundrels see page     meaning i suppose the ministry it may be observed that he used the epithet scoundrel very commonly not quite in the sense in which it is generally understood but as a strong term of disapprobation as when he abruptly answered mrs thrale who had asked him how he did ready to become a scoundrel madam with a little more spoiling you will i think make me a complete rascal anecdotes of johnson p       he meant easy to become a capricious and selfindulgent valetudinarian a character for which i have heard him express great disgust  johnson had with him upon this jaunt il palermino dinghilterra a romance praised by cervantes but did not like it much he said he read it for the language by way of preparation for his italian expedition  we lay this night at loughborough  on thursday march    we pursued our journey i mentioned that old mr sheridan complained of the ingratitude of mr wedderburne and general fraser who had been much obliged to him when they were young scotchmen entering upon life in england johnson why sir a man is very apt to complain of the ingratitude of those who have risen far above him a man when he gets into a higher sphere into other habits of life cannot keep up all his former connections then sir those who knew him formerly upon a level with themselves may think that they ought still to be treated as on a level which cannot be and an acquaintance in a former situation may bring out things which it would be very disagreeable to have mentioned before higher company though perhaps every body knows of them he placed this subject in a new light to me and showed that a man who has risen in the world must not be condemned too harshly for being distant to former acquaintance even though he may have been much obliged to them it is no doubt to be wished that a proper degree of attention should be shown by great men to their early friends but if either from obtuse insensibility to difference of situation or presumptuous forwardness which will not submit even to an exterior observance of it the dignity of high place cannot be preserved when they are admitted into the company of those raised above the state in which they once were encroachment must be repelled and the kinder feelings sacrificed to one of the very fortunate persons whom i have mentioned namely mr wedderburne now lord loughborough i must do the justice to relate that i have been assured by another early acquaintance of his old mr macklin who assisted him in improving his pronunciation that he had found him very grateful macklin i suppose had not pressed upon his elevation with so much eagerness as the gentleman who complained of him dr johnsons remark as to the jealousy entertained of our friends who rise far above us is certainly very just by this was withered the early friendship between charles townshend and akenside and many similar instances might be adduced  he said it is commonly a weak man who marries for love we then talked of marrying women of fortune and i mentioned a common remark that a man may be upon the whole richer by marrying a woman with a very small portion because a woman of fortune will be proportionally expensive whereas a woman who brings none will be very moderate in expenses johnson depend upon it sir this is not true a woman of fortune being used to the handling of money spends it judiciously but a woman who gets the command of money for the first time upon her marriage has such a gust in spending it that she throws it away with great profusion  he praised the ladies of the present age insisting that they were more faithful to their husbands and more virtuous in every respect than in former times because their understandings were better cultivated it was an undoubted proof of his good sense and good disposition that he was never querulous never prone to inveigh against the present times as is so common when superficial minds are on the fret on the contrary he was willing to speak favorably of his own age and indeed maintained its superiority in every respect except in its reverence for government the relaxation of which he imputed as its grand cause to the shock which our monarchy received at the revolution though necessary and secondly to the timid concessions made to faction by successive administrations in the reign of his present majesty i am happy to think that he lived to see the crown at last recover its just influence  at leicester we read in the newspapers that dr james was dead i thought that the death of an old schoolfellow and one with whom he had lived a good deal in london would have affected my fellowtraveller much but he only said ah poor jamy afterward however when we were in the chaise he said with more tenderness since i set out on this jaunt i have lost an old friend and a young one  dr james and poor harry meaning mr thrales son  having lain at st albans on thursday march    we breakfasted the next morning at barnet i expressed to him a weakness of mind which i could not help  an uneasy apprehension that my wifeand children who were at a great distance from me might perhaps be ill sir said he consider how foolish you should think it in them to be apprehensive that you are ill this sudden turn relieved me for the moment but i afterward perceived it to be an ingenious fallacy i might to be sure be satisfied that they had no reason to be apprehensive about me because i knew that i myself was well but we might have a mutual anxiety without the charge of folly because each was in some degree uncertain as to the condition of the other  i enjoyed the luxury of our approach to london that metropolis which we both loved so much for the high and varied intellectual pleasure which it furnishes i experienced immediate happiness while whirled along with such a companion and said to him sir you observed one day at general oglethorpes that a man is never happy for the present but when he is drunk will you not add  or when driving rapidly in a postchaise johnson no sir you are driving rapidly from something or to something  talking of melancholy he said some men and very thinking men too have not those vexing thoughts sir joshua reynolds is the same all the year round beauclerk except when ill and in pain is the same but i believe most men have them in the degree in which they are capable of having them if i were in the country and were distressed by that malady i would force myself to take a book and every time i did it i should find it the easier melancholy indeed should be diverted by every means but drinking  we stopped at messieurs dillys booksellers in the poultry from whence he hurried away in a hackney coach to mr thrales in the borough i called at his house in the evening having promised to acquaint mrs williams of his safe return when to my surprise i found him sitting with her at tea and as i thought not in a very good humor for it seems when he got to mr thrales he found the coach was at the door waiting to carry mrs and miss thrale and signor baretti their italian master to bath this was not showing the attention which might have been expected to the guide philosopher and friend the imlack who had hastened from the country to console a distressed mother who he understood was very anxious for his return they had i found without ceremony proceeded on their intended journey i was glad to understand from him that it was still resolved that his tour to italy with mr and mrs thrale should take place of which he had entertained some doubt on account of the loss which they had suffered and his doubts afterward proved to be wellfounded he observed indeed very justly that their loss was an additional reason for their going abroad and if it had not been fixed that he should have been one of the party he would force them out but he would not advise them unless his advice was asked lest they might suspect that he recommended what he wished on his own account i was not pleased that his intimacy with mr thrales family though it no doubt contributed much to his comfort and enjoyment was not without some degree of restraint not as has been grossly suggested that it was required of him as a task to talk for the entertainment of them and their company but that he was not quite at his ease which however might partly be owing to his own honest pride  that dignity of mind which is always jealous of appearing too compliant  on sunday march    i called on him and showed him as a curiosity which i had discovered his translation of lobos account of abyssinia which sir john pringle had lent me it being then little known as one of his works he said take no notice of it or dont talk of it he seemed to think it beneath him though done at sixandtwenty i said to him your style sir is much improved since you translated this he answered with a sort of triumphant smile sir i hope it is  on wednesday april   in the forenoon i found him very busy putting his books in order and as they were generally very old ones clouds of dust were flying around him he had on a pair of large gloves such as hedgers use his present appearance put me in mind of my uncle dr boswells description of him a robust genius born to grapple with whole libraries  i gave him an account of a conversation which had passed between me and captain cook the day before at dinner at sir john pringles and he was much pleased with the conscientious accuracy of that celebrated circumnavigator who set me right as to many of the exaggerated accounts given by dr hawkesworth of his voyages i told him that while i was with the captain i catched the enthusiasm of curiosity and adventure and felt a strong inclination to go with him on his next voyage johnson why sir a man does seel so till he considers how very little he can learn from such voyages boswell but one is carried away with the general grand and indistinct notion of a voyage round the world johnson yes sir but a man is to guard himself against taking a thing in general i said i was certain that a great part of what we are told by the travelers to the south sea must be conjecture because they had not enough of the language of those countries to understand so much as they have related objects falling under the observation of the senses might be clearly known but every thing intellectual every thing abstract  politics morals and religion must be darkly guessed dr johnson was of the same opinion he upon another occasion when a friend mentioned to him several extraordinary facts as communicated to him by the circumnavigators slily observed sir i never before knew how much i was respected by these gentlemen they told me none of these things  he had been in company with omai a native of one of the south sea islands after he had been some time in this country he was struck with the elegance of his behavior and accounted for it thus sir he had passed his time while in england only in the best company so that all that he had acquired of our manners was genteel as a proof of this sir lord mulgrave and he dined one day at streatham they sat with their backs to the light fronting me so that i could not see distinctly and there was so little of the savage in omai that i was afraid to speak to either left i should mistake one for the other  we agreed to dine today at the mitretavern after the rising of the house of lords where a branch of the litigation concerning the douglas estate in which i was one of the counsel was to come on i brought with me mr murray solicitorgeneral of scotland now one of the judges of the court of session with the title of lord henderland i mentioned mr solicitors relation lord charles hay with whom i knew dr johnson had been acquainted johnson i wrote something for lord charles and i thought he had nothing to fear from a court martial i suffered a great loss when he died he was a mighty pleasing man in conversation and a reading man the character of a soldier is high they who stand forth the foremost in danger for the community have the respect of mankind an officer is much more respected than any other man who has as little money in a commercial country money will always purchase respect but you find an officer who has properly speaking no money is every where well received and treated with attention the character of a soldier always stands him in stead boswell yet sir i think that common soldiers are worse thought of than other men in the same rank of life such as laborers johnson why sir a common soldier is usually a very gross man and any quality which procures respect may be overwhelmed by grossness a man of learning may be so vicious or so ridiculous that you cannot respect him a common soldier too generally eats more than he can pay for but when a common soldier is civil in his quarters his red coat procures him a degree of respect  the peculiar respect paid to the military character in france was mentioned boswell i should think that where military men are so numerous they would be less valued as not being rare johnson nay sir wherever a particular character or profession is high in the estimation of a people those who are of it will be valued above other men we value an englishman highly in this country and yet englishmen are not rare in it  mr murray praised the ancient philosophers for the candor and good humor with which those of different sects disputed with each other johnson sir they disputed with good humor because they were not in earnest as to religion had the ancients been serious in their belief we should not have had their gods exhibited in the manner we find them represented in the poets the people would not have suffered it they disputed with good humor upon their fanciful theories because they were not interested in the truth of them when a man has nothing to lose he may be in good humor with his opponent accordingly you see in lucian the epicurean who argues only negatively keeps his temper the stoic who has something positive to preserve grows angry being angry with one who controverts an opinion which you value is a necessary consequence of the uneasiness which you feel every man who attacks my belief diminishes in some degree my confidence in it and therefore makes me uneasy and i am angry with him who makes me uneasy those only who believed in revelation have been angry at having their faith called in question because they only had something upon which they could rest as matter of fact murray it seems to me that we are not angry at a man for controverting an opinion which we believe and value we rather pity him johnson why sir to be sure when you wish a man to have that belief which you think is of infinite advantage you wish well to him but your primary consideration is your own quiet if a madman were to come into this room with a stick in his hand no doubt we should pity the state of his mind but our primary consideration would be to take care of ourselves we should knock him down first and pity him afterward no sir every man will dispute with great good humor upon a subject in which he is not interested i will dispute very calmly upon the probability of another mans son being hanged but if a man zealously enforces the probability that my own son will be hanged i shall certainly not be in very good humor with him i added this illustration if a man endeavors to convince me that my wife whom i love very much and in whom i have great confidence is a disagreeable woman and is even unfaithful to me i shall be very angry for he is putting me in fear of being unhappy murray but sir truth will always bear an examination johnson yes sir but it is painful to be forced to defend it consider sir how should you like though conscious of your innocence to be tried before a jury for a capital crime once a week  we talked of education at great schools the advantages and disadvantages of which johnson displayed in a luminous manner but his arguments preponderated so much in favor of the benefit which a boy of good parts might receive at one of them that i have reason to believe mr murray was very much influenced by what he had heard today in his determination to send his own son to westminster school  i introduced the topic which is often ignorantly urged that the universities of england are too rich so that learning does not flourish in them as it would do if those who teach had smaller salaries and depended on their assiduity for a great part of their income johnson sir the very reverse of this is the truth the english universities are not rich enough our fellowships are only sufficient to support a man during his studies to fit him for the world and accordingly in general they are held no longer than till an opportunity offers of getting away now and then perhaps there is a fellow who grows old in his college but this is against his will unless he be a man very indolent indeed a hundred a year is reckoned a good fellowship and that is no more than is necessary to keep a man decently as a scholar we do not allow our fellows to marry because we consider academical institutions as preparatory to a settlement in the world it is only by being employed as a tutor that a fellow can obtain any thing more than a livelihood to be sure a man who has enough without teaching will probably not teach for we would all be idle if we could in the same manner a man who is to get nothing by teaching will not exert himself greshamcollege was intended as a place of instruction for london able professors were to read lectures gratis they contrived to have no scholars whereas if they had been allowed to receive but sixpence a lecture from each scholar they would have been emulous to have had many scholars every body will agree that it should be the interest of those who teach to have scholars and this is the case in our universities that they are too rich is certainly not true for they have nothing good enough to keep a man of eminent learning with them for his life in the foreign universities a professorship is a high thing it is as much almost as a man can make by his learning and therefore we find the most learned men abroad are in the universities it is not so with us our uiversities are impoverished of learning by the penury of their provisions i wish there were many places of a thousand a year at oxford to keep first rate men of learning from quitting the university undoubtedly if this were the case literature would have a still greater dignity and splendor at oxford and there would be grander living sources of instruction  i mentioned mr maclaurins uneasiness on account of a degree of ridicule carelessly thrown on his deceased father in goldsmiths history of animated nature in which that celebrated mathematician is represented as being subject to fits of yawning so violent as to render him incapable of proceeding in his lecture a story altogether unfounded but for the publication of which the law would give no reparation dr goldsmith was dead before mr maclaurin discovered the ludicrous error but mr nourse the bookseller who was the proprietor of the work upon being applied to by sir john pringle agreed very handsomely to have the leaf on which it was contained cancelled and reprinted without it at his own expense  this led us to agitate the question whether legal redress could be obtained even when a mans deceased relation was calumniated in a publication mr murray maintained there should be reparation unless the author could justify himself by proving the fact johnson sir it is of so much more consequence that truth should be told than that individuals should not be made uneasy that it is much better that the law does not restrain writing freely concerning the characters of the dead damages will be given to a man who is calumniated in his lifetime because he may be hurt in his worldly interest or at least hurt in his mind but the law does not regard that uneasiness which a man feels on having his ancestor calumniated that is too nice let him deny what is said and let the matter have a fair chance by discussion but if a man could say nothing against a character but what he can prove history could not be written for a great deal is known of men of which proof cannot be brought a minister may be notoriously known to take bribes and yet you may not be able to prove it mr murray suggested that the author should be obliged to show some sort of evidence though he would not require a strict legal proof but johnson firmly and resolutely opposed any restraint whatever as adverse to a free investigation of the characters of mankind what dr johnson has here said is undoubtedly good sense yet i am afraid that law though defined by lord coke the perfection of reason is not altogether with him for it is held in the books that an attack on the reputation even of a dead man may be punished as a libel because tending to a breach of the peace there is however i believe no modern decided case to that effect in the kings bench trinity term    0 the question occurred on occasion of an indictment the king v topham who as a proprietor of a newspaper entitled the world was found guilty of a libel against earl cowper deceased because certain injurious charges against his lordship were published in that paper one of the counsel for mr topham my friend mr constable who is very able to maintain the argument with learning and ingenuity informs me that it is intended to move in arrest of judgment so that we shall probably have a solemn determination upon a point of universal importance no man has a higher reverence for the law of england in general than i have but with all deference i cannot help thinking that prosecution by indictment if a defendant is never to be allowed to justify must often be very oppressive unless juries who i am more and more confirmed in holding to be judges of law as well as of fact interpose   on thursday april   having called on dr johnson i said it was a pity that truth was not so firm as to bid defiance to all attacks so that it might be shot at as much as people chose to attempt and yet remain unhurt johnson then sir it would not be shot at nobody attempts to dispute that two and two make four but with contests concerning moral truth human passions are generally mixed and therefore it must ever be liable to assault and misrepresentation  on friday april   being good friday after having attended the morning service at st clements church i walked home with johnson we talked of the roman catholic religion johnson in the barbarous ages sir priests and people were equally deceived but afterward there were gross corruptions introduced by the clergy such as indulgences to priests to have concubines and the worship of images not indeed inculcated but knowingly permitted he strongly censured the licensed stews at rome boswell so then sir you would allow of no irregular intercourse whatever between the sexes johnson to be sure i would not sir i would punish it much more than is done and so restrain it in all countries there has been fornication as in all countries there has been theft but there may be more or less of the one as well as of the other in proportion to the force of law all men will naturally commit fornication as all men will naturally steal and sir it is very absurd to argue as has been often done that prostitutes are necessary to prevent the violent effects of appetite from violating the decent order of life nay should be permitted in order to preserve the chastity of our wives and daughters depend upon it sir severe laws steadily enforced would be sufficient against those evils and would promote marriage  i stated to him this case  suppose a man has a daughter who he knows has been seduced but her misfortune is concealed from the world should he keep her in his house would he not by doing so be accessory to imposition and perhaps a worthy unsuspecting man might come and marry this woman unless the father inform him of the truth johnson sir he is accessory to no imposition his daughter is in his house and if a man courts her he takes his chance if a friend or indeed if any man asks his opinion whether he should marry her he ought to advise him against it without telling why because his real opinion is then required or if he has other daughters who know of her frailty he ought not to keep her in his house you are to consider the state of life is this we are to judge of one anothers characters as well as we can and a man is not bound in honesty or honor to tell us the faults of his daughter or of himself a man who has debauched his friends daughter is not obliged to say to every body  take care of me dont let me into your houses without suspicion i once debauched a friends daughter i may debauch yours  mr thrale called upon him and appeared to bear the loss of his son with a manly composure there was no affectation about him and he talked as usual upon indifferent subjects he seemed to me to hesitate as to the intended italian tour on which i flattered myself he and mrs thrale and dr johnson were soon to set out and therefore i pressed it as much as i could i mentioned that mr beauclerk had said that baretti whom they were to carry with them would keep them so long in the little towns of his own district that they would not have time to see rome i mentioned this to put them on their guard johnson sir we do not thank mr beauclerk for supposing that we are to be directed by baretti no sir mr thrale is to go by my advice to mr jackson the allknowing and get from him a plan for seeing the most that can be seen in the time that we have to travel we must to be sure see rome naples florence and venice and as much more as we can speaking with a tone of animation  when i expressed an earnest wish for his remarks on italy he said i do not see that i could make a book upon italy yet i should be glad to get two hundred pounds or five hundred pounds by such a work this showed both that a journal of his tour upon the continent was not wholly out of his contemplation and that he uniformly adhered to that strange opinion which his indolent disposition made him utter no man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money numerous instances to refute this will occur to all who are versed in the history of literature  he gave us one of the many sketches of character which were treasured in his mind and which he was wont to produce quite unexpectedly in a very entertaining manner i lately said he received a letter from the east indies from a gentleman whom i formerly knew very well he had returned from that country with a handsome fortune as it was reckoned before means were found to acquire those immense sums which have been brought from thence of late he was a scholar and an agreeable man and lived very prettily in london till his wife died after her death he took to dissipation and gaming and lost all he had one evening he lost a thousand pounds to a gentleman whose name i am sorry i have forgotten next morning he sent the gentleman five hundred pounds with an apology that it was all he had in the world the gentleman sent the money back to him declaring he would not accept it and adding that if mr  had ocasion for five hundred pounds more he would lend it to him he resolved to go out again to the east indies and make his fortune anew he got a considerable appointment and i had some intention of accompanying him had i thought then as i do now i should have gone but at that time i had objections to quitting england  it was a very remarkable circumstance about johnson whom shallow observers have supposed to have been ignorant of the world that very few men had seen greater variety of characters and none could observe them better as was evident from the strong yet nice portraits which he often drew i have frequently thought that if he had made out what the french call une catalogue raisonnee of all the people who had passed under his observation it would have afforded a very rich fund of instruction and entertainment the suddenness with which his accounts of some of them started out in conversation was not less pleasing than surprising i remember he once observed to me it is wonderful sir what is to be found in london the most literary conversation that i ever enjoyed was at the table of jack ellis a moneyscrivener behind the royal exchange with whom i at one period used to dine generally once a week this mr ellis is i believe the last of that profession called scriveners which is one of the london companies but of which the business is no longer carried on separately but is transacted by attorneys and others he is a man of literature and talents he is the author of a hudibrastick version of maphaeuss canto in addition to the aeneid of some poems in dodsleys collection and various other small pieces but being a very modest man has never put his name to any thing he has shown me a translation which he has made of ovids epistles very prettily done there is a good engraved portrait of him by peffer from a picture by fry which hangs in the hall of the scriveners company he is now a very old man i have visited him this day october      0 in his ninetythird year and found his judgment distinct and clear and his memory though faded so as to fail him occasionally yet as he assured me and i indeed perceived able to serve him very well after a little recollection it was agreeable to observe that he was free from the discontent and fretfulness which too often molest old age he in the summer of this year walked to rotherhithe where he dined and walked home in the evening   volumes would be required to contain a list of his numerous and various acquaintance none of whom he ever forgot and could describe and discriminate them all with precision and vivacity he associated with persons the most widely different in manners abilities rank and accomplishments he was at once the companion of the brilliant colonel forrester of the guards who wrote the polite philosopher and of the awkward and uncouth robert levett of lord thurlow and mr sastres the italian master and has dined one day with the beautiful gay and fascinating lady craven lord macartney who with his other distinguished qualities is remarkable also for an elegant pleasantry told me that he met johnson at lady cravens and that he seemed jealous of any interference so said his lordship smiling i kept back  and the next with good mrs gardener the tallowchandler on snowhill  on my expressing my wonder at his discovering so much of the knowledge peculiar to different professions he told me i learnt what i know of law chiefly from mr ballow a very able man i learnt some too from chambers but was not so teachable then one is not willing to be taught by a young man when i expressed a wish to know more about mr ballow johnson said sir i have seen him but once these twenty years the tide of life has driven us different ways i was sorry at the time to hear this but whoever quits the creeks of private connections and fairly gets into the great ocean of london will by imperceptible degrees unavoidably experience this  my knowledge of physic he added i learnt from dr james whom i helped in writing the proposals for his dictionary and also a little in the dictionary itself i also learnt some from dr lawrence but was then grown more stubborn  a curious incident happened today while mr thrale and i sat with him francis announced that a large packet was brought to him from the post office said to have come from lisbon and it was charged seven pounds ten shillings he would not receive it supposing it to be some trick nor did he even look at it but upon enquiry afterward he found that it was a real packet for him from that very friend in the east indies of whom he had been speaking and the ship which carried it having come to portugal this packet with others had been put into the post office at lisbon  i mentioned a new gaming club of which mr beauclerk had given me an account where the members played to a desperate extent johnson depend upon it sir this is mere talk who is ruined by gaming you will not find six instances in an age there is a strange rout made about deep play whereas you have many more people ruined by adventurous trade and yet we do not hear such an outcry against it thrale there may be few people absolutely ruined by deep play but very many are much hurt in their circumstances by it johnson yes sir and so are very many by other kinds of expense i had heard him talk once before in the same manner and at oxford he said he wished he had learnt to play at cards the truth however is that he loved to display his ingenuity in argument and therefore would sometimes in conversation maintain opinions which he was sensible were wrong but in supporting which his reasoning and wit would be most conspicuous he would begin thus why sir as to the good or evil of cardplaying   now said garrick he is thinking which side he shall take he appeared to have a pleasure in contradiction especially when any opinion whatever was delivered with an air of confidence so that there was hardly any topic if not one of the great truths of religion and morality that he might not have been incited to argue either for or against it lord elibank patrick lord elibank who died      had the highest admiration of his powers he once observed to me whatever opinion johnson maintains i will not say that he convinces me but he never fails to show me that he has good reasons for it i have heard johnson pay his lordship this high compliment i never was in lord elibanks company without learning something  we sat together till it was too late for the afternoon service thrale said he had come with intention to go to church with us we went at seven to evening prayers at st clements church after having drank coffee an indulgence which i understood johnson yielded to on this occasion in compliment to thrale  on sunday april   easter day after having been at st pauls cathedral i came to dr johnson according to my usual custom it seemed to me that there was always something peculiarly mild and placid in his manner upon this holy festival the commemoration of the most joyful event in the history of our world the resurrection of our lord and savior who having triumphed over death and the grave proclaimed immortality to mankind  i repeated to him an argument of a lady of my acquaintance who maintained that her husbands having been guilty of numberless infidelities released her from conjugal obligations because they were reciprocal johnson this is miserable stuff sir to the contract of marriage besides the man and wife there is a third party  society and if it be considered as a vow  god and therefore it cannot be dissolved by their consent alone laws are not made for particular cases but for mankind in general a woman may be unhappy with her husband but she cannot be freed from him without the approbation of the civil and ecclesiastical power a man may be unhappy because he is not so rich as another but he is not to seize upon anothers property with his own hand boswell but sir this lady does not want that the contract should be dissolved she only argues that she may indulge herself in gallantries with equal freedom as her husband does provided she takes care not to introduce a spurious issue into his family you know sir what macrobius has told us of julia nunquam enim nisi uavi plena tollo vectorem lib ii c vi  johnson this lady of yours sir i think is very fit for a brothel  mr macbean author of the dictionary of ancient geography came in he mentioned that he had been forty years absent from scotland ah boswell said johnson smiling what would you give to be forty years from scotland i said i should not like to be so long absent from the seat of my ancestors this gentleman mrs williams and mr levett dined with us  dr johnson made a remark which both mr macbean and i thought new it was this that the law against usury is for the protection of creditors as well as of debtors for if there were no such check people would be apt from the temptation of great interest to lend to desperate persons by whom they would lose their money accordingly there are instances of ladies being ruined by having injudiciously sunk their fortunes for high annuities which after a few years ceased to be paid in consequence of the ruined circumstances of the borrower  mrs williams was very peevish and i wondered at johnsons patience with her now as i had often done on similar occasions the truth is that his humane consideration of the forlorn and indigent state in which this lady was left by her father induced him to treat her with the utmost tenderness and even to be desirous of procuring her amusement so as sometimes to incommode many of his friends by carrying her with him to their houses where from her manner of eating in consequence of her blindness she could not but offend the delicacy of persons of nice sensations  after coffee we went to afternoon service in st clements church observing some beggars in the street as we walked along i said to him i supposed there was no civilized country in the world where the misery of want in the lowest classes of the people was prevented johnson i believe sir there is not but it is better that some should be unhappy than that none should be happy which would be the case in a general state of equality  when the service was ended i went home with him and we sat quietly by ourselves he recommended dr cheynes books i said i thought cheyne had been reckoned whimsical  so he was said he in some things but there s no end of objections there are few books to which some objection or other may not be made  upon the question whether a man who had been guilty of vicious actions would do well to force himself into solitude and sadness johnson no sir unless it prevent him from being vicious again with some people gloomy penitence is only madness turned upside down a man may be gloomy till in order to be relieved from gloom he has recourse again to criminal indulgences  on wednesday april  0 i dined with him at mr thrales where were mr murphy and some other company before dinner dr johnson and i passed some time by ourselves i was sorry to find it was now resolved that the proposed journey to italy should not take place this year he said i am disappointed to be sure but it is not a great disappointment i wondered to see him bear with a philosophical calmness what would have made most people peevish and fretful i perceived however that he had so warmly cherished the hope of enjoying classical scenes that he could not easily part with the scheme for he said i shall probably contrive to get to italy some other way but i will not mention it to mr and mrs thrale as it might vex them i suggested that going to italy might have done mr and mrs thrale good johnson i rather believe not sir while grief is fresh every attempt to divert only irritates you must wait till grief be digested and then amusement will dissipate the remains of it  at dinner mr murphy entertained us with the history of mr joseph simpson a schoolfellow of dr johnsons a barrister at law of good parts but who fell into a dissipated course of life incompatible with that success in his profession which he once had and would otherwise have deservedly maintained yet he still preserved a dignity in his deportment he wrote a tragedy on the story of leonidas entitled the patriot he read it to a company of lawyers who found so many faults that he wrote it over again so then there were two tragedies on the same subject and with the same title dr johnson told us that one of them was still in his possession this very piece was after his death published by some person who had been about him and for the sake of a little hasty profit was positively averred to have been written by johnson himself  i said i disliked the custom which some people had of bringing their children into company because it in a manner forced us to pay foolish compliments to please their parents johnson you are right sir we may be excused for not caring much about other peoples children for there are many who care very little about their own children it may be observed that men who from being engaged in business or from their course of life in whatever way seldom see their children do not care much about them i myself should not have had much fondness for a child of my own mrs thrale nay sir how can you talk so johnson at least i never wished to have a child  mr murphy mentioned dr johnsons having a design to publish an edition of cowley johnson said he did not know but he should and he expressed his disapprobation of dr hurd for having published a mutilated edition under the title of select works of abraham cowley mr murphy thought it a bad precedent observing that any author might be used in the same manner and that it was pleasing to see the variety of an authors compositions at different periods  we talked of flatmans poems and mrs thrale observed that pope had partly borrowed from him the dying christian to his soul johnson repeated rochesters verses upon flatman which i think by much too severe  nor that slow drudge in swift pindarick strains flatman who cowley imitates with pains and rides a jaded muse whipped with loose reins i like to recollect all the passages that i heard johnson repeat it stamps a value on them  he told us that the book entitled the lives of the poets by mr cibber was entirely compiled by mr shiels a scotchman one of his amanuenses the booksellers said he gave theophilus cibber who was then in prison ten guineas to allow mr cibber to be put upon the title page as the author by this a double imposition was intended in the first place that it was the work of a cibber at all and in the second place that it was the work of old cibber  mr murphy said that the memoirs of grays life set him much higher in his estimation than his poems did for you there saw a man constantly at work in literature johnson acquiesced in this but depreciated the book i thought very unreasonably for he said i forced myself to read it only because it was a common topic of conversation i found it mighty dull and as to the style it is fit for the second table why he thought so i was at a loss to conceive he now gave it as his opinion that akenside was a superior poet both to gray and mason  talking of the reviews johnson said i think them very impartial i do not know an instance of partiality he mentioned what had passed upon the subject of the monthly and critical reviews in the conversation with which his majesty had honored him he expatiated a little more on them this evening the monthly reviewers said he are not deists but they are christians with as little christianity as may be and are for pulling down all establishments the critical reviewers are for supporting the constitution both in church and state the critical reviewers i believe often review without reading the books through but lay hold of a topic and write chiefly from their own minds the monthly reviewers are duller men and are glad to read the books through  he talked of lord lytteltons extreme anxiety as an author observing that he was thirty years in preparing his history and that he employed a man to point it for him as if laughing another man could point his sense better than himself mr murphy said he understood his history was kept back several years for fear of smollet johnson this seems strange to murphy and me who never felt that anxiety but sent what we wrote to the press and let it take its chance mrs thrale the time has been sir when you felt it johnson why really madam i do not recollect a time when that was the case  talking of the spectator he said it is wonderful that there is such a proportion of bad papers in the half of the work which was not written by addison for there was all the world to write that half yet not a half of that half is good one of the finest pieces in the english language is the paper on novelty yet we do not hear it talked of it was written by grove a dissenting teacher he would not i perceived call him a clergyman though he was candid enough to allow very great merit to his composition mr murphy said he remembered when there were several people alive in london who enjoyed a considerable reputation merely from having written a paper in the spectator he mentioned particularly mr ince who used to frequent toms coffeehouse but said johnson you must consider how highly steel speaks of mr ince he would not allow that the paper on carrying a boy to travel signed philip homebred which was written by the lord chancellor hardwick had merit he said it was quite vulgar and had nothing luminous  johnson mentioned dr barrys system of physic he was a man said he who had acquired a high reputation in dublin came over to england and brought his reputation with him but had not great success his notion was that pulsation occasions death by attrition and that therefore the way to preserve life is to retard pulsation but we know that pulsation is strongest in infants and that we increase in growth while it operates in its regular course so it cannot be the cause of destruction soon after this he said something very flattering to mrs thrale which i do not recollect but it concluded with wishing her long life sir said i if dr barrys system be true you have now shortened mrs thrales life perhaps some minutes by accelerating her pulsation  on thursday april    i dined with him at general paolis in whose house i now resided and where i had ever afterward the honor of being entertained with the kindest attention as his constant guest while i was in london till i had a house of my own there i mentioned my having that morning introduced to mr garrick count neni a flemish nobleman of great rank and fortune to whom garrick talked of abel drugger as a small part and related with pleasant vanity that a frenchman who had seen him in one of his low characters exclaimed comment je ne le crois pas ce nest pas monsieur garrick ce grand homme garrick added with an appearance of grave recollection if i were to begin life again i think i should not play those low characters upon which i observed sir you would be in the wrong for your great excellence is your variety of playing your representing so well characters so very different johnson garrick sir was not in earnest in what he said for to be sure his peculiar excellence is his variety and perhaps there is not any one character which has not been as well acted by somebody else as he could do it boswell why then sir did he talk so johnson why sir to make you answer as you did boswell i dont know sir he seemed to dip deep into his mind for the reflection johnson he had not far to dip sir he had said the same thing probably twenty times before  of a nobleman raised at a very early period to high office he said his parts sir are pretty well for a lord but would not be distinguished in a man who had nothing else but his parts  a journey to italy was still in his thoughts he said a man who has not been in italy is always conscious of an inferiority  from his not having seen what it is expected a man should see the grand object of traveling is to see the shores of the mediterrannean on those shores were the four great empires of the world the assyrian the persian the grecian and the roman  all our religion almost all our law almost all our arts almost all that sets us above savages has come to us from the shores of the mediterranean the general observed that the mediterranean would be a noble subject for a poem  we talked of translation i said i could not define it nor could i think of a similitude to illustrate it but that it appeared to me the translation of poetry could be only imitation johnson you may translate books of science exactly you may also translate history in so far as it is not embellished with oratory which is poetical poetry indeed cannot be translated and therefore it is the poets that preserve languages for we would not be at the trouble to learn a language if we could have all that is written in it just as well in a translation but as the beauties of poetry cannot be preserved in any language except that in which it was originally written we learn the language  a gentleman maintained that the art of printing had hurt real learning by disseminating idle writings  johnson sir if it had not been for the art of printing we should now have no learning at all for books would have perished faster than they could have been transcribed this observation seems not just considering for how many ages books were preserved by writing alone  the same gentleman maintained that a general diffusion of knowledge among a people was a disadvantage for it made the vulgar rise above their humble sphere johnson sir while knowledge is a distinction those who are possessed of it will naturally rise above those who are not merely to read and write was a distinction at first but we see when reading and writing have become general the common people keep their stations and so were higher seize to become general the effect would be the same  goldsmith he said referred every thing to vanity his virtues and his vices too were from that motive he was not a social man he never exchanged mind with you  we spent the evening at mr hooles mr mickle the excellent translator of the lusiad was there i have preserved little of the conversation of this evening dr johnson said thomson had a true poetical genius the power of viewing every thing in a poetical light his fault is such a cloud of words sometimes that the sense can hardly peep through shiels who compiled cibbers lives of the poets was one day sitting with me i took down thomson and read aloud a large portion of him and then asked  is not this fine shiels having expressed the highest admiration well sir said i i have omitted every other line  i related a dispute between goldsmith and mr robert dodsley one day when they and i were dining at tom daviess in      goldsmith asserted that there was no poetry produced in this age dodsley appealed to his own collection and maintained that though you could not find a palace like drydens ode on st cecilias day you had villages composed of very pretty houses and he mentioned particularly the spleen johnson i think dodsley gave up the question he and goldsmith said the same thing only he said it in a softer manner than goldsmith did for he acknowledged that there was no poetry nothing that towered above the common mark you may find wit and humor in verse and yet no poetry hudibras has a profusion of these yet it is not to be reckoned a poem the spleen in dodsleys collection on which you say he chiefly rested is not poetry boswell does not grays poetry sir tower above the common mark johnson yes sir but we must attend to the difference between what men in general cannot do if they would and what every man may do if he would sixteenstring jack towered above the common mark boswell then sir what is poetry johnson why sir it is much easier to say what it is not we all know what light is but it is not easy to tell what it is  on friday april    i dined with him at our friend tom daviess where we met mr cradock a leicestershire gentleman author of zobeide a tragedy and dr harwood who has written and published various works  i introduced aristotles doctrine in his art of poetry of the  the purging of the passions as the purpose of tragedy but how are the passions to be purged by terror and pity said i with an assumed air of ignorance to incite him to talk for which it was often necessary to employ some address johnson why sir you are to consider what is the meaning of purging in the original sense it is to expel impurities from the human body the mind is subject to the same imperfection the passions are the great movers of human actions but they are mixed with such impurities that it is necessary they should be purged or refined by means of terror and pity for instance ambition is a noble passion but by seeing upon the stage that a man who is so excessively ambitious as to raise himself by injustice is punished we are terrified at the fatal consequences of such a passion in the same manner a certain degree of resentment is necessary but if we see that a man carries it too far we pity the object of it and are taught to moderate that passion my record upon this occasion does great injustice to johnsons expression which was so forcible and brilliant that mr cradock whispered me o that his words were written in a book  i observed the great defect of the tragedy of othello was that it had not a moral for that no man could resist the circumstances of suspicion which were artfully suggested to othellos mind johnson in the first place sir we learn from othello this very useful moral not to make an unequal match in the second place we learn not to yield too readily to suspicion the handkerchief is merely a trick though a very pretty trick but there are no other circumstances of reasonable suspicion except what is related by iago of cassios warm expressions concerning desdemona in his sleep and that depended entirely upon the assertion of one man no sir i think othello has more moral than almost any play  talking of a penurious gentleman of our acquaintance johnson said sir he is narrow not so much from avarice as from impotence to spend his money he cannot find in his heart to pour out a bottle of wine but he would not much care if it should sour  he said he wished to see john denniss critical works collected davies said they would not sell dr johnson seemed to think otherwise  davies said of a well known dramatick author that he lived upon potted stories and that he made his way as hannibal did by vinegar having begun by attacking people particularly the players  he reminded dr johnson of mr murphys having paid him the highest compliment that ever was paid to a layman by asking his pardon for repeating some oaths in the course of telling a story  johnson and i supt this evening at the crown and anchor tavern in company with sir joshua reynolds mr langton mr nairne now one of the scotch judges with the title of lord dunsinan and my very worthy friend sir william forbes of pitsligo  we discussed the question whether drinking improved conversation and benevolence sir joshua maintained it did johnson no sir before dinner men meet with great inequality of understanding and those who are conscious of their inferiority have the modesty not to talk when they have drunk wine every man feels himself happy and loses that modesty and grows impudent and vociferous but he is not improved he is only not sensible of his defects sir joshua said that the doctor was talking of the effects of excess in wine but that a moderate glass enlivened the mind by giving a proper circulation to the blood i am said he in very good spirits when i get up in the morning by dinnertime i am exhausted wine puts me in the same state as when i got up and i am sure that moderate drinking makes people talk better johnson no sir wine gives not light gay ideal hilarity but tumultuous noisy clamourous merriment i have heard none of those drunken  nay drunken is a coarse word  none of those vinous flights sir joshua because you have sat by quite sober and felt an envy of the happiness of those who were drinking johnson perhaps contempt  and sir it is not necessary to be drunk ones self to relish the wit of drunkenness do we not judge of the drunken wit of the dialogue between iago and cassio the most excellent in its kind when we are quite sober wit is wit by whatever means it is produced and if good will appear so at all times i admit that the spirits are raised by drinking as by the common participation of any pleasure cockfighting or bearbaiting will raise the spirits of a company as drinking does though surely they will not improve conversation i also admit that there are some sluggish men who are improved by drinking as there are fruits which are not good till they are rotten there are such men but they are medlars i indeed allow that there have been a very few men of talents who were improved by drinking but i maintain that i am right as to the effects of drinking in general and let it be considered that there is no position however false in its universality which is not true of some particular man sir william forbes said might not a man warmed with wine be like a bottle of beer which is made brisker by being set before the fire  nay said johnson laughing i cannot answer that that is too much for me  i observed that wine did some people harm by inflaming confusing and irritating their minds but that the experience of mankind had declared in favor of moderate drinking johnson sir i do not say it is wrong to produce selfcomplacency by drinking i only deny that it improves the mind when i drank wine i scorned to drink it when in company i have drunk many a bottle by myself in the first place because i had need of it to raise my spirits in the second place because i would have nobody to witness its effects upon me  he told us almost all his ramblers were written just as they were wanted for the press that he sent a certain portion of the copy of an essay and wrote the remainder while the former part of it was printing when it was wanted and he had fairly sat down to it he was sure it would be done  he said that for general improvement a man should read whatever his immediate inclination prompts him to though to be sure if a man has a science to learn he must regularly and resolutely advance he added what we read with inclination makes a much stronger impression if we read without inclination half the mind is employed in fixing the attention so there is but one half to be employed on what we read he told us he read fieldings amelia through without stopping we have here an involuntary testimony to the excellence of this admirable writer to whom we have seen that dr johnson directly allowed so little merit  he said if a man begins to read in the middle of a book and feels an inclination to go on let him not quit it to go to the beginning he may perhaps not feel again the inclination  sir joshua mentioned mr cumberlands odes which were just published johnson why sir they would have been thought as good as odes commonly are if cumberland had not put his name to them but a name immediately draws censure unless it be a name that bears down every thing before it nay cumberland has made his odes subsidiary to the fame of another man mr romney the painter who has now deservedly established a high reputation  they might have run well enough by themselves but he has not only loaded them with a name but has made them carry double  we talked of the reviews and dr johnson spoke of them as he did at thrales page  0 of this volume  sir joshua said what i have often thought that he wondered to find so much good writing employed in them when the authors were to remain unknown and so could not have the motive of fame johnson nay sir those who write in them write well in order to be paid well  soon after this day he went to bath with mr and mrs thrale i had never seen that beautiful city and wished to take the opportunity of visiting it while johnson was there having written to him i received the following answer to james boswell esquire dear sir why do you talk of neglect when did i neglect you if you will come to bath we shall all be glad to see you come therefore as soon as you can  but i have a little business for you at london bid francis look in the paperdrawer of the chest of drawers in my bedchamber for two cases one for the attorney general and one for the solicitorgeneral they lie i think at the top of my papers otherwise they are somewhere else and will give me more trouble  please to write me immediately if they can be found make my compliments to all our friends round the world and to mrs williams at home  i am sir your etc sam johnson search for the papers as soon as you can that if it is necessary i may write to you again before you come down       on the   th of april i went to bath and on my arrival at the pelican inn found lying for me an obliging invitation from mr and mrs thrale by whom i was agreeably entertained almost constantly during my stay they were gone to the rooms but there was a kind note from dr johnson that he should sit at home all the evening i went to him directly and before mr and mrs thrale returned we had by ourselves some hours of teadrinking and talk  i shall groupe together such of his sayings as i preserved during the few days that i was at bath  of a person who differed from him in politics he said in private life he is a very honest gentleman but i will not allow him to be so in public life people may be honest though they are doing wrong that is between their maker and them but we who are suffering by their pernicious conduct are to destroy them we are sure that  acts from interest we know what his genuine principles were they who allow their passions to confound the distinctions between right and wrong are criminal they may be convinced but they have not come honestly by their conviction  it having been mentioned i know not with what truth that a certain female political writer whose doctrines he disliked had of late become very fond of dress sat hours together at her toilet and even put on rouge  johnson she is better employed at her toilet than using her pen it is better she should be reddening her own cheeks than blackening other peoples characters  he told us that addison wrote budgells papers in the spectator at least mended them so much that he made them almost all his own and that draper tonsons partner assured mrs johnson that the much admired epilogue to the distressed mother which came out in budgells name was in reality written by addison  the mode of government by one may be ill adapted to a small society but is best for a great nation the characteristick of our own government at present is imbecility the magistrate dare not call the guards for fear of being hanged the guards will not come for fear of being given up to the blind rage of popular juries  of the father of one of our friends he observed he never clarified his notions by filtrating them through other minds he had a canal upon his estate where at one place the bank was too low  i dug the canal deeper said he  he told me that so long ago as      he had read the grave a poem i am sorry that there are no memoirs of the reverend robert blair the author of this poem he was the representative of the ancient family of blair of blair in ayrshire but the estate had descended to a female and afterward passed to the son of her husband by another marriage he was minister of the parish of athelstaneford where mr john home was his successor so that it may be truly called classick ground his son who is of the same name and a man eminent for talents and learning is now with universal approbation solicitorgeneral of scotland  but did not like it much i differed from him for though it is not equal throughout and is seldom elegantly correct it abounds in solemn thought and poetical imagery beyond the common reach the world has differed from him for the poem has passed through many editions and is still much read by people of a serious cast of mind  a literary lady of large fortune was mentioned as one who did good to many but by no means by stealth and instead of blushing to find it fame acted evidently from vanity johnson i have seen no beings who do as much good from benevolence as she does from whatever motive if there are such under the earth or in the clouds i wish they would comeup or come down what soame jennyns says upon this subject is not to be minded he is a wit no sir to act from pure benevolence is not possible for finite beings human benevolence is mingled with vanity interest or some other motive  he would not allow me to praise a lady then at bath observing she does not gain upon me sir i think her emptyheaded he was indeed a stern critic upon characters and manners even mrs thrale did not escape his friendly animadversion at times when he and i were one day endeavoring to ascertain article by article how one of our friends could possibly spend as much money in his family as he told us he did she interrupted us with a lively extravagant sally on the expense of clothing his children describing it in a very ludicrous and fanciful manner johnson looked a little angry and said nay madam when you are declaiming declaim and when you are calculating calculate at another time when she said perhaps affectedly i dont like to fly johnson with your wings madam you must fly but have a care there are clippers abroad how very well was this said and how fully has experience proved the truth of it but have they not clipped rather rudely and gone a great deal closer than was necessary  a gentleman expressed a wish to go and live three years at otaheite or newzealand in order to obtain a full acquaintance with people so totally different from all that we have ever known and be satisfied what pure nature can do for man johnson what could you learn sir what can savages tell but what they themselves have seen of the past or the invisible they can tell nothing the inhabitants of otaheite and newzealand are not in a state of pure nature for it is plain they broke off from some other people had they grown out of the ground you might have judged of a state of pure nature fanciful people may talk of a mythology being amongst them but it must be invention they have once had religion which has been gradually debased and what account of their religion can you suppose to be learnt from savages only consider sir our own state our religion is in a book we have an order of men whose duty it is to teach it we have one day in the week set apart for it and this in general pretty well observed yet ask the first ten gross men you meet and hear what they can tell of their religion  on monday april    he and i made an excursion to bristol where i was entertained with seeing him inquire upon the spot into the authenticity of  rowleys poetry as i had seen him inquire upon the spot into the authenticity of  ossians poetry george catcot the pewterer who was as zealous for rowley as dr hugh blair was for ossian i trust my reverend friend will excuse the comparison attended us at our inn and with a triumphant air of lively simplicity called out i will make dr johnson a convert dr johnson at his desire read aloud some of chattertons fabricated verses while catcot stood at the back of his chair moving himself like a pendulum and beating time with his feet and now and then looking into dr johnsons face wondering that he was not yet convinced we called on mr barret the surgeon and saw some of the originals as they were called which were executed very artificially but from a careful inspection of them and a consideration of the circumstances with which they were attended we were quite satisfied of the imposture which indeed has been clearly demonstrated from internal evidence by several able critics mr tyrwhitt mr warton mr malone   honest catcot seemed to pay no attention whatever to any objections but insisted as an end of all controversy that we should go with him to the tower of the church of st mary redcliff and view with our own eyes the ancient chest in which the manuscripts were found to this dr johnson goodnaturedly agreed and though troubled with a shortness of breathing labored up a long flight of steps till we came to the place where the wondrous chest stood  there said catcot with a bouncing confident credulity there is the very chest itself after this ocular demonstration there was no more to be said he brought to my recollection a scotch highlander a man of learning too and who had seen the world attesting and at the same time giving his reasons for the authenticity of fingal  i have heard all that poem when i was young  have you sir pray what have you heard  i have heard ossian oscar and every one of them  johnson said of chatterton this is the most extraordinary young man that has encountered my knowledge it is wonderful how the whelp has written such things  we were by no means pleased with our inn at bristol let us see now said i how we should describe it johnson was ready with his raillery describe it sir  why it was so bad that boswell wished to be in scotland  after dr johnsons return to london i was several times with him at his house where i occasionally slept in the room that had been assigned to me i dined with him at dr taylors at general oglethorpes and at general paolis to avoid a tedious minuteness i shall groupe together what i have preserved of his conversation during this period also without specifying each scene where it passed except one which will be found so remarkable as certainly to deserve a very particular relation where the place or the persons do not contribute to the zest of the conversation it is unnecessary to encumber my page with mentioning them to know of what vintage our wine is enables us to judge of its value and to drink it with more relish but to have the produce of each vine of one vineyard in the same year kept separate would serve no purpose to know that our wine to use an advertising phrase is of the stock of an ambassador lately deceased heightens its flavor but it signifies nothing to know the bin where each bottle was once deposited  garrick he observed does not play the part of archer in the beaux stratagem well the gentleman should break out through the footman which is not the case as he does it  where there is no education as in savage countries men will have the upper hand of women bodily strength no doubt contributes to this but it would be so exclusive of that for it is mind that always governs when it comes to dry understanding man has the better  the little volumes entitled respublicae which are very well done were a booksellers work  there is much talk of the misery which we cause to the brute creation but they are recompensed by existence if they were not useful to man and therefore protected by him they would not be nearly so numerous this argument is to be found in the able and benignant hutchinsons moral philosophy but the question is whether the animals who endure such sufferings of various kinds for the service and entertainment of man would accept of existence upon the terms on which they have it madame sevigne who though she had many enjoyments felt with delicate sensibility the prevalence of misery complains of the task of existence having been imposed upon her without her consent  that man is never happy for the present is so true that all his relief from unhappiness is only forgetting himself for a little while life is a progress from want to want not from enjoyment to enjoyment  though many men are nominally entrusted with the administration of hospitals and other public institutions almost all the good is done by one man by whom the rest are driven on owing to confidence in him and indolence in them  lord chesterfields letters to his son i think might be made a very pretty book take out the immorality and it should be put into the hands of every young gentleman an elegant manner and easiness of behavior are acquired gradually and imperceptibly no man can say ill be genteel there are ten genteel women for one genteel man because they are more restrained a man without some degree of restraint is insufferable but we are all less restrained than women were a woman sitting in company to put out her legs before her as most men do we should be tempted to kick them in  no man was a more attentive and nice observer of behavior in those in whose company he happened to be than johnson or however strange it may seem to many had a higher estimation of its refinements lord eliot informs me that one day when johnson and he were at dinner at a gentlemans house in london upon lord chesterfields letters being mentioned johnson surprised the company by this sentence every man of any education would rather be called a rascal than accused of deficiency in the graces mr gibbon who was present turned to a lady who knew johnson well and lived much with him and in his quaint manner tapping his box addressed her thus dont you think madam looking toward johnson that among all your acquaintance you could find one exception the lady smiled and seemed to acquiesce  i read said he sharpes letters on italy over again when i was at bath there is a great deal of matter in them  mrs williams was angry that thrales family did not send regularly to her every time they heard from me while i was in the hebrides little people are apt to be jealous but they should not be jealous for they ought to consider that superior attention will necessarily be paid to superior fortune or rank two persons may have equal merit and on that account may have an equal claim to attention but one of them may have also fortune and rank and so may have a double claim  talking of his notes on shakspeare he said i despise those who do not see that i am right in the passage where as is repeated and asses of great charge introduced that on to be or not to be is disputable it may be observed that mr malone in his very valuable edition of shakspeare has fully vindicated dr johnson from the idle censures which the first of these notes has given rise to the interpretation of the other passage which dr johnson allows to be disputable he has clearly shown to be erroneous   a gentleman whom i found sitting with him one morning said that in his opinion the character of an infidel was more detestable than that of a man notoriously guilty of an atrocious crime i differed from him because we are surer of the odiousness of the one than of the error of the other johnson sir i agree with him for the infidel would be guilty of any crime if he were inclined to it  many things which are false are transmitted from book to book and gain credit in the world one of these is the cry against the evil of luxury now the truth is that luxury produces much good take the luxury of building in london does it not produce real advantage in the convenience and elegance of accommodation and this all from the exertion of industry people will tell you with a melancholy face how many builders are in gaol it is plain they are in gaol not for building for rents are not fallen  a man gives half a guinea for a dish of green peace how much gardening does this occasion how many laborers must the competition to have such things early in the market keep in employment you will hear it said very gravely why was not the halfguinea thus spent in luxury given to the poor to how many might it have afforded a good meal alas has it not gone to the industrious poor whom it is better to support than the idle poor you are much surer that you are doing good when you pay money to those who work as the recompense of their labor than when you give money merely in charity suppose the ancient luxury of a dish of peacocks brains were to be revived how many carcases would be left to the poor at a cheap rate and as to the rout that is made about people who are ruined by extravagance it is no matter to the nation that some individuals suffer when so much general productive exertion is the consequence of luxury the nation does not care though there are debtors in gaol nay they would not care though their creditors were there too  the uncommon vivacity of general oglethorpes mind and variety of knowledge having sometimes made his conversation seem too desultory johnson observed oglethorpe sir never completes what he has to say  when i complained of having dined at a splendid table without hearing one sentence of conversation worthy of being remembered he said sir there seldom is any such conversation boswell why then meet at table johnson why to eat and drink together and promote kindness and sir this is better done when there is no solid conversation for when there is people differ in opinion and get into bad humor or some of the company who are not capable of such conversation are left out and feel themselves uneasy it was for this reason sir robert walpole said he always talked bawdy at his table because in that all could join  being irritated by hearing a gentleman ask mr levett a variety of questions concerning him when he was sitting by he broke out sir you have but two topics yourself and me i am sick of both  a man said he should not talk of himself nor much of any particular person he should take care not to be made a proverb and therefore should avoid having any one topic of which people can say we shall hear him upon it there was a dr oldfield who was always talking of the duke of marlborough he came into a coffeehouse one day and told that his grace had spoken in the house of lords for half an hour did he indeed speak for half an hour said belchier the surgeon  yes  and what did he say of dr oldfield  nothing  why then sir he was very ungrateful for dr oldfield could not have spoken for a quarter of an hour without saying something of him  every man is to take existence on the terms on which it is given to him to some men it is given on condition of not taking liberties which other men may take without much harm one man may drink wine and be nothing the worse for it on another wine may have effects so inflammatory as to injure him both in body and mind and perhaps make him commit something for which he may deserve to be hanged  lord hailess annals of scotland have not that pointed form which is the taste of this age but it is a book which will always sell it has such a stability of dates such a certainty of facts and such a punctuality of citation i never before read scotch history with certainty  i asked him whether he would advise me to read the bible with a commentary and what commentaries he would recommend johnson to be sure sir i would have you read the bible with a commentary and i would recommend lowth and patrick on the old testament and hammond on the new  during my stay in london this spring i solicited his attention to another law case in which i was engaged in the course of a contested election for the borough of dunfermline which i attended as one of my friend colonel now sir archibald campbells counsel a man one of his political agents who was charged with having been unfaithful to his employer and having deserted to the opposite party for a pecuniary reward  attacked very rudely in a newspaper the reverend mr james thomson one of the ministers of that place on account of a supposed allusion to him in one of his sermons upon this the minister on a subsequent sunday arraigned him by name from the pulpit with some severity and the agent after the sermon was over rose up and asked the minister aloud what bribe he had received for telling so many lies from the chair of veracity i was present at this very extraordinary scene the person arraigned and his father and brother who had also had a share both of the reproof from the pulpit and in the retaliation brought an action against mr thomson in the court of session for defamation and damages and i was one of the counsel for the reverend defendant the liberty of the pulpit was our great ground of defense but we argued also on the provocation of the previous attack and on the instant retaliation the court of session however the fifteen judges who are at the same time the jury decided against the minister contrary to my humble opinion and several of them expressed themselves with indignation against him he was an aged gentleman formerly a military chaplain and a man of high spirit and honor johnson was satisfied that the judgment was wrong and dictated to me the following argument in confutation of it  of the censure pronounced from the pulpit our determination must be formed as in other cases by a consideration of the action itself and the particular circumstances with which it is invested  the right of censure and rebuke seems necessarily appendant to the pastoral office he to whom the care of a congregation is entrusted is considered as the shepherd of a flock as the teacher of a school as the father of a family as a shepherd tending not his own sheep but those of his master he is answerable for those that stray and that lose themselves by straying but no man can be answerable for losses which he has not power to prevent or for vagrancy which he has not authority to restrain  as a teacher giving instruction for wages and liable to reproach if those whom he undertakes to inform make no proficiency he must have the power of enforcing attendance of awakening negligence and repressing contradiction  as a father he possesses the paternal authority of admonition rebuke and punishment he cannot without reducing his office to an empty name be hindered from the exercise of any practice necessary to stimulate the idle to reform the vicious to check the petulant and correct the stubborn  if we enquire into the practice of the primitive church we shall i believe find the ministers of the word exercising the whole authority of this complicated character we shall find them not only encouraging the good by exhortation but terrifying the wicked by reproof and denunciation in the earliest ages of the church while religion was yet pure from secular advantages the punishment of sinners was public censure and open penance penalties inflicted merely by ecclesiastical authority at a time while the church had yet no help from the civil power while the hand of the magistrate lifted only the rod of persecution and when governors were ready to afford a refuge to all those who fled from clerical authority  that the church therefore had once a power of public censure is evident because that power was frequently exercised that it borrowed not its power from the civil authority is likewise certain because civil authority was at that time its enemy  the hour came at length when after three hundred years of struggle and distress truth took possession of imperial power and the civil laws lent their aid to the ecclesiastical constitutions the magistrate from that time cooperated with the priest and clerical sentences were made efficacious by secular force but the state when it came to the assistance of the church had no intention to diminish its authority those rebukes and those censures which were lawful before were lawful still but they had hitherto operated only upon voluntary submission the refractory and contemptuous were at first in no danger of temporal severities except what they might suffer from the reproaches of conscience or the detestation of their fellow christians when religion obtained the support of law if admonitions and censures had no effect they were seconded by the magistrates with coercion and punishment  it therefore appears from ecclesiastical history that the right of inflicting shame by public censure has been always considered as inherent in the church and that this right was not conferred by the civil power for it was exercised when the civil power operated against it by the civil power it was never taken away for the christian magistrate interposed his office not to rescue sinners from censure but to supply more powerful means of reformation to add pain where shame was insufficient and when men were proclaimed unworthy of the society of the faithful to restrain them by imprisonment from spreading abroad the contagion of wickedness  it is not improbable that from this acknowledged power of public censure grew in time the practice of auricular confession those who dreaded the blast of public reprehension were willing to submit themselves to the priest by a private accusation of themselves and to obtain a reconciliation with the church by a kind of clandestine absolution and invisible penance conditions with which the priest would in times of ignorance and corruption easily comply as they increased his influence by adding the knowledge of secret sins to that of notorious offenses and enlarged his authority by making him the sole arbiter of the terms of reconcilement  from this bondage the reformation set us free the minister has no longer power to press into the retirements of conscience to torture us by interrogatories or put himself in possession of our secrets and our lives but though we have thus controuled his usurpations his just and original power remains unimpaired he may still see though he may not pry he may yet hear though he may not question and that knowledge which his eyes and ears force upon him it is still his duty to use for the benefit of his flock a father who lives near a wicked neighbor may forbid a son to frequent his company a minister who has in his congregation a man of open and scandalous wickedness may warn his parishioners to shun his conversation to warn them is not only lawful but not to warn them would be criminal he may warn them one by one in friendly converse or by a parochial visitation but if he may warn each man singly what shall forbid him to warn them all together of that which is to be made known to all how is there any difference whether it be communicated to each singly or to all together what is known to all must necessarily be public whether it shall be public at once or public by degrees is the only question and of a sudden and solemn publication the impression is deeper and the warning more effectual  it may easily be urged if a minister be thus left at liberty to delate sinners from the pulpit and to publish at will the crimes of a parishioner he may often blast the innocent and distress the timorous he may be suspicious and condemn without evidence he may be rash and judge without examination he may be severe and treat slight offenses with too much harshness he may be malignant and partial and gratify his private interest or resentment under the shelter of his pastoral character  of all this there is possibility and of all this there is danger but if possibility of evil be to exclude good no good ever can be done if nothing is to be attempted in which there is danger we must all sink into hopeless inactivity the evils that may be feared from this practice arise not from any defect in the institution but from the infirmities of human nature power in whatever hands it is placed will be sometimes improperly exerted yet courts of law must judge though they will sometimes judge amiss a father must instruct his children though he himself may often want instruction a minister must censure sinners though his censure may be sometimes erroneous by want of judgment and sometimes unjust by want of honesty  if we examine the circumstances of the present case we shall find the sentence neither erroneous nor unjust we shall find no breach of private confidence no intrusion into secret transactions the fact was notorious and indubitable so easy to be proved that no proof was desired the act was base and treacherous the perpetration insolent and open and the example naturally mischievous the minister however being retired and recluse had not yet heard what was publicly known throughout the parish and on occasion of a public election warned his people according to his duty against the crimes which public elections frequently produce his warning was felt by one of his parishoners as pointed particularly at himself but instead of producing as might be wished private compunction and immediate reformation it kindled only rage and resentment he charged his minister in a public paper with scandal defamation and falsehood the minister thus reproached had his own character to vindicate upon which his pastoral authority must necessarily depend to be charged with a defamatory lie is an injury which no man patiently endures in common life to be charged with polluting the pastoral office with scandal and falsehood was a violation of character still more atrocious as it affected not only his personal but his clerical veracity his indignation naturally rose in proportion to his honesty and with all the fortitude of injured honesty he dared this calumniator in the church and at once exonerated himself from censure and rescued his flock from deception and from danger the man whom he accuses pretends not to be innocent or at least only pretends for he declines a trial the crime of which he is accused has frequent opportunities and strong temptations it has already spread far with much depravation of private morals and much injury to public happiness to warn the people therefore against it was not wanton and officious but necessary and pastoral  what then is the fault with which this worthy minister is charged he has usurped no dominion over conscience he has exerted no authority in support of doubtful and controverted opinions he has not dragged into light a bashful and corrigible sinner his censure was directed against a breach of morality against an act which no man justifies the man who appropriated this censure to himself is evidently and notoriously guilty his consciousness of his own wickedness incited him to attack his faithful reprover with open insolence and painted accusations such an attack made defense necessary and we hope it will be at last decided that the means of defense were just and lawful  when i read this to mr burke he was highly pleased and exclaimed well he does his work in a workmanlike manner as a proof of dr johnsons extraordinary powers of composition it appears from the original manuscript of this excellent dissertation of which he dictated the first eight paragraphs on the  0th of may and the remainder on the   th that there are in the whole only seven corrections or rather variations and those not considerable such were at once the vigorous and accurate emanations of his mind   mr thomson wished to bring the cause by appeal before the house of lords but was dissuaded by the advice of the noble person who now presides so ably in that most honorable house and who was then attorney general as my readers will no doubt be glad also to read the opinion of this eminent man upon the same subject i shall here insert it  case there is herewith laid before you   petition for the reverend mr james thomson minister of dunfermline   answers thereto   copy of the judgment of the court of session upon both   notes of the opinions of the judges being the reasons upon which their decree is grounded   these papers you will please to peruse and give your opinion whether there is a probability of the above decree of the court of sessions being reversed if mr thomson should appeal from the same  i dont think the appeal advisable not only because the value of the judgment is in no degree adequate to the expense but because there are many chances that upon the general complexion of the case the impression will be taken to the disadvantage of the appellant  it is impossible to approve the style of that sermon but the complaint was not less ungracious from that man who had behaved so ill by his original libel and at the time when he received the reproach he complains of in the last article all the plaintiffs are equally concerned it struck me also with some wonder that the judges should think so much fervor apposite to the occasion of reproving the defendant for a little excess  upon the matter however i agree with them in condemning the behavior of the minister and in thinking it a subject fit for ecclesiastical censure and even for an action if any individual could qualify it is curious to observe that lord thurlow has here perhaps in compliment to northbritain made use of a term of the scotch law which to an english reader may require explanation to qualify a wrong is to point out and establish it a wrong and a damage arising from it but this i doubt the circumstance of publishing the reproach in a pulpit though extremely indecent and culpable in another view does not constitute a different sort of wrong or any other rule of law than would have obtained if the same words had been pronounced elsewhere i dont know whether there be any difference in the law of scotland in the definition of slander before the commissaries or the court of session the common law of england does not give way to actions for every reproachful word an action cannot be brought for general damages upon any words which import less than an offense cognisable by law consequently no action could have been brought here for the words in question both laws admit the truth to be a justification in actions for words and the law of england does the same in actions for libels the judgment therefore seems to me to have been wrong in that the court repelled that defense  e thurlow  i am now to record a very curious incident in dr johnsons life which fell under my own observation of which pars magna fui and which i am persuaded will with the liberalminded be much to his credit  my desire of being acquainted with celebrated men of every description had made me much about the same time obtain an introduction to dr samuel johnson and to john wilkes esquire two men more different could perhaps not be selected out from all mankind they had even attacked one another with some asperity in their writings yet i lived in habits of friendship with both i could fully relish the excellence of each for i have ever delighted in that intellectual chemistry which can separate good qualities from evil in the same person  sir john pringle mine own friend and my fathers friend between whom and dr johnson i in vain wished to establish an acquaintance as i respected and lived in intimacy with both of them observed to me once very ingeniously it is not in friendship as in mathematics where two things each equal to a third are equal between themselves you agree with johnson as a middle quality and you agree with me as a middle quality but johnson and i should not agree sir john was not sufficiently flexible so i desisted knowing indeed that the repulsion was equally strong on the part of johnson who i know not from what cause unless his being a scotchman had formed a very erroneous opinion of sir john but i conceived an irresistible wish if possible to bring dr johnson and mr wilkes together how to manage it was a nice and difficult matter  my worthy booksellers and friends messieurs dillys in the poultry at whose hospitable and wellcovered table i have seen a greater number of literary men than at any other except that of sir joshua reynolds had invited me to meet mr wilkes and some more gentlemen on wednesday may    pray said i let us have dr johnson  what with mr wilkes not for the world said mr edward dilly dr johnson would never forgive me  come said i if you will let me negociate for you i will be answerable that all shall go well dilly nay if you will take it upon you i am sure i shall be very happy to see them both here  notwithstanding the high veneration which i entertained for dr johnson i was sensible that he was sometimes a little actuated by the spirit of contradiction and by means of that i hoped i should gain my point i was persuaded that if i had come upon him with a direct proposal sir will you dine in company with jack wilkes he would have flown into a passion and would probably have answered dine with jack wilkes sir i would as soon dine with jack ketch this has been circulated as if actually said by johnson when the truth is it w only  by me  i therefore while we were sitting quietly by ourselves at his house in an evening took occasion to open my plan thus  mr dilly sir sends his respectful compliments to you and would be happy if you would do him the honor to dine with him on wednesday next along with me as i must soon go to scotland johnson sir i am obliged to mr dilly i will wait upon him   boswell provided sir i suppose that the company which he is to have is agreeable to you johnson what do you mean sir what do you take me for do you think i am so ignorant of the world as to imagine that i am to prescribe to a gentleman what company he is to have at his table boswell i beg your pardon sir for wishing to prevent you from meeting people whom you might not like perhaps he may have some of what he calls his patriotick friends with him johnson well sir and what then what care i for his patriotick friends poh boswell i should not be surprised to find jack wilkes there johnson and if jack wilkes should be there what is that to me sir my dear friend let us have no more of this i am sorry to be angry with you but really it is treating me strangely to talk to me as if i could not meet any company whatever occasionally boswell pray forgive me sir i meant well but you shall meet whoever comes for me thus i secured him and told dilly that he would find him very well pleased to be one of his guests on the day appointed  upon the muchexpected wednesday i called on him about half an hour before dinner as i often did when we were to dine out together to see that he was ready in time and to accompany him i found him buffeting his books as upon a former occasion   see page    of this volume  covered with dust and making no preparation for going abroad how is this sir said i dont you recollect that you are to dine at mr dillys johnson sir i did not think of going to dillys it went out of my head i have ordered dinner at home with mrs williams boswell but my dear sir you know you were engaged to mr dilly and i told him so he will expect you and will be much disappointed if you dont come johnson you must talk to mrs williams about this  here was a sad dilemma i feared that what i was so confident i had secured would yet be frustrated he had accustomed himself to show mrs williams such a degree of humane attention as frequently imposed some restraint upon him and i knew that if she should be obstinate he would not stir i hastened down stairs to the blind ladys room and told her i was in great uneasiness for dr johnson had engaged to me to dine this day at mr dillys but that he had told me he had forgotten his engagement and had ordered dinner at home yes sir said she pretty peevishly dr johnson is to dine at home  madam said i his respect for you is such that i know he will not leave you unless you absolutely desire it but as you have so much of his company i hope you will be good enough to forego it for a day as mr dilly is a very worthy man has frequently had agreeable parties at his house for dr johnson and will be vexed if the doctor neglects him today and then madam be pleased to consider my situation  i carried the message and i assured mr dilly that dr johnson was to come and no doubt he has made a dinner and invited a company and boasted of the honor he expected to have i shall be quite disgraced if the doctor is not there she gradually softened to my solicitations which were certainly as earnest as most entreaties to ladies upon any occasion and was graciously pleased to empower me to tell dr johnson that all things considered she thought he should certainly go i flew back to him still in dust and careless of what should be the event indifferent in his choice to go or stay but as soon as i had announced to him mrs williamss consent he roared frank a clean shirt and was very soon dressed when i had him fairly seated in a hackneycoach with me i exulted as much as a sortunehunter who has got an heiress into a postchaise with him to set out for gretnagreen  when we entered mr dillys drawing room he found himself in the midst of a company he did not know i kept myself snug and silent watching how he would conduct himself i observed him whispering to mr dilly who is that gentleman sir  mr arthur lee  johnson tut tut tut under his breath which was one of his habitual mutterings mr arthur lee could not but be very obnoxious to johnson for he was not only a patriot but an american he was afterward minister from the united states at the court of madrid and who is the gentleman in lace  mr wilkes sir this information confounded him still more he had some difficulty to restrain himself and taking up a book sat down upon a windowseat and read or at least kept his eye upon it intently for some time till he composed himself his feelings i dare say were awkward enough but he no doubt recollected his having rated me for supposing that he could be at all disconcerted by any company and he therefore resolutely set himself to behave quite as an easy man of the world who could adapt himself at once to the disposition and manners of those whom he might chance to meet  the cheering sound of dinner is upon the table dissolved his reverie and we all sat down without any symptom of ill humor there were present besides mr wilkes and mr arthur lee who was an old companion of mine when he studied physic at edinburgh mr now sir john miller dr lettsom and mr slater the druggist mr wilkes placed himself next to dr johnson and behaved to him with so much attention and politeness that he gained upon him insensibly no man eat more heartily than johnson or loved better what was nice and delicate mr wilkes was very assiduous in helping him to some fine veal pray give me leave sir  it is better here  a little of the brown  some fat sir  a little of the stuffing  some gravy  let me have the pleasure of giving you some butter  allow me to recommend a squeeze of this orange  or the lemon perhaps may have more zest  sir sir i am obliged to you sir cried johnson bowing and turning his head to him with a look for some time of surly virtue johnsons london a poem v      but in a short while of complacency  foot being mentioned johnson said he is not a good mimick one of the company added a merry andrew a buffoon johnson but he has wit too and is not deficient in ideas or in fertility and variety of imagery and not empty of reading he has knowledge enough to fill up his part one species of wit he has in an eminent degree that of escape you drive him into a corner with both hands but he is gone sir when you think you have got him  like an animal that jumps over your head then he has a great range for his wit he never lets truth stand between him and a jest and he is sometimes mighty coarse garrick is under many restraints from which foot is free wilkes garricks wit is more like lord chesterfields johnson the first time i was in company with foot was at fitzherberts having no good opinion of the fellow i was resolved not to be pleased and it is very difficult to please a man against his will i went on eating my dinner pretty sullenly affecting not to mind him but the dog was so very comical that i was obliged to lay down my knife and fork throw myself back upon my chair and fairly laugh it out no sir he was irresistible foot told me that johnson said of him for loud obstreperous broadsaced mirth i know not his equal  he upon one occasion experienced in an extraordinary degree the efficacy of his powers of entertaining amongst the many and various modes which he tried of getting money he became a partner with a smallbeer brewer and he was to have a share of the profits for procuring customers amongst his numerous acquaintance fitzherbert was one who took his smallbeer but it was so bad that the servants resolved not to drink it they were at some loss how to notify their resolution being afraid of offending their master who they knew liked foot much as a companion at last they fixed upon a little black boy who was rather a favorite to be their deputy and deliver their remonstrance and having invested him with the whole authority of the kitchen he was to inform mr fitzherbert in all their names upon a certain day that they would drink footes smallbeer no longer on that day foot happened to dine at fitzherberts and this boy served at table he was so delighted with footes stories and merriment and grimace that when he went down stairs he told them this is the finest man i have ever seen i will not deliver your message i will drink his smallbeer  somebody observed that garrick could not have done this wilkes garrick would have made the smallbeer still smaller he is now leaving the stage but he will play scrub all his life i knew that johnson would let nobody attack garrick but himself as garrick once said to me and i had heard him praise his liberality so to bring out his commendation of his celebrated pupil i said loudly i have heard garrick is liberal johnson yes sir i know that garrick has given away more money than any man in england that i am acquainted with and that not from ostentatious views garrick was very poor when he began life so when he came to have money he probably was very unskilful in giving away and saved when he should not but garrick began to be liberal as soon as he could and i am of opinion the reputation of avarice which he has had has been very lucky for him and prevented his having many enemies you despise a man for avarice but do not hate him garrick might have been much better attacked for living with more splendor than is suitable to a player if they had had the wit to have assaulted him in that quarter they might have galled him more but they have kept clamouring about his avarice which has rescued him from much obloquy and envy  talking of the great difficulty of obtaining authentic information for biography johnson told us when i was a young fellow i wanted to write the life of dryden and in order to get materials i applied to the only two persons then alive who had seen him these were old swiney and old cibber swineys information was no more than this that at wills coffeehouse dryden had a particular chair for himself which was set by the fire in winter and was then called his winterchair and that it was carried out for him to the balcony in summer and was then called his summerchair cibber could tell no more but that he remembered him a decent old man arbiter of critical disputes at wills you are to consider that cibber was then at a great distance from dryden had perhaps one leg only in the room and durst not draw in the other boswell yet cibber was a man of observation johnson i think not boswell you will allow his apology to be well done johnson very well done to be sure sir that book is a striking proof of the justice of popes remark each might his several province well command would all but stoop to what they understand boswell and his plays are good johnson yes but that was his trade lesprit du corpse he had been all his life among players and playwriters i wondered that he had so little to say in conversation for he had kept the best company and learnt all that can be got by the ear he abused pindar to me and then showed me an ode of his own with an absurd coupler making a linnet soar on an eagles wing see page     of vol i  i told him that when the ancients made a simile they always made it like something real  mr wilkes remarked that among all the bold slights of shakspeares imagination the boldest was making birnamwood march to dunsinane creating a wood where there never was a shrub a wood in scotland ha ha ha and he also observed that the clannish slavery of the highlands of scotland was the single exception to miltons remark of the mountain nymph sweet liberty being worshipped in all hilly countries  when i was at inverary said he on a visit to my old friend archibald duke of argyle his dependents congratulated me on being such a favorite of his grace i said it is then gentlemen truly lucky for me for if i had displeased the duke and he had wished it there is not a campbell among you but would have been ready to bring john wilkess head to him in a charger it would have been only off with his head so much for aylesbury i was then member for aylesbury  dr johnson and mr wilkes talked of the contested passage in horaces art of poetry difficile est proprie communia dicere mr wilkes according to my note gave the interpretation thus it is difficult to speak with propriety of common things as if a poet had to speak of queen caroline drinking tea he must endeavor to avoid the vulgarity of cups and saucers but upon reading my note he tells me that he meant to say that the word communia being a roman law term signifies here things communis juris that is to say what have never yet been treated by any body and this appears clearly from what followed   tuque rectius iliacum carmen deducis in actus quam si proferres ignota indictaque primus   you will easier make a tragedy out of the iliad than on any subject not handled before my very pleasant friend himself as well as others who remember old stories will no doubt startle when i observe that john wilkes here shows himself to be of the warburtonian school it is nevertheless true as appears from dr hurd the bishop of worcesters very elegant commentary and notes on the epistola ad pisones  it is necessary to a fair consideration of the question that the whole passage in which the words occur should be kept in view  si quid inexpertum scenae committis et audes personam formare novam servetur ad imum qualis ab incepto processerit et sibi constet difficile est proprie communia dicere tuque rectius iliacum carmen deducis in actus quam si proferres ignota indictaque primus publica materies privati juris erit si non circa vilem patulumque moraberis orbem nec verbum verbo curabis reddere fidus interpres nec desilies imitator in artum unde pedem proferre pudor vetat aut operis lex the commentary thus illustrates it but the formation of quite new characters is a work of great difficulty and hazard for here there is no generally received and fixed archetype to work after but every one judges of common right according to the extent and comprehension of his own idea therefore he advises to labor and refit old characters and subjects particularly those made known and authorized by the practice of homer and the epick writers  the note is   difficile est proprie communia dicere lambins comment is communia hoc loc appellat horatius argumenta fabularum a nullo adhuc tractata et ita quae cuivis exposita sunt et in medio quodammodo posita quasi vacua et a nemine occupata and that this is the true meaning of communia is evidently fixed by the words ignota indictaque which are explanatory of it so that the sense given it in the commentary is unquestionably the right one yet notwithstanding the clearness of the case a late critic has this strange passage  difficile quidem esse proprie communia dicere hoc est materiam vulgarem notam et e medio petitam ita immutare atque exornare ut nova et scriptori propria videatur ul concedimus et maximi procul dubio ponderis ista est observatio sed omnibus utrinque collatis et tum difficilis tum venusti tam judicii quam ingenii ratione habita major videtur esse gloria fabulam formare penitus novam quam veterem utcunque mutatam de nov exhibere poet prael v ii p     where having first put a wrong construction on the word communia he employs it to introduce an impertinent criticism for where does the poet prefer the glory of refitting old subjects to that of inventing new ones the contrary is implied in what he urges about the superior difficulty of the latter from which he dissuades his countrymen only in respect of their abilities and inexperience in these matters and in order to cultivate in them which is the main view of the epistle a spirit of correctness by sending them to the old subjects treated by the greek writers  for my own part with all deference for dr hurd who thinks the case clear i consider the passage difficile est proprie communia dicere to be a crux for the critics on horace  the explication which my lord of worcester treats with so much contempt is nevertheless countenanced by authority which i find quoted by the learned baxter in his edition of horace  difficile est proprie communia dicere h e res vulgares disertis verbis enarrare vel humile thema cum dignitate tractare difficile est communes res propriis explicare verbis vet schol  i was much disappointed to find that the great critic dr bentley has no note upon this very difficult passage as from his vigorous and illuminated mind i should have expected to receive more satisfaction than i have yet had  sanadon thus treats of it proprie communia dicere cest a dire quil nest pas aise de former a ces personnages dimagination des caracteres particuliers et cependant vralsemblables comme lon a ete le maitre de les former tells quon a voulu les fautes que lon fait en cela sont moins pardonnables cest pourquoi horace conseille de prendre toujours des sujets connus tells que sont par exemple ceux que lon peut tirer des poemes dhomere  and dacier observes upon it apres avoir marque les deux qualites quil faut donner aux personnages quon invente il conseille aux poets tragiques de nuser pas trop facilement de cette lberte quils ont den inventer car il est tres difficile de reussir dans es nouveaux caracteres il est mal aise dit horace de traiter proprement cest a dire convenablement des sujets communs cest a dire des sujets inventes et qui nont aucun fondement ni dans lhistoire ni dans la fable et il les appelle communs parce quils sont en disposition a tout le monde et que tout le monde a le droit de les inventer et quils sont comme on dit au premier occupant see his observations at large on this expression and the following  after all i cannot help entertaining some doubt whether the words difficile est proprie communia dicere may not have been thrown in by horace to form a separate article in a choice of difficulties which a poet has to encounter who chooses a new subject in which case it must be uncertain which of the various explanations is the true one and every reader has a right to decide as it may strike his own fancy and even should the words be understood as they generally are to be connected both with what goes before and what comes after the exact sense cannot be absolutely ascertained for instance whether proprie is meant to signify in an appropriated manner as dr johnson here understands it or as it is often used by cicero with propriety or elegantly in short it is a rare instance of a defect in perspicuity in an admirable writer who with almost every species of excellence is peculiarly remarkable for that quality the length of this note perhaps requires an apology many of my readers i doubt not will admit that a critical discussion of a passage in a favorite classick is very engaging    johnson he means that it is difficult to appropriate to particular persons qualities which are common to all mankind as homer has done  wilkes we have no citypoet now that is an office which has gone into disuse the last was elkanah settle there is something in names which one cannot help feeling now elkanah settle sounds so queer who can expect much from that name we should have no hesitation to give it for john dryden in preference to elkanah settle from the names only without knowing their different merits johnson i suppose sir settle did as well for aldermen in his time as john home could do now where did beckford and tecothick learn english  mr arthur lee mentioned some scotch who had taken possession of a barren part of america and wondered why they should choose it johnson why sir all barrenness is comparative the scotch would not know it to be barren boswell come come he is flattering the english you have now been in scotland sir and say if you did not see meat and drink enough there johnson why yes sir meat and drink enough to give the inhabitants sufficient strength to run away from home all these quick and lively sallies were said sportively quite in jest and with a smile which showed that he meant only wit upon this topic he and mr wilkes could perfectly assimilate here was a bond of union between them and i was conscious that as both of them had visited caledonia both were fully satisfied of the strange narrow ignorance of those who imagine that it is a land of famine but they amused themselves with persevering in the old jokes when i claimed a superiority for scotland over england in one respect that no man can be arrested there for a debt merely because another swears it against him but there must first be the judgment of a court of law ascertaining its justice and that a seizure of the person before judgment is obtained can take place only if his creditor should swear that he is about to fly from the country or as it is technically expressed is in meditatione fugae wilkes that i should think may be safely sworn of all the scotch nation johnson to mr wilkes you must know sir i lately took my friend boswell and showed him genuine civilized life in an english provincial town i turned him loose at lichfield my native city that he might see for once real civility for you know he lives among savages in scotland and among rakes in london wilkes except when he is with grave sober decent people like you and me johnson smiling and we ashamed of him  they were quite frank and easy johnson told the story of his asking mrs macaulay to allow her footman to sit down with them to prove the ridiculousness of the argument for the equality of mankind and he said to me afterward with a nod of satisfaction you saw mr wilkes acquiesced wilkes talked with all imaginable freedom of the ludicrous title given to the attorney general diabolus regis adding i have reason to know something about that officer for i was prosecuted for a libel johnson who many people would have supposed must have been furiously angry at hearing this talked of so lightly said not a word he was now indeed a goodhumoured fellow  after dinner we had an accession of mrs knowles the quaker lady well known for her various talents and of mr alderman lee amidst some patriotick groans somebody i think the alderman said poor old england is lost johnson sir it is not so much to be lamented that old england is lost as that the scotch have found it it would not become me to expatiate on this strong and pointed remark in which a very great deal of meaning is condensed  wilkes had lord bute governed scotland only i should not have taken the trouble to write his eulogy and dedicate mortimer to him  mr wilkes held a candle to show a fine print of a beautiful female figure which hung in the room and pointed out the elegant contour of the bosom with the finger of an arch connoisseur he afterward waggishly insisted with me that all the time johnson showed visible signs of a servant admiration of the corresponding charms of the fair quaker  this record though by no means so perfect as i could wish will serve to give a notion of a very curious interview which was not only pleasing at the time but had the agreeable and benignant effect of reconciling any animosity and sweetening any acidity which in the various bustle of political contest had been produced in the minds of two men who though widely different had so many things in common  classical learning modern literature wit and humor and ready repartee  that it would have been much to be regretted if they had been for ever at a distance from each other  mr burke gave me much credit for this successful negotiation and pleasantly said that there was nothing to equal it in the whole history of the corpse diplomatique  i attended dr johnson home and had the satisfaction to hear him tell mrs williams how much he had been pleased with mr wilkess company and what an agreeable day he had passed  i talked a good deal to him of the celebrated margaret caroline rudd whom i had visited induced by the fame of her talents address and irresistible power of fascination to a lady who disapproved of my visiting her he said on a former occasion nay madam boswell is in the right i should have visited her myself were it not that they have now a trick of putting every thing into the newspapers this evening he exclaimed i envy him his acquaintance with mrs rudd  i mentioned a scheme which i had of making a our to the isle of man and giving a full account of it and that mr burk ad playfully suggested as a motto the proper study of mankind is  johnson sir you will get more by the book th the jaunt will cost you so you will have your diversion for nothing and add  your reputation  on the evening of the next day i took leave of him being to set out for scotland i thanked him with great warmth for all his kindness sir said he you are very welcome nobody repays it with more  how very false is the notion which has gone round the world of the rough and passionate and harsh manners of this great and good man that he had occasional sallies of heat of temper and that he was sometimes perhaps too easily provoked by absurdity and folly and sometimes too desirous of triumph in colloquial contest must be allowed the quickness both of his perception and sensibility disposed him to sudden explosions of satire to which his extraordinary readiness of wit was a strong and almost irresistible incitement to adopt one of the finest images in mr homes douglas    on each glance of thought decision followed as the thunderbolt pursues the flash  i admit that the beadle within him was often so eager to apply the lash that the judge had not time to consider the case with sufficient deliberation  that he was occasionally remarkable for violence of temper may be granted but let us ascertain the degree and not let it be supposed that he was in a perpetual rage and never without a club in his hand to knock down every one who approached him on the contrary the truth is that by much the greatest part of his time he was civil obliging nay polite in the true sense of the word so much so that many gentlemen who were long acquainted with him never received or even heard a severe expression from him  it was i think after i had left london this year that an epitaph which dr johnson had written for the monument of dr goldsmith in westminsterabbey gave occasion to a remonstrance to the monarch of literature for an account of which i am indebted to sir william forbes of pitsligo  that my readers may have the subject more fully and clearly before them i shall first insert the epitaph  olivarii goldsmith poetae physici historici qui nullum fere scribendi genus non tetigit nullum quod tetigit non ornavit sive risus essent movendi sive lacrymae affectuum potens at lenis dominator ingenio sublimis vividus versatilis oratione grandis nitidus venustus hoc monumento memoriam coluit sodalium amor amicorum fides lectorum veneratio natus in hibernia forniae longfordiensis in loco cui nomen pallas nov xxix m dcc xxxi eblanae literis institutus obiit londini april iv m dcc lxxxiv sir william forbes writes to me thus   i enclose the round robin this jeu desprit took its rise one day at dinner at our friend sir joshua reynoldss all the company present except myself were friends and acquaintance of dr goldsmith the epitaph written for him by dr johnson became the subject of conversation and various emendations were suggested which it was agreed should be submitted to the doctors consideration  but the question was who should have the courage to propose them to him at last it was hinted that there could be no way so good as that of a round robin as the sailors call it which they make use of when they enter into a conspiracy so as not to let it be known who puts his name first or last to the paper this proposition was instantly assented to and dr barnard dean of derry now bishop of killaloe drew up an address to dr johnson on the occasion replete with wit and humor but which it was feared the doctor might think treated the subject with too much levity mr burke then proposed the address as it stands in the paper in writing to which i had the honor to officiate as clerk  sir joshua agreed to carry it to dr johnson who received it with much good humor he however upon seeing dr wartons name to the suggestion that the epitaph should be in english observed to sir joshua i wonder that joe warton a scholar by profession should be such a fool mr langton who was one of the company at sir joshuas like a sturdy scholar resolutely refused to sign the round robin the epitaph is engraved upon dr goldsmiths monument without any alteration  and desired sir joshua to tell the gentlemen that he would alter the epitaph in any manner they pleased as to the sense of it but he would never consent to disgrace the walls of westminster abbey with an english inscription  i consider this round robin as a species of literary curiosity worth preserving as it marks in a certain degree dr johnsons character  my readers are presented with a faithful transcript of a paper which i doubt not of their being desirous to see  round robin addressed to samuel johnson l l d with fac similes of the signatures we the circumscribers having read with great pleasure an intended epitaph for the monument of dr goldsmith which considered abstractedly appears to be for elegant composition and masterly style in every respect worthy of the pen of its learned author are yet of opinion that the character of the deceased as a writer particularly as a poet is perhaps not delineated with all the xactness which dr johnson is capable of giving it we therefore with deference to his superior judgment humbly request that he would at least take the trouble of revising it and of making such additions and alterations as he shall think proper upon a farther perusal  but if we might venture to express our wishes they would lead us to request that he would write the epitaph in english rather than in latin as we think that the memory of so eminent an english writer ought to be perpetuated in the language to which his works are likely to be so lasting an ornament which we also know to have been the opinion of he late doctor himself  jos warton  edm burke  tho franklin  ant chamier  g colman    jreynolds   orbes  j barnard  rb sheridan  p metcalfe  e gibbon    london published as the ct directs  0 april      by charles dilly   sir william forbess observation is very just the anecdote now related proves in the strongest manner the reverence and awe with which johnson was regarded by some of the most eminent men of his time in various departments and even by such of them as lived most with him while it also confirms what i have again and again inculcated that he was by no means of that ferocious and irascible character which has been ignorantly imagined  this hasty composition is also to be remarked as one of a thousand instances which evince the extraordinary promptitude of mr burke who while he is equal to the greatest things can adorn the least can with equal facility embrace the vast and complicated speculations of politics or the ingenious topics of literary investigation  besides this latin epitaph johnson honored the memory of his friend goldsmith with a short one in greek which has been obligingly communicated to me by my learned and ingenious friend dr percy the bishop of dromore his lordship procured it from a gentleman in ireland who had it from johnson himself mr archdall who was educated under dr sumner at harrow      dr johnson to mrs boswell madam you must not think me uncivil in omitting to answer the letter with which you favored me some time ago i imagined it to have been written without mr boswells knowledge and therefore supposed the answer to require what i could not find a private conveyance  the difference with lord auchinleck is now over and since young alexander has appeared i hope no more difficulties will arise among you for i sincerely wish you all happy do not teach the young ones to dislike me as you dislike me yourself but let me at least have veronicas kindness because she is my acquaintance  you will now have mr boswell home it is well that you have him he has led a wild life i have taken him to lichfield and he has followed mr thrale to bath pray take care of him and tame him the only thing in which i have the honor to agree with you is in loving him and while we are so much of a mind in a matter of so much importance our other quarrels will i hope produce no great bitterness  i am madam your most humble servant sam johnson may          mr boswell to dr johnson edinburgh june         you have formerly complained that my letters were too long there is no danger of that complaint being made at present for i find it difficult for me to write to you at all here an account of having been afflicted with a return of melancholy or bad spirits  the boxes of books upon a settlement of our account of expenses on our tour to the hebrides there was a balance due to me which dr johnson chose to discharge by sending books which you sent to me are arrived but i have not yet examined the contents         i send you mr maclaurins paper for the negro who claims his freedom in the court of session   dr johnson to mr boswell dear sir these black fits of which you complain perhaps hurt your memory as well as your imagination when did i complain that your letters were too long baretti told me that johnson complained of my writing very long letters to him when i was upon the continent which was most certainly true but it seems my friend did not remember it  your last letter after a very long delay brought very bad news here a series of reflections upon melancholy and  what i could not help thinking strangely unreasonable in him who had suffered so much from it himself  a good deal of severity and reproof as if it were owing to my own fault or that i was perhaps affecting it from a desire of distinction  read cheynes english malady but do not let him teach you a foolish notion that melancholy is a proof of acuteness       to hear that you have not opened your boxes of books is very offensive the examination and arrangement of so many volumes might have afforded you an amusement very seasonable at present and useful for the whole of life i am i confess very angry that you manage yourself so ill       i do not now say any more than that i am with great kindness and sincerity dear sir  your humble servant sam johnson july        it was last year determined by lord mansfield in the court of kings bench that a negro cannot be taken out of the kingdom without his own consent     dr johnson to mr boswell dear sir i make haste to write again lest my last letter should give you too much pain if you are really oppressed with overpowering and involuntary melancholy you are to be pitied rather than reproached       now my dear bozzy let us have done with quarrels and with censure let me know whether i have not sent you a pretty library there are perhaps many books among them which you need never read through but there are none which it is not proper for you to know and sometimes to consult of these books of which the use is only occasional it is often sufficient to know the contents that when any question arises you may know where to look for information  since i wrote i have looked over mr maclaurins plea and think it excellent how is the suit carried on if by subscription i commission you to contribute in my name what is proper let nothing be wanting in such a case dr drummond the son of johnsons old friend mr william drummond see vol i p     he was a young man of such distinguished merit that he was nominated to one of the medical professorships in the college of edinburgh without solicitation while he was at naples having other views he did not accept of the honor and soon afterward died  i see is superseded his father would have grieved but he lived to obtain the pleasure of his sons election and died before that pleasure was abated  langtons lady has brought him a girl and both are well i dined with him the other day       it vexes me to tell you that on the evening of the   th of may i was seized by the gout and am not quite well the pain has not been violent but the weakness and tenderness were very troublesome and what is said to be very uncommon it has not alleviated my other disorders make use of youth and health while you have them make my compliments to mrs boswell  i am my dear sir your most affectionate sam johnson july         mr boswell to dr johnson my dear sir edinburgh july         your letter of the second of this month was rather a harsh medicine but i was delighted with that spontaneous tenderness which a few days afterward sent forth such balsam as your next brought me i found myself for some time so ill that all i could do was to preserve a decent appearance while all within was weakness and distress like a reduced garrison that has some spirit left i hung out flags and planted all the force i could muster upon the walls i am now much better and i sincerely thank you for your kind attention and friendly counsel  count manucci a florentine nobleman mentioned by johnson in his notes of his tour in france i had the pleasure of becoming acquainted with him in london in the spring of this year came here last week from traveling in ireland i have shown him what civilities i could on his own account yours and on that of mr and mrs thrale he has had a fall from his horse and been much hurt i regret this unlucky accident for he seems to be a very amiable man   as the evidence of what i have mentioned at the beginning of this year i select from his private register the following passage  july         o god who have ordained that whatever is to be desired should be sought by labor and who by thy blessing bring honest labor to good effect look with mercy upon my studies and endeavors grant me o lord to design only what is lawful and right and afford me calmness of mind and steadiness of purpose that i may so do thy will in this short life as to obtain happiness in the world to come for the sake of jesus christ our lord amen prayers and meditations p       it appears from a note subjoined that this was composed when he purposed to apply vigorously to study particularly of the greek and italian tongues  such a purpose so expressed at the age of sixtyseven is admirable and encouraging and it must impress all the thinking part of my readers with a consolatory confidence in habitual devotion when they see a man of such enlarged intellectual powers as johnson thus in the genuine earnestness of secrecy imploring the aid of that supreme being from whom comes down every good and every perfect gift  mr boswell to dr johnson edinburgh august  0      after giving him an account of my having examined the chests of books which he had sent to me and which contained what may be truly called a numerous and miscellaneous stall library thrown together at random    lord hailes was against the decree in the case of my client the minister not that he justified the minister but because the parishioner both provoked and retorted i sent his lordship your able argument upon the case for his perusal his observation upon it in a letter to me was dr johnsons suasorium is pleasantly why his lordship uses the epithet pleasantly when speaking of a grave piece of reasoning i cannot conceive but different men have different notions of pleasantry i happened to sit by a gentleman one evening at the openhouse in london who at the moment when medea appeared to be in great agony at the thought of killing her children turned to me with a smile and said  funny enough and artfully composed i suspect however that he has not convinced himself for i believe that he is better read in ecclesiastical history than to imagine that a bishop or a presbyter has a right to begin censure or discipline e cathedra dr johnson afterward told me that he was of opinion that a clergyman had this right   for the honor of count manucci as well as to observe that exactness of truth which you have taught me i must correct what i said in a former letter he did not fall from his horse which might have been an imputation on his skill as an officer of cavalry his horse fell with him  i have since i saw you read every word of grangers biographical history it has entertained me exceedingly and i do not think him the whig that you supposed horace walpoles being his patron is indeed no good sign of his political principles but he denied to lord mountstuart that he was a whig and said he had been accused by both parties of partiality it seems he was like pope while tories call me whig and whigs a tory i wish you would look more into his book and as lord mountstuart wishes much to find a proper person to continue the work upon grangers plan and has desired i would mention it to you if such a man occurs please to let me know his lordship will give him generous encouragement   i again wrote to dr johnson on the   st of october informing him that my father had in the most liberal manner paid a large debt for me and that i had now the happiness of being upon very good terms with him to which he returned the following answer  to james boswell esquire dear sir i had great pleasure in hearing that you are at last on good terms with your father cultivate his kindness by all honest and manly means life is but short no time can be afforded but for the indulgence of real sorrow or contests upon questions seriously momentous let us not throw any of our days away upon useless resentment or contend who shall hold out longest in stubborn malignity it is best not to be angry and best in the next place to be quickly reconciled may you and your father pass the remainder of your time in reciprocal benevolence  do you ever hear from mr langton i visit him sometimes but he does not talk i do not like his scheme of life but as i am not permitted to understand it i cannot set any thing right that is wrong his children are sweet babies  i hope my irreconcilable enemy mrs boswell is well desire her not to transmit her malevolence to the young people let me have alexander and veronica and euphemia for my friends  mrs williams whom you may reckon as one of your wellwishers is in a feeble and languishing state with little hope of growing better she went for some part of the autumn into the country but is little benefited and dr lawrence confesses that his art is at an end death is however at a a distance and what more than that can we say of ourselves i am sorry for her pain and more sorry for her decay mr levett is sound wind and limb  i was some weeks this autumn at brighthelmston the place was very dull and i was not well the expedition to the hebrides was the most pleasant journey that i ever made such an effort annually would give the world a little diversification  every year however we cannot wander and must therefore endeavor to spend our time at home as well as we can i believe it is best to throw life into a method that every hour may bring its employment and every employment have its hour xenophon observes in his treatise of economy that if every thing be kept in a certain place when any thing is worn out or consumed the vacuity which it leaves will show what is wanting so if every part of time has its duty the hour will call into remembrance its proper engagement  i have not practiced all this prudence myself but i have suffered much for want of it and i would have you by timely recollection and steady resolution escape from those evils which have lain heavy upon me  i am my dearest boswell your most humble servant sam johnson boltcourt nov          on the   th of november i informed him that mr strahan had sent me twelve copies of the journey to the western islands handsomely bound instead of the twenty copies which were stipulated but which i supposed were to be only in sheets requested to know how they should be distributed and mentioned that i had another son born to me who was named david and was a sickly infant  to james boswell esquire dear sir i have been for some time ill of a cold which perhaps i made an excuse to myself for not writing when in reality i knew not what to say  the books you must at last distribute as you think best in my name or your own as you are inclined or as you judge most proper every body cannot be obliged but i wish that nobody may be offended do the best you can  i congratulate you on the increase of your family and hope that little david is by this time well and his mamma perfectly recovered i am much pleased to hear of the reestablishment of kindness between you and your father cultivate his paternal tenderness as much as you can to live at variance at all is uncomfortable and variance with a father is still more uncomfortable besides that in the whole dispute you have the wrong side at least you gave the first provocations and some of them very offensive let it now be all over as you have no reason to think that your new mother has shown you any foul play treat her with respect and with some degree of confidence this will secure your father when once a discordant family has felt the pleasure of peace they will not willingly lose it if mrs boswell would but be friends with me we might now shut the temple of janus  what came of dr memiss cause is the question about the negro determined has sir allan any reasonable hopes what is become of poor macquarry let me know the event of all these litigations i wish particularly well to the negro and sir allan  mrs williams has been much out of order and though she is something better is likely in her physicians opinion to endure her malady for life though she may perhaps die of some other mrs thrale is big and fancies that she carries a boy if it were very reasonable to wish much about it i should wish her not to be disappointed the desire of male heirs is not appendant only to feudal tenures a son is almost necessary to the continuance of thrales fortune for what can misses do with a brewhouse lands are fitter for daughters than trades  baretti went away from thrales in some whimsical fit of disgust or ill nature without taking any leave it is well if he finds in any other place as good an habitation and as many conveniences he has got fiveandtwenty guineas by translating sir joshuas discourses into italian and mr thrale gave him an hundred in the spring so that he is yet in no difficulties  colman has bought footes patent and is to allow foot for life sixteen hundred pounds a year as reynolds told me and to allow him to play so often on such terms that he may gain four hundred pounds more what colman can get by this bargain but trouble and hazard i do not see  i am dear sir your humble servant sam johnson dec          the reverend dr hugh blair who had long been admired as a preacher at edinburgh thought now of diffusing his excellent sermons more extensively and increasing his reputation by publishing a collection of them he transmitted the manuscript to mr strahan the printer who after keeping it for some time wrote a letter to him discouraging the publication such at first was the unpropitious state of one of the most successful theological books that has ever appeared mr strahan however had sent one of the sermons to dr johnson for his opinion and after his unfavourable letter to dr blair had been sent off he received from johnson on christmaseve a note in which was the following paragraph  i have read over dr blairs first sermon with more than approbation to say it is good is to say too little  i believe mr strahan had very soon after this time a conversation with dr johnson concerning them and then he very heartily wrote again to dr blair enclosing johnsons note and agreeing to purchase the volume for which he and mr cadell gave one hundred pounds the sale was so rapid and extensive and the approbation of the public so high that to their honor be it recorded the proprietors made dr blair a present first of one sum and afterward of another of fifty pounds thus voluntarily doubling the stipulated price and when he prepared another volume they gave him at once three hundred pounds being in all five hundred pounds by an agreement to which i am a subscribing witness and now for a third octavo volume he has received no less than six hundred pounds  prayers and meditations that johnson suffered much from a state of mind unsettled and perplexed and from that constitutional gloom which together with his extreme humility and anxiety with regard to his religious state made him contemplate himself through too dark and unfavourable a medium it may be said of him that he saw god in clouds certain we may be of his injustice to himself in the following lamentable paragraph which it is painful to think came from the contrite heart of this great man to whose labors the world is so much indebted when i survey my past life i discover nothing but a barren waste of time with some disorders of body and disturbances of the mind very near to madness which i hope he that made me will suffer to extenuate many faults and excuse many deficiencies prayers and meditations p      but we find his devotions in this year eminently servent and we are comforted by observing intervals of quiet composure and gladness  on easter day we find the following emphatick prayer almighty and most merciful father who see all our miseries and know all our necessities look down upon me and pity me defend me from the violent incursion of evil thoughts and enable me to form and keep such resolutions prayers and meditations p       while he was at church the agreeable impressions upon his mind are thus commemorated i was for some time much distressed but at last obtained i hope from the god of peace more quiet than i have enjoyed for a long time i had made no resolution but as my heart grew lighter my hopes revived and my courage increased and i wrote with my pencil in my common prayer book vita ordinanda biblia legenda theologiae opera danda serviendum et laetandum   mr steevens whose generosity is well known joined dr johnson in kind assistance to a female relation of dr goldsmith and desired that on her return to ireland she would procure authentic particulars of the life of her celebrated relation concerning her there is the following letter to george steevens esquire dear sir you will be glad to hear that from mrs goldsmith whom we lamented as drowned i have received a letter full of gratitude to us all with promise to make the enquiries which we recommended to her  i would have had the honor of conveying this intelligence to miss caulfield but that her letter is not at hand and i know not the direction you will tell the good news  i am sir your most etc sam johnson february          mr boswell to dr johnson my dear sir edinburgh feb         my state of epistolary accounts with you at present is extraordinary the balance as to number is on your side i am indebted to you for two letters one dated the   th of november upon which very day i wrote to you so that our letters were exactly exchanged and one dated the   st of december last  my heart was warmed with gratitude by the truly kind contents of both of them and it is amazing and vexing that i have allowed so much time to elapse without writing to you but delay is inherent in me by nature or by bad habit i waited till i should have an opportunity of paying you my compliments on a new year i have procrastinated till the year is no longer new  dr memiss cause was determined against him with  0l costs the lord president and two other of the judges dissented from the majority upon this ground  that although there may have been no intention to injure him by calling him doctor of medicine instead of physician yet as he remonstrated against the designation before the charter was printed off and represented that it was disagreeable and even hurtful to him it was illnatured to refuse to alter it and let him have the designation to which he was certainly entitled my own opinion is that our court has judged wrong the defendants were in mala fide to persist in naming him in a way that he disliked you remember poor goldsmith when he grew important and wished to appear doctor major could not bear your calling him goldy would it not have been wrong to have named him so in your preface to shakspeare or in any serious permanent writing of any sort the difficulty is whether an action should be allowed on such petty wrongs de minimis non curat lex  the negro cause is not yet decided a memorial is preparing on the side of slavery i shall send you a copy as soon as it is printed maclaurin is made happy by your approbation of his memorial for the black  macquarry was here in the winter and we passed an evening together the sale of his estate cannot be prevented  sir allan macleans suit against the duke of argyle for recovering the ancient inheritance of his family is now fairly before all our judges i spoke for him yesterday and maclaurin today crosbie spoke today against him three more counsel are to be heard and next week the cause will be determined i send you the informations or cases on each side which i hope you will read you said to me when we were under sir allans hospitable roof i will help him with my pen you said it with a generous glow and though his grace of argyle did afterward mount you upon an excellent horse upon which you looked like a bishop you must not swerve from your purpose at inchkenneth i wish you may understand the points at issue amidst our scotch law principles and phrases  here followed a full state of the case in which i endeavored to make it as clear as i could to an englishman who had no knowledge of the formularies and technical language of the law of scotland  i shall inform you how the cause is decided here but as it may be brought under the review of our judges and is certainly to be carried by appeal to the house of lords the assistance of such a mind as yours will be of consequence your paper on vicious intromission is a noble proof of what you can do even in scotch law  i have not yet distributed all your books lord hailes and lord monboddo have each received one and return you thanks monboddo dined with me lately and having drank tea we were a good while by ourselves and as i knew that he had read the journey superficially as he did not talk of it as i wished i brought it to him and read aloud several passages and then he talked so that i told him he was to have a copy from the author he begged that might be marked on it  i ever am my dear sir your most faithful and affectionate humble servant james boswell   sir alexander dick to dr samuel johnson sir prestonfield feb         i had yesterday the honor of receiving your book of your journey to the western islands of scotland which you was so good as to send me by the hands of our mutual friend mr boswell of auchinleck for which i return you my most hearty thanks and after carefully reading it over again shall deposit it in my little collection of choice books next our worthy friends journey to corsica as there are many things to admire in both performances i have often wished that no travels or journeys should be published but those undertaken by persons of integrity and capacity to judge well and describe faithfully and in good language the situation condition and manners of the countries past through indeed our country of scotland in spite of the union of the crowns is still in most places so devoid of clothing or cover from hedges and plantations that it was well you gave your readers a sound monitoire with respect to that circumstance the truths you have told and the purity of the language in which they are expressed as your journey is universally read may and already appear to have a very good effect for a man of my acquaintance who has the largest nursery for trees and hedges in this country tells me that of late the demand upon him for these articles is doubled and sometimes tripled i have therefore listed dr samuel johnson in some of my memorandums of the principal planters and favorers of the enclosures under a name which i took the liberty to invent from the greek papadendrion lord auchinleck and some few more are of the list i am told that one gentleman in the shire of aberdeen viz sir archibald grant has planted above fifty millions of trees on a piece of very wild ground at monimusk i must enquire if he has fenced them well before he enters my list for that is the soul of enclosing i began myself to plant a little our ground being too valuable for much and that is now fifty years ago and the trees now in my seventyfourth year i look up to with reverence and show them to my eldest son now in his fifteenth year that they are full the height of my country house here where i had the pleasure of receiving you and hope again to have that satisfaction with our mutual friend mr boswell i shall always continue with the truest esteem  dear doctor your much obliged and obedient humble servant alexander dick for a character of this very amiable man see journal of a tour to the hebrides  d edit p       to james boswell esquire dear sir it is so long since i heard any thing from you by the then course of the post my long letter of the   th had not yet reached him  that i am not easy about it write something to me next post when you sent your last letter every thing seemed to be mending i hope nothing has lately grown worse i suppose young alexander continues to thrive and veronica is now very pretty company i do not suppose the lady is yet reconciled to me yet let her know that i love her very well and value her very much  dr blair is printing some sermons if they are all like the first which i have read they are sermones aurei ac auro magis aurei it is excellently written both as to doctrine and language mr watsons book history of philip the second seems to be much esteemed  poor beauclerk still continues very ill langton lives on as he is used to do his children are very pretty and i think his lady loses her scotch paoli i never see  i have been so distressed by difficulty of breathing that i lost as was computed sixandthirty ounces of blood in a few days i am better but not well  i wish you would be vigilant and get me grahams telemachus that was printed at glasgow a very little book and johnstoni poemata another little book printed at middleburg  mrs williams sends her compliments and promises that when you come hither she will accommodate you as well as ever she can in the old room she wishes to know whether you sent her book to sir alexander gordon  my dear boswell do not neglect to write to me for your kindness is one of the pleasures of my life which i should be very sorry to lose  i am sir your humble servant sam johnson feb          to dr samuel johnson my dear sir edinburgh feb         your letter dated the   th instant i had the pleasure to receive last post although my late long neglect or rather delay was truly culpable i am tempted not to regret it since it has produced me so valuable a proof of your regard i did indeed during that inexcusable silence sometimes divert the reproaches of my own mind by fancying that i should hear again from you inquiring with some anxiety about me because for aught you knew i might have been ill  you are pleased to show me that my kindness is of some consequence to you my heart is elated at the thought be assured my dear sir that my affection and reverence for you are exalted and steady i do not believe that a more perfect attachment ever existed in the history of mankind and it is a noble attachment for the attractions are genius learning and piety  your difficulty of breathing alarms me and brings into my imagination an event which although in the natural course of things i must expect at some period i cannot view with composure  my wife is much honored by what you say of her she begs you may accept of her best compliments she is to send you some marmalade of oranges of her own making  i ever am my dear sir your most obliged and faithful humble servant james boswell   to james boswell esquire dear sir i have been much pleased with your late letter and am glad that my old enemy mrs boswell begins to feel some remorse as to miss veronicas scotch i think it cannot be helped an english maid you might easily have but she would still imitate the greater number as they would be likewise those whom she must most respect her dialect will not be gross her mamma has not much scotch and you have yourself very little i hope she knows my name and does not call me johnston  the immediate cause of my writing is this  one shaw who seems a modest and a decent man has written an erse grammar which a very learned highlander macbean has at my request examined and approved  the book is very little but mr shaw has been persuaded by his friends to set it at half a guinea though i had advised only a crown and thought myself liberal you whom the author considers as a great encourager of ingenious men will receive a parcel of his proposals and receipts i have undertaken to give you notice of them and to solicit your countenance you must ask no poor man because the price is really too high yet such a work deserves patronage  it is proposed to augment our club from twenty to thirty of which i am glad for as we have several in it whom i do not much like to consort with on account of their differing from his as to religion and politics  i am for reducing it to a mere miscellaneous collection of conspicuous men without any determinate character  i am dear sir most affectionately yours sam johnson march         my respects to madam to veronica to alexander to euphemia to david       mr boswell to dr johnson edinburgh april        after informing him of the death of my little son david and that i could not come to london this spring    i think it hard that i should be a whole year without seeing you may i presume to petition for a meeting with you in the autumn you have i believe seen all the cathedrals in england except that of carlisle if you are to be with dr tailor at ashbourne it would not be a great journey to come thither we may pass a few most agreeable days there by ourselves and i will accompany you a good part of the way to the southward again pray think of this  you forget that mr shaws erse grammar was put into your hands by myself last year lord eglintoune put it into mine i am glad that mr macbean approves of it i have received mr shaws proposals for its publication which i can perceive are written by the hand of a master  pray get for me all the editions of waltons lives i have a notion that the republication of them with notes will fall upon me between dr horn and lord hailes   mr shaws proposals for an analysis of the scotch celtick language were thus illuminated by the pen of johnson  though the erse dialect of the celtick language has from the earliest times been spoken in britain and still subsists in the northern parts and adjacent islands yet by the negligence of a people rather warlike than lettered it has hitherto been left to the caprice and judgment of every speaker and has floated in the living voice without the steadiness of analogy or direction of rules an erse grammar is an addition to the stores of literature and its author hopes for the indulgence always shown to those that attempt to do what was never done before if his work shall be found defective it is at least all his own he is not like other grammarians a compiler or transcriber what he delivers he has learned by attentive observation among his countrymen who perhaps will be themselves surprised to see that speech reduced to principles which they have used only by imitation  the use of this book will however not be confined to the mountains and islands it will afford a pleasing and important subject of speculation to those whose studies lead them to trace the affinity of languages and the migrations of the ancient races of mankind  to dr samuel johnson my dear sir glasgow april         our worthy friend thrales death having appeared in the newspapers and been afterward contradicted i have been placed in a state of very uneasy uncertainty from which i hoped to be relieved by you but my hopes have as yet been vain how could you omit to write to me on such an occasion i shall wait with anxiety  i am going to auchinleck to stay a fortnight with my father it is better not to be there very long at one time but frequent renewals of attention are agreeable to him  pray tell me about this edition of the english poets with a preface biographical and critical to each author by samuel johnson ll d which i see advertised i am delighted with the prospect of it indeed i am happy to feel that i am capable of being so much delighted with literature but is not the charm of this publication chiefly owing to the magnum nomen in the front of it  what do you say of lord chesterfields memoirs and last letters  my wife has made marmalade of oranges for you i left her and my daughters and alexander all well yesterday i have taught veronica to speak of you thus  dr john son not john ston  i remain my dear sir your most affectionate and obliged humble servant james boswell   to james boswell esquire dear sir the story of mr thrales death as he had neither been sick nor in any other danger made so little impression upon me that i never thought about obviating its effects on any body else it is supposed to have been produced by the english custom of making april fools that is of sending one another on some foolish errand on the first of april  tell mrs boswell that i shall taste her marmalade cautiously at first timeo danaos et dona ferentes beware says the italian proverb of a reconciled enemy but when i find it does me no harm i shall then receive it and be thankful for it as a pledge of firm and i hope of unalterable kindness she is after all a dear dear lady  please to return dr blair thanks for his sermons the scotch write english wonderfully well  your frequent visits to auchinleck and your short stay there are very laudable and very judicious your present concord with your father gives me great pleasure it was all that you seemed to want  my health is very bad and my nights are very unquiet what can i do to mend them i have for this summer nothing better in prospect than a journey into staffordshire and derbyshire perhaps with oxford and birmingham in my way  make my compliments to miss veronica i must leave it to her philosophy to comfort you for the loss of little david you must remember that to keep three out of four is more than your share mrs thrale has but four out of eleven  i am engaged to write little lives and little prefaces to a little edition of the english poets i think i have persuaded the booksellers to insert something of thomson and if you could give me some information about him for the life which we have is very scanty i should be glad  i am dear sir your most affectionate humble servant sam johnson may         to those who delight in tracing the progress of works of literature it will be an entertainment to compare the limited design with the ample execution of that admirable performance the lives of the english poets which is the richest most beautiful and indeed most perfect production of his pen his notion of it at this time appears in the preceding letter he has a memorandum in this year    may eastereve i treated with booksellers on a bargain but the time was not long prayers and meditations p      the bargain was concerning that undertaking but his tender conscience seems alarmed lest it should have intruded too much on his devout preparation for the solemnity of the ensuing day but indeed very little time was necessary for johnsons concluding a treaty with the booksellers as he had i believe less attention to profit from his labors than any man to whom literature has been a profession i shall here insert from a letter to me from my late worthy friend mr edward dilly though of a later date an account of this plan so happily conceived since it was the occasion of procuring for us an elegant collection of the best biography and criticism of which our language can boast  to james boswell esquire dear sir southill sept         you will find by this letter that i am still in the same calm retreat from the noise and bustle of london as when i wrote to you last i am happy to find you had such an agreeable meeting with your old friend dr johnson i have no doubt your stock is much increased by the interview few men nay i may say scarcely any man has got that fund of knowledge and entertainment as dr johnson in conversation when he opens freely every one is attentive to what he says and cannot fail of improvement as well as pleasure  the edition of the poets now printing will do honor to the english press and a concise account of the life of each author by dr johnson will be a very valuable addition and stamp the reputation of this edition superior to any thing that is gone before the first cause that gave rise to this undertaking i believe was owing to the little trifling edition of the poets printing by the martins at edinburgh and to be sold by bell in london upon examining the volumes which were printed the type was sound so extremely small that many persons could not read them not only this inconvenience attended it but the inaccuracy of the press was very conspicuous these reasons as well as the idea of an invasion of what we call our literary property induced the london booksellers to print an elegant and accurate edition of all the english poets of reputation from chaucer to the present time  accordingly a select number of the most respectable booksellers met on the occasion and on consulting together agreed that all the proprietors of copyright in the various poets should be summoned together and when their opinions were given to proceed immediately on the business accordingly a meeting was held consisting of about forty of the most respectable booksellers of london when it was agreed that an elegant and uniform edition of the english poets should be immediately printed with a concise account of the life of each author by dr samuel johnson and that three persons should be deputed to wait upon dr johnson to solicit him to undertake the lives viz t davies strahan and cadell the doctor very politely undertook it and seemed exceedingly pleased with the proposal as to the terms t was left entirely to the doctor to name his own he mentioned two hundred guineas it was immediately agreed to and a farther compliment i believe will be made him a committee was likewise appointed to engage the best engravers viz bartolozzi sherwin hall etc likewise another committee for giving directions about the paper printing etc so that the whole will be conducted with spirit and in the best manner with respect to authourship editorship engravings etc etc my brother will give you a list of the poets we mean to give many of which are within the time of the act of queen anne which martin and bell cannot give as they have no property in them the proprietors are almost all the booksellers in london of consequence  i am dear sir ever yours edward dilly   i shall afterward have occasion to consider the extensive and varied range which johnson took when he was once led upon ground which he trod with a peculiar delight having long been intimately acquainted with all the circumstances of it that could interest and please  dr johnson to charles oconor esquire mr walker of the treasury dublin who obligingly communicated to me this and a former letter from dr johnson to the same gentleman for which see vol i page     writes to me as follows  perhaps it would gratify you to have some account of mr oconor he is an amiable learned venerable old gentleman of an independent fortune who lives at belanagar in the county of roscommon he is an admired writer and member of the irish academy  the above letter is alluded to in the preface to the zd edit of his dissert p    sir having had the pleasure of conversing with dr campbell about your character and your literary undertaking i am resolved to gratify myself by renewing a correspondence which began and ended a great while ago and ended i am afraid by my fault a fault which if you have not forgotten it you must now forgive  if i have ever disappointed you give me leave to tell you that you have likewise disappointed me i expected great discoveries in irish antiquity and large publications in the irish language but the world still remains as it was doubtful and ignorant what the irish language is in itself and to what languages it has affinity are very interesting questions which every man wishes to see resolved that has any philological or historical curiosity dr leland begins his history too late the ages which deserve an exact enquiry are those times for such there were when ireland was the school of the west the quiet habitation of sanctity and literature if you could give a history though imperfect of the irish nation from its conversion to christianity to the invasion from england you would amplify knowledge with new views and new objects set about it therefore if you can do what you can easily do without anxious exactness lay the foundation and leave the superstructure to posterity  i am sir your most humble servant sam johnson may          early in this year came out in two volumes quarto the posthumous works of the learned dr zachary pearce bishop of rochester being a commentary with notes on the four evangelists and the acts of the apostles with other theological pieces johnson had now an opportunity of making a grateful return to that excellent prelate who we have seen was the only person who gave him any assistance in the compilation of his dictionary the bishop had left some account of his life and character written by himself to this johnson made some valuable additions and also furnished to the editor the reverend mr derby a dedication which i shall here insert both because it will appear at this time with peculiar propriety and because it will tend to propagate and increase that fervor of loyalty which in me who boast of the name of tory is not only a principle but a passion  to the king sir i presume to lay before your majesty the last labors of a learned bishop who died in the toils and duties of his calling he is now beyond the reach of all earthly honors and rewards and only the hope of inciting others to imitate him makes it now fit to be remembered that he enjoyed in his life the favor of your majesty  the tumultuary life of princes seldom permits them to survey the wide extent of national interest without losing sight of private merit to exhibit qualities which may be imitated by the highest and the humblest of mankind and to be at once amiable and great  such characters if now and then they appear in history are contemplated with admiration may it be the ambition of all your subjects to make haste with their tribute of reverence and as posterity may learn from your majesty how kings should live may they learn likewise from your people how they should be honored  i am may it please your majesty with the most profound respect your majestys most dutiful and devoted subject and servant   in the summer he wrote a prologue which was spoken before a word to the wise a comedy by mr hugh kelly which had been brought upon the stage in    0 but its design being supposed favorable to the ministry it fell a sacrifice to popular fury and in the playhouse phrase was damned by the generosity of mr harris the proprietor of covent garden theater it was now exhibited for one night for the benefit of the authors widow and children to conciliate the favor of the audience was the intention of johnsons prologue which as it is not long i shall here insert as a proof that his poetical talents were in no degree impaired  this night presents a play which public rage or right or wrong once hooted from the stage from zeal or malice now no more we dread for english vengeance wars not with the dead a generous foe regards with pitying eye the man whom fate has laid where all must lie to wit reviving from its authors dust be kind ye judges or at least be just let no renewed hostilities invade the oblivious graves inviolable shade let one great payment every claim appease and him who cannot hurt allow to please to please by scenes unconscious of offense by harmless merriment or useful sense where aught of bright or fair the piece displays approve it only  it is too late to praise if want of skill or want of care appear forbear to hiss  the poet cannot hear by all like him must praise and blame be found at last a fleeting gleam or empty sound yet then shall calm reflection bless the night when liberal pity dignified delight when pleasure fired her torch at virtues flame and mirth was bounty with an humbler name a circumstance which could not fail to be very pleasing to johnson occurred this year the tragedy of sir thomas overbury written by his early companion in london richard savage was brought out with alterations at drury lane theater the prologue to it was written by mr richard brindsley sheridan in which after describing very pathetically the wretchedness of illfated savage at whose birth was given no parent but the muse no friend but heaven he concluded with an elegant compliment to johnson on his dictionary that wonderful performance which cannot be too often or too highly praised of which mr harris in his philological inquiries part first chap    justly and liberally observes such is its merit that our language does not possess a more copious learned and valuable work the concluding lines of this prologue were these  so pleads the tale life of richard savage by dr johnson that gives to future times the sons misfortunes and the parents crimes there shall his fame if owned tonight survive fixed by the hand that bids our language live mr sheridan here at once did honor to his taste and to his liberality of sentiment by showing that he was not prejudiced from the unlucky difference which had taken place between his worthy father and dr johnson i have already mentioned that johnson was very desirous of reconciliation with old mr sheridan it will therefore not seem at all surprising that he was zealous in acknowledging the brilliant merit of his son while it had as yet been displayed only in the drama johnson proposed him as a member of the literary club observing that he who has written the two best comedies of his age is surely a considerable man and he had accordingly the honor to be elected for an honor it undoubtedly must be allowed to be when it is considered of whom that society consists and that a single black ball excludes a candidate  mr boswell to dr johnson my dear sir june        for the health of my wife and children i have taken the little country house at which you visited my uncle dr boswell who having lost his wife is gone to live with his son we took possession of our villa about a week ago we have a garden of three quarters of an acre well stocked with fruit trees and flowers and gooseberries and currants and pease and beans and cabbages etc etc and my children are quite happy i now write to you in a little study from the window of which i see around me a verdant grove and beyond it the lofty mountain called arthurs seat  your last letter in which you desire me to send you some additional information concerning thomson reached me very fortunately just as i was going to lanark to put my wifes two nephews the young campbells to school there under the care of mr thomson the master of it whose wife is sister to the author of the seasons she is an old woman but her memory is very good and she will with pleasure give me for you every particular that you wish to know and she can tell pray then take the trouble to send me such questions as may lead to biographical materials you say that the life which we have of thomson is scanty since i received your letter i have read his life published under the name of cibber but as you told me really written by a mr shiels that written by dr murdoch one prefixed to an edition of the seasons published at edinburgh which is compounded of both with the addition of an anecdote of quins relieving thomson from prison the abridgement of murdochs life of him in the biographia britannica and another abridgement of it in the biographical dictionary enriched with dr joseph wartons critical panegyric on the seasons in his essay on the genius and writings of pope from all these it appears to me that we have a pretty full account of this poet however you will i doubt not show me many blanks and i shall do what can be done to have them filled up as thomson never returned to scotland which you will think very wise his sister can speak from her own knowledge only as to the early part of his life she has some letters from him which may probably give light as to his more advanced progress if she will let us see them which i suppose she will i believe george lewis scott and dr armstrong are now his only surviving companions while he lived in and about london and they i dare say can tell more of him than is yet known my own notion is that thomson was a much coarser man than his friends are willing to acknowledge his seasons are indeed full of elegant and pious sentiments but a rank soil nay a dunghill will produce beautiful flowers  your edition of the english poets will be very valuable on account of the prefaces and lives but i have seen a specimen of an edition of the poets at the apollo press at edinburgh which for excellence in printing and engraving highly deserves a liberal encouragement  most sincerely do i regret the bad health and bad rest with which you have been afflicted and i hope you are better i cannot believe that the prologue which you generously gave to mr kellys widow and children the other day is the effusion of one in sickness and in disquietude but external circumstances are never sure indications of the state of man i send you a letter which i wrote to you two years ago at wilton and did not send at the time for fear of being reproved as indulging too much tenderness and one written to you at the tomb of melancthon which i kept back lest i should appear at once too superstitious and too enthusiastic i now imagine that perhaps they may please you  you do not take the least notice of my proposal for our meeting at carlisle though i have meritoriously refrained from visiting london this year i ask you if it would not be wrong that i should be two years without having the benefit of your conversation when if you come down as far as derbyfhire we may meet at the expense of a few days journeying and not many pounds i wish you to see carlisle which made me mention that place but if you have not a desire to complete your tour of the english cathedrals i will take a larger share of the road between this place and ashbourne so tell me where you will fix for our passing a few days by ourselves now dont cry foolish fellow or idle dog chain your humor and let your kindness play  you will rejoice to hear that miss macleod of rasay is married to colonel mure campbell an excellent man with a pretty good estate of his own and the prospect of having the earl of loudouns fortune and honors is not this a noble lot for our fair hebridean how happy am i that she is to be in ayrshire we shall have the lord of rasay and old malcolm and i know not how many gallant macleods and bagpipes etc etc at auchinleck perhaps you may meet them all there  without doubt you have read what is called the life of david hume written by himself with the letter from dr adam smith subjoined to it is not this an age of daring effrontery my friend mr anderson professor of natural philosophy at glasgow at whose house you and i supped and to whose care mr windham of norfolk was entrusted at that university paid me a visit lately and after we had talked with indignation and contempt of the poisonous productions with which this age is infested he said there was now an excellent opportunity for dr johnson to step forth i agreed with him that you might knock humes and smiths heads together and make vain and ostentatious infidelity exceedingly ridiculous would it not be worth your while to crush such noxious weeds in the moral garden  you have said nothing to me of dr dodd i know not how you think on that subject though the newspapers give us a saying of yours in favor of mercy to him but i own i am very desirous that the royal prerogative of remission of punishment should be employed to exhibit an illustrious instance of the regard which gods vicegerent will ever show to piety and virtue if for ten righteous men the almighty would have spared sodom shall not a thousand acts of goodness done by dr dodd counterbalance one crime such an instance would do more to encourage goodness than his execution would do to deter from vice i am not afraid of any bad consequence to society for who will persevere for a long course of years in a distinguished discharge of religious duties with a view to commit a forgery with impunity  pray make my best compliments acceptable to mr and mrs thrale by assuring them of my hearty joy that the master as you call him is alive i hope i shall often taste his champagne  soberly  i have not heard from langton for a long time i suppose he is as usual studious the busy moments to deceive   i remain my dear sir your most affectionate and faithful humble servant james boswell   on the   d of june i again wrote to dr johnson enclosing a shipmasters receipt for a jar of marmalade of oranges and a large packet of lord hailess annals of scotland  to james boswell esquire dear sir i have just received your packet from mr thrales but have not daylight enough to look much into it i am glad that i have credit enough with lord hailes to be trusted with more copy i hope to take more care of it than of the last i return mrs boswell my affectionate thanks for her present which i value as a token of reconciliation  poor dodd was put to death yesterday in opposition to the recommendation of the jury  the petition of the city of london  and a subsequent petition signed by threeandtwenty thousand hands surely the voice of the public when it calls so loudly and calls only for mercy ought to be heard  the saying that was given me in the papers i never spoke but i wrote many of his petitions and some of his letters he applied to me very often he was i am afraid long flattered with hopes of life but i had no part in the dreadful delusion for as soon as the king had signed his sentence i obtained from mr chamier an account of the disposition of the court toward him with a declaration that there was no hope even of a respite this letter immediately was laid before dodd but he believed those whom he wished to be right as it is thought till within three days of his end he died with pious composure and resolution i have just seen the ordinary that attended him his address to his fellowconvicts offended the methodists but he had a moravian with him much of his time his moral character is very bad i hope all is not true that is charged upon him of his behavior in prison an account will be published  i give you joy of your country house and your pretty garden and hope some time to see you in your felicity i was much pleased with your two letters that had been kept so long in store     since they have been so much honored by dr johnson i shall here insert them to mr samuel johnson my ever dear and muchrespected sir you know my solemn enthusiasm of mind you love me for it and i respect myself for it because in so far i resemble mr johnson you will be agreeably surprised when you learn the reason of my writing this letter i am at wittemberg in saxony i am in the old church where the reformation was first preached and where some of the reformers lie interred i cannot resist the serious pleasure of writing to mr johnson from the tomb of melancthon my paper rests upon the gravestone of that great and good man who was undoubtedly the worthiest of all the reformers he wished to reform abuses which had been introduced into the church but had no private resentment to gratify so mild was he that when his aged mother consulted him with anxiety on the perplexing disputes of the times he advised her to keep to the old religion at this tomb then my ever dear and respected friend i vow to thee an eternal attachment it shall be my study to do what i can to render your life happy and if you die before me i shall endeavor to do honor to your memory and elevated by the remembrance of you persist in noble piety may god the father of all beings ever bless you and may you continue to love  your most affectionate friend and devoted servant james boswell sunday sept  0       to dr samuel johnson my dear sir wilton house april         every scene of my life confirms the truth of what you have told me  there is no certain happiness in this state of being  i am here amidst all that you know is at lord pembrokes and yet i am weary and gloomy i am just setting out for the house of an old friend in devonshire and shall not get back to london for a week yet you said to me last good friday with a cordiality that warmed my heart that if i came to settle in london we should have a day fixed every week to meet by ourselves and talk freely to be thought worthy of such a privilege cannot but exalt me during my present absence from you while notwithstanding the gaiety which you allow me to prossess i am darkened by temporary clouds i beg to have a few lines from you a few lines merely of kindness as a viatium till i see you again in your vanity of human wishes and in parnells contentment i find the only sure means of enjoying happiness or at least the hopes of happiness  i ever am with reverence and affection most faithfully yours james boswell       and rejoice at miss rasays advancement and wish sir allan success  i hope to meet you somewhere toward the north but am loath to come quite to carlisle can we not meet at manchester but we will settle it in some other letters  mr seward william seward esquire well known to a numerous and valuable acquaintance for his literature love of the fine arts and social virtues i am indebted to him for several communications concerning johnson  a great favorite at streatham has been i think enkindled by our travels with a curiosity to see the highlands i have given him letters to you and beattie he desires that a lodging may be taken for him at edinburgh against his arrival he is just setting out  langton has been exercising the militia mrs williams is i fear declining dr lawrence says he can do no more she is gone to summer in the country with as many conveniences about her as she can expect but i have no great hope we must all die may we all be prepared  i suppose miss boswell reads her book and young alexander takes to his learning let me hear about them for every thing that belongs to you belongs in a more remote degree and not i hope very remote to  dear sir yours affectionately sam johnson june          to the same dear sir this gentleman is a great favorite at streatham and therefore you will easily believe that he has very valuable qualities our narrative has kindled him with a desire of visiting the highlands after having already seen a great part of europe you must receive him as a friend and when you have directed him to the curiosities of edinburgh give him instructions and recommendations for the rest of his journey  i am dear sir your most humble servant sam johnson june          johnsons benevolence to the unfortunate was i am confident as steady and active as that of any of those who have been most eminently distinguished for that virtue innumerable proofs of it i have no doubt will be for ever concealed from mortal eyes we may however form some judgment of it from the many and very various instances which have been discovered one which happened in the course of this summer is remarkable from the name and connection of the person who was the object of it the circumstance to which i allude is ascertained by two letters one to mr langton and another to the reverend dr vyse rector of lambeth son of the respectable clergyman at lichfield who was contemporary with johnson and in whose fathers family johnson had the happiness of being kindly received in his early years  dr johnson to bennet langton esquire dear sir i have lately been much disordered by a difficulty of breathing but am now better i hope your house is well  you know we have been talking lately of st cross at winchester i have an old acquaintance whose distress makes him very desirous of an hospital and i am afraid i have not strength enough to get him into the chartreux he is a painter who never rose higher than to get his immediate living and from that at eightythree he is disabled by a slight stroke of the palsy such as does not make him at all helpless on common occasions though his hand is not steady enough for his art  my request is that you will try to obtain a pomise of the next vacancy from the bishop of chester it is not a great thing to ask and i hope we shall obtain it dr warton has promised to favor him with his notice and i hope he may end his days in peace  i am sir your most humble servant sam johnson june          to the reverend dr vyse at lambeth sir i doubt not but you will readily forgive me for taking the liberty of requesting your assistance in recommending an old friend to his grace the archbishop as governor of the charter house  his name is de groot he was born at gloucester i have known him many years he has all the common claims to charity being old poor and infirm in a great degree he has likewise another claim to which no scholar can refuse attention he is by several descents the nephew of hugo grotius of him from whom perhaps every man of learning has learned something let it not be said that in any lettered country a nephew of grotius asked a charity and was refused  i am reverend sir your most humble servant sam johnson july          rev dr vyse to mr boswell sir lambeth june        i have searched in vain for the letter which i spoke of and which i wished at your desire to communicate to you it was from dr johnson to return me thanks for my application to archbishop cornwallis in favor of poor de groot he rejoices at the success it met with and is lavish in the praise he bestows upon his favorite hugo grotius i am really sorry that i cannot find this letter as it is worthy of the writer that which i send you enclosed the preceding letter is at your service it is very short and will not perhaps be thought of any consequence unless you should judge proper to consider it as a proof of the very humane part which dr johnson took in behalf of a distressed and deserving person  i am sir your most obedient humble servant w vyse   dr johnson to mr edward dilly sir to the collection of english poets i have recommended the volume of dr watts to be added his name has long been held by me in veneration and i would not willingly be reduced to tell of him only that he was born and died yet of his life i know very little and therefore must pass him in a manner very unworthy of his character unless some of his friends will favor me with the necessary information many of them must be known to you and by your influence perhaps i may obtain some instruction my plan does not exact much but i wish to distinguish watts a man who never wrote but for a good purpose be pleased to do for me what you can  i am sir your humble servant sam johnson boltcourt fleet street july         to dr samuel johnson my dear sir edinburgh july         the fate of dr dodd made a dismal impression upon my mind  i had sagacity enough to divine that you wrote his speech to the recorder before sentence was pronounced i am glad you have written so much for him and i hope to be favored with an exact list of the several pieces when we meet  i received mr seward as the friend of mr and mrs thrale and as a gentleman recommended by dr johnson to my attention i have introduced him to lord kames lord monboddo and mr nairne he is gone to the highlands with dr gregory when he returns i shall do more for him  sir allan maclean has carried that branch of his cause of which we had good hopes the president and one other judge only were against him i wish the house of lords may do as well as the court of session has done but sir allan has not the lands of brolos quite clear by this judgment till a long account is made up of debts and interests on the one side and rents on the other i am however not much afraid of the balance  macquarrys estates staffa and all were sold yesterday and bought by a campbell i fear he will have little or nothing left out of the purchase money  i send you the case against the negro by mr cullen son to dr cullen in opposition to maclaurins for liberty of which you have approved pray read this and tell me what you think as a politician as well as a poet upon the subject  be so kind as to let me know how your time is to be distributed next autumn i will meet you at manchester or where you please but i wish you would complete your tour of the cathedrals and come to carlisle and i will accompany you a part of the way homewards  i am ever most faithfully yours james boswell   to james boswell esquire dear sir your notion of the necessity of a yearly interview is very pleasing to both my vanity and tenderness i shall perhaps come to carlisle another year but my money has not held out so well as it used to do i shall go to ashbourne and i purpose to make dr tailor invite you if you live awhile with me at his house we shall have much time to ourselves and our stay will be no expense to us or him i shall leave london the   th and after some stay at oxford and lichfield shall probably come to ashbourne about the end of your session but of all this you shall have notice be satisfied we will meet somewhere  what passed between me and poor dr dodd you shall know more fully when we meet  of lawsuits there is no end poor sir allan must have another trial for which however his antagonist cannot be much blamed having two judges on his side i am more afraid of the debts than of the house of lords it is scarcely to be imagined to what debts will swell that are daily increasing by small additions and how carelessly in a state of desperation debts are contracted poor macquarry was far from thinking that when he sold his islands he should receive nothing for what were they sold and what was their yearly value the admission of money into the highlands will soon put an end to the feudal modes of life by making those men landlords who were not chiefs i do not know that the people will suffer by the change but there was in the patriarchal authority something venerable and pleasing every eye must look with pain on a campbell turning the macquarries at will out of their seeds avitae their hereditary island  sir alexander dick is the only scotsman liberal enough not to be angry that i could not find trees where trees were not i was much delighted by his kind letter  i remember rasay with too much pleasure not to partake of the happiness of any part of that amiable family our ramble in the islands hangs upon my imagination i can hardly help imagining that we shall go again pennant seems to have seen a great deal which we did not see when we travel again let us look better about us  you have done right in taking your unkles house some change in the form of life gives from time to time a new epoch of existence in a new place there is something new to be done and a different system of thoughts rises in the mind i wish i could gather currants in your garden now fit up a little study and have your books ready at hand do not spare a little money to make your habitation pleasing to yourself  i have dined lately with poor dear  i do not think he goes on well his table is rather coarse and he has his children too much about him this very just remark i hope will be constantly held in remembrance by parents who are in general too apt to indulge their own fond feelings for their children at the expense of their friends the common custom of introducing them after dinner is highly injudicious it is agreeable enough that they should appear at any other time but they should not be suffered to poison the moments of festivity by attracting the attention of the company and in a manner compelling them from politeness to say what they do not think  but he is a very good man  mrs williams is in the country to try if she can improve her health she is very ill matters have come so about that she is in the country with very good accommodation but age and sickness and pride have made her so peevish that i was forced to bribe the maid to stay with her by a secret stipulation of half a crown a week over her wages  our club ended its session about six weeks ago we now only meet to dine once a fortnight mr dunning the great lawyer is one of our members the thrales are well  i long to know how the negros cause will be decided what is the opinion of lord auchinleck or lord hailes or lord monboddo  i am dear sir your most affectionate etc sam johnson july          dr johnson to mrs boswell madam though i am well enough pleased with the taste of sweetmeats very little of the pleasure which i received at the arrival of your jar of marmalade arose from eating it i received it as a token of friendship as a proof of reconciliation things much sweeter than sweetmeats and upon this consideration i return you dear madam my sincerest thanks by having your kindness i think i have a double security for the continuance of mr boswells which it is not to be expected that any man can long keep when the influence of a lady so highly and so justly valued operates against him mr boswell will tell you that i was always faithful to your interest and always endeavored to exalt you in his estimation you must now do the same for me we must all help one another and you must now consider me as  dear madam your most obliged and most humble servant sam johnson july          mr boswell to dr johnson my dear sir edinburgh july         this is the day on which you were to leave london and i have been amusing myself in the intervals of my lawdrudgery with figuring you in the oxford postcoach i doubt however if you have had so merry a journey as you and i had in that vehicle last year when you made so much sport with gwyn the architect incidents upon a journey are recollected with peculiar pleasure they are preserved in brisk spirits and come up again in our minds tinctured with that gaiety or at least that animation with which we first perceived them  i added that something had occurred which i was afraid might prevent me from meeting him and that my wife had been affected with complaints which threatened a consumption but was now better   to james boswell esquire dear sir do not disturb yourself about our interviews i hope we shall have many nor think it any thing hard or unusual that your design of meeting me is interrupted we have both endured greater evils and have greater evils to expect  mrs boswells illness makes a more serious distress does the blood rise from her lungs or from her stomach from little vessels broken in the stomach there is no danger blood from the lungs is i believe always frothy as mixed with wind your physicians know very well what is to be done the loss of such a lady would indeed be very afflictive and i hope she is in no danger take care to keep her mind as easy as is possible  i have left langton in london he has been down with the militia and is again quiet at home talking to his little people as i suppose you do sometimes make my compliments to miss veronica the rest are too young for ceremony  i cannot but hope that you have taken your country house at a very seasonable time and that it may conduce to restore or establish mrs boswells health as well as provide room and exercise for the young ones that you and your lady may both be happy and long enjoy your happiness is the sincere and earnest wish of  dear sir your most etc sam johnson oxford aug         mr boswell to dr johnson informing him that my wife had continued to grow better so that my alarming apprehensions were relieved and that i hoped to disengage myself from the other embarrassment which had occurred and therefore requesting to know particularly when he intended to be at ashbourne   to james boswell esquire dear sir i am this day come to ashbourne and have only to tell you that dr tailor says you shall be welcome to him and you know how welcome you will be to me make haste to let me know when you may be expected  make my compliments to mrs boswell and tell her i hope we shall be at variance no more  i am dear sir your most humble servant sam johnson august  0       to james boswell esquire dear sir on saturday i wrote a very short letter immediately upon my arrival hither to show you that i am not less desirous of the interview than yourself life admits not of delays when pleasure can be had it is fit to catch it every hour takes away part of the things that please us and perhaps part of our disposition to be pleased when i came to lichfield i found my old friend harry jackson dead it was a loss and a loss not to be repaired as he was one of the companions of my childhood i hope we may long continue to gain friends but the friends which merit or usefulness can procure us are not able to supply the place of old acquaintance with whom the days of youth may be retraced and those images revived which gave the earliest delight if you and i live to be much older we shall take great delight in talking over the hebridean journey  in the mean time it may not be amiss to contrive some other little adventure but what it can be i know not leave it as sidney says to virtue fortune wine and womans breast for i believe mrs boswell must have some part in the consultation  one thing you will like the doctor so far as i can judge is likely to leave us enough to ourselves he was out today before i came down and i fancy will stay out till dinner i have brought the papers about poor dodd to show you but you will soon have dispatched them  before i came away i sent poor mrs williams into the country very ill of a pituitous defluxion which wastes her gradually away and which her physician declares himself unable to stop i supplied her as far as could be desired with all conveniences to make her excursion and abode pleasant and useful but i am afraid she can only linger a short time in a morbid state of weakness and pain  the thrales little and great are all well and purpose to go to brighthelmston at michaelmas they will invite me to go with them and perhaps i may go but i hardly think i shall like to stay the whole time but of futurity we know but little  mrs porter is well but mrs aston one of the ladies at stowhill has been struck with a palsy from which she is not likely ever to recover how soon may such a stroke fall upon us  write to me and let us know when we may expect you  i am dear sir your most humble servant sam johnson ashbourne sept         mr boswell to dr johnson edinburgh sept        after informing him that i was to set out next day in order to meet him at ashbourne    i have a present for you from lord hailes the fifth book of lactantius which he has published with latin notes he is also to give you a few anecdotes for your life of thomson who i find was private tutor to the present earl of hadington lord hailess cousin a circumstance not mentioned by dr murdoch i have keen expectations of delight from your edition of the english poets  i am sorry for poor mrs williamss situation you will however have the comfort of reflecting on your kindness to her mr jacksons death and mrs astons palsy are gloomy circumstances yet surely we should be habituated to the uncertainty of life and health when my mind is unclouded by melancholy i consider the temporary distresses of this state of being as light afflictions by stretching my mental view into that glorious after existence when they will appear to be as nothing but present pleasures and present pains must be felt i lately read rasselas over again with great satisfaction  since you are desirous to hear about macquarrys sale i shall inform you particularly the gentleman who purchased ulva is mr campbell of auchnaba our friend macquarry was proprietor of twothirds of it of which the rent was    l  s  d   this parcel was set up at  0  l   s  d but it sold for no less than    0l the other third of ulva with the island of staffa belonged to macquarry of ormaig its rent including that of staffa   l   s  d     set up at     l   s  d  sold for no less than    0l the lord of col wished to purchase ulva but he thought the price too high there may indeed be great improvements made there both in fishing and agriculture but the interest of the purchasemoney exceeds the rents so very much that i doubt if the bargain will be profitable there is an island called little colonsay of  0l yearly rent which i am informed has belonged to the macquarrys of ulva for many ages but which was lately claimed by the presbyterian synod of argyll in consequence of a grant made to them by queen anne it is believed that their claim will be dismissed and that little colonsay will also be sold for the advantage of macquarrys creditors what think you of purchasing this island and endowing a school or college there the master to be a clergyman of the church of england how venerable would such an institution make the name of dr samuel johnson in the hebrides i have like yourself a wonderful pleasure in recollecting our travels in those islands the pleasure is i think greater than it reasonably should be considering that we had not much either of beauty and elegance to charm our imaginations or of rude novelty to astonish let us by all means have another expedition i shrink a little from our scheme of going up the baltic it appears that johnson now in his sixtyeighth year was seriously inclined to realise the project of our going up the baltic which i had started when we were in the isle of sky for he thus writes to mrs thrale letters vol i page     ashbourne sept         boswell i believe is coming he talks of being here today i shall be glad to see him but he shrinks from the baltic expedition which i think is the best scheme in our power what we shall substitute i know not he wants to see wales but except the woods of bachycraigh what is there in wales that can fill the hunger of ignorance or quench the thirst of curiosity we may perhaps form some scheme or other but in the phrase of hockley in the hole it is pity he has not a better bottom     such an ardour of mind and vigor of enterprise is admirable at any age but more particularly so at the advanced period at which johnson was then arrived i am sorry now that i did not insist on our executing that scheme besides the other objects of curiosity and observation to have seen my illustrious friend received as he probably would have been by a prince so eminently distinguished for his variety of talents and acquisitions as the king of sweden and by the empress of russia whose extraordinary abilities information and magnanimity astonish the world would have afforded a noble subject for contemplation and record this reflection may possibly be thought too visionary by the more sedate and coldblooded part of my readers yet i own i frequently indulge it with an earnest unavailing regret    i am sorry you have already been in wales for i wish to see it shall we go to ireland of which i have seen but little we shall try to strike out a plan when we are at ashbourne  i am ever your most faithful humble servant james boswell   to james boswell esquire dear sir i write to be left at carlisle as you direct me but you cannot have it your letter dated sept   was not at this place till this day thursday sept    and i hope you will be here before this is at carlisle it so happened the letter was forwarded to my house at edinburgh   however what you have not going you may have returning and as i believe i shall not love you less after our interview it will then be as true as it is now that i set a very high value upon your friendship and count your kindness as one of the chief felicities of my life do not fancy that an intermission of writing is a decay of kindness no man is always in a disposition to write nor has any man at all times something to say  that distrust which intrudes so often on your mind is a mode of melancholy which if it be the business of a wise man to be happy it is foolish to indulge and if it be a duty to preserve our faculties entire for their proper use it is criminal suspicion is very often an useless pain from that and all other pains i wish you free and safe for  i am dear sir most affectionately yours sam johnson ashbourne sept          on sunday evening september    i arrived at ashbourne and drove directly up to dr taylors door dr johnson and he appeared before i had got out of the postchaise and welcomed me cordially  i told them that i had traveled all the preceding night and gone to bed at leek in staffordshire and that when i rose to go to church in the afternoon i was informed there had been an earthquake of which it seems the shock had been felt in some degree at ashbourne johnson sir it will be much exaggerated in popular talk for in the first place the common people do not accurately adapt their thoughts to the objects nor secondly do they accurately adapt their words to their thoughts they do not mean to lie but taking no pains to be exact they give you very false accounts a great part of their language is proverbial if any thing rocks at all they say it rocks like a cradle and in this way they go on  the subject of grief for the loss of relations and friends being introduced i observed that it was strange to consider how soon it in general wears away dr tailor mentioned a gentleman of the neighborhood as the only instance he had ever known of a person who had endeavored to retain grief he told dr tailor that after his ladys death which affected him deeply he resolved that the grief which he cherished with a kind of sacred fondness should be lasting but that he found he could not keep it long johnson all grief for what cannot in the course of nature be helped soon wears away in some sooner indeed in some later but it never continues very long unless where there is madness such as will make a man have pride so fixed in his mind as to imagine himself a king or any other passion in an unreasonable way for all unnecessary grief is unwise and therefore will not be long retained by a sound mind if indeed the cause of our grief is occasioned by our own misconduct if grief is mingled with remorse of conscience it should be lasting boswell but sir we do not approve of a man who very soon forgets the loss of a wife or a friend johnson sir we disapprove of him not because he soon forgets his grief for the sooner it is forgotten the better but because we suppose that if he forgets his wife or his friend soon he has not had much affection for them  i was somewhat disappointed in finding that the edition of the english poets sor which he was to write prefaces and lives was not an undertaking directed by him but that he was to furnish a preface and life to any poet the booksellers pleased i asked him if he would do this to any dunces works if they should ask him johnson yes sir and say he was a dunce my friend seemed now not much to relish talking of this edition  on monday september    dr johnson observed that every body commended such parts of his journey to the western islands as were in their own way for instance said he mr jackson the allknowing told me there was more good sense upon trade in it than he should hear in the house of commons in a year except from burke jones commended the part which treats of language burke that which describes the inhabitants of mountainous countries  after breakfast johnson carried me to see the garden belonging to the school of ashbourne which is very prettily formed upon a bank rising gradually behind the house the reverend mr langley the head master accompanied us  while we sat basking in the sun upon a seat here i introduced a common subject of complaint the very small salaries which many curates have and i maintained that no man should be invested with the character of a clergyman unless he has a security for such an income as will enable him to appear respectable that therefore a clergyman should not be allowed to have a curate unless he gives him a hundred pounds a year if he cannot do that let him perform the duty himself johnson to be sure sir it is wrong that any clergyman should be without a reasonable income but as the church revenues were sadly diminished at the reformation the clergy who have livings cannot afford in many instances to gi good salaries to curates without leaving themselves too little and if no curate were to be permitted unless he had a hundred pounds a year their number would be very small which would be a disadvantage as then there would not be such choice in the nursery for the church curates being candidates for the higher ecclesiastical offices according to their merit and good behavior he explained the system of the english hierarchy exceedingly well it is not thought fit said he to trust a man with the care of a parish till he has given proof as a curate that he shall deserve such a trust this is an excellent theory and if the practice were according to it the church of england would be admirable indeed however as i have heard dr johnson observe as to the universities bad practice does not infer that the constitution is bad  we had with us at dinner several of dr taylors neighbors good civil gentlemen who seemed to understand dr johnson very well and not to consider him in the light that a certain person did who being struck or rather stunned by his voice and manner when he was afterward asked what he thought of him answered he is a tremendous companion  johnson told me that tailor was a very sensible acute man and had a strong mind that he had great activity in some respects and yet such a sort of indolence that if you should put a pebble upon his chimneypiece you would find it there in the same state a year afterward  and here is the proper place to give an account of johnsons humane and zealous interference in behalf of the reverend dr william dodd formerly prebendary of brecon and chaplain in ordinary to his majesty celebrated as a very popular preacher an encourager of charitable institutions and author of a variety of works chiefly theological having unhappily contracted expensive habits of living partly occasioned by licentiousness of manners he in an evil hour when pressed by want of money and dreading an exposure of his circumstances forged a bond of which he attempted to avail himself to support his credit flattering himself with hopes that he might be able to repay its amount without being detected the person whose name he thus rashly and criminally presumed to falsify was the earl of chesterfield to whom he had been tutor and who he perhaps in the warmth of his feelings flattered himself would have paid the money in case of an alarm being taken rather than suffer him to fall a victim to the dreadful consequences of violating the law against forgery the most dangerous crime in a commercial country but the unfortunate divine had the mortification to find that he was mistaken his noble pupil appeared against him and he was capitally convicted  johnson told me that dr dodd was very little acquainted with him having been but once in his company many years previous to this period which was precisely the state of my own acquaintance with dodd but in his distress he bethought himself of johnsons persuasive power of writing if happily it might avail to obtain for him the royal mercy he did not apply to him directly but extraordinary as it may seem through the late countess of harrington who wrote a letter to johnson asking him to employ his pen in favor of dodd mr allen the printer who was johnsons landlord and next neighbor in boltcourt and for whom he had much kindness was one of dodds friends of whom to the credit of humanity be it recorded that he had many who did not desert him even after his infringement of the law had reduced him to the state of a man under sentence of death mr allen told me that he carried lady harringtons letter to johnson that johnson read it walking up and down his chamber and seemed much agitated after which he said i will do what i can   and certainly he did make extraordinary exertions  he this evening as he had obligingly promised in one of his letters put into my hands the whole series of his writings upon this melancholy occasion and i shall present my readers with the abstract which i made from the collection in doing which i studied to avoid copying what had appeared in print and now make part of the edition of johnsons works published by the booksellers of london but taking care to mark johnsons variations in some of the pieces there exhibited  dr johnson wrote in the first place dr dodds speech to the recorder of london at the oldbailey when sentence of death was about to be pronounced upon him  he wrote also the convicts address to his unhappy brethren a sermon delivered by dr dodd in the chapel of newgate according to johnsons manuscript it began thus after the text what shall i do to be saved  these were the words with which the keeper to whose custody paul and silas were committed by their prosecutors addressed his prisoners when he saw them freed from their bonds by the perceptible agency of divine favor and was therefore irresistibly convinced that they were not offenders against the laws but martyrs to the truth  dr johnson was so good as to mark for me with his own hand on a copy of this sermon which is now in my possession such passages as were added by dr dodd they are not many whoever will take the trouble to look at the printed copy and attend to what i mention will be satisfied of this  there is a short introduction by dr dodd and he also inserted this sentence you see with what confusion and dishonor i now stand before you  no more in the pulpit of instruction but on this humble seat with yourselves the notes are entirely dodds own and johnsons writing ends at the words the thief whom he pardoned on the cross what follows was supplied by dr dodd himself  the other pieces written by johnson in the above mentioned collection are two letters one to the lord chancellor bathurst not lord north as is erroneously supposed and one to lord mansfield  a petition from dr dodd to the king  a petition from mrs dodd to the queen  observations of some length inserted in the newspapers on occasion of earl percys having presented to his majesty a petition for mercy to dodd signed by twenty thousand people but all in vain he told me that he had also written a petition from the city of london but said he with a significant smile they mended it  the last of these articles which johnson wrote is dr dodds last solemn declaration which he left with the sheriff at the place of execution here also my friend marked the variations on a copy of that piece now in my possession dodd inserted i never knew or attended to the calls of frugality or the needful minuteness of painful economy and in the next sentence he introduced the words which i distinguish by italicks my life for some few unhappy years past has been dreadfully erroneous johnsons expression was hypocritical but his remark on the margin is with this he said he could not charge himself  having thus authentically settled what part of the occasional papers concerning dr dodds miserable situation came from the pen of johnson i shall proceed to present my readers with my record of the unpublished writings relating to that extraordinary and interesting matter  i found a letter to dr johnson from dr dodd may         in which the convicts address seems clearly to be meant  i am so penetrated my ever dear sir with a sense of your extreme benevolence toward me that i cannot find words equal to the sentiments of my heart  you are too conversant in the world to need the slightest hint from me of what infinite utility the speech his speech at the oldbailey when found guilty on the aweful day has been to me i experience every hour some good effect from it i am sure that effects still more salutary and important must follow from your kind and intended favor i will labor  god being my helper  to do justice to it from the pulpit i am sure had i your sentiments constantly to deliver from thence in all their mighty force and power not a soul could be left unconvinced and unpersuaded          he added may god almighty bless and reward with his choicest comforts your philanthropick actions and enable me at all times to express what i feel of the high and uncommon obligations which i owe to the first man in our times  on sunday june    he writes begging dr johnsons assistance in framing a supplicatory letter to his majesty  if his majesty could be moved of his royal clemency to spare me and my family the horrors and ignominy of a public death which the public itself is solicitous to wave and to grant me in some silent distant corner of the globe to pass the remainder of my days in penitence and prayer i would bless his clemency and be humbled  this letter was brought to dr johnson when in church he stooped down and read it and wrote when he went home the following letter for dr dodd to the king sir may it not offend your majesty that the most miserable of men applies himself to your clemency as his last hope and his last refuge that your mercy is most earnestly and humbly implored by a clergyman whom your laws and judges have condemned to the horror and ignominy of a public execution  i confess the crime and own the enormity of its consequences and the danger of its example nor have i the confidence to petition for impunity but humbly hope that public security may be established without the spectacle of a clergyman dragged through the streets to a death of infamy amidst the derision of the profligate and profane and that justice may be satisfied with irrevocable exile perpetual disgrace and hopeless penury  my life sir has not been useless to mankind i have benefited many but my offenses against god are numberless and i have had little time for repentance preserve me sir by your prerogative of mercy from the necessity of appearing unprepared at that tribunal before which kings and subjects must stand at last together permit me to hide my guilt in some obscure corner of a foreign country where if i can ever attain confidence to hope that my prayers will be heard they shall be poured with all the fervor of gratitude for the life and happiness of your majesty  i am sir your majestys etc     subjoined to it was written as follows to dr dodd sir i most seriously enjoin you not to let it be at all known that i have written this letter and to return the copy to mr allen in a cover to me i hope i need not tell you that i wish it success  but do not indulge hope  tell nobody   it happened luckily that mr allen was pitched on to assist in this melancholy office for he was a great friend of mr akerman the keeper of newgate dr johnson never went to see dr dodd he said to me it would have done him more harm than good to dodd who once expressed a desire to see him but not earnestly  dr johnson on the  0th of june wrote the following letter  to the right honorable charles jenkinson sir since the conviction and condemnation of dr dodd i have had by the intervention of a friend some intercourse with him and i am sure i shall lose nothing in your opinion by tenderness and commiseration whatever be the crime it is not easy to have any knowledge of the delinquent without a wish that his life may be spared at least when no life has been taken away by him i will therefore take the liberty of suggesting some reasons for which i wish this unhappy being to escape the utmost rigor of his sentence  he is so far as i can recollect the first clergyman of our church who has suffered public execution for immorality and i know not whether it would not be more for the interest of religion to bury such an offender in the obscurity of perpetual exile than to expose him in a cart and on the gallows to all who for any reason are enemies to the clergy  the supreme power has in all ages paid some attention to the voice of the people and that voice does not least deserve to be heard when it calls out for mercy there is now a very general desire that dodds life should be spared more is not wished and perhaps this is not too much to be granted  if you sir have any opportunity of enforcing these reasons you may perhaps think them worthy of consideration but whatever you determine i most respectfully entreat that you will be pleased to pardon for this intrusion  sir your most obedient and most humble servant sam johnson     it has been confidently circulated with invidious remarks that to this letter no attention whatever was paid by mr jenkinson now lord hawkesbury and that he did not even deign to show the common civility of owning the receipt of it i could not but wonder at such conduct in the noble lord whose own character and just elevation in life i thought must have impressed him with all due regard for great abilities and seize as the story had been much talked of and apparently from good authority i could not but have animadverted upon it in this work had it been as was alleged but from my earnest love of truth and having found reason to think that there might be a mistake i presumed to write to his lordship requesting an explanation and it is with the sincerest pleasure that i am enabled to assure the world that there is no foundation for it the fact being that owing to some neglect or accident johnsons letter never came to lord hawkesburys hands i should have thought it strange indeed if that noble lord had undervalued my illustrious friend but instead of this being the case his lordship in the very polite answer with which he was pleased immediately to honor me thus expresses himself  i have always respected the memory of dr johnson and admire his writings and i frequently read many parts of them with pleasure and great improvement  all applications for the royal mercy having failed dr dodd prepared himself for death and with a warmth of gratitude wrote to dr johnson as follows june    midnight accept thou great and good heart my earnest and fervent thanks and prayers for all thy benevolent and kind efforts in my behalf  oh dr johnson as i sought your knowledge at an early hour in life would to heaven i had cultivated the love and acquaintance of so excellent a man  i pray god most sincerely to bless you with the highest transports  the infelt satisfaction of humane and benevolent exertions  and admitted as i trust i shall be to the realms of bliss before you i shall hail your arrival there with transport and rejoice to acknowledge that you was my comforter my advocate and my friend god be ever with you     dr johnson lastly wrote to dr dodd this solemn and soothing letter to the reverend dr dodd dear sir that which is appointed to all men is now coming upon you outward circumstances the eyes and the thoughts of men are below the notice of an immortal being about to stand the trial for eternity before the supreme judge of heaven and earth be comforted your crime morally or religiously considered has no very deep dye of turpitude it corrupted no mans principles it attacked no mans life it involved only a temporary and reparable injury of this and of all other sins you are earnestly to repent and may god who knows our frailty and desires not our death accept your repentance for the sake of his son jesus christ our lord  in requital of those wellintended offices which you are pleased so emphatically to acknowledge let me beg that you make in your devotions one petition for my eternal welfare  i am dear sir your affectionate servant sam johnson june            under the copy of this letter i found written in johnsons own hand next day june    he was executed  to conclude this interesting episode with an useful application let us now attend to the reflections of johnson at the end of the occasional papers concerning the unfortunate dr dodd  such were the last thoughts of a man whom we have seen exulting in popularity and sunk in shame for his reputation which no man can give to himself those who conferred it are to answer of his public ministry the means of judging were sufficiently attainable he must be allowed to preach well whose sermons strike his audience with forcible conviction of his life those who thought it consistent with his doctrine did not originally form false notions he was at first what he endeavored to make others but the world broke down his resolution and he in time ceased to exemplify his own instructions  let those who are tempted to his faults tremble at his punishment and those whom he impressed from the pulpit with religious sentiments endeavor to confirm them by considering the regret and selfabhorrence with which he reviewed in prison his deviations from rectitude  johnson gave us this evening in his happy discriminative manner a portrait of the late mr fitzherbert of derbyshire there was said he no sparkle no brilliancy in fitzherbert but i never knew a man who was so generally acceptable he made every body quite easy overpowered nobody by the superiority of his talents made no man think worse of himself by being his rival seemed always to listen did not oblige you to hear much from him and did not oppose what you said every body liked him but he had no friend as i understand the word nobody with whom he exchanged intimate thoughts people were willing to think well of every thing about him a gentleman was making an affected rant as many people do of great feelings about his dear son who was at school near london how anxious he was lest he might be ill and what he would give to see him cant you said fitzherbert take a postchaise and go to him this to be sure finished the affected man but there was not much in it however this was circulated as wit for a whole winter and i believe part of a summer too a proof that he was no very witty man he was an instance of the truth of the observation that a man will please more upon the whole by negative qualities than by positive by never offending than by giving a great deal of delight in the first place men hate more steadily than they love and if i have said something to hurt a man once i shall not get the better of this by saying many things to please him  tuesday september    dr johnson having mentioned to me the extraordinary size and price of some cattle reared by dr tailor i rode out with our host surveyed his farm and was shown one cow which he had sold for a hundred and twenty guineas and another for which he had been offered a hundred and thirty tailor thus described to me his old schoolfellow and friend johnson he is a man of a very clear head great power of words and a very gay imagination but there is no disputing with him he will not hear you and having a louder voice than you must roar you down  in the afternoon i tried to get dr johnson to like the poems of mr hamilton of bangour which i had brought with me i had been much pleased with them at a very early age the impression still remained on my mind it was confirmed by the opinion of my friend the honorable andrew erskine himself both a good poet and a good critic who thought hamilton as true a poet as ever wrote and that his not having fame was unaccountable johnson upon repeated occasions while i was at ashbourne talked slightingly of hamilton he said there was no power of thinking in his verses nothing that strikes one nothing better than what you generally find in magazines and that the highest praise they deserved was that they were very well for a gentleman to hand about among his friends he said the imitation of ne sit ancillae tibi amor etc was too solemn he read part of it at the beginning he read the beautiful pathetick song ah the poor shepherds mournful fate and did not seem to give attention to what i had been used to think tender elegant strains but laughed at the rhyme in scotch pronunciation wishes and blushes reading wushes  and there he stopped he owned that the epitaph on lord newhall was pretty well done he read the inscription in a summer house and a little of the imitations of horaces epistles but said he found nothing to make him desire to read on when i urged that there were some good poetical passages in the book where said he will you find so large a collection without some i thought the description of winter might obtain his approbation  see winter from the frozen north drives his iron chariot forth his grisly hand in icy chains fair tweedas silver slood constrains etc he asked why an  iron chariot and said icy chains was an old image i was struck with the uncertainty of taste and somewhat sorry that a poet whom i had long read with fondness was not approved by dr johnson i comforted myself with thinking that the beauties were too delicate for his robust perceptions garrick maintained that he had not a taste for the finest productions of genius but i was sensible that when he took the trouble to analyze critically he generally convinced us that he was right  in the evening the reverend mr seward of lichfield who was passing through ashbourne in his way home drank tea with us johnson described him thus  sir his ambition is to be a fine talker so he goes to buxton and such places where he may find companies to listen to him and sir he is a valetudinarian one of those who are always mending themselves i do not know a more disagreeable character than a valetudinarian who thinks he may do any thing that is for his ease and indulges himself in the grossest freedoms sir he brings himself to the state of a hog in a stye  dr taylors nose happening to bleed he said it was because he had omitted to have himself blooded four days after a quarter of a years interval dr johnson who was a great dabbler in physic disapproved much of periodical bleeding for said he you accustom yourself to an evacuation which nature cannot perform of herself and therefore she cannot help you should you from forgetfulness or any other cause omit it so you may be suddenly suffocated you may accustom yourself to other periodical evacuations because should you omit them nature can supply the omission but nature cannot open a vein to blood you  i do not like to take an emetick said tailor for fear of breaking some small vessels  poh said johnson if you have so many things that will break you had better break your neck at once and there is an end on it you will break no small vessels blowing with high derision  i mentioned to dr johnson that david humes persisting in his infidelity when he was dying shocked me much johnson why should it shock you sir hume owned he had never read the new testament with attention here then was a man who had been at no pains to inquire into the truth of religion and had continually turned his mind the other way it was not to be expected that the prospect of death would alter his way of thinking unless god should send an angel to set him right i said i had reason to believe that the thought of annihilation gave hume no pain johnson it was not so sir he had a vanity in being thought easy it is more probable that he should assume an appearance of ease than that so very improbable a thing should be as a man not afraid of going as in spite of his delusive theory he cannot be sure but he may go into an unknown state and not being uneasy at leaving all he knew and you are to consider that upon his own principle of annihilation he had no motive to speak the truth the horror of death which i had always observed in dr johnson appeared strong tonight i ventured to tell him that i had been for moments of my life not afraid of death therefore i could suppose another man in that state of mind for a considerable space of time he said he never had a moment in which death was not terrible to him he added that it had been observed that almost no man dies in public but with apparent resolution from that desire of praise which never quits us i said dr dodd seemed to be willing to die and full of hopes of happiness sir said he dr dodd would have given both his hands and both his legs to have lived the better a man is the more afraid is he of death having a clearer view of infinite purity he owned that our being in an unhappy uncertainty as to our salvation was mysterious and said ah we must wait till we are in another state of being to have many things explained to us even the powerful mind of johnson seemed foiled by futurity but i thought that the gloom of uncertainty in solemn religious speculation being mingled with hope was yet more consolatory than the emptiness of infidelity a man can live in thick air but perishes in an exhausted receiver  dr johnson was much pleased with a remark which i told him was made to me by general paoli  that it is impossible not to be afraid of death and that those who at the time of dying are not afraid are not thinking of death but of applause or something else which keeps death out of their sight so that all men are equally afraid of death when they see it only some have a power of turning their sight away from it better than others  on wednesday september    dr butter physician at derby drank tea with us and it was settled that dr johnson and i should go on friday and dine with him johnson said i am glad of this he seemed weary of the uniformity of life at dr taylors  talking of biography i said in writing a life a mans peculiarities should be mentioned because they mark his character johnson sir there is no doubt as to peculiarities the question is whether a mans vices should be mentioned for instance whether it should be mentioned that addison and parnel drank too freely for people will probably more easily indulge in drinking from knowing this so that more ill may be done by the example than good by telling the whole truth here was an instance of his varying from himself in talk for when lord hailes and he sat one morning calmly conversing in my house at edinburgh i well remember that dr johnson maintained that if a man is to write a panegyric he may keep vices out of sight but if he professes to write a life he must represent it really as it was and when i objected to the danger of telling that parnel drank to excess he said that it would produce an instructive caution to avoid drinking when it was seen that even the learning and genius of parnel could be debased by it and in the hebrides he maintained as appears from my journal journal of a tour to the hebrides  d edit p   0  that a mans intimate friend should mention his faults if he writes his life  he had this evening partly i suppose from the spirit of contradiction to his whig friend a violent argument with dr tailor as to the inclinations of the people of england at this time toward the royal family of stuart he grew so outrageous as to say that if england were fairly polled the present king would be sent away tonight and his adherents hanged tomorrow tailor who was as violent a whig as johnson was a tory was roused by this to a pitch of bellowing he denied loudly what johnson said and maintained that there was an abhorrence against the stuart family though he admitted that the people were not much attached to the present king dr tailor was very ready to make this admission because the party with which he was connected was not in power there was then some truth in it owing to the pertinacity of factious clamor had he lived till now it would have been impossible for him to deny that his majesty possesses the warmest affection of his people  johnson sir the state of the country is this the people knowing it to be agreed on all hands that this king has not the hereditary right to the crown and there being no hope that he who has it can be restored have grown cold and indifferent upon the subject of loyalty and have no warm attachment to any king they would not therefore risk any thing to restore the exiled family they would not give twenty shillings a piece to bring it about but if a mere vote could do it there would be twenty to one at least there would be a very great majority of voices for it for sir you are to consider that all those who think a king has a right to his crown as a man has to his estate which is the just opinion would be for restoring the king who certainly has the hereditary right could he be trusted with it in which there would be no danger now when laws and every thing else are so much advanced and every king will govern by the laws and you must also consider sir that there is nothing on the other side to oppose to this for it is not alleged by any one that the present family has any inherent right so that the whigs could not have a contest between two rights  dr tailor admitted that if the question as to hereditary right were to be tried by a poll of the people of england to be sure the abstract doctrine would be given in favor of the family of stuart but he said the conduct of that family which occasioned their expulsion was so fresh in the minds of the people that they would not vote for a restoration dr johnson i think was contented with the admission as to the hereditary right leaving the original point in dispute viz what the people upon the whole would do taking in right and affection for he said people were afraid of a change even when they thought it right dr tailor said something of the slight foundation of the hereditary right of the house of stuart sir said johnson the house of stuart succeeded to the full right of both the houses of york and lancaster whose common source had the undisputed right a right to a throne is like a right to any thing else possession is sufficient where no better right can be shown this was the case with the royal family of england as it is now with the king of france for as to the first beginning of the right we are in the dark  thursday september    last night dr johnson had proposed that the crystal luster or chandelier in dr taylors large room should be lighted up some time or other tailor said it should be lighted up next night that will do very well said i for it is dr johnsons birthday when we were in the isle of sky johnson had desired me not to mention his birthday he did not seem pleased at this time that i mentioned it and said somewhat sternly he would not have the luster lighted the next night  some ladies who had been present yesterday when i mentioned his birthday came to dinner today and plagued him unintentionally by wishing him joy i know not why he disliked having his birthday mentioned unless it were that it reminded him of his approaching nearer to death of which he had a constant dread  i mentioned to him a friend of mine who was formerly gloomy from low spirits and much distressed by the fear of death but was now uniformly placid and contemplated his dissolution without any perturbation sir said johnson this is only a disordered imagination taking a different turn  we talked of a collection being made of all the english poets who had published a volume of poems johnson told me that a mr coxeter whom he knew had gone the greatest length toward this having collected i think about five hundred volumes of poets whose works were little known but that upon his death tom osborne bought them and they were dispersed which he thought a pity as it was curious to see any series complete and in every volume of poems something good may be found  he observed that a gentleman of eminence in literature had got into a bad style of poetry of late he puts said he a very common thing in a strange dress till he does not know it himself and thinks other people do not know it boswell that is owing to his being so much versant in old english poetry johnson what is that to the purpose sir if i say a man is drunk and you tell me it is owing to his taking much drink the matter is not mended no sir  has taken to an odd mode for example he would write thus hermit hoar in solemn cell wearing out lifes evening gray gray evening is common enough but evening gray he would think fine  stay  well make out the stanza hermit hoar in solemn cell wearing out lifes evening gray smite thy bosom sage and tell what is bliss and which the way   boswell but why smite his bosom sir johnson why to show he was in earnest smiling  he at an after period added the following stanza  thus i spoke and speaking sighed   scarce repressed the starting tear  when the smiling sage replied    come my lad and drink some beer as some of my readers may be gratified by reading the precise progress of this little composition i shall insert it from my notes when dr johnson and i were sitting tete a tete at the mitre tavern may        he said where is bliss would be better he then added a ludicrous stanza but would not repeat it lest i should take it down it was somewhat as follows the last line i am sure i remember  while i thus  cried   seer the hoary  replied come my lad and drink some beer in spring      when in better humor he made the second stanza as in the text there was only one variation afterward made on my suggestion which was changing hoary in the third line to smiling both to avoid a sameness with the epithet in the first line and to describe the hermit in his pleasantry he was then very well pleased that i should preserve it    i cannot help thinking the first stanza very good solemn poetry as also the three first lines of the second its last line is an excellent burlesque surprise on gloomy sentimental enquirers and perhaps the advice is as good as can be given to a lowspirited dissatisfied being  dont trouble your head with sickly thinking take a cup and be merry  friday september    after breakfast dr johnson and i set out in dr taylors chaise to go to derby the day was fine and we resolved to go by keddlestone the seat of lord scarsdale that i might see his lordships fine house i was struck with the magnificence of the building and the extensive park with the finest verdure covered with deer and cattle and sheep delighted me the number of old oaks of an immense size filled me with a sort of respectful admiration for one of them sixty pounds was offered the excellent smooth gravel roads the large piece of water formed by his lordship from some small brooks with a handsome barge upon it the venerable gothic church now the family chapel just by the house in short the grand groupe of objects agitated and distended my mind in a most agreeable manner one should think said i that the proprietor of all this must be happy  nay sir said johnson all this excludes but one evil  poverty when i mentioned dr johnsons remark to a lady of admirable good sense and quickness of understanding she observed it is true all this excludes only one evil but how much good does it let in   our names were sent up and a welldrest elderly housekeeper a most distinct articulator showed us the house which i need not describe as it is published in adamss works in architecture dr johnson thought better of it today than when he saw it before for the other night he attacked it violently saying it would do excellently for a town hall the large room with the pillars said he would do for the judges to sit in at the assizes the circular room for a jury chamber and the rooms above for prisoners still he thought the large room ill lighted and of no use but for dancing in and the bedchambers but indifferent rooms and that the immense sum which it cost was injudiciously laid out dr tailor had put him in mind of his appearing pleased with the house but said he that was when lord scarsdale was present politeness obliges us to appear pleased with a mans works when he is present no man will be so ill bred as to question you you may therefore pay compliments without saying what is not true i should say to lord scarsdale of his large room my lord this is the most costly room that i ever saw which is true  dr manningham physician in london who was visiting at lord scarsdales accompanied us through many of the rooms and soon afterward my lord himself to whom dr johnson was known appeared and did the honors of the house we talked of mr langton johnson with a warm vehemence of affectionate regard exclaimed the earth does not bear a worthier man than bennet langton we saw a good many fine pictures which i think are described in one of youngs tours there is a printed catalogue of them which the housekeeper put into my hand i should like to view them at leisure i was much struck with daniel interpreting nebuchadnezzars dream by rembrandt we were shown a pretty large library in his lordships dressing room lay johnsons small dictionary he showed it to me with some eagerness saying lookye quae terra nostri non plena laboris he observed also goldsmiths animated nature and said here is our friend the poor doctor would have been happy to hear of this  in our way johnson strongly expressed his love of driving fast in a postchaise if said he i had no duties and no reference to futurity i would spend my life in driving briskly in a postchaise with a pretty woman but she should be one who could understand me and would add something to the conversation i observed that we were this day to stop just where the highland army did in      johnson it was a noble attempt boswell i wish we could have an authentic history of it johnson if you were not an idle dog you might write it by collecting from every body what they can tell and putting down your authorities boswell but i could not have the advantage of it in my lifetime johnson you might have the satisfaction of its fame by printing it in holland and as to profit consider how long it was before writing came to be considered in a pecuniary view baretti says he is the first man that ever received copymoney in italy i said that i would endeavor to do what dr johnson suggested and i thought that i might write so as to venture to publish my history of the civil war in great britain in      and      without being obliged to go to a foreign press i am now happy to understand that mr john home who was himself gallantly in the field for the reigning family in that interesting warfare but is generous enough to do justice to the other side is preparing an account of it for the press   when we arrived at derby dr butter accompanied us to see the manufactory of china there i admired the ingenuity and delicate art with which a man fashioned clay into a cup a saucer or a teapot while a boy turned round a wheel to give the mass rotundity i thought this as excellent in its species of power as making good verses in its species yet i had no respect for this potter neither indeed has a man of any extent of thinking for a mere versemaker in whose numbers however perfect there is no poetry no mind the china was beautiful but dr johnson justly observed it was too dear for that he could have vessels of silver of the same size as cheap as what were here made of porcelain  i felt a pleasure in walking about derby such as i always have in walking about any town to which i am not accustomed there is an immediate sensation of novelty and one speculates on the way in which life is passed in it which although there is a sameness every where upon the whole is yet minutely diversified the minute diversities in every thing are wonderful talking of shaving the other night at dr taylors dr johnson said sir of a thousand shavers two do not shave so much alike as not to be distinguished i thought this not possible till he specified so many of the varieties in shaving  holding the razor more or less perpendicular  drawing long or short strokes  beginning at the upper part of the face or the under  at the right side or the left side indeed when one considers what variety of sounds can be uttered by the windpipe in the compass of a very small aperture we may be convinced how many degrees of difference there may be in the application of a razor  we dined with dr butter whose lady is daughter of my cousin sir john douglas whose grandson is now presumptive heir of the noble family of queensberry johnson and he had a good deal of medical conversation johnson said he had somewhere or other given an account of dr nicholss discourse de anima medica he told us that whatever a mans distemper was dr nichols would not attend him as a physician if his mind was not at ease for he believed that no medicines would have any influence he once attended a man in trade upon whom he found none of the medicines he prescribed had any effect he asked the mans wife privately whether his affairs were not in a bad way she said no he continued his attendance some time still without success at length the mans wife told him she had discovered that her husbands affairs were in a bad way when goldsmith was dying dr turton said to him your pulse is in greater disorder than it should be from the degree of fever which you have is your mind at ease goldsmith answered it was not  after dinner mrs butter went with me to see the silkmill which sir thomas lamb had a patent for having brought away the contrivance from italy i am not very conversant with mechanics but the simplicity of this machine and its multiplied operations struck me with an agreeable surprise i had learnt from dr johnson during this interview not to think with a dejected indifference of the works of art and the pleasures of life because life is uncertain and short but to consider such indifference as a failure of reason a morbidness of mind for happiness should be cultivated as much as we can and the objects which are instrumental to it should be steadily considered as of importance with a reference not only to ourselves but to multitudes in successive ages though it is proper to value small parts as sands make the mountain moments make the year young  yet we must contemplate collectively to have a just estimation of objects one moments being uneasy or not seems of no consequence yet this may be thought of the next and the next and so on till there is a large portion of misery in the same way one must think of happiness of learning of friendship we cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed as in filling a vessel drop by drop there is at last a drop which makes it run over so in a series of kindnesses there is at last one which makes the heart run over we must not divide objects of our attention into minute parts and think separately of each part it is by contemplating a large mass of human existence that a man while he sets a just value on his own life does not think of his death as annihilating all that is great and pleasing in the world as if actually contained in his mind according to berkeleys reverie if his imagination be not sickly and feeble it wings its distant way far beyond himself and views the world in unceasing activity of every sort it must be acknowledged however that popes plaintive reflection that all things would be as gay as ever on the day of his death is natural and common we are apt to transfer to all around us our own gloom without considering that at any given point of time there is perhaps as much youth and gaiety in the world as at another before i came into this life in which i have had so many pleasant scenes have not thousands and ten thousands of deaths and funerals happened and have not families been in grief for their nearest relations but have those dismal circumstances at all affected me why then should the gloomy scenes which i experience or which i know affect others let us guard against imagining that there is an end of felicity upon earth when we ourselves grow old or are unhappy  dr johnson told us at tea that when some of dr dodds pious friends were trying to console him by saying that he was going to leave a wretched world he had honesty enough not to join in the cant  no no said he it has been a very agreeable world to me johnson added i respect dodd for thus speaking the truth for to be sure he had for several years enjoyed a life of great voluptuousness  he told us that dodds city friends stood by him so that a thousand pounds were ready to be given to the jailer if he would let him escape he added that he knew a friend of dodds who walked about newgate for some time on the evening before the day of his execution with five hundred pounds in his pocket ready to be paid to any of the turnkeys who could get him out but it was too late for he was watched with much circumspection he said dodds friends had an image of him made of wax which was to have been left in his place and he believed it was carried into the prison  johnson disapproved of dr dodds leaving the world persuaded that the convicts address to his unhappy brethren was of his own writing but sir said i you contributed to the deception for when mr seward expressed a doubt to you that it was not dodds own because it had a great deal more force of mind in it than any thing known to be his you answered  why should you think so depend upon it sir when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight it concentrates his mind wonderfully johnson sir as dodd got it from me to pass as his own while that could do him any good there was an implied promise that i should not own it to own it therefore would have been telling a lie with the addition of breach of promise which was worse than simply telling a lie to make it be believed it was dodds besides sir i did not directly tell a lie i left the matter uncertain perhaps i thought that seward would not believe it the less to be mine for what i said but i would not put it in his power to say i had owned it  he praised blairs sermons yet said he willing to let us see he was aware that fashionable fame however deserved is not always the most lasting perhaps they may not be reprinted after seven years at least not after blairs death  he said goldsmith was a plant that flowered late there appeared nothing remarkable about him when he was young though when he had got high in fame one of his friends began to recollect something of his being distinguished at college goldsmith in the same manner recollected more of that friends early years as he grew a greater man  i mentioned that lord monboddo told me he awaked every morning at four and then for his health got up and walked in his room naked with the window open which he called taking an air bath after which he went to bed again and slept two hours more johnson who was always ready to beat down any thing that seemed to be exhibited with disproportionate importance thus observed i suppose sir there is no more in it than this he awaltes at four and cannot sleep till he chills himself and makes the warmth of the bed a grateful sensation  i talked of the difficulty of rising in the morning dr johnson told me that the learned mrs carter at that period when she was eager in study did not awake as early as she wished and she therefore had a contrivance that at a certain hour her chamberlight should burn a string to which a heavy weight was suspended which then fell with a strong sudden noise this roused her from sleep and then she had no difficulty in getting up but i said that was my difficulty and wished there could be some medicine invented which would make one rise without pain which i never did unless after lying in bed a very long time perhaps there may be something in the stores of nature which can do this i have thought of a pulley to raise me gradually but that would give me pain as it would counteract my internal inclination i would have something that can dissipate the vis inertiae and give elasticity to the muscles as i imagine that the human body may be put by the operation of other substances into any state in which it has ever been and as i have experienced a state in which rising from bed was not disagreeable but easy nay sometimes agreeable i suppose that this state may be produced if we knew by what we can heat the body we can cool it we can give it tension or relaxation and surely it is possible to bring it into a state in which rising from bed will not be a pain  johnson observed that a man should take a sufficient quantity of sleep which dr mead says is between seven and nine hours i told him that dr cullen said to me that a man should not take more sleep than he can take at once johnson this rule sir cannot hold in all cases for many people have their sleep broken by sickness and surely cullen would not have a man to get up after having slept but an hour such a regimen would soon end in a long sleep this regimen was however practiced by bishop ken of whom hawkins not sir john in his life of that venerable prelate page   tells us and that neither his study might be the aggressor on his hours of instruction or what he judged his duty prevent his improvements or both his closet addresses to his god he strictly accustomed himself to but one sleep which often obliged him to rise at one or two of the clock in the morning and sometimes sooner and grew so habitual that it continued with him almost till his last illness and so lively and cheerful was his temper that he would be very facetious and entertaining to his friends in the evening even when it was perceived that with difficulty he kept his eyes open and then seemed to go to rest with no other purpose than the refreshing and enabling him with more vigor and cheerfulness to sing his morning hymn as he then used to do to his lute before he put on his clothes  dr tailor remarked i think very justly that a man who does not feel an inclination to sleep at the ordinary time instead of being stronger than other people must not be well for a man in health has all the natural inclinations to eat drink and sleep in a strong degree  johnson advised me tonight not to refine in the education of my children life said he will not bear refinement you must do as other people do  as we drove back to ashbourne dr johnson recommended to me as he had often done to drink water only for said he you are then sure not to get drunk whereas if you drink wine you are never sure i said drinking wine was a pleasure which i was unwilling to give up why sir said he there is no doubt that not to drink wine is a great deduction from life but it may be necessary he however owned that in his opinion a free use of wine did not shorten life and said he would not give less for the life of a certain scotch lord whom he named celebrated for hard drinking than for that of a sober man but stay said he with his usual intelligence and accuracy of enquiry does it take much wine to make him drunk i answered a great deal either of wine or strong punch  then said he that is the worse i presume to illustrate my friends observation thus a fortress which soon surrenders has its walls less shattered than when a long and obstinate resistance is made  i ventured to mention a person who was as violent a scotsman as he was an englishman and literally had the same contempt for an englishman compared with a scotsman that he had for a scotsman compared with an englishman and that he would say of dr johnson damned rascal to talk as he does of the scotch this seemed for a moment to give him pause it perhaps presented his extreme prejudice against the scotch in a point of view somewhat new to him by the effect of contrast  by the time when we returned to ashbourne dr tailor was gone to bed johnson and i sat up a long time by ourselves  he was much diverted with an article which i showed him in the critical review of this year giving an account of a curious publication entitled a spiritual diary and soliloquies by john rutty m d dr rutty was one of the people called quakers a physician of some eminence in dublin and author of several works this diary which was kept from      to      the year in which he died and was now published in two volumes octavo exhibited in the simplicity of his heart a minute and honest register of the state of his mind which though frequently laughable enough was not more so than the history of many men would be if recorded with equal fairness  the following specimens were extracted by the reviewers  tenth month          indulgence in bed an hour too long  twelfth month    an hypochondriack obnubilation from wind and indigestion  ninth month    an overdose of whisky     a dull cross choleric day  first month          a little swinish at dinner and repast     dogged on provocation  second month   very dogged or snappish     snappish on fasting     cursed snappishness to those under me on a bodily indisposition  third month    on a provocation exercised a dumb resentment for two days instead of scolding     scolded too vehemently     dogged again  fourth month    mechanically and sinfully dogged  johnson laughed heartily at this good quietists selfcondemning minutes particularly at his mentioning with such a serious regret occasional instances of  swinishness in eating and doggedness of temper he thought the observations of the critical reviewers upon the importance of a man to himself so ingenious and so well expressed that i shall here introduce them  after observing that there are few writers who have gained any reputation by recording their own actions they say  we may reduce the egotists to four classes in the first we have julius caesar he relates his own transactions but he relates them with peculiar grace and dignity and his narrative is supported by the greatness of his character and achievements in the second class we have marcus antoninus this writer has given us a series of reflections on his own life but his sentiments are so noble his morality so sublime that his meditations are universally admired in the third class we have some others of tolerable credit who have given importance to their own private history by an intermixture of literary anecdotes and the occurrences of their own times the celebrated huetius has published an entertaining volume upon this plan de rebus ad eum pertinentibus in the fourth class we have the journalists temporal and spiritual elias ashmole william lilly george whitefield john wesley and a thousand other old women and fanatic writers of memoirs and meditations  i mentioned to him that dr hugh blair in his lectures on rhetoric and belles lettres which i heard him deliver at edinburgh had animadverted on the johnsonian style as too pompous and attempted to imitate it by giving a sentence of addison in the spectator no     in the manner of johnson when treating of the utility of the pleasures of imagination in preserving us from vice it is observed of those who know not how to be idle and innocent that their very first step out of business is into vice or folly which dr blair supposed would have been expressed in the rambler thus their very first step out of the regions of business is into the perturbation of vice or the vacuity of folly when dr blair published his lectures he was invidiously attacked for having omitted his censure on johnsons style and on the contrary praising it highly but before that time johnsons lives of the poets had appeared in which his style was considerably easier than when he wrote the rambler it would therefore have been uncandid in blair even supposing his criticism to have been just to have preserved it  johnson sir these are not the words i should have used no sir the imitators of my style have not hit it miss aikin has done it the best for she has imitated the sentiment as well as the diction  i intend before this work is concluded to exhibit specimens of imitation of my friends style in various modes some caricaturing or mimicking it and some formed upon it whether intentionally or with a degree of similarity to it of which perhaps the writers were not conscious  in barettis review which he published in italy under the title of frusta letteraria it is observed that dr robertson the historian had formed his style upon that of il celebre samuele johnson my friend himself was of that opinion for he once said to me in a pleasant humor sir if robertsons style be faulty he owes it to me that is having too many words and those too big ones  i read to him a letter which lord monboddo had written to me containing some critical remarks upon the style of his journey to the western islands of scotland his lordship praised the very fine passage upon landing at icolmkill we were now treading that illustrious island which was once the luminary of the caledonian regions whence savage clans and roving barbarians derived the benefits of knowledge and the blessings of religion to abstract the mind from all local emotion would be impossible if it were endeavored and would be foolish if it were possible whatever withdraws us from the power of our senses whatever makes the past the distant or the future predominate over the present advances us in the dignity of thinking beings far from me and from my friends be such frigid philosophy as may conduct us indifferent and unmoved over any ground which has been dignified by wisdom bravery or virtue that man is little to be envied whose patriotism would not gain force upon the plain of marathon or whose piety would not grow warmer among the ruins of lona  had our tour produced nothing else but this sublime passage the world must have acnowledged that it was not made in vain the present respectable president of the royal society was so much struck on reading it that he clasped his hands together and remained for some time in an attitude of silent admiration    but his own style being exceedingly dry and hard he disapproved of the richness of johnsons language and of his frequent use of metaphorical expressions johnson why sir this criticism would be just if in my style superfluous words or words too big for the thoughts could be pointed out but this i do not believe can be done for instance in the passage which lord monboddo admires we were now treading that illustrious region the word illustrious contributes nothing to the mere narration for the fact might be told without it but it is not therefore superfluous for it wakes the mind to peculiar attention where something of more than usual importance is to be presented illustrious  for what and then the sentence proceeds to expand the circumstances connected with iona and sir as to metaphorical expression that is a great excellence in style when it is used with propriety for it gives you two ideas for one  conveys the meaning more luminously and generally with a perception of delight  he told me that he had been asked to undertake the new edition of the biographia britannica but had declined it which he afterward said to me he regretted in this regret many will join because it would have procured us more of johnsons most delightful species of writing and although my friend dr kippis has hitherto discharged the task judiciously distinctly and with more impartiality than might have been expected from a separatist it were to have been wished that the superintendance of this literary temple of fame had been assigned to a friend to the constitution in church and state we should not then have had it too much crowded with obscure dissenting teachers doubtless men of merit and worth but not quite to be numbered amongst the most eminent persons who have flourished in great britain and ireland  on saturday september  0 after breakfast when tailor was gone out to his farm dr johnson and i had a serious conversation by ourselves on melancholy and madness which he was i always thought erroneously inclined to confound together melancholy like great wit may be near allied to madness but there is in my opinion a distinct separation between them when he talked of madness he was to be understood as speaking of those who were in any great degree disturbed or as it is commonly expressed troubled in mind some of the ancient philosophers held that all deviations from right reason were madness and whoever wishes to see the opinions both of ancients and moderns upon this subject collected and illustrated with a variety of curious facts may read dr arnolds very entertaining work observations on insanity by thomas arnold m d london        johnson said a madman loves to be with people whom he fears not as a dog fears the lash but of whom he stands in awe i was struck with the justice of this observation to be with those of whom a person whose mind is wavering and dejected stands in awe represses and composes an uneasy tumult of spirits and consoles him with the contemplation of something steady and at least comparatively great  he added madmen are all sensual in the lower stages of the distemper they are eager for gratifications to sooth their minds and divert their attention from the misery which they suffer but when they grow very ill pleasure is too weak for them and they seek for pain we read in the gospels that those unfortunate persons who were possessed with evil spirits which after all i think is the most probable cause of madness as was first suggested to me by my respectable friend sir john pringle had recourse to pain tearing themselves and jumping sometimes into the fire sometimes into the water mr seward has furnished me with a remarkable anecdote in confirmation of dr johnsons observation a tradesman who had acquired a large fortune in london retired from business and went to live at worcester his mind being without its usual occupation and having nothing else to supply its place preyed upon itself so that existence was a torment to him at last he was seized with the stone and a friend who found him in one of its severest fits having expressed his concern no no sir said he dont pity me what i now feel is ease compared with that torture of mind from which it relieves me  employment sir and hardships prevent melancholy i suppose in all our army in america there was not one man who went mad  we entered seriously upon a question of much importance to me which johnson was pleased to consider with friendly attention i had long complained to him that i felt myself discontented in scotland as too narrow a sphere and that i wished to make my chief residence in london the great scene of ambition instruction and amusement a scene which was to me comparatively speaking a heaven upon earth johnson why sir i never knew any one who had such a gust for london as you have and i cannot blame you for your wish to live there yet sir were i in your fathers place i should not consent to your settling there for i have the old seudal notions and i should be afraid that auchinleck would be deserted as you would soon find it more desirable to have a countryseat in a better climate i own however that to consider it as a duty to reside on a family estate is a prejudice for we must consider that workingpeople get employment equally and the produce of land is sold equally whether a great family resides at home or not and if the rents of an estate be carried to london they return again in the circulation of commerce nay sir we must perhaps allow that carrying the rents to a distance is a good because it contributes to that circulation we must however allow that a wellregulated great family may improve a neighborhood in civility and elegance and give an example of good order virtue and piety and so its residence at home may be of much advantage but if a great family be disorderly and vicious its residence at home is very pernicious to a neighborhood there is not now the same inducement to live in the country as formerly the pleasures of social life are much better enjoyed in town and there is no longer in the country that power and influence in proprietors of land which they had in old times and which made the country so agreeable to them the lord of auchinleck now is not near so great a man as the lord of auchinleck was a hundred years ago  i told him that one of my ancestors never went from home without being attended by thirty men on horseback johnsons shrewdness and spirit of enquiry were exerted upon every occasion pray said he how did your ancestor support his thirty men and thirty horses when he went at a distance from home in an age when there was hardly any money in circulation i suggested the same difficulty to a friend who mentioned douglass going to the holy land with a numerous train of followers douglas could no doubt maintain followers enough while living upon his own lands the produce of which supplied them with food but he could not carry that food to the holy land and as there was no commerce by which he could be supplied with money how could he maintain them in foreign countries  i suggested a doubt that if i were to reside in london the exquisite zest with which i relished it in occasional visits might go off and i might grow tired of it johnson why sir you find no man at all intellectual who is willing to leave london no sir when a man is tired of london he is tired of life for there is in london all that life can afford  to obviate his apprehension that by settling in london i might desert the seat of my ancestors i assured him that i had old feudal principles to a degree of enthusiasm and that i felt all the dulcedo of the natale solum i reminded him that the lord of auchinleck had an elegant house in front of which he could ride ten miles forward upon his own territories upon which he had upwards of six hundred people attached to him that the family seat was rich in natural romantic beauties of rock wood and water and that in my morn of life i had appropriated the finest descriptions in the ancient classicks to certain scenes there which were thus associated in my mind that when all this was considered i should certainly pass a part of the year at home and enjoy it the more from variety and from bringing with me a share of the intellectual stores of the metropolis he listened to all this and kindly hoped it might be as i now supposed  he said a country gentleman should bring his lady to visit london as soon as he can that they may have agreeable topics for conversation when they are by themselves  as i meditated trying my fortune in westminster hall our conversation turned upon the profession of the law in england johnson you must not indulge too sanguine hopes should you be called to our bar i was told by a very sensible lawyer that there are a great many chances against any mans success in the profession of the law the candidates are so numerous and those who get large practice so few he said it was by no means true that a man of good parts and application is sure of having business though he indeed allowed that if such a man could but appear in a few causes his merit would be known and he would get forward but that the great risk was that a man might pass half a lifetime in the courts and never have an opportunity of showing his abilities  we talked of employment being absolutely necessary to preserve the mind from wearying and growing fretful especially in those who have a tendency to melancholy and i mentioned to him a saying which somebody had related of an american savage who when an european was expatiating on all the advantages of money  this question will it purchase occupation johnson depend upon it sir this saying is too refined for a savage and sir money will purchase occupation it will purchase all the conveniences of life it will purchase variety of company it will purchase all sorts of entertainment  i talked to him of forsters voyage to the south seas which pleased me but i found he did not like it sir said he there is a great affectation of fine writing in it boswell but he carries you along with him johnson no sir he does not carry me along with him he leaves me behind him or rather indeed he sets me before him for he makes me turn over many leaves at a time  on sunday september    we went to the church of ashbourne which is one of the largest and most luminous that i have seen in any town of the same size i felt great satisfaction in considering that i was supported in my fondness of solemn public worship by the general concurrence and munificence of mankind  johnson and tailor were so different from each other that i wondered at their preserving such an intimacy their having been at school and college together might in some degree account for this but sir joshua reynolds has furnished me with a stronger reason for johnson mentioned to him that he had been told by tailor he was to be his heir i shall not take upon me to animadvert upon this but certain it is that johnson paid great attention to tailor he now however said to me sir i love him but i do not love him more my regard for him does not increase as it is said in the apocrypha his talk is of bullocks ecclesiasticus chap xxxviii v    the whole chapter may be read as an admirable illustration of the superiority of cultivated minds over the gross and illiterate  i do not suppose he is very fond of my company his habits are by no means sufficiently clerical this he knows that i see and no man likes to live under the eye of perpetual disapprobation  i have no doubt that a good many sermons were composed for tailor by johnson at this time i found upon his table a part of one which he had newly begun to write and concio pro tayloro appears in one of his diaries when to these circumstances we add the internal evidence from the power of thinking and style in the collection which the reverend mr hayes has published with the significant title of sermons left for publication by the reverend john tailor ll d our conviction will be complete  i however would not have it thought that dr tailor though he could not write like johnson as indeed who could d not sometimes compose sermons as good as those which we generally have from very respectable divines he showed me one with notes on the margin in johnsons handwriting and i was present when he read another to johnson that he might have his opinion of it and johnson said it was very well these we may be sure were not johnsons for he was above little arts or tricks of deception  johnson was by no means of opinion that every man of a learned profession should consider it as incumbent upon him or as necessary to his credit to appear as an author when in the ardour of ambition for literary fame i regretted to him one day that an eminent judge had nothing of it and therefore would leave no perpetual monument of himself to posterity alas sir said johnson what a mass of confusion should we have if every bishop and every judge every lawyer physician and divine were to write books  i mentioned to johnson a respectable person of a very strong mind who had little of that tenderness which is common to human nature as an instance of which when i suggested to him that he should invite his son who had been settled ten years in foreign parts to come home and pay him a visit his answer was no no let him mind his business johnson i do not agree with him sir in this getting money is not all a mans business to cultivate kindness is a valuable part of the business of life  in the evening johnson being in very good spirits entertained us with several characteristical portraits i regret that any of them escaped my retention and diligence i found from experience that to collect my friends conversation so as to exhibit it with any degree of its original flavor it was necessary to write it down without delay to record his sayings after some distance of time was like preserving or pickling longkept and faded fruits or other vegetables which when in that state have little or nothing of their taste when fresh  i shall present my readers with a series of what i gathered this evening from the johnsonian garden  my friend the late earl of cork had a great desire to maintain the literary character of his family he was a genteel man but did not keep up the dignity of his rank he was so generally civil that nobody thanked him for it  did we not hear so much said of jack wilkes we should think more highly of his conversation jack has great variety of talk jack is a scholar and jack has the manners of a gentleman but after hearing his name sounded from pole to pole as the phoenix of convivial felicity we are disappointed in his company he has always been at me but i would do jack a kindness rather than not the contest is now over  garricks gaiety of conversation has delicacy and elegance foot makes you laugh more but foot has the air of a buffoon paid for entertaining the company he indeed well deserves his hire  colley cibber once consulted me as to one of his birthday odes a long time before it was wanted i objected very freely to several passages cibber lost patience and would not read his ode to an end when we had done with criticism we walked over to richardsons the author of clarissa and i wondered to find richardson displeased that i did not treat cibber with more respect now sir to talk of respect for a player smiling disdainfully boswell there sir you are always heretical you never will allow merit to a player johnson merit sir what merit do you respect a ropedancer or a balladsinger boswell no sir but we respect a great player as a man who can conceive lofty sentiments and can express them gracefully johnson what sir a fellow who claps a hump on his back and a lump on his leg and cries i am richard the third nay sir a balladsinger is a higher man for he does two things he repeats and he sings there is both recitation and music in his performance the player only recites boswell my dear sir you may turn any thing into ridicule i allow that a player of farce is not entitled to respect he does a little thing but he who can represent exalted characters and touch the noblest passions has very respectable powers and mankind have agreed in admiring great talents for the stage we must consider too that a great player does what very few are capable to do his art is a very rare faculty who can repeat hamlets soliloquy to be or not to be as garrick does it johnson any body may jemmy there a boy about eight years old who was in the room will do it as well in a week boswell no no sir and as a proof of the merit of great acting and of the value which mankind set upon it garrick has got a hundred thousand pounds johnson is getting a hundred thousand pounds a proof of excellence that has been done by a scoundrel commissary  this was most fallacious reasoning i was sure for once that i had the best side of the argument i boldly maintained the just distinction between a tragedian and a mere theatrical droll between those who rouse our terror and pity and those who only make us laugh if said i betterton and foot were to walk into this room you would respect betterton much more than foot johnson if betterton were to walk into this room with foot foot would soon drive him out of it foot sir quatenus foot has powers superior to them all  on monday september    when at breakfast i unguardedly said to dr johnson i wish i saw you and mrs macaulay together he grew very angry and after a pause while a cloud gathered on his brow he burst out no sir you would not see us quarrel to make you sport dont you know that it is very uncivil to pit two people against one another then checking himself and wishing to be more gentle he added i do not say you should be hanged or drowned for this but it is very uncivil dr tailor thought him in the wrong and spoke to him privately of it but i afterward acknowledged to johnson that i was to blame for i heartily owned that i meant to express a desire to see a contest between mrs macaulay and him but then i knew how the contest would end so that i was to see him triumph johnson sir you cannot be sure how a contest will end and no man has a right to engage two people in a dispute by which their passions may be inflamed and they may part with bitter resentment against each other i would sooner keep company with a man from whom i must guard my pockets than with a man who contrives to bring me into a dispute with somebody that he may hear it this is the great fault of  naming one of our friends endeavoring to introduce a subject upon which he knows two people in the company differ boswell but he told me sir he does it for instruction johnson whatever the motive be sir the man who does so does very wrong he has no more right to instruct himself at such a risk than he has to make two people fight a duel that he may learn how to defend himself  he found great fault with a gentleman of our acquaintance for keeping a bad table sir said he when a man is invited to dinner he is disappointed if he does not get something good i advised mrs thrale who has no cardparties at her house to give sweetmeats and such good things in an evening as are not commonly given and she would find company enough come to her for every body loves to have things which please the palate put in their way without trouble or preparation such was his attention to the minutiae of life and manners  he thus characterised the duke of devonshire grandfather of the present representative of that very respectable family he was not a man of superior abilities but he was a man strictly faithful to his word if for instance he had promised you an acron and none had grown that year in his woods he would not have contented himself with that excuse he would have sent to denmark for it so unconditional was he in keeping his word so high as to the point of honor this was a liberal testimony from the tory johnson to the virtue of a great whig nobleman  mr burkes letter to the sheriffs of bristol on the affairs of america being mentioned johnson censured the composition much and he ridiculed the definition of a free government viz for any practical purpose it is what the people think so edit   p      i will let the king of france govern me on those conditions said he for it is to be governed just as i please and when dr tailor talked of a girl being sent to a parish workhouse and asked how much she could be obliged to work why said johnson as much as is reasonable and what is that as much as she thinks reasonable  dr johnson obligingly proposed to carry me to see islam a romantic scene now belonging to a family of the name of port but formerly the seat of the congreves i suppose it is well described in some of the tours johnson described it distinctly and vividly at which i could not but express to him my wonder because though my eyes as he observed were better than his i could not by any means equal him in representing visible objects i said the difference between us in this respect was as that between a man who has a bad instrument but plays well on it and a man who has a good instrument on which he can play very imperfectly  i recollect a very fine amphitheatre surrounded with hills covered with wood and walks neatly formed along the side of a rocky steep on the quarter next the house with recesses under projections of rock overshadowed with trees in one of which recesses we were told congreve wrote his old bachelor we viewed a remarkable natural curiosity at islam two rivers bursting near each other from the rock not from immediate springs but after having run for many miles under ground plott in his history of staffordshire page     gives an account of this curiosity but johnson would not believe it though we had the attestation of the gardener who said he had put in corks where the river manyfold sinks into the ground and had eatched them in a net placed before one of the openings where the water bursts out indeed such subterraneous courses of water are found in various parts of our globe see plotts history of staffordshire p    and the authorities referred to by him   talking of dr johnsons unwillingness to believe extraordinary things i ventured to say sir you come near humes argument against miracles that it is more probable witnesses should lie or be mistaken than that they should happen johnson why sir hume taking the proposition simply is right but the christian revelation is not proved by the miracles alone but as connected with prophecies and with the doctrines in confirmation of which the miracles were wrought  he repeated his observation that the difference among christians are really of no consequence for instance said he if a protestant objects to a papist you worship images the papist can answer i do not insist on your doing it you may be a very good papist without it i do it only as a help to my devotion i said the great article of christianity is the revelation of immortality johnson admitted it was  in the evening a gentlemanfarmer who was on a visit at dr taylors attempted to dispute with johnson in favor of mungo campbell who shot alexander earl of eglintoune upon his having fallen when retreating from his lordship who he believed was about to seize his gun as he had threatened to do he said he should have done just as campbell did johnson whoever would do as campbell did deserves to be hanged not that i could as a juryman have found him legally guilty of murder but i am glad they found means to convict him the gentlemanfarmer said a poor man has as much honor as a rich man and campbell had that to defend johnson exclaimed a poor man has no honor the english yeoman not dismayed proceeded lord eglintoune was a damned fool to run on upon campbell after being warned that campbell would shoot him if he did johnson who could not bear any thing like swearing angrily replied he was not a damned fool he only thought too well of campbell he did not believe campbell would be such a damned scoundrel as to do so damned a thing his emphasis on damned accompanied with frowning looks reproved his opponents want of decorum in his presence  talking of the danger of being mortified by rejection when making approaches to the acquaintance of the great i observed i am however generally for trying nothing venture nothing have johnson very true sir but i have always been more afraid of failing than hopeful of success and indeed though he had all just respect for rank no man ever less courted the favor of the great  during this interview at ashbourne johnson seemed to be more uniformly social cheerful and alert than i had almost ever seen him he was prompt on great occasions and on small tailor who praised every thing of his own to excess in short whose geese were all swans as the proverb says expatiated on the excellence of his bulldog which he told us was perfectly well shaped johnson after examining the animal attentively thus repressed the vainglory of our host  no sir he is not well shaped for there is not the quick transition from the thickness of the forepart to the tenuity  the thin part  behind which a bulldog ought to have this tenuity was the only hard word that i heard him use during this interview and it will be observed he instantly put another expression in its place tailor said a small bulldog was as good as a large one johnson no sir for in proportion to his size he has strength and your argument would prove that a good bulldog may be as small as a mouse it was amazing how he entered with perspicuity and keenness upon every thing that occurred in conversation most men whom i know would no more think of discussing a question about a bulldog than of attacking a bull  i cannot allow any fragment whatever that floats in my memory concerning the great subject of this work to be lost though a small particular may appear trifling to some it will be relished by others while every little spark adds something to the general blaze and to please the true candid warm admirers of johnson and in any degree increase the splendor of his reputation i bid defiance to the shafts of ridicule or even of malignity showers of them have been discharged at my journal of a tour to the hebrides yet it still sails unhurt along the stream of time and as an attendant upon johnson pursues the triumph and partakes the gale   one morning after breakfast when the sun shone bright we walked out together and pored for some time with placid indolence upon an artificial waterfall which dr tailor had made by building a strong dyke of stone across the river behind his garden it was now somewhat obstructed by branches of trees and other rubbish which had come down the river and settled close to it johnson partly from a desire to see it play more freely and partly from that inclination to activity which will animate at times the most inert and sluggish mortal took a long pole which was lying on the bank and pushed down several parcels of this wreck with painful assiduity while i stood quietly by wondering to behold the sage thus curiously employed and smiling with an humorous satisfaction each time when he carried his point he worked till he was quite out of breath and having found a large dead cat so heavy that he could not move it after several efforts come said he throwing down the pole you shall take it now which i accordingly did and being a fresh man soon made the cat tumble over the cascade this may be laughed at as too trifling to record but it is a small characteristick trait in the flemish picture which i give of my friend and in which therefore i mark the most minute particulars and let it be remembered that aesop at play is one of the instructive apologues of antiquity  i mentioned an old gentleman of our acquaintance whose memory was beginning to fail  johnson there must be a diseased mind where there is a failure of memory at seventy a mans head sir must be morbid if he fails so soon my friend being now himself sixtyeight might think thus but i imagine that threescore and ten the psalmists period of sound human life in later ages may have a failure though there be no disease in the constitution  talking of rochesters poems he said he had given them to mr steevens to castrate for the edition of the poets to which he was to write prefaces dr tailor the only time i ever heard him say any thing witty i am told that the honorable horace walpole has a collection of bon mots by persons who never said but one  observed that if rochester had been castrated himself his exceptionable poems would not have been written i asked if burnet had not given a good life of rochester johnson we have a good death there is not much life i asked whether priors poems were to be printed entire johnson said they were i mentioned lord hailess censure of prior in his preface to a collection of sacred poems by various hands published by him at edinburgh a great many years ago where he mentions those impure tales which will be the eternal opprobrium of their ingenious author johnson sir lord hailes has forgot there is nothing in prior that will excite to lewdness if lord hailes thinks there is he must be more combustible than other people i instanced the tale of paulo purgant and his wife johnson sir there is nothing there but that his wife wanted to be kissed when poor paulo was out of pocket no sir prior is a ladys book no lady is ashamed to have it standing in her library  the hypochondriack disorder being mentioned dr johnson did not think it so common as i supposed  dr tailor said he is the same one day as another burke and reynolds are the same beauclerk except when in pain is the same i am not so myself but this i do not mention commonly  i complained of a wretched changefulness so that i could not preserve for any long continuance the same views of any thing it was most comfortable to me to experience in dr johnsons company a relief from this uneasiness his steady vigorous mind held firm before me those objects which my own feeble and tremulous imagination frequently presented in such a wavering state that my reason could not judge well of them  dr johnson advised me today to have as many books about me as i could that i might read upon any subject upon which i had a desire for instruction at the time what you read then said he you will remember but if you have not a book immediately ready and the subject moulds in your mind it is a chance if you again have a desire to study it he added if a man never has an eager desire for instruction he should prescribe a task for himself but it is better when a man reads from immediate inclination  he repeated a good many lines of horaces odes while we were in the chaise i remember particularly the ode eheu fugaces  he said the dispute as to the comparative excellence of homer or virgil i am informed by mr langton that a great many years ago he was present when this question was agitated between dr johnson and mr burke and to use johnsons phrase they talked their best johnson for homer burke for virgil it may well be supposed to have been one of the ablest and most brilliant contests that ever was exhibited how much must we regret that it has not been preserved was inaccurate we must consider said he whether homer was not the greatest poet though virgil may have produced the finest poem virgil was indebted to homer for the whole invention of the structure of an epick poem and for many of his beauties  he told me that bacon was a favorite author with him but he had never read his works till he was compiling the english dictionary in which he said i might see bacon very often quoted mr seward recollects his having mentioned that a dictionary of the english language might be compiled from bacons writings alone and that he had once an intention of giving an edition of bacon at least of his english works and writing the life of that great man had he executed this intention there can be no doubt that he would have done it in a most masterly manner mallets life of bacon has no inconsiderable merit as an acute and elegant dissertation relative to its subject but mallets mind was not comprehensive enough to embrace the vast extent of lord verulams genius and research dr warburton therefore observed with witty justness that mallet in his life of bacon had forgotten that he was a philosopher and if he should write the life of the duke of marlborough which he had undertaken to do he would probably forget that he was a general  wishing to be satisfied what degree of truth there was in a story which a friend of johnsons and mine had told me to his disadvantage i mentioned it to him in direct terms and it was to this effect that a gentleman who had lived in great intimacy with him shown him much kindness and even relieved him from a spunginghouse having afterward fallen into bad circumstances was one day when johnson was at dinner with him seized for debt and carried to prison that johnson sat still undisturbed and went on eating and drinking upon which the gentlemans sister who was present could not suppress her indignation what sir said she are you so unfeeling as not even to offer to go to my brother in his distress you who have been so much obliged to him and that johnson answered madam i owe him no obligation what he did for me he would have done for a dog  johnson assured me that the story was absolutely false but like a man conscious of being in the right and desirous of completely vindicating himself from such a charge he did not arrogantly rest on a mere denial and on his general character but proceeded thus  sir i was very intimate with that gentleman and was once relieved by him from an arrest but i never was present when he was arrested never knew that he was arrested and i believe he never was in difficulties after the time when he relieved me i loved him much yet in talking of his general character i may have said though i do not remember that i ever did so that as his generosity proceeded from no principle but was a part of his profusion he would do for a dog what he would do for a friend but i never applied this remark to any particular instance and certainly not to his kindness to me if a profuse man who does not value his money and gives a large sum to a whore gives half as much or an equally large sum to relieve a friend it cannot be esteemed as virtue this was all that i could say of that gentleman and if said at all it must have been said after his death sir i would have gone to the worlds end to relieve him the remark about the dog if made by me was such a sally as might escape one when painting a man highly  on tuesday september    johnson was remarkably cordial to me it being necessary for me to return to scotland soon i had fixed on the next day for my setting out and i felt a tender concern at the thought of parting with him he had at this time frankly communicated to me many particulars which are inserted in this work in their proper places and once when i happened to mention that the expense of my jaunt would come to much more than i had computed he said why sir if the expense were to be an inconvenience you would have reason to regret it but if you have had the money to spend i know not that you could have purchased as much pleasure with it in any other way  during this interview at ashbourne johnson and i frequently talked with wonderful pleasure of mere trifles which had occurred in our tour to the hebrides for it had left a most agreeable and lasting impression upon his mind  he found fault with me for using the phrase to make money dont you see said he the impropriety of it to make money is to coin it you should say get money the phrase however is i think pretty current but johnson was at all times jealous of infractions upon the genuine english language and prompt to repress colloquial barbarisms such as pledging myself for undertaking line for department or branch as the civil line the banking line he was particularly indignant against the almost universal use of the word idea in the sense of notion or opinion when it is clear that idea can only signify something of which an image can be formed in the mind we may have an idea or image of a mountain a tree a building but we cannot surely have an idea or image of an argument or proposition yet we hear the sages of the law delivering their ideas upon the question under consideration and the first speakers in parliament entirely coinciding in the idea which has been ably stated by an honorable member  or reprobating an idea unconstitutional and fraught with the most dangerous consequences to a great and free country johnson called this modern cant  i perceived that he pronounced the word heard as if spelt with a double e heerd instead of sounding it herd as is most usually done he said his reason was that if it were pronounced herd there would be a single exception from the english pronunciation of the syllable ear and he thought it better not to have that exception  he praised grangers ode on solitude in dodsleys collection and repeated with great energy the exordium  o solitude romantic maid whether by nodding towers you tread or haunt the desarts trackless gloom or hover over the yawning tomb or climb the andes clifted side or by the niles coy source abide or starting from your halfyears sleep from hecla view the thawing deep or at the purple dawn of day tadnors marble wastes survey observing this sir is very noble  in the evening our gentlemanfarmer and two others entertained themselves and the company with a great number of tunes on the fiddle johnson desired to have let ambition fire thy mind played over again and appeared to give a patient attention to it though he owned to me that he was very insensible to the power of music i told him that it affected me to such a degree as often to agitate my nerves painfully producing in my mind alternate sensations of pathetick dejection so that i was ready to shed tears and of daring resolution so that i was inclined to rush into the thickest part of a battle sir said he i should never hear it if it made me such a fool  much of the effect of music i am satisfied is owing to association of ideas that air which instantly and irresistibly excites in the swiss when in a foreign land the malady du pais has i am told no intrinsic power of sound and i know from my own experience that scotch reels though brisk make me melancholy because i used to hear them in my early years at a time when mr pit called for soldiers from the mountains of the north and numbers of brave highlanders were going abroad never to return whereas the airs in the beggars opera many of which are very soft never fail to render me gay because they are associated with the warm sensations and high spirits of london this evening while some of the tunes of ordinary composition were played with no great skill my frame was agitated and i was conscious of a generous attachment to dr johnson as my preceptor and friend mixed with an affectionate regret that he was an old man whom i should probably lose in a short time i thought i could defend him at the point of my sword my reverence and affection for him were in full glow i said to him my dear sir we must meet every year if you dont quarrel with me johnson nay sir you are more likely to quarrel with me than i with you my regard for you is greater almost than i have words to express but i do not choose to be always repeating it write it down in the first leaf of your pocketbook and never doubt of it again  i talked to him of misery being the doom of man in this life as displayed in his vanity of human wishes yet i observed that things were done upon the supposition of happiness grand houses were built fine gardens were made splendid places of public amusement were contrived and crowded with company johnson alas sir these are all only struggles for happiness when i first entered ranelagh it gave an expansion and gay sensation to my mind such as i never experienced any where else but as xerxes wept when he viewed his immense army and considered that not one of that great multitude would be alive a hundred years afterward so it went to my heart to consider that there was not one in all that brilliant circle that was not afraid to go home and think but that the thoughts of each individual there would be distressing when alone this reflection was experimentally just the feeling of languor pope mentions stretched on the rack of a too easy chair but i recollect a couplet quite apposite to my subject in virtue an ethick epistle a beautiful and instructive poem by an anonymous writer in      who treating of pleasure in excess says till languor suffering on the rack of bliss confess that man was never made for this   which succeeds the animation of gaiety is itself a very severe pain and when the mind is then vacant a thousand disappointments and vexations rush in and excruciate will not many even of my fairest readers allow this to be true  i suggested that being in love and flattered with hopes of success or having some favorite scheme in view for the next day might prevent that wretchedness of which we had been talking johnson why sir it may sometimes be so as you suppose but my conclusion is in general but too true  while johnson and i stood in calm conference by ourselves in dr taylors garden at a pretty late hour in a serene autumn night looking up to the heavens i directed the discourse to the subject of a future state my friend was in a placid and most benignant frame sir said he i do not imagine that all things will be made clear to us immediately after death but that the ways of providence will be explained to us very gradually i ventured to ask him whether although the words of some texts of scripture seemed strong in support of the dreadful doctrine of an eternity of punishment we might not hope that the denunciation was figurative and would not literally be executed johnson sir you are to consider the intention of punishment in a future state we have no reason to be sure that we shall then be no longer liable to offend against god we do not know that even the angels are quite in a state of security nay we know that some of them have fallen it may therefore perhaps be necessary in order to preserve both men and angels in a state of rectitude that they should have continually before them the punishment of those who have deviated from it but we may hope that by some other means a fall from rectitude may be prevented some of the texts of scripture upon this subject are as you observe indeed strong but they may admit of a mitigated interpretation he talked to me upon this aweful and delicate question in a gentle tone and as if afraid to be decisive  after supper i accompanied him to his apartment and at my request he dictated to me an argument in favor of the negro who was then claiming his liberty in an action in the court of session in scotland this being laid up somewhere amidst my multiplicity of papers at auchinleck has escaped my search for this work but when sound i shall take care that my readers shall have it  he had always been very zealous against slavery in every form in which i with all deference thought that he discovered a zeal without knowledge upon one occasion when in company with some very grave men at oxford his toast was here is to the next insurrection of the negroes in the west indies his violent prejudice against our westindian and american settlers appeared whenever there was an opportunity toward the conclusion of his taxation no tyranny he says how is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes and in his conversation with mr wilkes see page    of this volume  he asked where did beckford and trecothick learn english that trecothick could both speak and write good english is well known i myself was favored with his correspondence concerning the brave corsicans and that beckford could speak it with a spirit of honest resolution even to his majesty as his faithful lord mayor of london is commemorated by the noble monument erected to him in guildhall  when i said now to johnson that i was afraid i kept him too late up no sir said he i dont care though i sit all night with you this was an animated speech from a man in his sixtyninth year  had i been as attentive not to displease him as i ought to have been i know not but this vigil might have been fulfilled but i unluckily entered upon the controversy concerning the right of great britain to tax america and attempted to argue in favor of our fellow subjects on the other side of the atlantic i insisted that america might be very well governed and made to yield a sufficient revenue by the means of influence as exemplified in ireland while the people might be pleased with the imagination of their participating of the british constitution by having a body of representatives without whose consent money could not be exacted from them johnson could not bear my thus opposing his avowed opinion which he had exerted himself with an extreme degree of heat to enforce and the violent agitation into which he was thrown while answering or rather reprimanding me alarmed me so that i heartily repented of my having unthinkingly introduced the subject i myself however grew warm and the change was great from the calm state of philosophical discussion in which we had a little before been pleasingly employed  i talked of the corruption of the british parliament in which i alleged that any question however unreasonable or unjust might be carried by a venal majority and i spoke with high admiration of the roman senate as if composed of men sincerely desirous to resolve what they should think best for their country my friend would allow no such character to the roman senate and he maintained that the british parliament was not corrupt and that there was no occasion to corrupt its members asserting that there was hardly ever any question of great importance before parliament any question in which a man might not very well vote either upon one side or the other he said there had been none in his time except that respecting america  we were fatigued by the contest which was produced by my want of caution and he was not then in the humor to slide into easy and cheerful talk it therefore so happened that we were after an hour or two very willing to separate and go to bed  on wednesday september    i went into dr johnsons room before he got up and finding that the storm of the preceding night was quite laid i sat down upon his bedside and he talked with as much readiness and goodhumour as ever he recommended to me to plant a considerable part of a large moorish farm which i had purchased and he made several calculations of the expense and profit for he delighted in exercising his mind on the science of numbers he pressed upon me the importance of planting at the first in a very sufficient manner quoting the saying in bello non licet bis errare and adding this is equally true in planting  i spoke with gratitude of dr taylors hospitality and as evidence that it was not on account of his good table alone that johnson visited him often i mentioned a little anecdote which had escaped my friends recollection and at hearing which repeated he smiled one evening when i was sitting with him frank delivered this message sir dr tailor sends his compliments to you and begs you will dine with him tomorrow he has got a hare  my compliments said johnson and i will dine with him hare or rabbit  after breakfast i departed and pursued my journey northwards i took my postchaise from the green man a very good inn at ashbourne the mistress of which a mighty civil gentlewoman curtseying very low presented me with an engraving of the sign of her house to which she had subjoined in her own handwriting an address in such singular simplicity of style that i have preserved it pasted upon one of the boards of my original journal at this time and shall here insert it for the amusement of my readers  m killingleys duty waits upon mr boswell is exceedingly obliged to him for this favor whenever he comes this way hopes for a continuance of the same would mr boswell name the house to his extensive acquaintance it would be a singular favor conferred on one who has it not in her power to make any other return but her most grateful thanks and sincerest prayers for his happiness in time and in a blessed eternity  tuesday morn from this meeting at ashbourne i derived a considerable accession to my johnsonian store i communicated my original journal to sir william forbes in whom i have always placed deserved confidence and what he wrote to me concerning it is so much to my credit as the biographer of johnson that my readers will i hope grant me their indulgence for here inserting it it is not once or twice going over it says sir william that will satisfy me for i find in it a high degree of instruction as well as entertainment and i derive more benefit from dr johnsons admirable discussions than i should be able to draw from his personal conversation for i suppose there is not a man in the world to whom he discloses his sentiments so freely as to yourself  i cannot omit a curious circumstance which occurred at edensorinn close by chatsworth to survey the magnificence of which i had gone a considerable way out of my road to scotland the inn was then kept by a very joll landlord whose name i think was malton he happened to mention that the celebrated dr johnson had been in his house i inquired who this dr johnson was that i might hear mine hosts notion of him sir said he johnson the great writer oddity as they call him he is the greatest writer in england he writes for the ministry he has a correspondence abroad and lets them know what is going on  my friend who had a thorough dependence upon the authenticity of my relation without any embellishment as falsehood or fiction is too gently called laughed a good deal at this representation of himself  mr boswell to dr johnson my dear sir edinburgh sept         by the first post i inform you of my safe arrival at my own house and that i had the comfort of finding my wife and children all in good health  when i look back upon our late interview it appears to me to have answered expectation better than almost any scheme of happiness that i ever put in execution my journal is stored with wisdom and wit and my memory is filled with the recollection of lively and affectionate feelings which now i think yield me more satisfaction than at the time when they were first excited i have experienced this upon other occasions i will be obliged to you if you will explain it to me for it seems wonderful that pleasure should be more vivid at a distance than when near i wish you may find yourself in the humor to do me this favor but i flatter myself with no strong hope of it for i have observed that unless upon very serious occasions your letters to me are not answers to those which i write  i then expressed to him much uneasiness that i had mentioned to him the name of the gentleman who had told me the story so much to his disadvantage the truth of which he had completely refuted for that my having done so might be interpreted as a breach of confidence and offend one whose society i valued  therefore earnestly requesting that no notice might be taken of it to any body till i should be in london and have an opportunity to talk it over with the gentleman   to james boswell fsq dear sir you will wonder or you have wondered why no letter has come from me what you wrote at your return had in it such a strain of cowardly caution as gave me no pleasure i could not well do what you wished i had no need to vex you with a refusal i have seen mr  and as to him have set all right without any inconvenience so far as i know to you mrs thrale had forgot the story you may now be at ease  and at ease i certainly wish you for the kindness that you showed in coming so long a journey to see me it was pity to keep you so long in pain but upon reviewing the matter i do not see what i could have done better than as i did  i hope you found at your return my dear enemy and all her little people quite well and had no reason to repent your journey i think on it with great gratitude  i was not well when you left me at the doctors and i grew worse yet i staid on and at lichfield was very ill traveling however did not make me worse and when i came to london i complied with a summons to go to brighthelmston where i saw beauclerk and staid three days  our club has recommenced last friday but i was not there langton has another wench a daughter born to him  mrs thrale is in hopes of a young brewer they got by their trade last year a very large sum and their expenses are proportionate  mrs williamss health is very bad and i have had for some time a very difficult and laborious respiration but i am better by purges abstinence and other methods i am yet however much behindhand in my health and rest  dr blairs sermons are now universally commended but let him think that i had the honor of first finding and first praising his excellencies i did not stay to add my voice to that of the public  my dear friend let me thank you once more for your visit you did me great honor and i hope met with nothing that displeased you i staid long at ashbourne not much pleased yet awkward at departing i then went to lichfield where i found my friend at stowhill mrs aston very dangerously diseased such is life let us try to pass it well whatever it be for there is surely something beyond it  well now i hope all is well write as soon as you can to  dear sir your affectionate servant sam johnson london nov          to dr samuel johnson my dear sir edinburgh nov         this days post has at length relieved me from much uneasiness by bringing me a letter from you i was indeed doubly uneasy  on my own account and yours i was very anxious to be secured against any bad consequences from my imprudence in mentioning the gentlemans name who had told me a story to your disadvantage and as i could hardly suppose it possible that you would delay so long to make me easy unless you was ill i was not a little apprehensive about you you must not be offended when i venture to tell you that you appear to me to have been too rigid upon this occasion the cowardly caution which gave you no pleasure was suggested to me by a friend here to whom i mentioned the strange story and the detection of its falsity as an instance how one may be deceived by what is apparently very good authority but as i am still persuaded that as i might have obtained the truth without mentioning the gentlemans name it was wrong in me to do it i cannot see that you are just in blaming my caution but if you were ever so just in your disapprobation might you not have dealt more tenderly with me  i went to auchinleck about the middle of october and passed some time with my father very comfortably  i am engaged in a criminal prosecution against a country schoolmaster for indecent behavior to his female scholars there is no statute against such abominable conduct but it is punishable at common law i will be obliged to you for your assistance in this extraordinary trial  i ever am my dear sir your faithful humble servant james boswell   about this time i wrote to johnson giving him an account of the decision of the negro cause by the court of session which by those who hold even the mildest and best regulated slavery in abomination of which number i do not hesitate to declare that i am none should be remembered with high respect and to the credit of scotland for it went upon a much broader ground than the case of somerset which was decided in england see state trials vol xi p     and mr hargraves argument  being truly the general question whether a perpetual obligation of service to one master in any mode should be sanctioned by the law of a free country a negro then called joseph knight a native of africa who having been brought to jamaica in the usual course of the slave trade and purchased by a scotch gentleman in that island had attended his master to scotland where it was officiously suggested to him that he would be found entitled to his liberty without any limitation he accordingly brought his action in the course of which the advocates on both sides did themselves great honor mr maclaurin has had the praise of johnson for his argument the motto to it was happily chosen   nimium ne creed colori i cannot avoid mentioning a circumstance no less strange than true that a brother advocate in considerable practice but of whom it certainly cannot be said ingenuas didicit fideliter arts asked mr maclaurin with a face of flippant assurance are these words your own in favor of the negro and mr macconochie distinguished himself on the same side by his ingenuity and extraordinary research mr cullen on the part of the master discovered good information and sound reasoning in which he was well supported by mr james fergusson a man remarkable for a manly understanding and a knowledge both of books and of the world but i cannot too highly praise the speech which mr henry dundas generously contributed to the cause of the sooty stranger mr dundass scottish accent which has been so often in vain obtruded as an objection to his powerful abilities in parliament was no disadvantage to him in his own country and i do declare that upon this memorable question he impressed me and i believe all his audience with such feelings as were produced by some of the most eminent orations of antiquity this testimony i liberally give to the excellence of an old friend with whom it has been my lot to differ very widely upon many political topics yet i persuade myself without malice a great majority of the lords of session decided for the negro but four of their number the lord president lord elliock lord monboddo and lord covington resolutely maintained the lawfulness of a status which has been acknowledged in all ages and countries and that when freedom flourished as in old greece and rome  to james boswell esquire dear sir this is the time of the year in which all express their good wishes to their friends and i send mine to you and your family may your lives be long happy and good i have been much out of order but i hope do not grow worse  the crime of the schoolmaster whom you are engaged to prosecute is very great and may be suspected to be too common in our law it would be a breach of the peace and a misdemeanour that is a kind of indefinite crime not capital but punishable at the discretion of the court you cannot want matter all that needs to be said will easily occur  mr shaw the author of the gaelick grammar desires me to make a request for him to lord eglintoune that he may be appointed chaplain to one of the newraised regiments  all our friends are as they were little has happened to them of either good or bad mrs thrale ran a great black hairdressing pin into her eye but by great evacuation she kept it from inflaming and it is almost well miss reynolds has been out of order but is better mrs williams is in a very poor state of health  if i should write on i should perhaps write only complaints and therefore i will content myself with telling you that i love to think on you and to hear from you and that i am  dear sir yours faithfully sam johnson december          prefaces biographical and critical to the most eminent of the english poets published by the booksellers of london the remaining volumes came out in the year    0 the poets were selected by the several booksellers who had the honorary copyright which is still preserved among them by mutual compact notwithstanding the decision of the house of lords against the perpetuity of literary property we have his own authority life of watts  that by his recommendation the poems of blackmore watts pomfret and yalden were added to the collection of this work i shall speak more particularly hereafter  to dr samuel johnson dear sir edinburgh jan        your congratulations upon a new year are mixed with complaint mine must be so too my wife has for some time been very ill having been confined to the house these three months by a severe cold attended with alarming symptoms  here i gave a particular account of the distress which the person upon every account most dear to me suffered and of the dismal slate of  did you ever look at a book written by wilson a scotsman under the latin name of volusenus according to the custom of literary men at a certain period it is entitled de animi tranquillitate i earnestly desire tranquillity bona res quies but i fear i shall never attain it for when unoccupied i grow gloomy and occupation agitates me to feverishness  i am dear sir your most affectionate humble servant james boswell   to james boswell esquire dear sir to a letter so interesting as your last it is proper to return some answer however little i may be disposed to write  your alarm at your ladys illness was reasonable and not disproportionate to the appearance of the disorder i hope your physical friends conjecture is now verified and all fear of a consumption at an end a little care and exercise will then restore her london is a good air for ladies and if you bring her hither i will do for her what she did for me  i will retire from my apartments for her accommodation behave kindly to her and keep her cheerful  you always seem to call for tenderness know then that in the first month of the present year i very highly esteem and very cordially love you i hope to tell you this at the beginning of every year as long as we live and why should we trouble ourselves to tell or hear it oftener  tell veronica euphemia and alexander that i wish them as well as their parents many happy years  you have ended the negros cause much to my mind lord auchinleck and dear lord hailes were on the side of liberty lord hailess name reproaches me but if he saw my languid neglect of my own affairs he would rather pity than resent my neglect of his i hope to mend ut et mihi vivam et amicis  i am dear sir yours affectionately sam johnson january         my service to my fellowtraveller joseph     to dr samuel johnson my dear sir edinburgh feb         why i have delayed for near a month to thank you for your last affectionate letter i cannot say for my mind has been in better health these three weeks than for some years past i believe i have evaded till i could send you a copy of lord hailess opinion on the negros cause which he wishes you to read and correct any errors that there may be in the language for says he we live in a critical though not a learned age and i seek to screen myself under the shield of ajax i communicated to him your apology for keeping the sheets of his annals so long he says i am sorry to see that dr johnson is in a state of languor why should a sober christian neither an enthusiast nor a fanatic be very merry or very sad i envy his lordships comfortable constitution but well do i know that languor and dejection will afflict the best however excellent their principles i am in possession of lord hailess opinion in his own handwriting and have had it for some time my excuse then for procrastination must be that i wanted to have it copied and i have now put that off so long that it will be better to bring it with me than send it as i shall probably get you to look at it sooner when i solicit you in person  my wife who is i thank god a good deal better is much obliged to you for your very polite and courteous offer of your apartment but if she goes to london it will be best for her to have lodgings in the more airy vicinity of hydepark i however doubt much if i shall be able to prevail with her to accompany me to the metropolis for she is so different from you and me that she dislikes traveling and she is so anxious about her children that she thinks she should be unhappy if at a distance from them she therefore wishes rather to go to some country place in scotland where she can have them with her  i purpose being in london about the  0th of next month as i think it creditable to appear in the house of lords as one of douglass counsel in the great and last competition between duke hamilton and him  i am sorry poor mrs williams is so ill though her temper is unpleasant she has always been polite and obliging to me i wish many happy years to good mr levett who i suppose holds his usual place at your breakfasttable dr percy the bishop of dromore humorously observed that levett used to breakfast on the crust of a roll which johnson after tearing out the crumb for himself threw to his humble friend   i ever am my dear sir your affectionate humble servant james boswell   to the same my dear sir edinburgh feb         you are at present busy amongst the english poets preparing for the public instruction and entertainment prefaces biographical and critical it will not therefore be out of season to appeal to you for the decision of a controversy which has arisen between a lady and me concerning a passage in parnell that poet tells us that his hermit quitted his cell    to know the world by sight to find if books or swains report it right for yet by swains alone the world he knew whose feet came wandering over the nightly dew i maintain that there is an inconsistency here for as the hermits notions of the world were formed from the reports both of books and swains he could not justly be said to know by swains alone be pleased to judge between us and let us have your reasons  what do you say to taxation no tyranny now after lord norths declaration or confession or whatever else his conciliatory speech should be called i never differed from you on politics but upon two points  the middlesex election and the taxation of the americans by the british houses of representatives there is a charm in the word parliament so i avoid it as i am a steady and a warm tory i regret that the king does not see it to be better for him to receive constitutional supplies from his american subjects by the voice of their own assemblies where his royal person is represented than through the medium of his british subjects i am persuaded that the power of the crown which i wish to increase would be greater when in contact with all its dominions than if the rays of regal bounty alluding to a line in his vanity of human wishes when describing cardinal wolsev in his state of elevation through him the rays of regal bounty shine  were to shine upon america through that dense and troubled body  a modern british parliament but enough of this subject for your angry voice at ashbourne upon it still sounds aweful in my minds ears i ever am  my dear sir your most affectionate humble servant james boswell   to the same my dear sir edinburgh march         the alarm of your late illness distressed me but for a few hours for on the evening of the day that it reached me i found it contradicted in the london chronicle which i could depend upon as authentic concerning you mr strahan being the printer of it i did not see the paper in which the approaching extinction of a bright luminary was announced sir william forbes told me of it and he says he saw me so uneasy that he did not give me the report in such strong terms as he had read it he afterward sent me a letter from mr langton to him which relieved me much i am however not quite easy as i have not heard from you and now i shall not have that comfort before i see you for i set out for london tomorrow before the post comes in i hope to be with you on wednesday morning and i ever am with the highest veneration  my dear sir your much obliged faithful and affectionate humble servant james boswell   on wednesday march    i arrived in london and was informed by good mr francis that his master was better and was gone to mr thrales at streatham to which place i wrote to him begging to know when he would be in town he was not expected for some time but next day having called on dr tailor in deansyard westminster i found him there and was told he had come to town for a few hours he met me with his usual kindness but instantly returned to the writing of something on which he was employed when i came in and on which he seemed much intent finding him thus engaged i made my visit very short and had no more of his conversation except his expressing a serious regret that a friend of ours was living at too much expense considering how poor an appearance he made if said he a man has splendor from his expense if he spends his money in pride or in pleasure he has value but if he lets others spend it for him which is most commonly the case he has no advantage from it  on friday march  0 i found him at his own house sitting with mrs williams and was informed that the room formerly allotted to me was now appropriated to a charitable purpose mrs desmoulins daughter of dr swinsen johnsons godfather and widow of mr desmoulins a writingmaster  and i think her daughter and a miss carmichael being all lodged in it such was his humanity and such his generosity that mrs desmoulins herself told me he allowed her halfaguinea a week let it be remembered that this was above a twelfth part of his pension  his liberality indeed was at all periods of his life very remarkable mr howard of lichfield at whose fathers house johnson had in his early years been kindly received told me that when he was a boy at the charter house his father wrote to him to go and pay a visit to mr samuel johnson which he accordingly did and found him in an upper room of poor appearance johnson received him with much courteousness and talked a great deal to him as to a schoolboy of the course of his education and other particulars when he afterward came to know and understand the high character of this great man he recollected his condescension with wonder he added that when he was going away mr johnson presented him with halfaguinea and this said mr howard was at a time when he probably had not another  we retired from mrs williams to another room tom davies soon after joined us he had now unfortunately failed in his circumstances and was much indebted to dr johnsons kindness for obtaining for him many alleviations of his distress after he went away johnson blamed his folly in quitting the stage by which he and his wife got five hundred pounds a year i said i believed it was owing to churchills attack upon him he mouths a sentence as curs mouth a bone johnson i believe so too sir but what a man is he who is to be driven from the stage by a line another line would have driven him from his shop  i told him that i was engaged as counsel at the bar of the house of commons to oppose a roadbill in the county of stirling and asked him what mode he would advise me to follow in addressing such an audience johnson why sir you must provide yourself with a good deal of extraneous matter which you are to produce occasionally so as to fill up the time for you must consider that they do not listen much if you begin with the strength of your cause it may be lost before they begin to listen when you catch a moment of attention press the merits of the question upon them he said as to one point of the merits that he thought it would be a wrong thing to deprive the small landholders of the privilege of assessing themselves for making and repairing the high roads it was destroying so much liberty without a good reason which was always a bad thing when i mentioned this observation next day to mr wilkes he pleasantly said what does he talk of liberty liberty is as ridiculous in his mouth as religion in mine mr wilkess advice as to the best mode of speaking at the bar of the house of commons was not more respectful toward the senate than that of dr johnson be as impudent as you can as merry as you can and say whatever comes uppermost jack lee is the best heard there of any counsel and he is the most impudent dog and always abusing us  in my interview with dr johnson this evening i was quite easy quite as his companion upon which i find in my journal the following reflection so ready is my mind to suggest matter for dissatisfaction that i felt a sort of regret that i was so easy i missed that aweful reverence with which i used to contemplate mr samuel johnson in the complex magnitude of his literary moral and religious character i have a wonderful superstitious love of mystery when perhaps the truth is that it is owing to the cloudy darkness of my own mind i should be glad that i am more advanced in my progress of being so that i can view dr johnson with a steadier and clearer eye my dissatisfaction tonight was foolish would it not be foolish to regret that we shall have less mystery in a future state that we now see in a glass darkly but shall then see face to face  this reflection which i thus freely communicate will be valued by the thinking part of my readers who may have themselves experienced similar states of mind  he returned next day to streatham to mr thrales where as mr strahan once complained to me he was in a great measure absorbed from the society of his old friends i was kept in london by business and wrote to him on the   th that a separation from him for a week when we were so near was equal to a separation for a year when we were at four hundred miles distance i went to streatham on monday march  0 before he appeared mrs thrale made a very characteristical remark  i do not know for certain what will please dr johnson but i know for certain that it will displease him to praise any thing even what he likes extravagantly  at dinner he laughed at querulous declamations against the age on account of luxury  increase of london  scarcity of provisions  and other such topics houses said he will be built till rents fall and corn is more plentiful now than ever it was  i had before dinner repeated a ridiculous story told me by an old man who had been a passenger with me in the stagecoach today mrs thrale having taken occasion to allude to it in talking to me called it the story told you by the old woman  now madam said i give me leave to catch you in the fact it was not an old woman but an old man whom i mentioned as having told me this i presumed to take an opportunity in presence of johnson of showing this lively lady how ready she was unintentionally to deviate from exact authenticity of narration  thomas a kempis he observed must be a good book as the world has opened its arms to receive it it is said to have been printed in one language or other as many times as there have been months since it first came out i always was struck with this sentence in it be not angry that you cannot make others as you wish them to be since you cannot make yourself as you wish to be  he said i was angry with hurd about cowley for having published a selection of his works but upon better consideration i think there is no impropriety in a mans publishing as much as he chooses of any author if he does not put the rest out of the way a man for instance may print the odes of horace alone he seemed to be in a more indulgent humor than when this subject was discussed between him and mr murphy see p    of this volume   when we were at tea and coffee there came in lord trimblestown in whose family was an ancient irish peerage but it suffered by taking the generous side in the troubles of the last century he was a man of pleasing conversation and was accompanied by a young gentleman his son  i mentioned that i had in my possession the life of sir robert sibbald the celebrated scottish antiquary and founder of the royal college of physicians at edinburgh in the original manuscript in his own handwriting and that it was i believed the most natural and candid account of himself that ever was given by any man as an instance he tells that the duke of perth then chancellor of scotland pressed him very much to come over to the roman catholic faith that he resisted all his graces arguments for a considerable time till one day he felt himself as it were instantaneously convinced and with tears in his eyes ran into the dukes arms and embraced the ancient religion that he continued very steady in it for some time and accompanied his grace to london one winter and lived in his household that there he found the rigid fasting prescribed by the church very severe upon him that this disposed him to reconsider the controversy and having then seen that he was in the wrong he returned to protestantism i talked of some time or other publishing this curious life mrs thrale i think you had as well let alone that publication to discover such weakness exposes a man when he is gone johnson nay it is an honest picture of human nature how often are the primary motives of our greatest actions as small as sibbalds for his reconversion mrs thrale but may they not as well be forgotten johnson no madam a man loves to review his own mind that is the use of a diary or journal lord trimblestown true sir as the ladies love to see themselves in a glass so a man likes to see himself in his journal boswell a very pretty allusion johnson yes indeed boswell and as a lady adjusts her dress before a mirror a man adjusts his character by looking at his journal i next year found the very same thought in atterburys sermon on lady cutts in this glass she every day dressed her mind this is a proof of coincidence and not of plagiarism for i had never read that sermon before  next morning while we were at breakfast johnson gave a very earnest recommendation of what he himself practiced with the utmost conscientiousness i mean a strict attention to truth even in the most minute particulars accustom your children said he constantly to this if a thing happened at one window and they when relating it say that it happened at another do not let it pass but instantly check them you do not know where deviation from truth will end boswell it may come to the door and when once an account is at all varied in one circumstance it may by degrees be varied so as to be totally different from what really happened our lively hostess whose fancy was impatient of the rein fidgeted at this and ventured to say nay this is too much if mr johnson should forbid me to drink tea i would comply as i should feel the restraint only twice a day but little variations in narrative must happen a thousand times a day if one is not perpetually watching johnson well madam and you ought to be perpetually watching it is more from carelessness about truth than from intentional lying that there is so much falsehood in the world  in his review of dr wartons essay on the writings and genius of pope johnson has given the following salutary caution upon this subject nothing but experience could evince the frequency of false information or unable any man to conceive that so many groundless reports should be propagated as every man of eminence may hear of himself some men relate what they think as what they know some men of confused memories and habitual inaccuracy ascribe to one man what belongs to another and some talk on without thought or care a few men are sufficient to broach falsehoods which are afterward innocently diffused by successive relaters literary magazine      p     had he lived to read what sir john hawkins and mrs piozzi have related concerning himself how much would he have found his observation illustrated he was indeed so much impressed with the prevalence of falsehood voluntary or unintentional that i never knew any person who upon hearing an extraordinary circumstance told discovered more of the incredulus odi he would say with a significant look and decisive tone it is not so do not tell this again he inculcated upon all his friends the importance of perpetual vigilance against the slightest degrees of falsehood the effect of which as sir joshua reynolds observed to me has been that all who were of his school are distinguished for a love of truth and accuracy which they would not have possessed in the same degree if they had not been known to johnson  talking of ghosts he said it is wonderful that five thousand years have now elapsed since the creation of the world and still it is undecided whether or not there has ever been an instance of the spirit of any person appearing after death all argument is against it but all belief is for it  he said john wesleys conversation is good but he is never at leisure he is always obliged to go at a certain hour this is very disagreeable to a man who loves to fold his legs and have out his talk as i do  on friday april   i dined with him in london in a company where were present several eminent men whom i shall not name but distinguish their parts in the conversation by different letters  f i have been looking at this famous antique marble dog of mr jennings valued at a thousand guineas said to be alcibiadess dog johnson his tail then must be docked that was the mark of alcibiadess dog e a thousand guineas the representation of no animal whatever is worth so much at this rate a dead dog would indeed be better than a living lion johnson sir it is not the worth of the thing but of the skill in forming it which is so highly estimated every thing that enlarges the sphere of human powers that shows man he can do what he thought he could not do is valuable the first man who balanced a straw upon his nose johnston who rode upon three horses at a time in short all such men deserved the applause of mankind not on account of the use of what they did but of the dexterity which they exhibited boswell yet a misapplication of time and assiduity is not to be encouraged addison in one of his spectators commends the judgment of a king who as a suitable reward to a man that by long perseverance had attained to the art of throwing a barleycorn through the eye of a needle gave him a bushel of barley johnson he has been a king of scotland where barley is scarce f one of the most remarkable antique figures of an animal is the boar at florence johnson the first boar that is well made in marble should be preserved as a wonder when men arrive at a facility of making boars well then the workmanship is not of such value but they should however be preserved as examples and as a greater security for the restoration of the art should it be lost  e we hear prodigious complaints at present of emigration i am convinced that emigration makes a country more populous j that sounds very much like a paradox e exportation of men like exportation of all other commodities makes more be produced johnson but there would be more people were there not emigration provided there were food for more e no leave a few breeders and you will have more people than if there were no emigration johnson nay sir it is plain there will be more people if there are more breeders thirty cows in good pasture will produce more calves than ten cows provided they have good bulls e there are bulls enough in ireland johnson smiling so sir i should think from your argument boswell you said exportation of men like exportation of other commodities makes more be produced but a bounty is given to encourage the exportation of corn and no bounty is given for the exportation of men though indeed those who go gain by it r but the bounty on the exportation of corn is paid at home e that is the same thing johnson no sir r a man who stays at home gains nothing by his neighbors emigrating boswell i can understand that emigration may be the cause that more people may be produced in a country but the country will not therefore be from that the more populous for the people issue from it it can only be said that there is a flow of people it is an encouragement to have children to know that they can get a living by emigration r yes if there were an emigration of children under six years of age but they dont emigrate till they could earn their livelihood in some way at home c it is remarkable that the most unhealthy countries where there are the most destructive diseases such as egypt and bengal are the most populous johnson countries which are the most populous have the most destructive diseases that is the true state of the proposition c holland is very unhealthy yet it is exceedingly populous johnson i know not that holland is unhealthy but its populousness is owing to an influx of people from all other countries disease cannot be the cause of populousness for it not only carries off a great proportion of the people but those who are left are weakened and unfit for the purposes of increase  r mr e i dont mean to flatter but when posterity reads one of your speeches in parliament it will be difficult to believe that you took so much pains knowing with certainty that it could produce no effect that not one vote would be gained by it e waving your compliment to me i shall say in general that it is very well worth while for a man to take pains to speak well in parliament a man who has vanity speaks to display his talents and if a man speaks well he gradually establishes a certain reputation and consequence in the general opinion which sooner or later will have its political reward besides though not one vote is gained a good speech has its effect though an act which has been ably opposed passes into a law yet in its progress it is modelled it is softened in such a manner that we see plainly the minister has been told that the members attached to him are so sensible of its injustice or absurdity from what they have heard that it must be altered johnson and sir there is a gratification of pride though we cannot outvote them we will outargue them they shall not do wrong without its being shown both to themselves and to the world e the house of commons is a mixed body i except the minority which i hold to be pure smiling but i take the whole house it is a mass by no means pure but neither is it wholly corrupt though there is a large proportion of corruption in it there are many members who generally go with the minister who will not go all lengths there are many honest wellmeaning country gentlemen who are in parliament only to keep up the consequence of their families upon most of these a good speech will have influence johnson we are all more or less governed by interest but interest will not make us do every thing in a case which admits of doubt we try to think on the side which is for our interest and generally bring ourselves to act accordingly but the subject must admit of diversity of coloring it must receive a color on that side in the house of commons there are members enough who will not vote what is grossly unjust or absurd no sir there must always be right enough or appearance of right to keep wrong in countenance boswell there is surely always a majority in parliament who have places or who want to have them and who therefore will be generally ready to support government without requiring any pretext e true sir that majority will always follow quo clamor vocat et turba faventium boswell well now let us take the common phrase placehunters i thought they had hunted without regard to any thing just as their huntsman the minister leads looking only to the prey lord bolingbroke who however detestable as a metaphysician must be allowed to have had admirable talents as a political writer thus deseribes the house of commons in his letter to sir william windham  you know the nature of that assembly they grow like hounds fond of the man who shows them game and by whose halloo they are used to be encouraged  j but taking your metaphor you know that in hunting there are few so desperately keen as to follow without reserve some do not choose to leap ditches and hedges and risk their necks or gallop over steeps or even to dirty themselves in bogs and mire boswell i am glad there are some good quiet moderate political hunters e i believe in any body of men in england i should have been in the minority i have always been in the minority p the house of commons resembles a private company how seldom is any man convinced by anothers argument passion and pride rise against it r what would be the consequence if a minister sure of a majority in the house of commons should resolve that there should be no speaking at all upon his side e he must soon go out that has been tried but it was found it would not do  e the irish language is not primitive it is teutonick a mixture of the northern tongues it has much english in it johnson it may have been radically teutonick but english and high dutch have no similarity to the eye though radically the same once when looking into low dutch i found in a whole page only one word similar to english stroem like stream and it signified tide e i remember having seen a dutch sonnet in which i found this word roesnopies nobody would at first think that this could be english but when we enquire we find roes rose and nopie knob so we have rosebuds  johnson i have been reading thicknesss travels which i think are entertaining boswell what sir a good book johnson yes sir to read once i do not say you are to make a study of it and digest it and i believe it to be a true book in his intention all travelers generally mean to tell truth though thickness observes upon smollets account of his alarming a whole town in france by firing a blunderbuss and frightening a french nobleman till he made him tie on his portmanteau that he would be loath to say smollet had told two lies in one page but he had found the only town in france where these things could have happened travelers must often be mistaken in every thing except where mensuration can be applied they may honestly differ there has been of late a strange turn in travelers to be displeased  e from the experience which i have had  and i have had a great deal  i have learnt to think better of mankind johnson from my experience i have found them worse in commercial dealings more disposed to cheat than i had any notion of but more disposed to do one another good than i had conceived j less just and more beneficent johnson and really it is wonderful considering how much attention is necessary for men to take care of themselves and ward off immediate evils which press upon them it is wonderful how much they do for others as it is said of the greatest liar that he tells more truth than falsehood so it may be said of the worst man that he does more good than evil boswell perhaps from experience men may be found happier than we suppose johnson no sir the more we enquire we shall find men the less happy p as to thinking better or worse of mankind from experience some cunning people will not be satisfied unless they have put men to the test as they think there is a very good story told of sir godfrey kneller in his character of a justice of the peace a gentleman brought his servant before him upon an accusation of having stolen some money from him but it having come out that he had laid it purposely in the servants way in order to try his honesty sir godfrey sent the master to prison johnson to resist temptation once is not a sufficient proof of honesty if a servant indeed were to resist the continued temptation of silver lying in a window as some people let it lie when he is sure his master does not know how much there is of it he would give a strong proof of honesty but this is a proof to which you have no right to put a man you know humanly speaking there is a certain degree of temptation which will overcome any virtue now in so far as you approach temptation to a man you do him an injury and if he is overcome you share his guilt p and when once overcome it is easier for him to be got the better of again boswell yes you are his seducer you have debauched him i have known a man resolve to put friendship to the test by asking a friend to lend him money merely with that view when he did not want it johnson that is very wrong sir your friend may be a narrow man and yet have many good qualities narrowness may be his only fault now you are trying his general character as a friend by one particular singly in which he happens to be defective when in truth his character is composed of many particulars  e i understand the hogshead of claret which this society was favored with by our friend the dean is nearly out i think he should be written to to send another of the same kind let the request be made with a happy ambiguity of expression so that we may have the chance of his sending it also as a present johnson i am willing to offer my services as secretary on this occasion p as many as are for dr johnson being secretary hold up your hands  carried unanimously boswell he will be our dictator johnson no the company is to dictate to me i am only to write for wine and i am quite disinterested as i drink none i shall not be suspected of having forged the application i am no more than humble scribe e then you shall prescribe boswell very well the first play of words today j no no the bulls in ireland johnson were i your dictator you should have no wine it would be my business cavere ne quid detrimenti respublica caperet and wine is dangerous rome was ruined by luxury smiling e if you allow no wine as dictator you shall not have me for your master of horse  on saturday april   i drank tea with johnson at dr taylors where he had dined he entertained us with an account of a tragedy witten by a dr kennedy not the lisbon physician the catastrophe of it said he was that a king who was jealous of his queen with his primeminister castrated himself this tragedy was actually shown about in manuscript to several people and amongst others to mr fitzherbert who repeated to me two lines of the prologue our heros fate we have but gently touched the fair might blame us if it were less couched it is hardly to be believed what absurd and indecent images men will introduce into their writings without being sensible of the absurdity and indecency i remember lord orrery told me that there was a pamphlet written against sir robert walpole the whole of which was an allegory on the phallick obscenity the duchess of buckingham asked lord orrery who this person was he answered he did not know she said she would send to mr pulteney who she supposed could inform her so then to prevent her from making herself ridiculous lord orrery sent her grace a note in which he gave her to understand what was meant  he was very silent this evening and read in a variety of books suddenly throwing down one and taking up another  he talked of going to streatham that night tailor you will be robbed if you do or you must shoot a highwayman now i would rather be robbed than do that i would not shoot a highwayman johnson but i would rather shoot him in the instant when he is attempting to rob me than afterward swear against him at the oldbailey to take away his life after he has robbed me i am surer i am right in the one case than in the other i may be mistaken as to the man when i swear i cannot be mistaken if i shoot him in the act besides we feel less reluctance to take away a mans life when we are heated by the injury than to do it at a distance of time by an oath after we have cooled boswell so sir you would rather act from the motive of private passion than that of public advantage johnson nay sir when i shoot the highwayman i act from both boswell very well very well  there is no catching him johnson at the same time one does not know what to say for perhaps one may a year after hang himself from uneasiness for having shot a man the late duke of montrose was generally said to have been uneasy on that account but i can contradict the report from his graces own authority as he used to admit me to very easy conversation with him i took the liberty to introduce the subject his grace told me that when riding one night near london he was attacked by two highwaymen on horseback and that he instantly shot one of them upon which the other galloped off that his servant who was very well mounted proposed to pursue him and take him but that his grace said no we have had blood enough i hope the man may live to repent his grace upon my presuming to put the question assured me that his mind was not all clouded by what he had thus done in selfdefence  few minds are fit to be trusted with so great a thing boswell then sir you would not shoot him johnson but i might be vexed afterward for that too  thrales carriage not having come for him as he expected i accompanied him some part of the way home to his own house i told him that i had talked of him to mr dunning a few days before and had said that in his company we did not so much interchange conversation as listen to him and that dunning observed upon this one is always willing to listen to dr johnson to which i answered that is a great deal from you sir  yes sir said johnson a great deal indeed here is a man willing to listen to whom the world is listening all the rest of the year boswell i think sir it is right to tell one man of such a handsome thing which has been said of him by another it tends to increase benevolence johnson undoubtedly it is right sir  on tuesday april   i breakfasted with him at his house he said nobody was content i mentioned to him a respectable person in scotland whom he knew and i asserted that i really believed he was always content johnson no sir he is not content with the present he has always some new scheme some new plantation something which is future you know he was not content as a widower for he married again boswell but he is not restless johnson sir he is only locally at rest a chemist is locally at rest but his mind is hard at work this gentleman has done with external exertions it is too late for him to engage in distant projects boswell he seems to amuse himself quite well to have his attention fixed and his tranquillity preserved by very small matters i have tried this but it would not do with me johnson laughing no sir it must be born with a man to be contented to take up with little things women have a great advantage that they may take up with little things without disgracing themselves a man cannot except with fiddling had i learnt to fiddle i should have done nothing else boswell pray sir did you ever play on any musical instrument johnson no sir i once bought me a flagelet but i never made out a tune boswell a flagelet sir  so small an instrument when i told this to miss seward she smiled and repeated with admirable readiness from acis and galatea bring me a hundred reeds of ample growth to make a pipe for my capacious mouth   i should have liked to hear you play on the violincello that should have been your instrument johnson sir i might as well have played on the violincello as another but i should have done nothing else no sir a man would never undertake great things could he be amused with small i once tried knotting dempsters sister undertook to teach me but i could not learn it boswell so sir it will be related in pompous narrative once for his amusement he tried knotting nor did this hercules disdain the distaff once for his amusement he tried knotting johnson knitting of stockings is a good amusement as a freeman of aberdeen i should be a knitter of stockings  he asked me to go down with him and dine at mr thrales at streatham to which i agreed i had lent him an account of scotland in   0  written by a man of various enquiry an english chaplain to a regiment stationed there johnson it is sad stuff sir miserably written as books in general then were there is now an elegance of style universally diffused no man now writes so ill as martins account of the hebrides is written a man could not write so ill if he should try set a merchants clerk now to write and he will do better  he talked to me with serious concern of a certain female friends laxity of narration and inattention to truth  i am as much vexed said he at the ease with which she hears it mentioned to her as at the thing itself i told her madam you are contented to hear every day said to you what the highest of mankind have died for rather than bear  you know sir the highest of mankind have died rather than bear to be told they had uttered a falsehood do talk to her of it i am weary  boswell was not dr john campbell a very inaccurate man in his narrative sir he once told me that he drank thirteen bottles of port at a sitting johnson why sir i do not know that campbell ever lied with pen and ink but you could not entirely depend on any thing he told you in conversation if there was fact mixed with it however i loved campbell he was a solid orthodox man he had a reverence for religion though defective in practice he was religious in principle and he did nothing grossly wrong that i have heard  i told him that i had been present the day before when mrs montagu the literary lady sat to miss reynolds for her picture and that she said she had bound up mr gibbons history without the last two offensive chapters for that she thought the book so far good as it gave in an elegant manner the substance of the bad writers medii aevi which the late lord lyttelton advised her to read johnson sir she has not read them she shows none of this impetuosity to me she does not know greek and i fancy knows little latin she is willing you should think she knows them but she does not say she does boswell mr harris who was present agreed with her johnson harris was laughing at her sir harris is a sound sullen scholar he does not like interlopers harris however is a prig and a bad prig what my friend meant by these words concerning the amiable philosopher of salisbury i am at a loss to understand  i looked into his book and thought he did not understand his own system boswell he says plain things in a formal and abstract way to be sure but his method is good for to have clear notions upon any subject we must have recourse to analytick arrangement johnson sir it is what every body does whether they will or no but sometimes things may be made darker by definition i see a cow i define her animal quadrupes ruminans cornutum but a goat ruminates and a cow may have no horns cow is plainer boswell i think dr franklins definition of man a good one  a toolmaking animal johnson but many a man never made a tool and suppose a man without arms he could not make a tool  talking of drinking wine he said i did not leave off wine because i could not bear it i have drunk three bottles of port without being the worse for it university college has witnessed this boswell why then sir did you leave it off johnson why sir because it is so much better for a man to be sure that he is never to be intoxicated never to lose the power over himself i shall not begin to drink wine again till i grow old and want it boswell i think sir you once said to me that not to drink wine was a great deduction from life see p     of this volume johnson it is a diminution of pleasure to be sure but i do not say a diminution of happiness there is more happiness in being rational boswell but if we could have pleasure always should not we be happy the greatest part of men would compound for pleasure johnson supposing we could have pleasure always an intellectual man would not compound for it the greatest part of men would compound because the greatest part of men are gross boswell i allow there may be greater pleasure than from wine i have had more pleasure from your conversation i have indeed i assure you i have johnson when we talk of pleasure we mean sensual pleasure when a man says he had pleasure with a woman he does not mean conversation but something of a very different nature philosophers tell you that pleasure is contrary to happiness gross men prefer animal pleasure so there are men who have preferred living among savages now what a wretch must he be who is content with such conversation as can be had among savages you may remember an officer at fort augustus who had served in america told us of a woman whom they were obliged to bind in order to get her back from savage life boswell she must have been an animal a beast johnson sir she was a speaking cat  i mentioned to him that i had become very weary in a company where i heard not a single intellectual sentence except that a man who had been settled ten years in minorca was become a much inferior man to what he was in london because a mans mind grows narrow in a narrow place johnson a mans mind grows narrow in a narrow place whose mind is enlarged only because he has lived in a large place but what is got by books and thinking is preserved in a narrow place as well as well as in a large place a man cannot know modes of life as well in minorca as in london but he may study mathematics as well in minorca boswell i dont know sir if you had remained ten years in the isle of col you would not have been the man that you now are johnson yes sir if i had been there from fifteen to twentyfive but not if from twentyfive to thirtyfive boswell i own sir the spirits which i have in london make me do every thing with more readiness and vigor i can talk twice as much in london as any where else  of goldsmith he said he was not an agreeable companion for he talked always for fame a man who does so never can be pleasing the man who talks to unburthen his mind is the man to delight you an eminent friend of ours is not so agreeable as the variety of his knowledge would otherwise make him because he talks partly from ostentation  soon after our arrival at thrales i heard one of the maids calling eagerly on another to go to dr johnson i wondered what this could mean i afterward learnt that it was to give her a bible which he had brought from london as a present to her  he was for a considerable time occupied in reading memoires de fontenelle leaning and swinging upon the low gate into the court without his hat  i looked into lord kamess sketches of the history of man and mentioned to dr johnson his censure of charles the fifth for celebrating his funeral obsequies in his lifetime which i told him i had been used to think a solemn and affecting act johnson why sir a man may dispose his mind to think so of that act of charles but it is so liable to ridicule that if one man out of ten thousand laughs at it he will make the other nine thousand nine hundred and ninetynine laugh too i could not agree with him in this  sir john pringle had expressed a wish that i would ask dr johnsons opinion what were the best english sermons for style i took an opportunity today of mentioning several to him atterbury johnson yes sir one of the best boswell tillotson johnson why not now i should not advise a preacher at this day to imitate tillotsons style though i dont know i should be cautious of objecting to what has been applauded by so many suffrages  south is one of the best if you except his peculiarities and his violence and sometimes coarseness of language  seed has a very fine style but he is not very theological  jortins sermons are very elegant  sherlocks style too is very elegant though he has not made it his principal study  and you may add smallridge all the latter preachers have a good style indeed nobody now talks much of style every body composes pretty well there are no such unharmonious periods as there were a hundred years ago i should recommend dr clarkes sermons were he orthodox however it is very well known where he was not orthodox which was upon the doctrine of the trinity as to which he is a condemned heretic so one is aware of it boswell i like ogdens sermons on prayer very much both for neatness of style and subtilty of reasoning johnson i should like to read all that ogden has written boswell what i wish to know is what sermons afford the best specimen of english pulpit eloquence johnson we have no sermons addressed to the passions that are good for any thing if you mean that kind of eloquence a clergyman whose name i do not recollect were not dodds sermons addressed to the passions johnson they were nothing sir be they addressed to what they may  at dinner mrs thrale expressed a wish to go and see scotland johnson seeing scotland madam is only seeing a worse england it is seeing the flower gradually fade away to the naked stalk seeing the hebrides indeed is seeing quite a different scene  our poor friend mr thomas davies was soon to have a benefit at drurylane theater as some relief to his unfortunate circumstances we were all warmly interested for his success and had contributed to it however we thought there was no harm in having our joke when he could not be hurt by it i proposed that he should be brought on to speak a prologue upon the occasion and i began to mutter fragments of what it might be as that when now grown old he was obliged to cry poor toms acold  that he owned he had been driven from the stage by a churchill but that this was no disgrace for a churchill had beat the french  that he had been satyrised as mouthing a sentence as curs mouth a bone but he was now glad of a bone to pick  nay said johnson i would have him to say mad tom is come to see the world again   he and i returned to town in the evening upon the road i endeavored to maintain in argument that a landed gentleman is not under any obligation to reside upon his estate and that by living in london he does no injury to his country johnson why sir he does no injury to his country in general because the money which he draws from it gets back again in circulation but to his particular district his particular parish he does an injury all that he has to give away is not given to those who have the first claim to it and though i have said that the money circulates back it is a long time before that happens then sir a man of family and estate ought to consider himself as having the charge of a district over which he is to diffuse civility and happiness  next day i found him at home in the forenoon he praised delaneys observations on swift said that his book and lord orrerys might both be true though one viewed swift more and the other less favorably and that between both we might have a complete notion of swift  talking of a mans resolving to deny himself the use of wine from moral and religious considerations he said he must not doubt about it when one doubts as to pleasure we know what will be the conclusion i now no more think of drinking wine than a horse does the wine upon the table is no more for me than for the dog that is under the table  on thursday april   i dined with him at sir joshua reynoldss with the bishop of st asaph dr shipley mr allan ramsay mr gibbon mr cambridge and mr langton mr ramsay had lately returned from italy and entertained us with his observations upon horaces villa which he had examined with great care i relished this much as it brought fresh into my mind what i had viewed with great pleasure thirteen years before the bishop dr johnson and mr cambridge joined with mr ramsay in recollecting the various lines in horace relating to the subject  horaces journey to brundusium being mentioned johnson observed that the brook which he describes is to be seen now exactly as at that time and that he had often wondered how it happened that small brooks such as this kept the same situation for ages notwithstanding earthquakes by which even mountains have been changed and agriculture which produces such a variation upon the surface of the earth cambridge a spanish writer has this thought in a poetical conceit after observing that most of the solid structures of rome are totally perished while the tiber remains the same he adds lo que era firm huio i solamente lo fugitivo permanece i dura johnson sir that is taken from janus vitalis   immota labesunt et quae perpetuo sunt agitata manent   the bishop said it appeared from horaces writings that he was a cheerful contented man johnson we have no reason to believe that my lord are we to think pope was happy because he says so in his writings we see in his writings what he wished the state of his mind to appear dr young who pined for preferment talks with contempt of it in his writings and affects to despise every thing that he did not despise bishop of st asaph he was like other chaplains looking for vacancies but that is not peculiar to the clergy i remember when i was with the army after the battle of lafeldt the officers seriously grumbled that no general was killed cambridge we may believe horace more when he says romae tibur amem ventosus tibure romam boswell how hard is it that man can never be at rest ramsay it is not in his nature to be at rest when he is at rest he is in the worst state that he can be in for he has nothing to agitate him he is then like the man in the irish song there was an old fellow at ballanacrazy who wanted a wife for to make him unaisy goldsmith being mentioned johnson observed that it was long before his merit came to be acknowledged that he once complained to him in ludicrous terms of distress whenever i write any thing the public make a point to know nothing about it but that his traveller brought him into high reputation langton there is not one bad line in that poem not one of drydens careless verses sir joshua i was glad to hear charles fox say it was one of the finest poems in the english language langton why was you glad you surely had no doubt of this before johnson no the merit of the traveller is so well established that mr foxs praise cannot augment it nor his censure diminish it sir joshua but his friends may suspect they had a too great partiality for him johnson nay sir the partiality of his friends was all against him it was with difficulty we could give him a hearing goldsmith had no settled notions upon any subject so he talked always at random it seemed to be his intention to blurt out whatever was in his mind and see what would become of it he was angry too when catched in an absurdity but it did not prevent him from falling into another the next minute i remember chamier after talking with him for some time said well i do believe he wrote this poem himself and let me tell you that is believing a great deal chamier once asked him what he meant by slow the last word in the first line of the traveller remote unfriended melancholy slow did he mean tardiness of locomotion goldsmith who would say something without consideration answered yes i was sitting by and said no sir you do not mean tardiness of locomotion you mean that sluggishness of mind which comes upon a man in solitude chamier believed then that i had written the line as much as if he had seen me write it goldsmith however was a man who whatever he wrote did it better than any other man could do he deserved a place in westminsterabbey and every year he lived would have deserved it better he had indeed been at no pains to fill his mind with knowledge he transplanted it from one place to another and it did not settle in his mind so he could not tell what was in his own books  we talked of living in the country johnson no wise man will go to live in the country unless he has something to do which can be better done in the country for instance if he is to shut himself up for a year to study a science it is better to look out to the fields than to an opposite wall then if a man walks out in the country there is nobody to keep him from walking in again but if a man walks out in london he is not sure when he shall walk in again a great city is to be sure the school for studying life and the proper study of mankind is man as pope observes boswell i fancy london is the best place in the world for society though i have heard that the very first society of paris is still beyond any thing that we have here johnson sir i question if in paris such a company as is sitting round this table could be got together in less than half a year they talk in france of the felicity of men and women living together the truth is that there the men are not higher than the women they know no more than women do and they are not held down in their conversation by the presence of women ramsay literature is upon the growth it is in its spring in france here it is rather passee johnson literature was in france long before we had it paris was the second city for the revival of letters italy had it first to be sure what have we done for literature equal to what was done by the stephani and others in france our literature came to us through france caxton printed only two books chaucer and gower that were not translations from the french and chaucer we know took much from the italians no sir if literature be in its spring in france it is a second spring it is after a winter we are now before the french in literature but we had it long after them in england any man who wears a sword and a powdered wig is ashamed to be illiterate i believe it is not so in france yet there is probably a great deal of learning in france because they have such a number of religious establishments so many men who have nothing else to do but to study i do not know this but i take it upon the common principles of chance where there are many shooters some will hit  we talked of old age johnson now in his seventieth year said it is a mans own fault it is from want of use if his mind grows torpid in old age the bishop asked if an old man does not lose faster than he gets johnson i think not my lord if he exerts himself one of the company rashly observed that he thought it was happy for an old man that insensibility comes upon him johnson with a noble elevation and disdain no sir i should never be happy by being less rational bishop of st asaph your wish then sir is  johnson yes my lord  his lordship mentioned a charitable establishment in wales where people were maintained and supplied with every thing upon the condition of their contributing the weekly produce of their labor and he said they grew quite torpid for want of property johnson they have no object for hope their condition cannot be better it is rowing without a port  one of the company asked him the meaning of the expression in juvenal unius lacertae johnson i think it clear enough as much ground as one may have a chance to find a lizard upon  commentators have differed as to the exact meaning of the expression by which the poet intended to ensorce the sentiment contained in the passage where these words occur it is enough that they mean to denote even a very small possession provided it be a mans own  est aliquid quocunque loco quocunque recessu unius sese dominum fecisse lacertae this season there was a whimsical fashion in the newspapers of applying shakspeares words to describe living people well known in the world which was done under the title of modern characters from shakspeare many of which were admirably adapted the fancy took so much that they were afterward collected into a pamphlet somebody said to johnson across the table that he had not been in those characters yes said he i have i should have been sorry to be left out he then repeated what had been applied to him i must borrow garagantuas mouth miss reynolds not perceiving at once the meaning of this he was obliged to explain it to her which had something of an awkward and ludicrous effect why madam it has a reference to me as using big words which require the mouth of a giant to pronounce them garagantua is the name of a giant in rabelais boswell but sir there is another amongst them for you he would not flatter neptune for his trident or jove for his power to thunder johnson there is nothing marked in that no sir garagantua is the best notwithstanding this ease and good humor when i a little while afterward repeated his farcasm on kenrick see p     of vol i  which was received with applause he asked  who said that and on my suddenly answering garagantua he looked serious which was a sufficient indication that he did not wish it to be kept up  when we went to the drawing room there was a rich assemblage besides the company who had been at dinner there were mr garrick mr harris of salisbury dr percy dr burney honorable mrs cholmondeley miss hannah more etc etc  after wandering about in a kind of pleasing distraction for some time i got into a corner with johnson garrick and harris garrick to harris pray sir have you read potters aeschylus harris yes and think it pretty garrick to johnson and what think you sir of it johnson i thought what i read of it verbiage but upon mr harriss recommendation i will read a play to mr harris dont prescribe two mr harris suggested one i do not remember which johnson we must try its effect as an english poem that is the way to judge of the merit of a translation translations are in general for people who cannot read the original i mentioned the vulgar saying that popes homer was not a good representation of the original johnson sir it is the greatest work of the kind that has ever been produced boswell the truth is it is impossible perfectly to translate poetry in a different language it may be the same tune but it has not the same tone homer plays it on a bassoon pope on a flagelet harris i think heroic poetry is best in blank verse yet it appears that rhyme is essential to english poetry from our deficiency in metrical quantities in my opinion the chief excellence of our language is numerous prose johnson sir william temple was the first writer who gave cadence to english prose before his time they were careless of arrangement and did not mind whether a sentence ended with an important word or an insignificant word or with what part of speech it was concluded mr langton who now had joined us commended clarendon johnson he is objected to for his parentheses his involved clauses and his want of harmony but he is supported by his matter it is indeed owing to a plethory of matter that his style is so faulty every substance smiling to mr harris has so many accidents  to be distinct we must talk analytically if we analyze language we must speak of it grammatically if we analyze argument we must speak of it logically garrick of all the translations that ever were attempted i think elphinstons martial the most extraordinary he consulted me upon it who am a little of an epigrammatist myself you know i told him freely you dont seem to have that turn i asked him if he was serious and finding he was i advised him against publishing why his translation is more difficult to understand than the original i thought him a man of some talents but he seems crazy in this johnson sir you have done what i had not courage to do but he did not ask my advice and i did not force it upon him to make him angry with me garrick but as a friend sir   johnson why such a friend as i am with him  no garrick but if you see a friend going to tumble over a precipice johnson that is an extravagant case sir you are sure a friend will thank you for hindering him from tumbling over a precipice but in the other case i should hurt his vanity and do him no good he would not take my advice his brotherinlaw strahan sent him a subscription of fifty pounds and said he would send him fifty more if he would not publish garrick what eh is strahan a good judge of an epigram is not he rather an obtuse man eh johnson why sir he may not be a judge of an epigram but you see he is a judge of what is not an epigram boswell it is easy for you mr garrick to talk to an author as you talked to elphinston you who have been so long the manager of a theater rejecting the plays of poor authors you are an old judge who have often pronounced sentence of death you are a practiced surgeon who have often amputated limbs and though this may have been for the good of your patients they cannot like you those who have undergone a dreadful operation are not very fond of seeing the operator again garrick yes i know enough of that there was a reverend gentleman mr hawkins who wrote a tragedy the siege of something which i refused harris so the siege was raised johnson aye he came to me and complained and told me that garrick said his play was wrong in the concoction now what is the concoction of a play here garrick started and twisted himself and seemed sorely vexed for johnson told me he believed the story was true garrick i  i  i  said first concoction johnson smiling well he left out first and rich he said refused him in false english he could show it under his hand garrick he wrote to me in violent wrath for having refused his play sir this is growing a very serious and terrible affair i am resolved to publish my play i will appeal to the world and how will your judgment appear i answered sir notwithstanding all the seriousness and all the terrors i have no objection to your publishing your play and as you live at a great distance devonshire i believe if you will send me it i will convey it to the press i never heard more of it ha ha ha  on friday april  0 i found johnson at home in the forenoon we resumed the conversation of yesterday he put me in mind of some of it which had escaped my memory and enabled me to record it more perfectly than i otherwise could have done he was much pleased with my paying so great attention to his recommendation in      the beginning of our acquaintance to keep a journal and i could perceive he was secretly pleased to find so much of the fruit of his mind preserved and as he had been used to imagine and say that he always labored when he said a good thing  it delighted him on a review to find that his conversation teemed with point and imagery  i said to him you were yesterday sir in remarkably good humor but there was nothing to offend you nothing to produce irritation or violence there was no bold offender there was not one capital conviction it was a maiden assize you had on your white gloves  he found fault with our friend langton for having been too silent sir said i you will recollect that he very properly took up sir joshua for being glad that charles fox had praised goldsmiths traveller and you joined him johnson yes sir i knocked fox on the head without ceremony reynolds is too much under fox and burke at present he is under the fox star and the irish constellation he is always under some planet boswell there is no fox star johnson but there is a dog star boswell they say indeed a fox and a dog are the same animal  i reminded him of a gentleman who mrs cholmondeley said was first talkative from affectation and then silent from the same cause that he first thought i shall be celebrated as the liveliest man in every company and then all at once o it is much more respectable to be grave and look wise he has reversed the pythagorean discipline by being first talkative and then silent he reverses the course of nature too he was first the gay butterfly and then the creeping worm johnson laughed loud and long at this expansion and illustration of what he himself had told me  we dined together with mr scott now sir william scott his majestys advocate at his chambers in the temple nobody else there the company being small johnson was not in such spirits as he had been yesterday and for a considerable time little was said at last he burst forth subordination is sadly broken down in this age no man now has the same authority which his father had  except a jailer no master has it over his servants it is diminished in our colleges nay in our grammarschools boswell what is the cause of this sir johnson why the coming in of the scotch laughing sarcastically boswell that is to say things have been turned topsy turvey  but your serious cause johnson why sir there are many causes the chief of which is i think the great increase of money no man now depends upon the lord of a manor when he can send to another country and fetch provisions the shoeblack at the entry of my court does not depend on me i can deprive him but of a penny a day which he hopes somebody else will bring him and that penny i  carry to another shoeblack so the trade suffers nothing i have explained in my journey to the hebrides how gold and silver destroy sedual subordination but besides there is a general relaxation of reverence no son now depends upon his father as in former times paternity used to be considered as of itself a great thing which had a right to many claims that is in general reduced to very small bounds my hope is that as anarchy produces tyranny this extreme relaxation will produce freni strictio  talking of fame for which there is so great a desire i observed how little there is of it in reality compared with the other objects of human attention let every man recollect and he will be sensible how small a part of his time is employed in talking or thinking of shakspeare voltaire or any of the most celebrated men that have ever lived or are now supposed to occupy the attention and admiration of the world let this be extracted and compressed into what a narrow space will it go i then slily introduced mr garricks fame and his assuming the airs of a great man johnson sir it is wonderful how little garrick assumes no sir garrick fortunam reverenter habet consider sir celebrated men such as you have mentioned have had their applause at a distance but garrick had it dashed in his face founded in his ears and went home every night with the plaudits of a thousand in his cranium then sir garrick did not find but made his way to the tables the levees and almost the bedchambers of the great then sir garrick had under him a numerous body of people who from fear of his power and hopes of his favor and admiration of his talents were constantly submissive to him and here is a man who has advanced the dignity of his profession garrick has made a player a higher character scott and he is a very sprightly writer too johnson yes sir and all this supported by great wealth of his own acquisition if all this had happened to me i should have had a couple of fellows with long poles walking before me to knock down every body that stood in the way consider if all this had happened to cibber or quin they would have jumped over the moon  yet garrick speaks to us smiling boswell and garrick is a very good man a charitable man johnson sir a liberal man he has given away more money than any man in england there may be a little vanity mixed but he has shown that money is not his first object boswell yet foot used to say of him that he walked out with an intention to do a generous action but turning the corner of a street he met with the ghost of a halfpenny which frightened him johnson why sir that is very true too for i never knew a man of whom it could be said with less certainty today what he will do tomorrow than garrick it depends so much on his humor at the time scott i am glad to hear of his liberality he has been represented as very saving johnson with his domestic saving we have nothing to do i remember drinking tea with him long ago when peg woffington made it and he grumbled at her for making it too strong when johnson told this little anecdote to sir joshua reynolds he mentioned a cirumstance which he omitted today  why said garrick it is as red as blood  he had then begun to feel money in his purse and did not know when he should have enough of it  on the subject of wealth the proper use of it and the effects of that art which is called economy he observed it is wonderful to think how men of very large estates not only spend their yearly income but are often actually in want of money it is clear they have not value for what they spend lord shelburne told me that a man of high rank who looks into his own affairs may have all that he ought to have all that can be of any use or appear with any advantage for five thousand pounds a year therefore a great proportion must go in waste and indeed this is the case with most people whatever their fortune is boswell i have no doubt sir of this but how is it what is waste johnson why sir breaking bottles and a thousand other things waste cannot be accurately told though we are sensible how destructive it is economy on the one hand by which a certain income is made to maintain a man genteelly and waste on the other by which on the same income another man lives shabbily cannot be defined it is a very nice thing as one man wears his coat out much sooner than another we cannot tell how  we talked of war johnson every man thinks meanly of himself for not having been a soldier or not having been at sea boswell lord mansfield does not johnson sir if lord mansfield were in a company of general officers and admirals who have been in service he would shrink he would wish to creep under the table boswell no he would think he could try them all johnson yes if he could catch them but they would try him much sooner no sir were socrates and charles the twelfth of sweden both present in any company and socrates to say follow me and hear a lecture in philosophy and charles laying his hand on his sword to say follow me and dethrone the czar a man would be ashamed to follow socrates sir the impression is universal yet it is strange as to the sailor when you look down from the quarter deck to the spae below you see the utmost extremity of human misery such crouding such filth such stench boswell yet sailors are happy johnson they are happy as brutes are happy with a piece of fresh meat with the grossest sensuality but sir the profession of soldiers and sailors has the dignity of danger mankind reverence those who have got over fear which is so general a weakness scott but is not courage mechanical and to be acquired johnson why yes sir in a collective sense soldiers consider themselves only as parts of a great machine scott we find people fond of being sailors johnson i cannot account for that any more than i can account for other strange perversions of imagination  his abhorrence of the profession of a sailor was uniformly violent but in conversation he always exalted the profession of a soldier and yet i have in my large and various collection of his writings a letter to an eminent friend in which he expresses himself thus my godson called on me lately he is weary and rationally weary of a military life if you can place him in some other state i think you may increase his happiness and secure his virtue a soldiers time is passed in distress and danger or in idleness and corruption such was his cool reflection in his study but whenever he was warmed and animated by the presence of company he like other philosophers whose minds are impregnated with poetical fancy caught the common enthusiasm for splendid renown  he talked of mr charles fox of whose abilities he thought highly but observed that he did not talk much at our club i have heard mr gibbon remark that mr fox could not be afraid of dr johnson yet he certainly was very shy of saying any thing in dr johnsons presence mr scott now quoted what was said of alcibiades by a greek poet to which johnson assented  he told us that he had given mrs montagu a catalogue of all daniel defoes works of imagination most if not all of which as well as of his other works he now enumerated allowing a considerable share of merit to a man who bred a silversmith had written so variously and so well indeed his robinson crusoe is enough of itself to establish his reputation  he expressed great indignation at the imposture of the cocklane ghost and related with much satisfaction how he had assisted in detecting the cheat and had published an account of it in the newspapers upon this subject i incautiously offended him by pressing him with too many questions and he showed his displeasure i apologized saying that i asked questions in order to be instructed and entertained i repaired eagerly to the fountain but that the moment he gave me a hint the moment he put a lock upon the well i desisted  but sir said he that is forcing one to do a disagreeable thing and he continued to rate me nay sir said i when you have put a lock upon the well so that i can no longer drink do not make the fountain of your wit play upon me and wet me  he sometimes could not bear being teazed with questions i was once present when a gentleman asked so many as what did you do sir what did you say sir that he at last grew enraged and said i will not be put to the question dont you consider sir that these are not the manners of a gentleman i will not be baited with what and why what is this what is that why is a cows tail long why is a foxs tail bushy the gentleman who was a good deal out of countenance said why sir you are so good that i venture to trouble you johnson sir my being so good is no reason why you should be so ill  talking of the justitia hulk at woolwich in which criminals were punished by being confined to labor he said i do not see that they are punished by this they must have worked equally had they never been guilty of stealing they now only work so after all they have gained what they stole is clear gain to them the confinement is nothing every man who works is confined the smith to his shop the tailor to his garret boswell and lord mansfield to his court johnson yes sir you know the notion of confinement may be extended as in the song every island is a prison there is in dodsleys collection a copy of verses to the author of that song  smiths latin verses on pococke the great traveller were mentioned he repeated some of them and said they were smiths best verses  he talked with an uncommon animation of traveling into distant countries that the mind was enlarged by it and that an acquisition of dignity of character was derived from it he expressed a particular enthusiasm with respect to visiting the wall of china i catched it for the moment and said i really believed i should go and see the wall of china had i not children of whom it was my duty to take care sir said he by doing so you would do what would be of importance in raising your children to eminence there would be a luster reflected upon them from your spirit and curiosity they would be at all times regarded as the children of a man who had gone to view the wall of china i am serious sir  when we had left mr scotts he said will you go home with me sir said i it is late but i will go with you for three minutes johnson or four we went to mrs williamss room where we found mr allen the printer who was the landlord of his house in boltcourt a worthy obliging man and his very old acquaintance and what was exceedingly amusing though he was of a very diminutive size he used even in johnsons presence to imitate the stately periods and slow and solemn utterance of the great man i this evening boasted that although i did not write what is called stenography or shorthand in appropriated characters devised for the purpose i had a method of my own of writing half words and leaving out some altogether so as yet to keep the substance and language of any discourse which i heard so much in view that i could give it very completely soon after taking it down he defied me as he had once defied an actual shorthand writer and he made the experiment by reading slowly and distinctly a part of robertsons history of america while i endeavored to write it in my way of taking notes it was found that i had it very imperfectly the conclusion from which was that its excellence was principally owing to a studied arrangement of words which could not be varied or abridged without an essential injury  on sunday april    i found him at home before dinner dr dodds poem entitled thoughts in prison was lying upon his table this appearing to me an extraordinary effort by a man who was in newgate for a capital crime i was desirous to hear johnsons opinion of it to my surprise he told me he had not read a line of it i took up the book and read a passage to him johnson pretty well if you are previously disposed to like them i read another passage with which he was better pleased he then took the book into his own hands and having looked at the prayer at the end of it he said what evidence is there that this was composed the night before he suffered i do not believe it he then read aloud where he prays for the king etc and observed sir do you think that a man the night before he is to be hanged cares for the succession of a royal family though he may have composed this prayer then a man who has been canting all his life may cant to the last and yet a man who has been refused a pardon after so much petitioning would hardly be praying thus servently for the king  he and i and mrs williams went to dine with the reverend dr percy talking of goldsmith johnson said he was very envious i defended him by observing that he owned it frankly upon all occasions johnson sir you are enforcing the charge he had so much envy that he could not conceal it he was so full of it that he overflowed he talked of it to be sure often enough now sir what a man avows he is not ashamed to think though many a man thinks what he is ashamed to avow we are all envious naturally but by checking envy we get the better of it so we are all thieves naturally a child always tries to get at what it wants the nearest way by good instruction and good habits this is cured till a man has not even an inclination to seize what is anothers has no struggle with himself about it  and here i shall record a scene of too much heat between dr johnson and dr percy which i should have suppressed were it not that it gave occasion to display the truly tender and benevolent heart of johnson who as soon as he found a friend was at all hurt by any thing which he had said in his wrath was not only prompt and desirous to be reconciled but exerted himself to make ample reparation  books of travels having been mentioned johnson praised pennant very highly as he did at dunvegan in the isle of sky journal of a tour to the hebrides edit   p      dr percy still holding himself as the heir male of the ancient percies and having the warmest and most dutiful attachment to the noble house of northumberland could not sit quietly and hear a man praised who had spoken disrespectfully of alnwickcastle and the dukes pleasuregrounds especially as he thought meanly of his travels he therefore opposed johnson eagerly johnson pennant in what he has said of alnwick has done what he intended he has made you very angry percy he has said the garden is trim which is representing it like a citizens parterre when the truth is there is a very large extent of fine turf and gravel walks johnson according to your own account sir pennant is right it is trim here is grass cut close and gravel rolled smooth is not that trim the extent is nothing against that a mile may be as trim as a square yard your extent puts me in mind of the citizens enlarged dinner two pieces of roastbeef and two puddings there is no variety no mind exerted in laying out the ground no trees percy he pretends to give the natural history of northumberland and yet takes no notice of the immense number of trees planted there of late johnson that sir has nothing to do with the natural history that is civil history a man who gives the natural history of the oak is not to tell how many oaks have been planted in this place or that a man who gives the natural history of the cow is not to tell how many cows are milked at islington the animal is the same whether milked in the park or at islington percy pennant does not describe well a carrier who goes along the side of lochlomond would describe it better johnson i think he describes very well percy i traveled after him johnson and i traveled after him percy but my good friend you are shortsighted and do not see so well as i do i wondered at dr percys venturing thus dr johnson said nothing at the time but inflammable particles were collecting for a cloud to burst in a little while dr percy said something more in disparagement of pennant johnson pointedly this is the resentment of a narrow mind because he did not find every thing in northumberland percy feeling the stroke sir you may be as rude as you please johnson hold sir dont talk of rudeness remember sir you told me puffing hard with passion struggling for a vent i was shortsighted we have done with civility we are to be as rude as we please percy upon my honor sir i did not mean to be uncivil johnson i cannot say so sir for i did mean to be uncivil thinking you had been uncivil dr percy rose ran up to him and taking him by the hand assured him affectionately that his meaning had been misunderstood upon which a reconciliation instantly took place johnson my dear sir i am willing you shall hang pennant percy resuming the former subject pennant complains that the helmet is not hung out to invite to the hall of hospitality now i never heard that it was a custom to hand out a helmet johnson hang him up hang him up boswell humouring the joke hang out his skull instead of a helmet and you may drink ale out of it in your hall of odin as he is your enemy that will be truly ancient there will be northern antiquities johnson he is a whig sir a sad dog smiling at his own violent expressions merely for political difference of opinion but he is the best traveller i ever read he observes more things than any one else does  i could not help thinking that this was too high praise of a writer who traversed a wide extent of country in such haste that he could put together only curt frittered fragments of his own and afterward procured supplemental intelligence from parochial ministers and others not the best qualified or most impartial narrators whose ungenerous prejudice against the house of stuart glares in misrepresentation a writer who at best treats merely of superficial objects and shows no philosophical investigation of character and manners such as johnson has exhibited in his masterly journey over part of the same ground and who it should seem from a desire of ingratiating himself with the scotch has flattered the people of northbritain so inordinately and with so little discrimination that the judicious and candid amongst them must be disgusted while they value more the plain just yet kindly report of johnson  we had a calm after the storm staid the evening and supt and were pleasant and gay but dr percy told me he was very uneasy at what had passed for there was a gentleman there who had recently been admitted into the confidence of the northumberland family to whom he hoped to appear more respectable by showing him how intimate he was with the great dr johnson and now the gentleman would go away with an impression much to his disadvantage as if johnson treated him with disregard which might do him an essential injury he begged i would mention this to dr johnson which i afterward did his observation upon it was this comes of stratagem had he tole me that he wished to appear to advantage before that gentleman he should have been at the top of the house all the time he spoke of dr percy in the handsomest terms then sir said i may i be allowed to suggest a mode by which you may effectually counteract any unfavourable report of what passed i will write a letter to you upon the subject of the unlucky contest of that day and you will be kind enough to put in writing as an answer to that letter what you have now said and in short all that you can say to dr percys advantage and as lord percy is to dine with us at general paolis soon i will take an opportunity to read the correspondence in his lordships presence this friendly scheme was accordingly carried into execution without dr percys knowledge johnsons letter was studiously framed to place dr percys unquestionable merit in the fairest point of view and i contrived that lord percy should hear the correspondence by introducing it at general paolis as an instance of dr johnsons kind disposition toward one in whom his lordship was interested thus our friend percy was raised higher in the estimation of those by whom he wished most to be regarded i breakfasted the day after with him and informed him of my scheme and its happy completion for which he thanked me in the warmest terms and was highly delighted with dr johnsons letter in his praise of which i gave him a copy he said i would rather have this than degrees from all the universities in europe it will be for me and my children and grandchildren dr johnson having afterward asked me if i had given him a copy of it and being told i had was offended and insisted that i should get it back which i did as however he did not desire me to destroy either the original or the copy or forbid me to let it be seen i think myself at liberty to apply to it his general declaration to me concerning his other letters that he did not choose they should be published in his lifetime but had no objection to their appearing after his death i shall therefore insert this kindly correspondence having faithfully narrated the circumstances accompanying it  to dr samuel johnson my dear sir i beg leave to address you in behalf of our friend dr percy who was much hurt by what you said to him that day we dined at his house sunday april          when in the course of the dispute as to pennants merit as a traveller you told percy that he had the resentment of a narrow mind against pennant because he did not find every thing in northumberland percy is sensible that you did not mean to injure him but he is vexed to think that your behavior to him upon that occasion may be interpreted as a proof that he is despised by you which i know is not the case i have told him that the charge of being narrowminded was only as to the particular point in question and that he had the merit of being a martyr to his noble family  earl percy is to dine with general paoli next friday and i should be sincerely glad to have it in my power to satisfy his lordship how well you think of dr percy who i find apprehends that your good opinion of him may be of very essential consequence and who assures me that he has the highest respect and the warmest affection for you  i have only to add that my suggesting this occasion for the exercise of your candor and generosity is altogether unknown to dr percy and proceeds from my good will toward him and my persuasion that you will be happy to do him an essential kindness  i am more and more my dear sir your most faithful and affectionate humble servant james boswell   to james boswell esquire sir the debate between dr percy and me is one of those foolish controversies which begin upon a question of which neither party cares how it is decided and which is nevertheless continued to acrimony by the vanity with which every man resists confutation dr percys warmth proceeded from a cause which perhaps does him more honor than he could have derived from juster criticism his abhorrence of pennant proceeded from his opinion that pennant had wantonly and indecently censured his patron his anger made him resolve that for having been once wrong he never should be right pennant has much in his notions that i do not like but still i think him a very intelligent traveller if percy is really offended i am sorry for he is a man whom i never knew to offend any one he is a man very willing to learn and very able to teach a man out of whose company i never go without having learned something it is sure that he vexes me sometimes but i am afraid it is by making me feel my own ignorance so much extension of mind and so much minute accuracy of enquiry if you survey your whole circle of acquaintance you will find so scarce if you find it at all that you will value percy by comparison lord hailes is somewhat like him but lord hailes does not perhaps go beyond him in research and i do not know that he equals him in elegance percys attention to poetry has given grace and splendor to his studies of antiquity a mere antiquarian is a rugged being  upon the whole you see that what i might say in sport or petulance to him is very consistent with full conviction of his merit  i am dear sir your most etc sam johnson april          to the reverend dr percy northumberlandhouse dear sir i wrote to dr johnson on the subject of the pennantian controversy and have received from him an answer which will delight you i read it yesterday to dr robertson at the exhibition and at dinner to lord percy general oglethorpe etc who dined with us at general paolis who was also a witness to the high testimony to your honor  general paoli desires the favor of your company next tuesday to dinner to meet dr johnson if i can i will call on you today i am with sincere regard  your most obedient humble servant james boswell south audleystreet april     on monday april    i dined with johnson at mr langtons where were dr porteus then bishop of chester now of london and dr stinton he was at first in a very silent frame before dinner he said nothing but pretty baby to one of the children langton said very well to me afterward that he could repeat johnsons conversation before dinner as johnson had said that he could repeat a complete chapter of the natural history of iceland from the danish of horrebow the whole of which was exactly thus  chap lxxii concerning snakes there are no snakes to be met with throughout the whole island  at dinner we talked of another mode in the newspapers of giving modern characters in sentences from the classicks and of the passage  parcus dcorum cultor et infrequens insanientis dum sapientiae consultus erro nunc retrorsum vela dare atque iterare cursus cogor relictos being well applied to soame jennyns who after having wandered in the wilds of infidelity had returned to the christian faith mr langton asked johnson as to the propriety of sapientiae consultus johnson though consultus was primarily an adjective like amicus it came to be used as a substantive so we have jurisconsultus a consult in law  we talked of the styles of different painters and how certainly a connoisseur could distinguish them i asked if there was as clear a difference of styles in language as in painting or even as in handwriting so that the composition of every individual may be distinguished johnson yes those who have a style of eminent excellence such as dryden and milton can always be distinguished i had no doubt of this but what i wanted to know was whether there was really a peculiar style to every man whatever as there is certainly a peculiar handwriting a peculiar countenance not widely different in many yet always enough to be distinctive   facies non omnibus una nec diversa tamen  the bishop thought not and said he supposed that many pieces in dodsleys collection of poems though all very pretty had nothing appropriated in their style and in that particular could not be at all distinguished johnson why sir i think every man whatever has a peculiar style which may be discovered by nice examination and comparison with others but a man must write a great deal to make his style obviously discernable as logicians say this appropriation of style is infinite in potestate limited in actu  mr topham beauclerk came in the evening and he and dr johnson and i staid to supper it was mentioned that dr dodd had once wished to be a member of the literary club johnson i should be sorry if any of our club were hanged i will not say but some of them deserve it see note p  0  of this volume  beauclerk supposing this to be aimed at persons for whom he had at that time a wonderful fancy which however did not last long was irritated and eagerly said you sir have a friend naming him who deserves to be hanged for he speaks behind their backs against those with whom he lives on the best terms and attacks them in the newspapers he certainly ought to be kicked johnson sir we all do this in some degree veniam petimus damusque vicissim to be sure it may be done so much that a man may deserve to be kicked beauclerk he is very malignant johnson no sir he is not malignant he is mischievous if you will he would do no man an essential injury he may indeed love to make sport of people by vexing their vanity i however once knew an old gentleman who was absolutely malignant he really wished evil to others and rejoiced at it boswell the gentleman mr beauclerk against whom you are so violent is i know a man of good principles beauclerk then he does not wear them out in practice  dr johnson who as i have observed before delighted in discrimination of character and having a masterly knowledge of human nature was willing to take men as they are imperfect and with a mixture of good and bad qualities i suppose thought he had said enough in defense of his friend of whose merits notwithstanding his exceptionable points he had a just value and added no more on the subject  on tuesday april    i dined with him at general oglethorpes with general paoli and mr langton general oglethorpe declaimed against luxury johnson depend upon it sir every state of society is as luxurious as it can be men always take the best they can get oglethorpe but the best depends much upon ourselves and if we can be as well satisfied with plain things we are in the wrong to accustom our palates to what is highseasoned and expensive what says addison in his cato speaking of the numidian coarse are his meals the fortune of the chase amid the running stream he slakes his thirst toils all the day and at the approach of night on the first friendly bank he throws him down or rests his head upon a rock till morn and if the following day he chance to find a new repast or an untasted spring blesses his stars and thinks it luxury let us us have that kind of luxury sir if you will johnson but hold sir to be merely satisfied is not enough it is in refinement and elegance that the civilized man differs from the savage a great part of our industry and all our ingenuity is exercised in procuring pleasure and sir a hungry man has not the same pleasure in eating a plain dinner that a hungry man has in eating a luxurious dinner you see i put the case fairly a hungry man may have as much nay more pleasure in eating a plain dinner than a man grown fastidious has in eating a luxurious dinner but i suppose the man who decides between the two dinners to be equally a hungry man  talking of different governments johnson the more contracted that power is the more easily it is destroyed a country governed by a despot is an inverted cone government there cannot be so firm as when it rests upon a broad basis gradually contracted as the government of great britain which is founded on the parliament then is in the privy council then in the king boswell power when contracted into the person of a despot may be easily destroyed as the prince may be cut off so caligula wished that the people of rome had but one neck that he might cut them off at a blow oglethorpe it was of the senate he wished that the senate by its usurpation controuled both the emperor and the people and dont you think that we see too much of that in our own parliament  dr johnson endeavored to trace the etymology of maccaronick verses which he thought were of italian invention from maccaroni but on being informed that this would infer that they were the most common and easy verses maccaroni being the most ordinary and simple food he was at a loss for he said he rather should have supposed it to import in its primitive signification a composition of several things for maccaronick verses are verses made out of a mixture of different languages that is of one language with the termination of another i suppose there is almost no language in any country where there is any learning in which that motley ludicrous specious of composition may not be found it is particularly droll in low dutch the polemomiddinia of drummond of hawthornden in which there is a jumble of many languages molded as if it were all in latin is well known mr langton made us laugh heartily at one in the grecian mould by joshua barnes in which are to be found such comical angloellenisms as  they were banged with clubs  on wednesday april    i dined with dr johnson at mr dillys and was in high spirits for i had been a good part of the morning with mr orme the able and eloquent historian of hindostan who expressed a high admiration of johnson i do not care said he on what subject johnson talks but i love better to hear him talk than any body he either gives you new thoughts or a new coloring it is a shame to the nation that he has not been more liberally rewarded had i been george the third and thought as he did about america i would have given johnson three hundred a year for his taxation no tyranny alone i repeated this and johnson was much pleased with such praise from such a man as orme  at mr dillys today were mrs knowles the ingenious quaker lady dr johnson describing her needle work in one of his letters to mrs thrale vol i p     uses the learned word sutile which mrs thrale has mistaken and made the phrase injurious by writing  futile pictures  miss seward the poetess of lichfield the rev dr mayo and the rev mr beresford tutor to the duke of bedford before dinner dr johnson seized upon mr charles sheridans account of the late revolution in sweden and seemed to read it ravenously as if he devoured it which was to all appearance his method of studying he knows how to read better than any one said mrs knowles he gets at the substance of a book directly he tears out the heart of it he kept it wrapped up in the tablecloth in his lap during the time of dinner from an avidity to have one entertainment in readiness when he should have finished another resembling if i may use so coarse a simile a dog who holds a bone in his paws in reserve while he eats something else which has been thrown to him  the subject of cookery having been very naturally introduced at a table where johnson who boasted of the niceness of his palate owned that he always found a good dinner he said i could write a better book of cookery than has ever yet been written it should be a book upon philosophical principles pharmacy is now made much more simple cookery may be made so too a prescription which is now compounded of five ingredients had formerly fifty in it so in cookery if the nature of the ingredients be well known much fewer will do then as you cannot make bad meat good i would tell what is the best butchers meat the best beef the best pieces how to choose young fowls the proper season of different vegetables and then how to roast and boil and compound dilly mrs glasses cookery which is the best was written by dr hill half the trade know this johnson well sir this shows how much better the subject of cookery may be treated by a philosopher i doubt if the book be written by dr hill for in mrs glasses cookery which i have looked into saltpeter and salprunella are spoken of as different substances whereas salprunella is only saltpeter burnt on charcoal and hill could not be ignorant of this however as the greatest part of such a book is made by transcription this mistake may have been carelessly adopted but you shall see what a book of cookery i shall make i shall agree with mr dilly for the copyright miss seward that would be hercules with the distaff indeed johnson no madam women can spin very well but they cannot make a good book of cookery  johnson o mr dilly  you must know that an english benedictine monk at paris has translated the duke of berwicks memoirs from the original french and has sent them to me to sell i offered them to strahan who sent them back with this answer  that the first book he had published was the duke of berwicks life by which he had lost and he hated the name  now i honestly tell you that strahan has refused them but i also honestly tell you that he did it upon no principle for he never looked into them dilly are they well translated sir johnson why sir very well  in a style very current and very clear i have written to the benedictine to give me an answer upon two points  what evidence is there that the letters are authentic for if they are not authentic they are nothing  and how long will it be before the original french is published for if the french edition is not to appear for a considerable time the translation will be almost as valuable as an original book they will make two volumes in octavo and i have undertaken to correct every sheet as it comes from the press mr dilly desired to see them and said he would send for them he asked dr johnson if he would write a preface to them johnson no sir the benedictines were very kind to me and i will do what i undertook to do but i will not mingle my name with them i am to gain nothing by them i will turn them loose upon the world and let them take their chance dr mayo pray sir are ganganellis letters authentic johnson no sir voltaire put the same question to the editor of them that i did to macpherson  where are the originals  mrs knowles affected to complain that men had much more liberty allowed them than women johnson why madam women have all the liberty they should wish to have we have all the labor and the danger and the women all the advantage we go to sea we build houses we do every thing in short to pay our court to the women mrs knowles the doctor reasons very wittily but not convincingly now take the instance of building the masons wife if she is ever seen in liquor is ruined the mason may get himself drunk as often as he pleases with little loss of character nay may let his wife and children starve johnson madam you must consider if the mason does get himself drunk and let his wife and children starve the parish will oblige him to find security for their maintenance we have different modes of restraining evil stocks for the men a duckingstool for women and a pound for beasts if we require more perfection from women than from ourselves it is doing them honor and women have not the same temptations that we have they may always live in virtuous company men must mix in the world indiscriminately if a woman has no inclination to do what is wrong being secured from it is no restraint to her i am at liberty to walk into the thames but if i were to try it my friends would restrain me in bedlam and i should be obliged to them mrs knowles still doctor i cannot help thinking it a hardship that more indulgence is allowed to men than to women it gives a superiority to men to which i do not see how they are entitled johnson it is plain madam one or other must have the superiority as shakspeare says if two men ride on horseback one must ride behind dilly i suppose sir mrs knowles would have them to ride in panniers one on each side johnson then sir the horse would throw them both mrs knowles well i hope that in another world the sexes will be equal boswell that is being too ambitious madam we might as well desire to be equal with the angels we shall all i hope be happy in a future state but we must not expect to be all happy in the same degree it is enough if we be happy according to our several capacities a worthy carman will get to heaven as well as sir isaac newton yet though equally good they will not have the same degrees of happiness johnson probably not  upon this subject i had once before sounded him by mentioning the late reverend mr brown of utrechts image that a great and small glass though equally full did not hold an equal quantity which he threw out to refute david humes saying that a little miss going to dance at a ball in a fine new dress was as happy as a great orator after having made an eloquent and applauded speech after some thought johnson said i come over to the parson as an instance of coincidence of thinking mr dilly told me that dr king a late dissenting minister in london said to him upon the happiness in a future state of good men of different capacities a pail does not hold so much as a tub but if it be equally full it has no reason to complain every saint in heaven will have as much happiness as he can hold mr dilly thought this a clear though a familiar illustration of the phrase one star differs from another in brightness  dr mayo having asked johnsons opinion of soame jennynss view of the internal evidence of the christian religion  johnson i think it a pretty book not very theological indeed and there seems to be an affectation of ease and carelessness as if it were not suitable to his character to be very serious about the matter boswell he may have intended this to introduce his book the better among genteel people who might be unwilling to read too grave a treatise there is a general levity in the age we have physicians now with bagwigs may we not have airy divines at least somewhat less solemn in their appearance than they used to be johnson jennyns might mean as you say boswell  you should like his book mrs knowles as it maintains as you friends do that courage is not a christian virtue mrs knowles yes indeed i like him there but i cannot agree with him that friendship is not a christian virtue johnson why madam strictly speaking he is right all friendship is preferring the interest of a friend to the neglect or perhaps against the interest of others so that an old greek said he that has friends has no friend now christianity recommends universal benevolence to consider all men as our brethren which is contrary to the virtue of friendship as described by the ancient philosophers surely madam your sect must approve of this for you call all men friends mrs knowles we are commanded to do good to all men but especially to them who are of the household of faith johnson well madam the household of faith is wide enough mrs knowles but doctor our savior had twelve apostles yet there was one whom he loved john was called the disciple whom jesus loved johnson with eyes sparkling benignantly very well indeed madam you have said very well boswell a fine application pray sir had you ever thought of it johnson i had not sir  from this amiable and pleasing subject he i know not how or why made a sudden transition to one upon which he was a violent aggressor for he said i am willing to love all mankind except an american and his inflammable corruption bursting into horrid fire he breathed out threatenings and slaughter calling them rascals  robbers  pirates and exclaiming he would burn and destroy them miss seward looking to him with mild but steady astonishment said sir this is an instance that we are always most violent against those whom we have injured  he was irritated still more by this delicate and keen reproach and roared out another tremendous volley which one might fancy could be heard across the atlantic during this tempest i sat in great uneasiness lamenting his heat of temper till by degrees i diverted his attention to other topics  dr mayo to dr johnson pray sir have you read edwards of new england on grace johnson no sir boswell it puzzled me so much as to the freedom of the human will by stating with wonderful acute ingenuity our being actuated by a series of motives which we cannot resist that the only relief i had was to forget it mayo but he makes the proper distinction between moral and physical necessity boswell alas sir they come both to the same thing you may be bound as hard by chains when covered by leather as when the iron appears the argument for the moral necessity of human actions is always i observe fortified by supposing universal prescience to be one of the attributes of the deity johnson you are surer that you are free than you are of prescience you are surer that you can lift up your finger or not as you please than you are of any conclusion from a deduction of reasoning but let us consider a little the objection from prescience it is certain i am either to go home tonight or not that does not prevent my freedom boswell that it is certain you are either to go home or not does not prevent your freedom because the liberty of choice between the two is compatible with that certainty but if one of these events be certain now you have no future power of volition if it be certain you are to go home tonight you must go home johnson if i am well acquainted with a man i can judge with great probability how he will act in any case without his being restrained by my judging god may have this probability increased to certainty boswell when it is increased to certainty freedom ceases because that cannot be certainly soreknown which is not certain at the time but if it be certain at the time it is a contradiction in terms to maintain that there can be afterward any contingency dependent upon the exercise of will or any thing else johnson all theory is against the freedom of the will all experience for it  i did not push the subject any farther i was glad to find him so mild in discussing a question of the most abstract nature which is involved with theological tenets which he generally would not suffer to be in any degree opposed if any of my readers are disturbed by this thorny question i beg leave to recommend to them letter    of montesquieus lettres persannes and the late mr john palmer of slingtons answer to dr priestleys mechanical arguments for what he calls philosophical necessity   he as usual defended luxury you cannot spend money in luxury without doing good to the poor nay you do more good to them by spending it in luxury than by giving it for by spending it in luxury you make them exert industry whereas by giving it you keep them idle i own indeed there may be more virtue in giving it immediately in charity than in spending it in luxury though there may be a pride in that too miss seward asked if this was not mandevilles doctrine of private vices public benefits johnson the fallacy of that book is that mandeville defines neither vices nor benefits he reckons among vices every thing that gives pleasure he takes the narrowest system of morality monastic morality which holds pleasure itself to be a vice such as eating salt with our fish because it makes it taste better and he reckons wealth as a public benefit which is by no means always true pleasure of itself is not a vice having a garden which we all know to be perfectly innocent is a great pleasure at the same time in this state of being there are many pleasures vices which however are so immediately agreeable that we can hardly abstain from them the happiness of heaven will be that pleasure and virtue will be perfectly consistent mandeville puts the case of a man who gets drunk at an alehouse and says it is a public benefit because so much money is got by it to the public but it must be considered that all the good gained by this through the gradation of alehousekeeper brewer maltster and farmer is overbalanced by the evil caused to the man and his family by his getting drunk this is the way to try what is vicious by ascertaining whether more evil than good is produced by it upon the whole which is the case in all vice it may happen that good is produced by vice but not as vice for instance a robber may take money from its owner and give it to one who will make a better use of it here is good produced but not by the robbery as robbery but as translation of property i read mandeville forty or i believe fifty years ago he did not puzzle me he opened my views into real life very much no it is clear that the happiness of society depends on virtue in sparta theft was allowed by general consent theft therefore was there not a crime but then there was no security and what a life must they have had when there was no security without truth there must be a dissolution of society as it is there is so little truth that we are almost afraid to trust our ears but how should we be if falsehood were multiplied ten times society is held together by communication and information and i remember this remark of sir thomas browns do the devils lie no for then hell could not subsist  talking of miss  a literary lady he said i was obliged to speak to miss reynolds to let her know that i desired she would not flatter me so much somebody now observed she flatters garrick johnson she is in the right to flatter garrick she is in the right for two reasons first because she has the world with her who have been praising garrick these thirty years and secondly because she is rewarded for it by garrick why should she flatter me i can do nothing for her let her carry her praise to a better market then turning to mrs knowles you madam have been flattering me all the evening i wish you would give boswell a little now if you knew his merit as well as i do you would say a great deal he is the best traveling companion in the world  somebody mentioned the reverend mr masons prosecution of mr murray the bookseller for having inserted in a collection of grays poems only fifty lines of which mr mason had still the exclusive property under the statute of queen anne and that mr mason had persevered notwithstanding his being requested to name is own terms of compensation see a letter to w mason a m from j murray bookseller in london  d edition p     johnson signified his displeasure at mr masons conduct very strongly but added by way of showing that he was not surprised at it masons a whig mrs knowles not hearing distinctly what a prig sir johnson worse madam a whig but he is both  i expressed a horror at the thought of death mrs knowles nay thou should not have a horror for what is the gate of life johnson standing upon the hearth rolling about with a serious solemn and somewhat gloomy air no rational man can die without uneasy apprehension mrs knowles the scriptures tell us the righteous shall have hope in his death johnson yes madam that is he shall not have despair but consider his hope of salvation must be founded on the terms on which it is promised that the mediation of our savior shall be applied to us namely obedience and where obedience has failed then as suppletory to it repentance but what man can say that his obedience has been such as he would approve of in another or even in himself upon close examination or that his repentance has not been such as to require being repented of no man can be sure that his obedience and repentance will obtain salvation mrs knowles but divine intimation of acceptance may be made to the soul johnson madam it may but i should not think the better of a man who should tell me on his deathbed he was sure of salvation a man cannot be sure himself that he has divine intimation of acceptance much less can he make others sure that he has it boswell then sir we must be contented to acknowledge that death is a terrible thing johnson yes sir i have made no approaches to a state which can look on it as not terrible mrs knowles seeming to enjoy a pleasing serenity in the persuasion of benignant divine light does not st paul say i have fought the good fight of faith i have finished my course henceforth is laid up for me a crown of life johnson yes madam but here was a man inspired a man who had been converted by supernatural interposition boswell in prospect death is dreadful but in fact we find that people die easy johnson why sir most people have not thought much of the matter so cannot say much and it is supposed they die easy few believe it certain they are then to die and those who do set themselves to behave with resolution as a man does who is going to be hanged he is not the less unwilling to be hanged miss seward there is one mode of the fear of death which is certainly absurd and that is the dread of annihilation which is only a pleasing sleep without a dream johnson it is neither pleasing nor sleep it is nothing now mere existence is so much better than nothing that one would rather exist even in pain than not exist boswell if annihilation be nothing then existing in pain is not a comparative state but is a positive evil which i cannot think we should choose i must be allowed to differ here and it would lessen the hope of a future state founded on the argument that the supreme being who is good as he is great will hereafter compensate for our present sufferings in this life for if existence such as we have it here be comparatively a good we have no reason to complain though no more of it should be given to us but if our only state of existence were in this world then we might with some reason complain that we are so dissatisfied with our enjoyments compared with our desires johnson the lady confounds annihilation which is nothing with the apprehension of it which is dreadful it is in the apprehension of it that the horror of annihilation consists  of john wesley he said he can talk well on any subject boswell pray sir what has he made of his story of a ghost johnson why sir he believes it but not on sufficient authority he did not take time enough to examine the girl it was at newcastle where the ghost was said to have appeared to a young woman several times mentioning something about the right to an old house advising application to be made to an attorney which was done and at the same time saying the attorney would do nothing which proved to be the fact this says john is a proof that a ghost knows our thoughts now laughing it is not necessary to know our thoughts to tell that an attorney will sometimes do nothing charles wesley who is a more stationary man does not believe the story i am sorry that john did not take more pains to inquire into the evidence for it miss seward with an incredulous smile what sir about a ghost johnson with solemn vehemence yes madam this is a question which after five thousand years is yet undecided a question whether in theology or philosophy one of the most important that can come before the human understanding  mrs knowles mentioned as a proselyte to quakerism miss  a young lady well known to dr johnson for whom he had shown much affection while she ever had and still retained a great respect for him mrs knowles at the same time took an opportunity of letting him know that the amiable young creature was sorry at finding that he was offended at her leaving the church of england and embracing a simpler faith and in the gentlest and most persuasive manner solicited his kind indulgence for what was sincerely a matter of conscience johnson frowning very angrily madam she is an odious wench she could not have any proper conviction that it was her duty to change her religion which is the most important of all subjects and should be studied with all care and with all the helps we can get she knew no more of the church which she left and that which she embraced than she did of the difference between the copernican and ptolemaick systems mrs knowles she had the new testament before her johnson madam she could not understand the new testament the most difficult book in the world for which the study of a life is required mrs knowles it is clear as to essentials johnson but not as to controversial points the heathens were easily converted because they had nothing to give up but we ought not without very strong conviction indeed to desert the religion in which we have been educated that is the religion given you the religion in which it may be said providence has placed you if you live conscientiously in that religion you may be safe but error is dangerous indeed if you err when you choose a religion for yourself mrs knowles must we then go by implicit faith johnson why madam the greatest part of our knowledge is implicit faith and as to religion have we heard all that a disciple of confucius all that a mohammedan can say for himself he then rose again into passion and attacked the young proselyte in the severest terms of reproach so that both the ladies seemed to be much shocked  we remained together till it was pretty late notwithstanding occasional explosions of violence we were all delighted upon the whole with johnson i compared him at this time to a warm westindian climate where you have a bright sun quick vegetation luxuriant foliage luscious fruits but where the same heat sometimes produces thunder lightening and earthquakes in a terrible degree  april    being good friday i waited on johnson as usual i observed at breakfast that although it was a part of his abstemious discipline on this most solemn fast to take no milk in his tea yet when mrs desmoulins inadvertently poured it in he did not reject it i talked of the strange indecision of mind and imbecility in the common occurrences of life which we may observe in some people johnson why sir i am in the habit of getting others to do things for me boswell what sir have you that weakness johnson yes sir but i always think afterward i should have done better for myself  i told him that at a gentlemans house where there was thought to be such extravagance or bad management that he was living much beyond his income his lady had objected to the cutting of a pickled mango and that i had taken an opportunity to ask the price of it and found it was only two shillings so here was a very poor saving johnson sir that is the blundering economy of a narrow understanding it is stopping one hole in a sieve  i expressed some inclination to publish an account of my travels upon the continent of europe for which i had a variety of materials collected johnson i do not say sir you may not publish your travels but i give you my opinion that you would lessen yourself by it what can you tell of countries so well known as those upon the continent of europe which you have visited boswell but i can give an entertaining narrative with many incidents anecdotes jeux desprit and remarks so as to make very pleasant reading johnson why sir most modern travelers in europe who have published their travels have been laughed at i would not have you added to the number i believe however i shall follow my own opinion for the world has shown a very flattering partiality to my writings on many occasions  the world is now not contented to be merely entertained by a travellers narrative they want to learn something now some of my friends asked me why i did not give some account of my travels in france the reason is plain intelligent readers had seen more of france than i had you might have liked my travels in france and the club might have liked them but upon the whole there would have been more ridicule than good produced by them boswell i cannot agree with you sir people would like to read what you say of any thing suppose a face has been painted by fifty painters before still we love to see it done by sir joshua johnson true sir but sir joshua cannot paint a face when he has not time to look on it boswell sir a sketch of any sort by him is valuable and sir to talk to you in your own style raising my voice and shaking my head you should have given us your travels in france i am sure i am right and there is an end on it  i said to him that it was certainly true as my friend dempster had observed in his letter to me upon the subject that a great part of what was in his journey to the western islands of scotland had been in his mind before he left london johnson why yes sir the topics were and books of travels will be good in proportion to what a man has previously in his mind his knowing what to observe his power of contrasting one mode of life with another as the spanish proverb says he who would bring home the wealth of the indies must carry the wealth of the indies with him so it is in traveling a man must carry knowledge with him if he would bring home knowledge boswell the proverb i suppose sir means he must carry a large stock with him to trade with johnson yes sir  it was a delightful day as we walked to st clements church i again remarked that fleet street was the most cheerful scene in the world fleet street said i is in my mind more delightful than tempe johnson aye sir but let it be compared with mull  there was a very numerous congregation today at st clements church which dr johnson said he observed with pleasure  and now i am to give a pretty full account of one of the most curious incidents in johnsons life of which he himself has made the following minute on this day in my return from church i was accosted by edwards an old fellowcollegian who had not seen me since      he knew me and asked if i remembered one edwards i did not at first recollect the name but gradually as we walked along recovered it and told him a conversation that had passed at an alehouse between us my purpose is to continue our acquaintance prayers and meditations p      it was in butcherrow that this meeting happened mr edwards who was a decentlooking elderly man in gray clothes and a wig of many curls accosted johnson with familiar confidence knowing who he was while johnson returned his salutation with a courteous formality as to a stranger but as soon as edwards had brought to his recollection their having been at pembrokecollege together nineandthirty years ago he seemed much pleased asked where he lived and said he should be glad to see him in boltcourt edwards ah sir we are old men now johnson who never liked to think of being old dont let us discourage one another edwards why doctor you look stout and hearty i am happy to see you so for the newspapers told us you were very ill johnson aye sir they are always telling lies of us old fellows  wishing to be present at more of so singular a conversation as that between two fellow collegians who had lived near forty years in london without ever having chanced to meet i whispered to mr edwards that dr johnson was going home and that he had better accompany him now so edwards walked along with us i eagerly assisting to keep up the conversation mr edwards informed dr johnson that he had practiced long as a solicitor in chancery but that he now lived in the country upon a little farm about sixty acres just by stevenage in hertfordshire and that he came to london to barnards inn no   generally twice a week johnson appearing to be in a reverie mr edwards addressed himself to me and expatiated on the pleasure of living in the country boswell i have no notion of this sir what you have to entertain you is i think exhausted in half an hour edwards what dont you love to have hope realised i see my grass and my corn and my trees growing now for instance i am curious to see if this frost has not nipped my fruit trees johnson who we did not imagine was attending you find sir you have fears as well as hopes  so well did he see the whole when another saw but the half of a subject  when we got to dr johnsons house and were seated in his library the dialogue went on admirably edwards sir i remember you would not let us say prodigious at college for even then sir turning to me he was delicate in language and we all feared him johnson said to me afterward sir they respected me for my literature and yet it was not great but by comparison sir it is amazing how little literature there is in the world  johnson to edwards from your having practiced the law long sir i presume you must be rich edwards no sir i got a good deal of money but i had a number of poor relations to whom i gave a great part of it johnson sir you have been rich in the most valuable sense of the word edwards but i shall not die rich johnson nay sure sir it is better to live rich than to die rich edwards i wish i had continued at college johnson why do you wish that sir edwards because i think i should have had a much easier life than mine has been i should have been a parson and had a good living like bloxam and several others and lived comfortably johnson sir the life of a parson of a conscientious clergyman is not easy i have always considered a clergyman as the father of a larger family than he is able to maintain i would rather have chancery suits upon my hands than the cure of souls no sir i do not envy a clergymans life as an easy life nor do i envy the clergyman who makes it an easy life  here taking himself up all of a sudden he exclaimed o mr edwards i will convince you that i recollect you do you remember our drinking together at an alehouse near pembroke gate at that time you told me of the eton boy who when verses on our saviors turning water into wine were prescribed as an exercise brought up a single line which was highly admired vidit et erubuit lympha pudica deum and i told you of another fine line in camdens remains an eulogy upon one of our kings who was succeeded by his son a prince of equal merit mira cano sol occubuit nox nulla secuta est   edwards you are a philosopher dr johnson i have tried too in my time to be a philosopher but i dont know how cheerfulness was always breaking in  mr burke sir joshua reynolds mr courtenay mr malone and indeed all the eminent men to whom i have mentioned this have thought it an exquisite trait of character the truth is that philosophy like religion is too generally supposed to be hard and severe at least so grave as to exclude all gaiety  edwards i have been twice married doctor you i suppose have never known what it was to have a wife johnson sir i have known what it was to have a wife and in a solemn tender faultering tone i have known what it was to lose a wife  it had almost broke my heart  edwards how do you live sir for my part i must have my regular meals and a glass of good wine i find i require it johnson i now drink no wine sir early in life i drank wine for many years i drank none i then for some years drank a great deal edwards some hogsheads i warrant you johnson i then had a severe illness and left it off and i have never begun it again i never felt any difference upon myself from eating one thing rather than another nor from one kind of weather rather than another there are people i believe who feel a difference but i am not one of them and as to regular meals i have fasted from the sundays dinner to the tuesdays dinner without any inconvenience i believe it is best to eat just as one is hungry but a man who is in business or a man who has a family must have stated meals i am a straggler i may leave this town and go to grand cairo without being missed here or observed there edwards dont you eat supper sir johnson no sir edwards for my part now i consider supper as a turnpike through which one must pass in order to get to bed i am not absolutely sure but this was my own suggestion though it is truly in the character of edwards   johnson you are a lawyer mr edwards lawyers know life practically a bookish man should always have them to converse with they have what he wants edwards i am grown old i am sixtyfive johnson i shall be sixtyeight next birthday come sir drink water and put in for a hundred  mr edwards mentioned a gentleman who had left his whole fortune to pembroke college johnson whether to leave ones whole fortune to a college be right must depend upon circumstances i would leave the interest of the fortune i bequeathed to a college to my relations or my friends for their lives it is the same thing to a college which is a permanent society whether it gets the money now or twenty years hence and i would wish to make my relations or friends feel the benefit of it  this interview confirmed my opinion of johnsons most humane and benevolent heart his cordial and placid behavior to an old fellowcollegian a man so different from himself and his telling him that he would go down to his farm and visit him showed a kindliness of disposition very rare at an advanced age he observed how wonderful it was that they had both been in london almost forty years without having ever once met and both walkers in the street too mr edwards when going away again recurred to his consciousness of senility and looking full in johnsons face said to him you will find in dr young o my coevals remnants of yourselves johnson did not relish this at all but shook his head with impatience edwards walked off seemingly highly pleased with the honor of having been thus noticed by dr johnson when he was gone i said to johnson that i thought him but a weak man johnson why yes sir here is a man who has passed through life without experience yet i would rather have him with me than a more sensible man who will not talk readily this man is always willing to say what he has to say yet dr johnson had himself by no means that willingness which he praised so much and i think so justly for who has not felt the painful effect of the dreary void when there is a total silence in a company for any length of time or which is as bad or perhaps worse when the conversation is with difficulty kept up by a perpetual effort  johnson once observed to me tom tyers described me the best sir said he you are like a ghost you never speak till you are spoken to  the gentleman whom he thus familiarly mentioned was mr thomas tyers son of mr jonathan tyers the founder of that excellent place of public amusement vauxhall gardens which must ever be an estate to its proprietor as it is peculiarly adapted to the taste of the english nation there being a mixture of curious show  gay exhibition  music vocal and instrumental not too refined for the general ear  for all which only a shilling is paid  and though last not least good eating and drinking for those who choose to purchase that regale mr thomas tyers was bred to the law but having a handsome fortune vivacity of temper and eccentricity of mind he could not confine himself to the regularity of practice he therefore ran about the world with a pleasant carelessness amusing every body by his desultory conversation he abounded in anecdote but was not sufficiently attentive to accuracy i therefore cannot venture to avail myself much of a biographical sketch of johnson which he published being one among the various persons ambitious of appending their names to that of my illustrious friend that sketch is however an entertaining little collection of fragments those which he published of pope and addison are of higher merit but his fame must chiefly rest upon his political conferences in which he introduces several eminent persons delivering their sentiments in the way of dialogue and discovers a considerable share of learning various knowledge and discernment of character this much may i be allowed to say of a man who was exceedingly obliging to me and who lived with dr johnson in as easy a manner as almost any of his very numerous acquaintance  mr edwards had said to me aside that dr johnson should have been of a profession i repeated the remark to johnson that i might have his own thoughts on the subject johnson sir it would have been better that i had been of a profession i ought to have been a lawyer boswell i do not think sir it would have been better for we should not have had the english dictionary johnson but you would have had reports boswell aye but there would not have been another who could have written the dictionary there have been many very good judges suppose you had been lord chancellor you would have delivered opinions with more extent of mind and in a more ornamented manner than perhaps any chancellor ever did or ever will do but i believe causes have been as judiciously decided as you could have done johnson yes sir property has been as well settled  johnson however had a noble ambition floating in his mind and had undoubtedly often speculated on the possibility of his supereminent powers being rewarded in this great and liberal country by the highest honors of the state sir william scott informs me that upon the death of the late lord lichfield who was chancellor of the university of oxford he said to johnson what a pity it is sir that you did not follow the profession of the law you might have been lord chancellor of great britain and attained to the dignity of the peerage and now that the title of lichfield your native city is extinct you might have had it johnson upon this seemed much agitated and in an angry tone exclaimed why will you vex me by suggesting this when it is too late  but he did not repine at the prosperity of others the late dr thomas leland told mr courtenay that when mr edmund burke showed johnson his fine house and lands near beaconsfield johnson coolly said non equidem invideo miror magis  yet no man had a higher notion of the dignity of literature than johnson or was more determined in maintaining the respect which he justly considered as due to it of this besides the general tenor of his conduct in society some characteristical instances may be mentioned  he told sir joshua reynolds that once when he dined in a numerous company of booksellers where the room being small the head of the table at which he sat was almost close to the fire he persevered in suffering a great deal of inconvenience from the heat rather than quit his place and let one of them sit above him  goldsmith in his diverting simplicity complained one day in a mixed company of lord camden i met him said he at lord clares house in the country and he took no more notice of me than if i had been an ordinary man the company having laughed heartily johnson stood forth in defense of his friend nay gentlemen said he dr goldsmith is in the right a nobleman ought to have made up to such a man as goldsmith and i think it is much against lord camden that he neglected him  nor could he patiently endure to hear that such respect as he thought due only to higher intellectual qualities should be bestowed on men of slighter though perhaps more amusing talents i told him that one morning when i went to breakfast with garrick who was very vain of his intimacy with lord camden he accosted me thus  pray now did you  did you meet a little lawyer turning the corner eh  no sir said i pray what do you mean by the question  why replied garrick with an affected indifference yet as if standing on tiptoe lord camden has this moment left me we have had a long walk together johnson well sir garrick talked very properly lord camden was a little lawyer to be associating so familiarly with a player  sir joshua reynolds has observed with great truth that johnson considered garrick to be as it were his property he would allow no man either to blame or to praise garrick in his presence without contradicting him  having fallen into a very serious frame in which mutual expressions of kindness passed between us such as would be thought too vain in me to repeat i talked with regret of the sad inevitable certainty that one of us must survive the other johnson yes sir that is an affecting consideration i remember swift in one of his letters to pope says i intend to come over that we may meet once more and when we must part it is what happens to all human beings boswell the hope that we shall see our departed friends again must support the mind johnson why yes sir boswell there is a strange unwillingness to part with life independent of serious fears as to futurity a reverend friend of ours naming him tells me that he feels an uneasiness at the thoughts of leaving his house his study his books johnson this is foolish in  a man need not be uneasy on these grounds for as he will retain his consciousness he may say with the philosopher omnia mea mecum porto boswell true sir we may carry our books in our head but still there is something painful in the thought of leaving for ever what has given us pleasure i remember many years ago when my imagination was warm and i happened to be in a melancholy mood it distressed me to think of going into a state of being in which shakspeares poetry did not exist a lady whom i then much admired a very amiable woman humoured my fancy and relieved me by saying the first thing you will meet in the other world will be an elegant copy of shakspeares works presented to you dr johnson smiled benignantly at this and did not appear to disapprove of the notion  we went to st clements church again in the afternoon and then returned and drank tea and coffee in mrs williamss room mrs desmoulins doing the honors of the teatable i observed that he would not even look at a proofsheet of his life of waller on good friday  mr allen the printer brought a book on agriculture which was printed and was soon to be published it was a very strange performance the author having mixed in it his own thoughts upon various topics along with his remarks on ploughing sowing and other farming operations he seemed to be an absurd profane fellow and had introduced in his book many sneers at religion with equal ignorance and conceit dr johnson permitted me to read some passages aloud one was that he resolved to work on sunday and did work but he owned he felt some weak compunction and he had this very curious reflection  i was born in the wilds of christianity and the briars and thorns still hang about me dr johnson could not help laughing at this ridiculous image yet was very angry at the fellows impiety however said he the reviewers will make him hang himself he however observed that formerly there might have been a dispensation obtained for working on sunday in the time of harvest indeed in ritual observances were all the ministers of religion what they should be and what many of them are such a power might be wisely and safely lodged with the church  on saturday april    i drank tea with him he praised the late mr duncombe of canterbury as a pleasing man he used to come to me i did not seek much after him indeed i never sought much after any body boswell lord orrery i suppose johnson no sir i never went to him but when he sent for me boswell richardson johnson yes sir but i sought after george psalmanazar the most i used to go and sit with him at an alehouse in the city  i am happy to mention another instance which i discovered of his seeking after a man of merit soon after the honorable daines barrington had published his excellent observations on the statutes johnson waited on that worthy and learned gentleman and having told him his name courteously said i have read your book sir with great pleasure and wish to be better known to you thus began an acquaintance which was continued with mutual regard as long as johnson lived  talking of a recent seditious delinquent he said they should set him in the pillory that he may be punished in a way that would disgrace him i observed that the pillory does not always disgrace and i mentioned an instance of a gentleman who i thought was not dishonored by it johnson aye but he was sir he could not mouth and strut as he used to do after having been there people are not very willing to ask a man to their tables who has stood in the pillory  the gentleman who had dined with us at dr percys see p     of this volume came in johnson attacked the americans with intemperate vehemence of abuse i said something in their favor and added that i was always sorry when he talked on that subject this it seems exasperated him though he said nothing at the time the cloud was charged with sulphurous vapor which was afterward to burst in thunder  we talked of a gentleman who was running out his fortune in london and i said we must get him out of it all his friends must quarrel with him and that will soon drive him away johnson nay sir well send you to him if your company does not drive a man out of his house nothing will this was a horrible shock for which there was no visible cause i afterward asked him why he had said so harsh a thing johnson because sir you had made me angry about the americans boswell but why did not you take your revenge directly johnson smiling because sir i had nothing ready a man cannot strike till he has his weapons this was a candid and pleasant confession  he showed me tonight his drawing room very genteelly fitted up and said mrs thrale sneered when i talked of my having asked you and your lady to live at my house i was obliged to tell her that you would be in as respectable a situation in my house as in hers sir the insolence of wealth will creep out boswell she has a little both of the insolence of wealth and the conceit of parts johnson the insolence of wealth is a wretched thing but the conceit of parts has some foundation to be sure it should not be but who is without it boswell yourself sir johnson why i play no tricks i lay no traps boswell no sir you are six feet high and you only do not stoop  we talked of the numbers of people that sometimes have composed the household of great families i mentioned that there were a hundred in the family of the present earl of eglintounes father dr johnson seeming to doubt it i began to enumerate let us see my lord and my lady two johnson nay sir if you are to count by twos you may be long enough boswell well but now i add two sons and seven daughters and a servant for each that will make twenty so we have the fifth part already johnson very true you get at twenty pretty readily but you will not so easily get further on we grow to five feet pretty readily but it is not so easy to grow to seven  on sunday april    being easter day after the solemnities of the festival in st pauls church i visited him but could not stay to dinner i expressed a wish to have the arguments for christianity always in readiness that my religious faith might be as firm and clear as any proposition whatever so that i need not be under the least uneasiness when it should be attacked johnson sir you cannot answer all objections you have demonstration for a first cause you see he must be good as well as powerful because there is nothing to make him otherwise and goodness of itself is preferable yet you have against this what is very certain the unhappiness of human life this however gives us reason to hope for a future state of compensation that there may be a perfect system but of that we were not sure till we had a positive revelation i told him that his rasselas had often made me unhappy for it represented the misery of human life so well and so convincingly to a thinking mind that if at any time the impression wore off and i felt myself easy i began to suspect some delusion  on monday april  0 i found him at home in the morning we talked of a gentleman who we apprehended was gradually involving his circumstances by bad management johnson wasting a fortune is evaporation by a thousand imperceptible means if it were a stream they would stop it you must speak to him it is really miserable were he a gamester it could be said he had hopes of winning were he a bankrupt in trade he might have grown rich but he has neither spirit to spend nor resolution to spare he does not spend fast enough to have pleasure from it he has the crime of prodigality and the wretchedness of parsimony if a man is killed in a duel he is killed as many a one has been killed but it is a sad thing for a man to lie down and die to bleed to death because he has not fortitude enough to sear the wound or even to stitch it up i cannot but pause a moment to admire the fecundity of fancy and choice of language which in this instance and indeed on almost all occasions he displayed it was well observed by dr percy now bishop of dromore the conversation of johnson is strong and clear and may be compared to an antique statue where every vein and muscle is distinct and bold ordinary conversation resembles an inferior cast  on saturday april    i dined with him at sir joshua reynoldss with the learned dr musgrave counselor leland of ireland son to the historian mrs cholmondeley and some more ladies the project a new poem was read to the company by dr musgrave johnson sir it has no power were it not for the wellknown names with which it is filled it would be nothing the names carry the poet not the poet the names musgrave a temporary poem always entertains us johnson so does an account of the criminals hanged yesterday entertain us  he proceeded  demosthenes tailor as he was called that is the translator of demosthenes was the most silent man the merest statue of a man that i have ever seen i once dined in company with him and all he said during the whole time was no more than richard how a man should say only richard it is not easy to imagine but it was thus dr douglas was talking of dr zachary gray and ascribing to him something that was written by dr richard gray so to correct him tailor said imitating his affected sententious emphasis and nod richard  mrs cholmondeley in a high flow of spirits exhibited some lively sallies of hyperbolical compliment to johnson with whom she had been long acquainted and was very easy he was quick in catching the manner of the moment and answered her somewhat in the style of the hero of a romance madam you crown me with unsading laurels  i happened i know not how to say that a pamphlet meant a prose piece johnson no sir a few sheets of poetry unbound are a pamphlet as much as a few sheets of prose musgrave a pamphlet may be understood to mean a poetical piece in westminster hall that is in formal language but in common language it is understood to mean prose johnson and here was one of the many instances of his knowing clearly and telling exactly how a thing is a pamphlet is understood in common language to mean prose only from this that there is so much more prose written than poetry as when we say a book prose is understood for the same reason though a book may as well be in poetry as in prose we understand what is most general and we name what is less frequent  we talked of a certain ladys verses on ireland miss reynolds have you seen them sir johnson no madam i have seen a translation from horace by one of her daughters she showed it me miss reynolds and how was it sir johnson why very well for a young misss ses  that is to say compared with excellence nothing but very well for the person who wrote them i am vexed at being shown verses in that manner miss reynolds but if they should be good why not give them hearty praise johnson why madam because i have not then got the better of my bad humor from having been shown them you must consider madam beforehand they may be bad as well as good nobody has a right to put another under such a difficulty that he must either hurt the person by telling the truth or hurt himself by telling what is is not true boswell a man often shows his writings to people of eminence to obtain from them either from their goodnature or from their not being able to tell the truth firmly a commendation of which he may afterward avail himself johnson very true sir therefore a man who is asked by an author what he thinks of his work is put to the torture and is not obliged to speak the truth so that what he says is not be considered as his opinion yet he has said it and cannot retract it and this author when mankind are hunting him with a cannister at his tail can say i would not have published had not johnson or reynolds or musgrave or some other good judge commended the work yet i consider it as a very difficult question in conscience whether one should advise a man not to publish a work if profit be his object for the man may say had it not been for you i should have had the money now you cannot be sure for you have only your own opinion and the public may think very differently sir joshua reynolds you must upon such an occasion have two judgments one as to the real value of the work the other as to what may please the general taste at the time johnson but you can be sure of neither and therefore i should scruple much to give a suppressive vote both goldsmiths comedies were once refused his first by garrick his second by colman who was prevailed on at last by much solicitation nay a kind of force to bring it on his vicar of wakefield i myself did not think would have had much success it was written and sold to a bookseller before his traveller but published after so little expectation had the bookseller from it had it been sold after the traveller he might have had twice as much money for it though sixty guineas was no mean price the bookseller had the advantage of goldsmiths reputation from the traveller in the sale though he had it not in selling the copy sir joshua reynolds the beggars opera affords a proof how strangely people will differ in opinion about a literary performance burke thinks it has no merit johnson it was refused by one of the houses but i should have thought it would succeed not from any great excellence in the writing but from the novelty and the general spirit and gaiety of the piece which keeps the audience always attentive and dismisses them in good humor  we went to the drawing room where was a considerable increase of company several of us got round dr johnson and complained that he would not give us an exact catalogue of his works that there might be a complete edition he smiled and evaded our entreaties that he intended to do it i have no doubt because i have heard him say so and i have in my possession an imperfect list fairly written out which he entitles historia studiorum i once got from one of his friends a list which there was pretty good reason to suppose was accurate for it was written down in his presence by this friend who enumerated each article aloud and had some of them mentioned to him by mr levett in concert with whom it was made out and johnson who heard all this did not contradict it but when i showed a copy of this list to him and mentioned the evidence for its exactness he laughed and said i was willing to let them go on as they pleased and never interfered upon which i read it to him article by article and got him positively to own or refuse and then having obtained certainty so far i got some other articles confirmed by him directly and afterward from time to time made additions under his sanction  his friend edward cave having been mentioned he told us cave used to sell ten thousand of the gentlemans magazine yet such was then his minute attention and anxiety that the sale should not feel the smallest diminution that he would name a particular person who he heard had talked of leaving off the magazine and would say let us have something good next month  it was observed that avarice was inherent in some dispositions johnson no man was born a miser because no man was born to possession every man is born cupidus  desirous of getting but not avarus  desirous of keeping boswell i have heard old mr sheridan maintain with much ingenuity that a complete miser is a happy man a miser who gives himself wholly to the one passion of saving johnson that is flying in the face of all the world who have called an avaricious man a miser because he is miserable no sir a man who both spends and saves money is the happiest man because he has both enjoyments  the conversation having turned on bon mots he quoted from one of the ana an exquisite instance of flattery in a maid of honor in france who being asked by the queen what oclock it was answered what your majesty pleases he admitted that mr burkes classical pun upon mr wilkess being carried on the shoulders of the mob   numerisque fertur lege solutus  was admirable and though he was strangely unwilling to allow to that extraordinary man the talent of wit see this question fully investigated in the notes upon my journal of a tour to the hebrides edit   p    et seq and here as a lawyer mindful of the maxim suum cuique tribuito i cannot forbear to mention that the additional note beginning with i find since the former edition is not mine but was obligingly furnished by mr malone who was so kind as to superintend the press while i was in scotland and the first part of the second edition was printing he would not allow me to ascribe it to its proper author but as it is exquisitely acute and elegant i take this opportunity without his knowledge to do him justice  he also laughed with approbation at another of his playful conceits which was that horace has in one line given a description of a good desirable manor est modus in rebus sunt certi denique fines that is to say a modus as to the tithes and certain fines  he observed a man cannot with propriety speak of himself except he relates simple facts as i was at richmond or what depends on mensuration as i am six feet high he is sure he has been at richmond he is sure he is six feet high but he cannot be sure he is wise or that he has any other excellence then all censure of a mans self is oblique praise it is in order to show how much he can spare it has all the invidiousness of selfpraise and all the reproach of falsehood boswell sometimes it may proceed from a mans strong consciousness of his faults being observed he knows that others would throw him down and therefore he had better lie down softly of his own accord  on tuesday april    he was engaged to dine at general paolis where as i have already observed i was still entertained in elegant hospitality and with all the ease and comfort of a home i called on him and accompanied him in a hackneycoach we stopped first at the bottom of hedgelane into which he went to leave a letter with good news for a poor man in distress as he told me i did not question him particularly as to this he himself often resembled lady bolingbrokes lively description of pope that he was un politic aux choux et aux raves he would say i dine today in grosvenorsquare this might be with a duke or perhaps i dine today at the other end of the town or a gentleman of great eminence called on me yesterday  he loved thus to keep things floating in conjecture omne ignotum pro magnifico est i believe i ventured to dissipate the cloud to unveil the mystery more freely and frequently than any of his friends we stopped again at wirgmans the corner of st jamessstreet a toyshop to which he had been directed but not clearly for he searched about some time and could not find it at first and said to direct one only to a corner shop is toying with one i suppose he meant this as a play upon the word toy it was the first time that i knew him stoop to such sport after he had been some time in the shop he sent for me to come out of the coach and help him to choose a pair of silver buckles as those he had were too small probably this alteration in dress had been suggested by mrs thrale by associating with whom his external appearance was much improved he got better clothes and the dark color from which he never deviated was enlivened by metal buttons his wigs too were much better and during their travels in france he was furnished with a parismade wig of handsome construction this choosing of silver buckles was a negotiation sir said he i will not have the ridiculous large ones now in fashion and i will give no more than a guinea for a pair such were the principles of the business and after some examination he was fitted as we drove along i found him in a talking humor of which i availed myself boswell i was this morning in ridleys shop sir and was told that the collection called johnsoniana has sold very much johnson yet the journey to the hebrides has not had a great sale here he either was mistaken or had a different notion of an extensive sale from what is generally entertained for the fact is that four thousand copies of that excellent work were sold very quickly a new edition has been printed since his death besides that in the collection of his works  boswell that is strange johnson yes sir for in that book i have told the world a great deal that they did not know before  boswell i drank chocolate sir this forenoon with mr eld and to my no small surprise found him to be a staffordshire whig a being which i did not believe had existed johnson sir there are rascals in all countries boswell eld said a tory was a creature generated between a nonjuring parson and ones grandmother johnson and i have always said the first whig was the devil boswell he certainly was sir the devil was impatient of subordination he was the first who resisted power better to reign in hell than serve in heaven   at general paolis were sir joshua reynolds mr langton marchese gherardi of lombardy and mr john spottiswoode of spottiswoode in the phraseology of scotland i should have said mr spottiswoode of that ilk johnson knew that sense of the word very well and has thus explained it in his dictionary voce ilk  it also signifies the same as mackintosh of that ilk denotes a gentleman whose surname and the title of his estate are the same  the solicitor at this time fears of an invasion were circulated to obviate which mr spottiswoode observed that mr fraser the engineer who had lately come from dunkirk said that the french had the same fears of us johnson it is thus that mutual cowardice keeps us in peace were one half of mankind brave and one half cowards the brave would be always beating the cowards were all brave they would lead a very uneasy life all would be continually fighting but being all cowards we go on very well  we talked of drinking wine johnson i require wine only when i am alone i have then often wished for it and often taken it spottiswoode what by way of a companion sir johnson to get rid of myself to send myself away wine gives great pleasure and every pleasure is of itself a good it is a good unless counterbalanced by evil a man may have a strong reason not to drink wine and that may be greater than the pleasure wine makes a man better pleased with himself i do not say that it makes him more pleasing to others sometimes it does but the danger is that while a man grows better pleased with himself he may be growing less pleasing to others wine gives a man nothing it neither gives him knowledge nor wit it only animates a man and enables him to bring out   it is observed in wallers life in the biographia britannica that he drank only water and that while he sat in a company who were drinking wine he had the dexterity to accommodate his discourse to the pitch of theirs as it sunk if excess in drinking be meant the remark is acutely just but surely a moderate use of wine gives a gaiety of spirits which waterdrinkers know not what a dread of the company has repressed it only puts in motion what has been locked up in frost but this may be good or it may be bad spottiswoode so sir wine is a key which opens a box but this box may be either full or empty johnson nay sir conversation is the key wine is a picklock which forces open the box and injures it a man should cultivate his mind so as to have that confidence and readiness without wine which wine gives boswell the great difficulty of resisting wine is from benevolence for instance a good worthy man asks you to taste his wine which he has had twenty years in his cellar johnson sir all this notion about benevolence arises from a mans imagining himself to be of more importance to others than he really is they dont care a farthing whether he drinks wine or not sir joshua reynolds yes they do for the time johnson for the time  if they care this minute they forget it the next and as for the good worthy man how do we know he is good and worthy no good and worthy man will insist upon another mans drinking wine as to the wine twenty years in the cellar  of ten men three say this merely because they must say something  three are telling a lie when they say they have had the wine twenty years  three would rather save the wine  one perhaps cares i allow it is something to please ones company and people are always pleased with those who partake pleasure with them but after a man has brought himself to relinquish the great personal pleasure which arises from drinking wine any other consideration is a trifle to please others by drinking wine is something only if there be nothing against it i should however besorry to offend worthy men curst be the verse how well soever it flow that tends to make one worthy man my foe boswell cursed be the spring the water johnson but let us consider what a sad thing it would be if we were obliged to drink or do any thing else that may happen to be agreeable to the company where we are langton by the same rule you must join with a gang of cutpurses johnson yes sir but yet we must do justice to wine we must allow it the power it possesses to make a man pleased with himself let me tell you is doing a very great thing si patriae volumus si nobis vivere cari   i was at this time myself a waterdrinker upon trial by johnsons recommendation johnson boswell is a bolder combatant than sir joshua he argues for wine without the help of wine but sir joshua with it sir joshua reynolds but to please ones company is a strong motive johnson who from drinking only water supposed every body who drank wine to be elevated i will not argue any more with you sir you are too far gone sir joshua i should have thought so indeed sir had i made such a speech as you have now done johnson drawing himself in and i really thought blushing nay dont be angry i did not mean to offend you sir joshua at first the taste of wine was disagreeable to me but i brought myself to drink it that i might be like other people the pleasure of drinking wine is so connected with pleasing your company that altogether there is something of social goodness in it johnson sir this is only saying the same thing over again sir joshua no this is new johnson you put it in new words but it is an old thought this is one of the disadvantages of wine it makes a man mistake words for thoughts boswell i think it is a new thought at least it is in a new attitude johnson nay sir it is only in a new coat or an old coat with a new facing then laughing heartily it is the old dog in a new doublet  an extraordinary instance however may occur where a mans patron will do nothing for him unless he will drink there may be a good reason for drinking  i mentioned a nobleman who i believed was really uneasy if his company would not drink hard johnson that is from having had people about him whom he has been accustomed to command boswell supposing i should be tete a tete with him at table johnson sir there is no more reason for your drinking with him than his being sober with you boswell why that is true for it would do him less hurt to be sober than it would do me to get drunk johnson yes sir and from what i have heard of him one would not wish to sacrifice himself to such a man if he must always have somebody to drink with him he should buy a slave and then he would be sure to have it they who submit to drink as another pleases make themselves his slaves boswell but sir you will surely make allowance for the duty of hospitality a gentleman who loves drinking comes to visit me johnson sir a man knows whom he visits he comes to the table of a sober man boswell but sir you and i should not have been so well received in the highlands and hebrides if i had not drank with our worthy friends had i drunk water only as you did they would not have been so cordial johnson sir william temple mentions that in his travels through the netherlands he had two or three gentlemen with him and when a bumper was necessary he put it on them were i to travel again through the highlands i would have sir joshua with me to take the bumpers boswell but sir let me put a case suppose sir joshua should take a jaunt into scotland he does me the honor to pay me a visit at my house in the country i am overjoyed at seeing him we are quite by ourselves shall i unsociably and churlishly let him sit drinking by himself no no my dear sir joshua you shall not be treated so i will take a bottle with you  the celebrated mrs rudd being mentioned johnson fifteen years ago i should have gone to see her spottiswoode because she was fifteen years younger johnson no sir but now they have a trick of putting every thing into the newspapers  he begged of general paoli to repeat one of the introductory stanzas of the first book of tassos jerusalem which he did and then johnson found fault with the simile of sweetening the edges of a cup for a child being transferred from lucretius into an epick poem the general said he did not imagine homers poetry was so ancient as is supposed because he ascribes to a greek colony circumstances of refinement not found in greece itself at a later period when thucydides wrote johnson i recollect but one passage quoted by thucydides from homer which is not to be found in our copies of homers works i am for the antiquity of homer and think that a grecian colony by being nearer persia might be more refined than the mother country  on wednesday april    i dined with him at mr allan ramsays where were lord binning dr robertson the historian sir joshua reynolds and the honorable mrs boscawen widow of the admiral and mother of the present viscount falmouth of whom if it be not presumptuous in me to praise her i would say that her manners are the most agreeable and her conversation the best of any lady with whom i ever had the happiness to be acquainted before johnson came we talked a good deal of him ramsay said he had always found him a very polite man and that he treated him with great respect which he did very sincerely i said i worshipped him robertson but some of you spoil him you should not worship him you should worship no man boswell i cannot help worshipping him he is so much superior to other men robertson in criticism and in wit in conversation he is no doubt very excellent but in other respects he is not above other men he will believe any thing and will strenuously defend the most minute circumstance connected with the church of england boswell believe me doctor you are much mistaken as to this for when you talk with him calmly in private he is very liberal in his way of thinking robertson he and i have been always very gracious the first time i met him was one evening at strahans when he had just had an unlucky altercation with adam smith to whom he had been so rough that strahan after smith was gone had remonstrated with him and told him that i was coming soon and that he was uneasy to think that he might behave in the same manner to me no no sir said johnson i warrant you robertson and i shall do very well accordingly he was gentle and goodhumoured and courteous with me the whole evening and he has been so upon every occasion that we have met since i have often said laughing that i have been in a great measure indebted to smith for my good reception boswell his power of reasoning is very strong and he has a peculiar art of drawing characters which is as rare as good portrait painting sir joshua reynolds he is undoubtedly admirable in this but in order to mark the characters which he draws he overcharges them and gives people more than they really have whether of good or bad  no sooner did he of whom we had been thus talking so easily arrive than we were all as quiet as a school upon the entrance of the headmaster and were very soon set down to a table covered with such variety of good things as contributed not a little to dispose him to be pleased  ramsay i am old enough to have been a contemporary of pope his poetry was highly admired in his lifetime more a great deal than after his death johnson sir it has not been less admired after his death no authors ever had so much fame in their own lifetime as pope and voltaire and popes poetry has been as much admired after his death as during his life it has only not been as much talked of but that is owing to its being now more distant and people having other writings to talk of virgil is less talked of than pope and homer is less talked of than virgil but they are not less admired we must read what the world reads at the moment it has been maintained that this superfcetation this teeming of the press in modern times is prejudicial to good literature because it obliges us to read so much of what is of inferior value in order to be in the fashion so that better works are neglected for want of time because a man will have more gratification of his vanity in conversation from having read modern books than from having read the best works of antiquity but it must be considered that we have now more knowledge generally diffused all our ladies read now which is a great extension modern writers are the moons of literature they shine with reflected light with light borrowed from the ancients greece appears to me to be the fountain of knowledge rome of elegance ramsay i suppose homers iliad to be a collection of pieces which had been written before his time i should like to see a translation of it in poetical prose like the book of ruth or job robertson would you dr johnson who are master of the english language but try your hand upon a part of it johnson sir you could not read it without the pleasure of verse this experiment which madame dacier made in vain has since been tried in our own language by the editor of ossian and we must either think very meanly of his abilities or allow that dr johnson was in the right   we talked of antiquarian researches johnson all that is really known of the ancient state of britain is contained in a few pages we can know no more than what the old writers have told us yet what large books have we upon it the whole of which excepting such parts as are taken from those old writers is all a dream such as whitakers manchester i have heard henrys history of britain well spoken of i am told it is carried on in separate divisions as the civil the military the religious history i wish much to have one branch well done and that is the history of manners of common life robertson henry should have applied his attention to that alone which is enough for any man and he might have found a great deal scattered in various books had he read solely with that view henry erred in not selling his first volume at a moderate price to the booksellers that they might have pushed him on till he had got reputation i sold my history of scotland at a moderate price as a work by which the booksellers might either gain or not and cadell has told me that millar and he have got six thousand pounds by it i afterward received a much higher price for my writings an author should sell his first work for what the booksellers will give till it shall appear whether he is an author of merit or which is the same thing as to rchasemoney an author who pleases the public  dr robertson expatiated on the character of a certain nobleman that he was one of the strongestminded men that ever lived that he would sit in company quite sluggish while there was nothing to call sorth his intellectual vigor but the moment that any important subject was started for instance how this country is to be defended against a french invasion he would rouse himself and show his extraordinary talents with the most powerful ability and animation johnson yet this man cut his own throat the true strong and sound mind is the mind that can embrace equally great things and small now i am told the king of prussia will say to a servant bring me a bottle of such a wine which came in such a year it lies in such a corner of the cellars i would have a man to be great in great things and elegant in little things he said to me afterward when we were by ourselves robertson was in a mighty romantic humor he talked of one whom he did not know but i downed him with the king of prussia  yes sir said i you threw a bottle at his head  an ingenious gentleman was mentioned concerning whom both robertson and ramsay agreed that he had a constant firmness of mind for after a laborious day and amidst a multiplicity of cares and anxieties he would sit down with his sisters and be quite cheerful and goodhumoured such a disposition it was observed was a happy gift of nature johnson i do not think so a man has from nature a certain portion of mind the use he makes of it depends upon his own free will that a man has always the same firmness of mind i do not say because every man feels his mind less firm at one time than at another but i think a mans being in a good or bad humor depends upon his will i however could not help thinking that a mans humor is often uncontrollable by his will  johnson harangued against drinking wine a man said he may choose whether he will have abstemiousness and knowledge or claret and ignorance dr robertson who is very companionable was beginning to dissent as to the proscription of claret johnson with a placid smile nay sir you shall not differ with me as i have said that the man is most perfect who takes in the most things i am for knowledge and claret robertson holding a glass of generous claret in his hand sir i can only drink your health johnson sir i should be sorry if you should be ever in such a state as to be able to do nothing more robertson dr johnson allow me to say that in one respect i have the advantage of you when you were in scotland you would not come to hear any of our preachers whereas when i am here i attend your public worship without scruple and indeed with great satisfaction johnson why sir that is not so extraordinary the king of siam sent ambassadors to louis the fourteenth but louis the fourteenth sent none to the king of siam mrs piozzi confidently mentions this as having passed in scotland anecdotes p      here my friend for once discovered a want of knowledge or forgetfulness for louis the fourteenth did send an embassy to the king of siam and the abbe choisis who was employed in it published an account of it in two volumes  next day thursday april  0 i found him at home by himself johnson well sir ramsay gave us a splendid dinner i love ramsay you will not find a man in whose conversation there is more instruction more information and more elegance than in ramsays boswell what i admire in ramsay is his continuing to be so young johnson why yes sir it is to be admired i value myself upon this that there is nothing of the old man in my conversation i am now sixtyeight and i have no more of it than at twentyeight boswell but sir would not you wish to know old age he who is never an old man does not know the whole of human life for old age is one of the divisions of it johnson nay sir what talk is this boswell i mean sir the sphinxs description of it  morning noon and night i would know night as well as morning and noon johnson what sir would you know what it is to feel the evils of old age would you have the gout would you have decrepitude  seeing him heated i would not argue any farther but i was confident that i was in the right i would in due time be a nestor an elder of the people and there should be some difference between the conversation of twentyeight and sixtyeight a grave picture should not be gay there is a serene solemn placid old age johnson mrs thrales mother said of me what flattered me much a clergyman was complaining of want of society in the country where he lived and said they talk of runts that is young cows sir said mrs salusbury mr johnson would learn to talk of runts meaning that i was a man who would make the most of my situation whatever it was he added i think myself a very polite man  on saturday may   i dined with him at sir joshua reynoldss where there was a very large company and a great deal of conversation but owing to some circumstance which i cannot now recollect i have no record of any part of it except that there were several people there by no means of the johnsonian school so that less attention was paid to him than usual which put him out of humor and upon some imaginary offense from me he attacked me with such rudeness that i was vexed and angry because it gave those persons an opportunity of enlarging upon his supposed ferocity and ill treatment of his best friends i was so much hurt and had my pride so much roused that i kept away from him for a week and perhaps might have kept away much longer nay gone to scotland without seeing him again had not we fortunately met and been reconciled to such unhappy chances are human friendships liable  on friday may   i dined with him at mr langtons i was reserved and silent which i suppose he perceived and might recollect the cause after dinner when mr langton was called out of the room and we were by ourselves he drew his chair near to mine and said in a tone of conciliating courtesy well how have you done boswell sir you have made me very uneasy by your behavior to me when we were last at sir joshua reynoldss you know my dear sir no man has a greater respect and affection for you or would sooner go to the end of the world to serve you now to treat me so  he insisted that i had interrupted him which i assured him was not the case and proceeded but why treat me so before people who neither love you nor me johnson well i am sorry for it i will make it up to you twenty different ways as you please boswell i said today to sir joshua when he observed that you tossed me sometimes i dont care how often or how high he tosses me when only friends are present for then i fall upon soft ground but i do not like falling on stones which is the case when enemies are present  i think this a pretty good image sir johnson sir it is one of the happiest i have ever heard  the truth is there was no venom in the wounds which he inflicted at any time unless they were irritated by some malignant infusion by other hands we were instantly as cordial again as ever and joined in hearty laugh at some ludicrous but innocent peculiarities of one of our friends boswell do you think sir it is always culpable to laugh at a man to his face johnson why sir that depends upon the man and the thing if it is a slight man and a slight thing you may for you take nothing valuable from him  he said i read yesterday dr blairs sermon on devotion from the text cornelius a devout man his doctrine is the best limited the best expressed there is the most warmth without fanaticism the most rational transport there is one part of it which i disapprove and i would have him correct it which is that he who does not feel joy in religion is far from the kingdom of heaven there are many good men whose fear of god predominates over their love it may discourage it was rashly said a noble sermon it is indeed i wish blair would come over to the church of england  when mr langton returned to us the flow of talk went on an eminent author being mentioned  johnson he is not a pleasant man his conversation is neither instructive nor brilliant he does not talk as if impelled by any fullness of knowledge or vivacity of imagination his conversation is like that of any other sensible man he talks with no wish either to inform or to hear but only because he thinks it does not become  to sit in a company and say nothing  mr langton having repeated the anecdote of addison having distinguished between his powers in conversation and in writing by saying i have only ninepence in my pocket but i can draw for a thousand pounds  johnson he had not that retort ready sir he had prepared it beforehand langton turning to me a fine surmise set a thief to catch a thief  johnson called the eastindians barbarians boswell you will except the chinese sir johnson no sir boswell have they not arts johnson they have pottery boswell what do you say to the written characters of their language johnson sir they have not an alphabet they have not been able to form what all other nations have formed boswell there is more learning in their language than in any other from the immense number of their characters johnson it is only more difficult from its rudeness as there is more labor in hewing down a tree with a stone than with an axe  he said i have been reading lord kamess sketches of the history of man in treating of severity of punishment he mentions that of madame lapouchin in russia but he does not give it fairly for i have looked at chappe dauteroche from whom he has taken it he stops where it is said that the spectators thought her innocent and leaves out what follows that she nevertheless was guilty now this is being as culpable as one can conceive to misrepresent fact in a book and for what motive it is like one of those lies which people tell one cannot see why the womans life was spared and no punishment is too great for the favorite of an empress who had conspired to dethrone her mistress boswell he was only giving a picture of the lady in her sufferings johnson nay dont endeavor to palliate this guilt is a principal feature in the picture kames is puzzled with a question that puzzled me when i was a very young man why is it that the interest of money is lower when money is plentiful for five pounds has the same proportion of value to a hundred pounds when money is plentiful as when it is scarce a lady explained it to me it is said she because when money is plentiful there are so many more who have money to lend that they bid down one another many have then a hundred pounds and one says take mine rather than anothers and you shall have it at four per cent boswell does lord kames decide the question johnson i think he leaves it as he found it boswell this must have been an extraordinary lady who instructed you sir may i ask who she was johnson molly aston johnson had an extraordinary admiration of this lady notwithstanding she was a violent whig in answer to her highslown speeches for liberty he addressed to her the following epigram of which i presume to offer a translation liber ut esse velim suasisti pulchra maria ut maneam liber pulchra maria val adieu maria since you would have me free for who beholds thy charms a slave must be   sir the sister of those ladies with whom you dined at lichfield  i shall be at home tomorrow boswell then let us dine by ourselves at the mitre to keep up the old custom the custom of the manor the custom of the mitre johnson sir so it shall be  on saturday may   we fulfilled our purpose of dining by ourselves at the mitre according to old custom there was on these occasions a little circumstance of kind attention to mrs williams which must not be omitted before coming out and leaving her to dine alone he gave her her choice of a chicken a sweetbread or any other little nice thing which was carefully sent to her from the tavern ready dressed  our conversation today i know not how turned i think for the only time at any length during our long acquaintance upon the sensual intercourse between the sexes the delight of which he ascribed chiefly to imagination were it not for imagination sir said he a man would be as happy in the arms of a chambermaid as of a duchess but such is the adventitious charm of fancy that we find men who have violated the best principles of society and ruined their fame and their fortune that they might possess a woman of rank it would not be proper to record the particulars of such a conversation in moments of unreserved frankness when nobody was present on whom it could have any hurtful effect that subject when philosophically treated may surely employ the mind in as curious discussion and as innocently as anatomy provided that those who do treat it keep clear of inflammatory incentives  from grave to gay from lively to severe  we were soon engaged in very different speculation humbly and reverently considering and wondering at the universal mystery of all things as our imperfect faculties can now judge of them there are said he innumerable questions to which the inquisitive mind can in this state receive no answer why do you and i exist why was this world created since it was to be created why was it not created sooner  on sunday may  0 i supped with him at mr hooles with sir joshua reynolds i have neglected the memorial of this evening so as to remember no more of it than two particulars one that he strenuously opposed an argument by sir joshua that virtue was preferable to vice considering this life only and that a man would be virtuous were it only to preserve his character and that he expressed much wonder at the curious formation of the bat a mouse with wings saying that it was almost as strange a thing in physiology as if the fabulous dragon could be seen  on tuesday may    i waited on the earl of marchmont to know if his lordship would favor dr johnson with information concerning pope whose life he was about to write johnson had not flattered himself with the hopes of receiving any civility from this nobleman for he said to me when i mentioned lord marchmont as one who could tell him a great deal about pope sir he will tell me nothing i had the honor of being known to his lordship and applied to him of myself without being commissioned by johnson his lordship behaved in the most polite and obliging manner promised to tell all he recollected about pope and was so very courteous as to say tell dr johnson i have a great respect for him and am ready to show it in any way i can i am to be in the city tomorrow and will call at his house as i return his lordship however asked will he write the lives of the poets impartially he was the first that brought whig and tory into a dictionary and what do you think of his definition of excise do you know the history of his aversion to the word transpire then taking down the folio dictionary he showed it with this censure on its secondary sense to escape from secresy to notice a sense lately innovated from france without necessity the truth was lord bolingbroke who left the jacobites first used it therefore it was to be condemned he should have shown what word would do for it if it was unnecessary i afterward put the question to johnson why sir said he get abroad boswell that sir is using two words johnson sir there is no end of this you may as well insist to have a word for old age boswell well sir senectus johnson nay sir to insist always that there should be one word to express a thing in english because there is one in another language is to change the language  i availed myself of this opportunity to hear from his lordship many particulars both of pope and lord bolingbroke which i have in writing  i proposed to lord marchmont that he should revise johnsons life of pope so said his lordship you would put me in a dangerous situation you know he knocked down osborne the bookseller  elated with the success of my spontaneous exertion to procure material and respectable aid to johnson for his very favorite work the lives of the poets i hastened down to mr thrales at streatham where he now was that i might insure his being at home next day and after dinner when i thought he would receive the good news in the best humor i announced it eagerly i have been at work for you today sir i have been with lord marchmont he bid me tell you he has a great respect for you and will call on you tomorrow at one oclock and communicate all he knows about pope  here i paused in full expectation that he would be pleased with this intelligence would praise my active merit and would be alert to embrace such an offer from a nobleman but whether i had shown an over exultation which provoked his spleen or whether he was seized with a suspicion that i had obtruded him on lord marchmont and had humbled him too much or whether there was any thing more than an unlucky fit of ill humor i know not but to my surprise the result was  johnson i shall not be in town tomorrow i dont care to know about pope mrs thrale surprised as i was and a little angry i suppose sir mr boswell thought that as you are to write popes life you would wish to know about him johnson wish why yes if it rained knowledge i would hold out my hand but i would not give myself the trouble to go in quest of it there was no arguing with him at the moment some time afterward he said lord marchmont will call on me and then i shall call on lord marchmont mr thrale was uneasy at his unaccountable caprice and told me that if i did not take care to bring about a meeting between lord marchmont and him it would never take place which would be a great pity i sent a card to his lordship to be left at johnsons house acquainting him that dr johnson could not be in town next day but would do himself the honor of waiting on him at another time  i give this account fairly as a specimen of that unhappy temper with which this great and good man had occasionally to struggle from something morbid in his constitution let the most censorious of my readers suppose himself to have a violent fit of the toothache or to have received a severe stroke on the shinbone and when in such a state to be asked a question and if he has any candor he will not be surprised at the answers which johnson sometimes gave in moments of irritation which let me assure them is exquisitely painful but it must not be erroneously supposed that he was in the smallest degree careless concerning any work which he undertook or that he wsa generally thus peevish it will be seen that in the following year he had a very agreeable interview with lord marchmont at his lordships house and this very afternoon he soon forgot any fretfulness and fell into conversation as usual  i mentioned a reflection having been thrown out against four peers for having presumed to rise in opposition to the opinion of the twelve judges in a cause in the house of lords as if that were indecent johnson sir there is no ground for censure the peers are judges themselves and supposing them really to be of a different opinion they might from duty be in opposition to the judges who were there only to be consulted  in this observation i fully concurred with him for unquestionably all the peers are vested with the highest judicial powers and when they are confident that they understand a cause are not obliged nay ought not to acquiesce in the opinion of the ordinary law judges or even in that of those who from their studies and experience are called the law lords i consider the peers in general as i do a jury who ought to listen with respectful attention to the sages of the law but if after hearing them they have a firm opinion of their own are bound as honest men to decide accordingly nor is it so difficult for them to understand even law questions as is generally thought provided they will bestow sufficient attention upon them this observation was made by my honored relation the late lord cathcart who had spent his life in camps and courts yet assured me that he could form a clear opinion upon most of the causes that came before the house of lords as they were so well enucleated in the cases  mrs thrale told us that a curious clergyman of our acquaintance had discovered a licentious stanza which pope had originally in his universal prayer before the stanza what conscience dictates to be done or warns us not to do etc it was this  can sins of moment claim the rod of everlasting fires and that offend great natures god which natures self inspires and that dr johnson observed it had been borrowed from guarini there are indeed in pastor fido many such flimsy superficial reasonings as that in the two last lines of this stanza  boswell in that stanza of popes rod of sires is certainly a bad metaphor mrs thrale and sins of moment is a faulty expression for its true import is momentous which cannot be intended johnson it must have been written of moments of moment is momentous of moments momentary i warrant you however pope wrote this stanza and some friend struck it out boileau wrote some such thing and arnaud struck it out saying vous gagnerez deux ou trois impies et perdrez je ne sais combien d honnettes gens these fellows want to say a daring thing and dont know how to go about it mere poets know no more of fundamental principles than   here he was interrupted somehow mrs thrale mentioned dryden johnson he puzzled himself about predestination  how foolish was it in pope to give all his friendship to lords who thought they honored him by being with him and to choose such lords as burlington and cobham and bolingbroke bathurst was negative a pleasing man and i have heard no ill of marchmont and then always saying i do not value you for being a lord which was a sure proof that he did i never say i do not value boswell more for being born to an estate because i do not care boswell nor for being a scotchman johnson nay sir i do value you more for being a scotchman you are a scotchman without the faults of scotchmen you would not have been so valuable as you are had you not been a scotchman  talking of divorces i asked if othellos doctrine was not plausible he who is robbed not wanting what is stolen let him not know it and he is not robbed at all dr johnson and mrs thrale joined against this johnson ask any man if he would wish not to know of such an injury boswell would you tell your friend to make him unhappy johnson perhaps sir i should not but that would be from prudence on my own account a man would tell his father boswell yes because he would not have spurious children to get any share of the family inheritance mrs thrale or he would tell his brother boswell certainly his elder brother johnson you would tell your friend of a womans infamy to prevent his marrying a whore there is the same reason to tell him of his wifes infidelity when he is married to prevent the consequences of imposition it is a breach of confidence not to tell a friend boswell would you tell mr  naming a gentleman who assuredly was not in the least danger of such a miserable disgrace though married to a fine woman johnson no sir because it would do no good he is so sluggish he would never go to parliament and get through a divorce  he said of one of our friends he is ruining himself without pleasure a man who loses at play or who runs out his fortune at court makes his estate less in hopes of making it bigger i am sure of this word which was often used by him but it is a sad thing to pass through the quagmire of parsimony to the gulf of ruin to pass over the flowery path of extravagance is very well  amongst the numerous prints pasted on the walls of the dining room at streatham was hogarths modern midnight conversation i asked him what he knew of parson ford who makes a conspicuous figure in the riotous groupe johnson sir he was my acquaintance and relation my mothers nephew he had purchased a living in the country but not simoniacally i never saw him but in the country i have been told he was a man of great parts very profligate but i never heard he was impious boswell was there not a story of his ghost having appeared johnson sir it was believed a waiter at the hummums in which house ford died had been absent for some time and returned not knowing that ford was dead going down to the cellar according to the story he met him going down again he met him a second time when he came up he asked some of the people of the house what ford could be doing there they told him ford was dead the waiter took a fever in which he lay for some time when he recovered he said he had a message to deliver to some women from ford but he was not to tell what or to whom he walked out he was followed but somewhere about st pauls they lost him he came back and said he had delivered the message and the women exclaimed then we are all undone dr pellet who was not a credulous man inquired into the truth of this story and he said the evidence was irresistible my wife went to the hummums it is a place where people get themselves cupped i believe she went with intention to hear about this story of ford at first they made difficulty to tell her but after they had talked to her she came away satisfied that it was true to be sure the man had a fever and this vision may have been the beginning of it but if the message to the women and their behavior upon it were true as related there was something supernatural that rests upon his word and there it remains  after mrs thrale was gone to bed johnson and i sat up late we resumed sir joshua reynoldss argument on sunday last that a man would be virtuous though he had no other motive than to preserve his character johnson sir it is not true for as to this world vice does not hurt a mans character boswell yes sir debauching a friends wife will johnson no sir who thinks the worse of  for it boswell lord  was not his friend johnson that is only a circumstance sir a slight distinction he could not get into the house but by lord  a man is chosen knight of the shire not the less for having debauched ladies boswell what sir if he debauched the ladies of gentlemen in the county will not there be a general resentment against him johnson no sir he will lose those particular gentlemen but the rest will not trouble their heads about it warmly boswell well sir i cannot think so johnson nay sir there is no talking with a man who will dispute what every body knows angrily dont you know this boswell no sir and i wish to think better of your country than you represent it i knew in scotland a gentleman obliged to leave it for debauching a lady and in one of our counties an earls brother lost his election because he had debauched the lady of another earl in that county and broken the peace of a noble family  still he would not yield he proceeded will you not allow sir that vice does not hurt a mans character so as to obstruct his prosperity in life when you know that  was loaded with wealth and honors a man who had acquired his fortune by such crimes that his consciousness of them impelled him to cut his own throat boswell you will recollect sir that dr robertson said he cut his throat because he was weary of still life little things not being sufficient to move his great mind johnson very angry nay sir what stuff is this you had no more this opinion after robertson said it than before i know nothing more offensive than repeating what one knows to be foolish things by way of continuing a dispute to see what a man will answer to make him your butt angrier still boswell my dear sir i had no such intention as you seem to suspect i had not indeed might not this nobleman have felt every thing weary stale flat and unprofitable as hamlet says johnson nay if you are to bring in gabble i will talk no more i will not upon my honor my readers will decide upon this dispute  next morning i stated to mrs thrale at breakfast before he came down the dispute of last night as to the influence of character upon success in life she said he was certainly wrong and told me that a baronet lost an election in wales because he had debauched the sister of a gentleman in the county whom he made one of his daughters invite as her companion at his seat in the country when his lady and his other children were in london but she would not encounter johnson upon the subject  i staid all this day with him at streatham he talked a great deal in very good humor  looking at messrs dillys splendid edition of lord chesterfields miscellaneous works he laughed and said here now are two speeches ascribed to him both of which were written by me and the best of it is they have found out that one is like demosthenes and the other like cicero  he censured lord kamess sketches of the history of man for misrepresenting clarendons account of the appearance of sir george villierss ghost as if clarendon were weakly credulous when the truth is that clarendon only says that the story was upon a better foundation of credit than usually such discourses are founded upon nay speaks thus of the person who was reported to have seen the vision the poor man if he had been at all waking which lord kames has omitted he added in this book it is maintained that virtue is natural to man and that if we would but consult our own hearts we should be virtuous now after consulting our own hearts all we can and with all the helps we have we find how few of us are virtuous this is saying a thing which all mankind know not to be true boswell is not modesty natural johnson i cannot say sir as we find no people quite in a state of nature but i think the more they are taught the more modest they are the french are a gross illbred untaught people a lady there will spit on the floor and rub it with her foot what i gained by being in france was learning to be better satisfied with my own country time may be employed to more advantage from nineteen to twentyfour almost in any way than in traveling when you set traveling against mere negation against doing nothing it is better to be sure but how much more would a young man improve were he to study during those years indeed if a young man is wild and must run after women and bad company it is better this should be done abroad as on his return he can break off such connections and begin at home a new man with a character to form and acquaintances to make how little does traveling supply to the conversation of any man who has traveled how little to beauclerk boswell what say you to lord  johnson i never but once heard him talk of what he had seen and that was of a large serpent in one of the pyramids of egypt boswell well i happened to hear him tell the same thing which made me mention him  i talked of a country life  johnson were i to live in the country i would not devote myself to the acquisition of popularity i would live in a much better way much more happily i would have my time at my own command boswell but sir is it not a sad thing to be at a distance from all our literary friends johnson sir you will by and by have enough of this conversation which now delights you so much  as he was a zealous friend of subordination he was at all times watchful to repress the vulgar cant against the manners of the great high people sir said he are the best take a hundred ladies of quality you will find them better wives better mothers more willing to sacrifice their own pleasure to their children than a hundred other women tradeswomen i mean the wives of tradesmen in the city who are worth from ten to fifteen thousand pounds are the worst creatures upon the earth grossly ignorant and thinking viciousness fashionable farmers i think are often worthless fellows few lords will cheat and if they do they will be ashamed of it farmers cheat and are not ashamed of it they have all the sensual vices too of the nobility with cheating into the bargain there is as much fornication and adultery amongst farmers as amongst noblemen boswell the notion of the world sir however is that the morals of women of quality are worse than those in lower stations johnson yes sir the licentiousness of one woman of quality makes more noise than that of a number of women in lower stations then sir you are to consider the malignity of women in the city against women of quality which will make them believe any thing of them such as that they call their coachmen to bed no sir so far as i have observed the higher in rank the richer ladies are they are the better instructed and the more virtuous  this year the reverend mr horn published his letter to mr dunning on the english particle johnson read it and though not treated in it with sufficient respect he had candor enough to say to mr seward were i to make a new edition of my dictionary i would adopt several in mr horn tookes enlargement of that letter which ho has since published with the title of  or the diversions of purley he mentions this compliment as if dr johnson instead of several of his etymologies had said all his recollection having thus magnified it shows how ambitious he was of the approbation of so great a man of mr hornes etymologies i hope they did not put the dog in the pillory for his libel he has too much literature for that  on saturday may    i dined with him at mr beauclerks with mr langton mr steevens dr higgins and some others i regret very feelingly every instance of my remissness in recording his memorabilia i am afraid it is the condition of humanity as mr windham of norfolk once observed to me after having made an admirable speech in the house of commons which was highly applauded but which he afterward perceived might have been better that we are more uneasy from thinking of our wants than happy in thinking of our acquisitions this is an unreasonable mode of disturbing our tranquillity and should be corrected let me then comfort myself with the large treasure of johnsons conversation which i have preserved for my own enjoyment and that of the world and let me exhibit what i have upon each occasion whether more or less whether a bulse or only a few sparks of diamond  he said dr mead lived more in the broad sunshine of life than almost any man  the disaster of general burgoynes army was then the common topic of conversation it was asked why piling their arms was insisted upon as a matter of such consequence when it seemed to be a circumstance so inconsiderable in itself johnson why sir a french author says il y a beaucoup de puerilites dans la guerre all distinctions are trifles because great things can seldom occur and those distinctions are settled by custom a savage would as willingly have his meat sent to him in the kitchen as eat it at the table here as men become civilized various modes of denoting honorable preference are invented  he this day made the observations upon the similarity between rasselas and candide which i have inserted in its proper place when considering his admirable philosophical romance he said candide he thought had more power in it than any thing that voltaire had written  he said the lyrical part of horace never can be perfectly translated so much of the excellence is in the numbers and the expression francis has done it the best i will take his five out of six against them all  on sunday may    i presented to him mr fullarton of fullarton who has since distinguished himself so much in india to whom he naturally talked of travels as mr brydone accompanied him in his tour to sicily and malta he said the information which we have from modern travelers is much more authentic than what we had from ancient travelers ancient travelers guessed modern travelers measure the swiss admit that there is but one error in stanyan if brydone were more attentive to his bible he would be a good traveller  he said lord chatham was a dictator he possessed the power of putting the state in motion now there is no power all order is relaxed boswell is there no hope of a change to the better johnson why yes sir when we are weary of this relaxation so the city of london will appoint its mayors again by seniority boswell but is not that taking a mere chance for having a good or a bad mayor johnson yes sir but the evil of competition is greater than that of the worst mayor that can come besides there is no more reason to suppose that the choice of a rabble will be right than that chance will be right  on tuesday may    i was to set out for scotland in the evening he was engaged to dine with me at mr dillys i waited upon him to remind him of his appointment and attend him thither he gave me some salutary counsel and recommended vigorous resolution against any deviation from moral duty boswell but you would not have me to bind myself by a solemn obligation johnson much agitated what a vow  o no sir a vow is a horrible thing it is a snare for sin the man who cannot go to heaven without a vow  may go   here standing erect in the middle of his library and rolling grand his pause was truly a curious compound of the solemn and the ludicrous he halfwhistled in his usual way when pleasant and he paused as if checked by religious awe  methought he would have added  to hell  but was restrained i humoured the dilemma what sir said i in coelum jusseris ibit alluding to his imitation of it and bid him go to hell to hell he goes   i had mentioned to him a slight fault in his noble imitation of the tenth satire of juvenal a too near recurrence of the verb spread in his description of the young enthusiast at college  through all his veins the fever of renown spreads from the strong contagion of the gown over bodleys dome his future labors spread and bacons mansion trembles over his head he had desired me to change spreads to burns but for perfect authenticity i now had it done with his own hand the slip of paper on which he made the correction is deposited by me in the noble library to which it relates and to which i have presented other pieces of his handwriting  i thought this alteration not only cured the fault but was more poetical as it might carry an allusion to the shirt by which hercules was inflamed  we had a quiet comfortable meeting at mr dillys nobody there but ourselves mr dilly mentioned somebody having wished that miltons tractate on education should be printed along with his poems in the edition of the english poets then going on johnson it would be breaking in upon the plan but would be of no great consequence so far as it would be any thing it would be wrong education in england has been in danger of being hurt by two of its greatest men milton and lock miltons plan is impracticable and i suppose has never been tried lockes i fancy has been tried often enough but is very imperfect it gives too much to one side and too little to the other it gives too little to literature i shall do what i can for dr watts but my materials are very scanty his poems are by no means his best works i cannot praise his poetry itself highly but i can praise its design  my illustrious friend and i parted with assurances of affectionate regard  johnson maintained a long and intimate friendship with mr welsh who succeeded the celebrated henry fielding as one of his majestys justices of the peace for westminster kept a regular office for the police of that great district and discharged his important trust for many years faithfully and ably johnson who had an eager and unceasing curiosity to know human life in all its variety told me that he attended mr welsh in his office for a whole winter to hear the examinations of the culprits but that he found an almost uniform tenor of misfortune wretchedness and profligacy mr welchs health being impaired he was advised to try the effect of a warm climate and johnson by his interest with mr chamier procured him leave of absence to go to italy and a promise that the pension or salary of two hundred pounds a year which government allowed him should not be discontinued mr welsh accordingly went abroad accompanied by his daughter anne a young lady of uncommon talents and literature i have been fortunate enough as this work was passing through the press to obtain the following letter which although the first part of my narrative of this year was printed off before i received it will now come in with very little deviation from chronological order  to saunders welsh esquire at the english coffeehouse rome dear sir to have suffered one of my best and dearest friends to pass almost two years in foreign countries without a letter has a very shameful appearance of inattention but the truth is that there was no particular time in which i had any thing particular to say and general expressions of good will i hope our long friendship is grown too solid to want  of public affairs you have information from the newspapers wherever you go for the english keep no secret and of other things mrs nollekens informs you my intelligence could therefore be of no use and miss nancys letters made it unnecessary to write to you for information i was likewise for some time out of humor to find that motion and nearer approaches to the sun did not restore your health so fast as i expected of your health the accounts have lately been more pleasing and i have the gratification of imaging to myself a length of years which i hope you have gained and of which the enjoyment will be improved by a vast accession of images and observations which your journeys and various residence have enabled you to make and accumulate you have traveled with this felicity almost peculiar to yourself that your companion is not to part from you at your journeys end but you are to live on together to help each others recollection and to supply each others omissions the world has few greater pleasures than that which two friends enjoy in tracing back at some distant time those transactions and events through which they have passed together one of the old mans miseries is that he cannot easily find a companion able to partake with him of the past you and your fellowtraveller have this comfort in store that your conversation will be not easily exhausted one will always be glad to say what the other will always be willing to hear  that you may enjoy this pleasure long your health must have your constant attention i suppose you purpose to return this year there is no need of haste do not come hither before the height of summer that you may fall gradually into the inconveniences of your native climate july seems to be the proper month august and september will prepare you for the winter after having traveled so far to find health you must take care not to lose it at home and i hope a little care will effectually preserve it  miss nancy has doubtless kept a constant and copious journal she must not expect to be welcome when she returns without a great mass of information let her review her journal often and set down what she finds herself to have omitted that she may trust to memory as little as possible for memory is soon confused by a quick succession of things and she will grow every day less confident of the truth of her own narratives unless she can recur to some written memorials if she has satisfied herself with hints instead of full representations let her supply the deficiencies now while her memory is yet fresh and while her fathers memory may help her if she observes this direction she will not have traveled in vain for she will bring home a book with which she may entertain herself to the end of life if it were not now too late i would advise her to note the impression which the first sight of any thing new and wonderful made upon her mind let her now set her thoughts down as she can recollect them for faint as they may already be they will grow every day fainter  perhaps i do not flatter myself unreasonably when i imagine that you may wish to know something of me i can gratify your benevolence with no account of health the hand of time or of disease is very heavy upon me i pass restless and uneasy nights harrassed with convulsions of my breast and flatulencies at my stomach and restless nights make heavy days but nothing will be mended by complaints and therefore i will make an end when we meet we will try to forget our cares and our maladies and contribute as we can to the cheerfulness of each other if i had gone with you i believe i should have been better but i do not know that it was in my power  i am dear sir your most humble servant sam johnson feb         this letter while it gives admirable advice how to travel to the best advantage and will therefore be of very general use is another eminent proof of johnsons warm and affectionate heart the friendship between mr welsh and him was unbroken mr welsh died not many months before him and bequeathed him five guineas for a ring which johnson received with tenderness as a kind memorial his regard was constant for his friend mr welchs daughters of whom jane is married to mr nollekens the statuary whose merit is too well known to require any praise from me   i wrote to him on the   th of may from thorpe in yorkshire one of the seats of mr bosville and gave him an account of my having passed a day at lincoln unexpectedly and therefore without having any letters of introduction but that i had been honored with civilities from the reverend mr simpson an acquaintance of his and captain broadley of the lincolnshire militia but more particularly from the reverend dr gordon the chancellor who first received me with great politeness as a stranger and when i had informed him who i was entertained me at his house with the most flattering attention i also expressed the pleasure with which i had sound that our worthy friend langton was highly esteemed in his own county town   to dr samuel johnson my dear sir edinburgh june         since my return to scotland i have been again at lanark and have had more conversation with thomsons sister it is strange that murdoch who was his intimate friend should have mistaken his mothers maiden name which he says was hume whereas hume was the name of his grandmother by the mothers side his mothers name was beatrix trotter dr johnson was by no means attentive to minute accuracy in his lives of the poets for notwithstanding my having detected this mistake he has continued it  a daughter of mr trotter of fogo a small proprietor of land thomson had one brother whom he had with him in england as his amanuensis but he was seized with a consumption and having returned to scotland to try what his native air would do for him died young he had three sisters one married to mr bell minister of the parish of strathaven one to mr craig father of the ingenious architect who gave the plan of the new town of edinburgh and one to mr thomson master of the grammar school at lanark he was of a humane and benevolent disposition not only sent valuable presents to his sisters but an yearly allowance in money and was always wishing to have it in his power to do them more good lord lytteltons observation that he lothed much to write was very true his letters to his sister mrs thomson were not frequent and in one of them he says all my friends who know me know how backward i am to write letters and never impute the negligence of my hand to the coldness of my heart i send you a copy of the last letter which she had from him she never heard that he had any intention of going into holy orders from this late interview with his sister i think much more favorably of him as i hope you will i am eager to see more of your prefaces to the poets i solace myself with the few proofsheets which i have  i send another parcel of lord hailess annals which you will please to return to me as soon as you conveniently can he says he wishes you would cut a little deeper but he may be proud that there is so little occasion to use the critical knife  i ever am my dear sir your faithful and affectionate humble servant james boswell   mr langton has been pleased at my request to favor me with some particulars of dr johnsons visit to warleycamp where this gentleman was at the time stationed as a captain in the lincolnshire militia i shall give them in his own words in a letter to me  it was in the summer of the year      that he complied with my invitation to come down to the camp at warley and he staid with me about a week the scene appeared notwithstanding a great degree of ill health that he seemed to labor under to interest and amuse him as agreeing with the disposition that i believe you know he constantly manifested toward enquiring into subjects of the military kind he sat with a patient degree of attention to observe the proceedings of a regimental court martial that happened to be called in the time of his stay with us and one night as late as at eleven oclock he accompanied the major of the regiment in going what are styled the rounds where he might observe the forms of visiting the guards for the seeing that they and their sentries are ready in their duty on their several posts he took occasion to converse at times on military topics one in particular that i see the mention of in your journal of a tour to the hebrides which lies open before me third edition p      as to gunpowder which he spoke of to the same effect in part that you relate  on one occasion when the regiment were going through their exercise he went quite close to the men at one of the extremities of it and watched all their practices attentively and when he came away his remark was the men indeed do load their muskets and fire with wonderful celerity he was likewise particular in requiring to know what was the weight of the musquetballs in use and within what distance they might be expected to take effect when fired off  in walking among the tents and observing the difference between those of the officers and private men he said that the superiority of accommodation of the better conditions of life to that of the inferior ones was never exhibited to him in so distinct a view the civilities paid to him in the camp were from the gentlemen of the lincolnshire regiment one of the officers of which accommodated him with a tent in which he slept and from general hall who very courteously invited him to dine with him where he appeared to be very well pleased with his entertainment and the civilities he received on the part of the general when i one day at court expressed to general hall my sense of the honor he had done my friend he politely answered sir i did myself honor  the attention likewise of the generals aiddecamp captain smith seemed to be very welcome to him as appeared by their engaging in a great deal of discourse together the gentlemen of the east york regiment likewise on being informed of his coming solicited his company at dinner but by that time he had fixed his departure so that he could not comply with the invitation  to james boswell esquire dear sir i have received two letters from you of which the second complains of the neglect shown to the first you must not tie your friends to such punctual correspondence you have all possible assurances of my affection and esteem and there ought to be no need of reiterated professions when it may happen that i can give you either counsel or comfort i hope it will never happen to me that i should neglect you but you must not think me criminal or cold if i say nothing when i have nothing to say  you are now happy enough mrs boswell is recovered and i congratulate you upon the probability of her long life if general approbation will add any thing to your enjoyment i can tell you that i have heard you mentioned as a man whom every body likes i think life has little more to give   has gone to his regiment he has laid down his coach and talks of making more contractions of his expense how he will succeed i know not it is difficult to reform a household gradually it may be better done by a system totally new i am afraid he has always something to hide when we pressed him to go to  he objected the necessity of attending his navigation yet he could talk of going to aberdeen a place not much nearer his navigation i believe he cannot bear the thought of living at  in a state of diminution and of appearing among the gentlemen of the neighborhood shorn of his beams this is natural but it is cowardly what i told him of the increasing expense of a growing family seems to have struck him he certainly had gone on with very confused views and we have i think shown him that he is wrong though with the common deficience of advisers we have not shown him how to do right  i wish you would a little correct or restrain your imagination and imagine that happiness such as life admits may be had at other places as well as london without asserting stoicism it may be said that it is our business to exempt ourselves as much as we can from the power of external things there is but one solid basis of happiness and that is the reasonable hope of a happy futurity this may be had every where  i do not blame your preference of london to other places for it is really to be preferred if the choice is free but few have the choice of their place or their manner of life and mere pleasure ought not to be the prime motive of action  mrs thrale poor thing has a daughter mr thrale dislikes the times like the rest of us mrs williams is sick mrs desmoulins is poor i have miserable nights nobody is well but mr levett  i am dear sir your most etc sam johnson london july         in the course of this year there was a difference between him and his friend mr strahan the particulars of which it is unnecessary to relate their reconciliation was communicated to me in a letter from mr strahan in the following words  the notes i showed you that past between him and me were dated in march last the matter lay dormant till july    when he wrote to me as follows to wlliam strahan esquire sir it would be very foolish for us to continue strangers any longer you can never by persistency make wrong right if i resented too acrimoniously i resented only to yourself nobody ever saw or heard what i wrote you saw that my anger was over for in a day or two i came to your house i have given you longer time and i hope you have made so good use of it as to be no longer on evil terms with  sir your etc sam johnson   on this i called upon him and he has since dined with me  after this time the same friendship as formerly continued between dr johnson and mr strahan my friend mentioned to me a little circumstance of his attention which though we may smile at it must be allowed to have its foundation in a nice and true knowledge of human life when i write to scotland said he i employ strahan to frank my letters that he may have the consequence of appearing a parliament man among his countrymen  to captain langton dr johnson here addresses his worthy friend bennet langton esquire by his title as a captain of the lincolnshire militia  at warley camp dear sir when i recollect how long ago i was received with so much kindness at warley common i am ashamed that i have not made some enquiries after my friends  pray how many sheepstealers did you convict and how did you punish them when are you to be cantoned in better habitations the air grows cold and the ground damp longer stay in the camp cannot be without much danger to the health of the common men if even the officers can escape  you see that dr percy is now dean of carlisle about five hundred a year with a power of presenting himself to some good living he is provided for  the session of the club is to commence with that of the parliament mr banks desires to be admitted he will be a very honorable accession  did the king please you the coxheath men i think have some reason to complain reynolds says your camp is better than theirs  i hope you find yourself able to encounter this weather take care of your own health and as you can of your men be pleased to make my compliments to all the gentlemen whose notice i have had and whose kindness i have experienced  i am dear sir your most humble servant sam johnson oct          i wrote to him on the   th of august the   th of september and the  th of november informing him of my having had another son born whom i had called james that i had passed some time at auchinleck that the countess of loudoun now in her ninetyninth year was as fresh as when he saw her and remembered him with respect and that his mother by adoption the countess of eglintoune had said to me tell mr johnson i love him exceedingly that i had again suffered much from bad spirits and that as it was very long since i heard from him i was not a little uneasy  the continuance of his regard for his friend dr burney appears from the following letters to the reverend dr wheeler oxford dear sir dr burney who brings this paper is engaged in a history of music and having been told by dr markham of some mss relating to his subject which are in the library of your college is desirous to examine them he is my friend and therefore i take the liberty of entreating your favor and assistance in his enquiry and can assure you with great confidence that if you knew him he would not want any intervenient solicitation to obtain the kindness of one who loves learning and virtue as you love them  i have been flattering myself all the summer with the hope of paying my annual visit to my friends but something has obstructed me i still hope not to be long without seeing you i should be glad of a little literary talk and glad to show you by the frequency of my visits how eagerly i love it when you talk it  london nov        i am dear sir your most humble servant sam johnson   to the reverend dr edwards oxford sir the bearer dr burney has had some account of a welsh manuscript in the bodleian library from which he hopes to gain some materials for his history of music but being ignorant of the language is at a loss where to find assistance i make no doubt but you sir can help him through his difficulties and therefore take the liberty of recommending him to your favor as i am sure you will find him a man worthy of every civility that can be shown and every benefit that can be conferred  but we must not let welsh drive us from greek what comes of xenophon if you do not like the trouble of publishing the book do not let your commentaries be lost contrive that they may be published somewhere  i am sir your humble servant sam johnson london nov           these letters procured dr burney great kindness and friendly offices from both of these gentlemen not only on that occasion but in future visits to the university the same year dr johnson not only wrote to dr joseph warton in favor of dr burneys youngest son who was to be placed in the college there but accompanied him to winchester when he went thither  we surely cannot but admire the benevolent exertions of this great and good man especially when we consider how grievously he was afflicted with bad health and how uncomfortable his home was made by the perpetual jarring of those whom he charitably accommodated under his roof he has sometimes suffered me to talk jocularly of his groupe of females and call them his seraglio he thus mentions them together with honest levett in one of his letters to mrs thrale vol ii page     williams hates every body levett hates desmoulins and does not love williams desmoulins hates them both poll miss carmichael loves none of them  to james boswell esquire dear sir it is indeed a long time since i wrote and i think you have some reason to complain however you must not let small things disturb you when you have such a fine addition to your happiness as a new boy and i hope your ladys health restored by bringing him it seems very probable that a little care will now restore her if any remains of her complaints are left  you seem if i understand your letter to be gaining ground at auchinleck an incident that would give me great delight  when any fit of anxiety or gloominess or perversion of mind lays hold upon you make it a rule not to publish it by complaints but exert your whole care to hide it by endeavoring to hide it you will drive it away be always busy  the club is to meet with the parliament we talk of electing banks the traveller he will be a reputable member  langton has been encamped with his company of militia on warleycommon i spent five days amongst them he signalized himself as a diligent officer and has very high respect in the regiment he presided when i was there at a court martial he is now quartered in hertfordshire his lady and little ones are in scotland paoli came to the camp and commended the soldiers  of myself i have no great matter to say my health is not restored my nights are restless and tedious the best night that i have had these twenty years was at fortaugustus  i hope soon to send you a few lives to read  i am dear sir your most affectionate sam johnson nov          about this time mr john hussy who had been some time in trade and is now a clergyman of the church of england being about to undertake a journey to aleppo and other parts of the east which he accomplished dr johnson honored him with the following letter to mr john hussy dear sir i have sent you the grammar and have left you two books more by which i hope to be remembered write my name in them we may perhaps see each other no more you part with my good wishes nor do i despair of seeing you return let no opportunities of vice corrupt you let no bad example seduce you let the blindness of mahometans confirm you in christianity  god bless you  i am dear sir your affectionate humble servant sam johnson dec            johnson this year expressed great satisfaction at the publication of the first volume of discourses to the royal academy by sir joshua reynolds whom he always considered as one of his literary school much praise indeed is due to those excellent discourses which are so universally admired and for which the author lately received from the empress of russia a gold   notwithstanding all my anxious attention to chronological order i find that i have ascribed to this year see page     the publication of his prefaces to the poets which in fact came out early in the next year snuff box adorned with her profile in bas relief set in diamonds and containing what is infinitely more valuable a slip of paper on which are written with her imperial majestys own hand the following words pour le chevalier reynolds en temoignage du contentement que jai ressentie a la lecture de ses excellens discourse sur la peinture  lives of the poets  on the   d of january i wrote to him on several topics and mentioned that as he had been so good as to permit me to have the proof sheets of his lives of the poets i had written to his servant francis to take care of them for me  mr boswell to dr johnson my dear sir edinburgh feb        garricks death is a striking event not that we should be surprised with the death of any man who has lived sixtytwo years but because there was a vivacity in our late celebrated friend which drove away the thoughts of death from any association with him i am sure you will be tenderly affected with his departure and i would wish to hear from you upon the subject i was obliged to him in my days of effervescence in london when poor derrick was my governor and since that time i received many civilities from him do you remember how pleasing it was when i received a letter from him at inverary upon our first return to civilized living after our hebridean journey i shall always remember him with affection as well as admiration  on saturday last being the  0th of january i drank coffee and old port and had solemn conversation with the reverend mr falconer a nonjuring bishop a very learned and worthy man he gave two toasts which you will believe i drank with cordiality dr samuel johnson and flora macdonald i sat about four hours with him and it was really as if i had been living in the last century the episcopal church of scotland though faithful to the royal house of stuart has never accepted of any conge delire since the revolution it is the only true episcopal church in scotland as it has its own succession of bishops for as to the episcopal clergy who take the oaths to the present government they indeed follow the rites of the church of england but as bishop falconer observed they are not episcopals for they are under no bishop as a bishop cannot have authority beyond his diocese    any fresh instance of the uncertainty of life makes one embrace more closely a valuable friend my dear and much respected sir may god preserve you long in this world while i am in it  i am ever your much obliged and affectionate humble servant james boswell   on the   d of february i wrote to him again complaining of his silence as i had heard he was ill and had written to mr thrale for information concerning him and i announced my intention of soon being again in london  to james boswell esquire dear sir why should you take such delight to make a bustle to write to mr thrale that i am negligent and to francis to do what is so very unnecessary thrale you may be sure cared not about it and i shall spare francis the trouble by ordering a set both of the lives and poets to dear mrs boswell he sent a set elegantly bound and gilt which was received as a very handsome present  in acknowledgement of her marmalade persuade her to accept them and accept them kindly if i thought she would receive them scornfully i would send them to miss boswell who i hope has yet none of her mammas ill will to me  i would send sets of lives four volumes to some other friends to lord hailes first his second volume lies by my bedside a book surely of great labor and to every just thinker of great delight write me word to whom i shall send besides would it please lord auchinleck mrs thrale waits in the coach  march         i am dear sir etc sam johnson   this letter crossed me on the road to london where i arrived on monday march    and next morning at a late hour found dr johnson sitting over his tea attended by mrs desmoulins mr levett and a clergyman who had come to submit some poetical pieces to his revision it is wonderful what a number and variety of writers some of them even unknown to him prevailed on his goodnature to look over their works and suggest corrections and improvements my arrival interrupted for a little while the important business of this true representative of bays upon its being resumed i found that the subject under immediate consideration was a translation yet in manuscript of the carmen seculare of horace which had this year been set to music and performed as a public entertainment in london for the joint benefit of monsieur philidor and signor baretti when johnson had done reading the author asked him bluntly if upon the whole it was a good translation johnson whose regard for truth was uncommonly strict seemed to be puzzled for a moment what answer to make as he certainly could not honestly commend the performance with exquisite address he evaded the question thus sir i do not say that it may not be made a very good translation here nothing whatever in favor of the performance was affirmed and yet the writer was not shocked a printed ode to the warlike genius of britain came next in review the bard was a lank bony figure with short black hair he was writhing himself in agitation while johnson read and showing his teeth in a grin of earnestness exclaimed in broken sentences and in a keen sharp tone is that poetry sir  is it pindar johnson why sir there is here a great deal of what is called poetry then turning to me the poet cried my muse has not been long upon the town and pointing to the ode it trembles under the hand of the great critic johnson in a tone of displeasure asked him why do you praise anson i did not trouble him by asking his reason for this question he proceeded here is an error sir you have made genius feminine  palpable sir cried the enthusiast i know it but in a lower tone it was to pay a compliment to the duchess of devonshire with which her grace was pleased she is walking across coxheath in the military uniform and i suppose her to be the genius of britain johnson sir you are giving a reason for it but that will not make it right you may have a reason why two and two should make five but they will still make but four  although i was several times with him in the course of the following days such it seems were my occupations or such my negligence that i have preserved no memorial of his conversation till friday march    when i visited him he said he expected to be attacked on account of his lives of the poets however said he i would rather be attacked than unnoticed for the worst thing you can do to an author is to be silent as to his works an assault upon a town is a bad thing but starving it is still worse an assault may be unsuccessful you may have more men killed than you kill but if you starve the town you are sure of a victory  talking of a friend of ours associating with persons of very discordant principles and characters i said he was a very universal man quite a man of the world johnson yes sir but one may be so much a man of the world as to be nothing in the world i remember a passage in goldsmiths vicar of wakefield which he was afterward fool enough to expunge i do not love a man who is zealous for nothing boswell that was a fine passage johnson yes sir there was another fine passage too which he struck out when i was a young man being anxious to distinguish myself i was perpetually starting new propositions but i soon gave this over for i found that generally what was new was false i said i did not like to sit with people of whom i had not a good opinion johnson but you must not indulge your delicacy too much or you will be a tete a tete man all your life  during my stay in london this spring i find i was unaccountably negligent in preserving johnsons sayings more so than at any time when i was happy enough to have an opportunity of hearing his wisdom and wit there is no help for it now i must content myself with presenting such scraps as i have but i am nevertheless ashamed and vexed to think how much has been lost it is not that there was a bad crop this year but that i was not sufficiently careful in gathering it in i therefore in some instances can only exhibit a few detached fragments  talking of the wonderful concealment of the author of the celebrated letters signed junius he said i should have believed burke to be junius because i know no man but burke who is capable of writing these letters but burke spontaneously denied it to me the case would have been different had i asked him if he was the author a man so questioned as to an anonymous publication may think he has a right to deny it  he observed that his old friend mr sheridan had been honored with extraordinary attention in his own country by having had an exception made in his favor in an irish act of parliament concerning insolvent debtors to be thus singled out said he by a legislature as an object of public consideration and kindness is a proof of no common merit  at streatham on monday march    at breakfast he maintained that a father had no right to control the inclinations of his daughters in marriage  on wednesday march    when i visited him and confessed an excess of which i had very seldom been guilty that i had spent a whole night in playing at cards and that i could not look back on it with satisfaction instead of a harsh animadversion he mildly said alas sir on how few things can we look back with satisfaction  on thursday april   he commended one of the dukes of devonshire for a dogged veracity see p     of this volume  he said too london is nothing to some peoples but to a man whose pleasure is intellectual london is the place and there is no place where economy can be so well practiced as in london more can be had here for the money even by ladies than any where else you cannot play tricks with your fortune in a small place you must make an uniform appearance here a lady may have wellfurnished apartments and elegant dress without any meat in her kitchen  i was amused by considering with how much ease and coolness he could write or talk to a friend exhorting him not to suppose that happiness was not to be found as well in other places as in london when he himself was at all times sensible of its being comparatively speaking a heaven upon earth the truth is that by those who from sagacity attention and experience have learnt the full advantage of london its preeminence over every other place not only for variety of enjoyment but for comfort will befelt with a philosophical exultation the freedom from remark and petty censure with which life may be passed there is a circircumstance which a man who knows the teizing restraint of a narrow circle must relish highly mr burke whose orderly and amiable domestic habits might make the eye of observation less irksome to him than to most men said once very pleasantly in my hearing though i have the honor to represent bristol i should not like to live there i should be obliged to be so much upon my good behavior in london a man may live in splendid society at one time and in frugal retirement another without animadversion there and there alone a mans own house is truly his castle in which he can be in perfect safety from intrusion whenever he pleases i never shall forget how well this was expressed to me one day by mr meynell the chief advantage of london said he is that a man is always so near his burrow  he said of one of his old acquaintances he is very fit for a traveling governor he knows french very well he is a man of good principles and there would be no danger that a young gentleman should catch his manner for it is so very bad that it must be avoided in that respect he would be like the drunken helot  on friday april   being good friday i visited him in the morning as usual and finding that we insensibly fell into a train of ridicule upon the foibles of one of our friends a very worthy man i by way of a check quoted some good admonition from the government of the tongue that very pious book it happened also remarkably enough that the subject of the sermon preached to us today by dr burrows the rector of st clement danes upon the certainty that at the last day we must give an account of the deeds done in the body and amongst various acts of culpability he mentioned evilspeaking as we were moving slowly along in the crowd from church johnson jogged my elbow and said did you attend to the sermon  yes sir said i it was very applicable to us he however stood upon the defensive why sir the sense of ridicule is given us and may be lawfully used the author of the government of the tongue would have us to treat all men alike  in the interval between morning and evening service he endeavored to employ himself earnestly in devotional exercises and as he has mentioned in his prayers and meditations page     gave me les pensees de pascal that i might not interrupt him i preserve the book with reverence his presenting it to me is marked upon it with his own hand and i have found in it a truly divine unction we went to church again in the afternoon  on saturday april   i visited him at night and found him sitting in mrs williamss room with her and one who he afterward told me was a natural son of the second lord southwell the table had a singular appearance being covered with a heterogeneous assemblage of oysters and porter for his company and tea for himself i mentioned my having heard an eminent physician who was himself a christian argue in favor of universal toleration and maintain that no man could be hurt by another mans differing from him in opinion johnson sir you are to a certain degree hurt by knowing that even one man does not believe  on easter day after solemn service at st pauls i dined with him mr allen the printer was also his guest he was uncommonly silent and i have not written down any thing except a single curious fact which having the sanction of his inflexible veracity may be received as a striking instance of human insensibility and inconsideration as he was passing by a fishmonger who was skinning an eel alive he heard him curse it because it would not lie still  on wednesday april   i dined with him at sir joshua reynoldss i have not marked what company was there johnson harangued upon the qualities of different liquors and spoke with great contempt of claret as so weak that a man would be drowned by it before it made him drunk he was persuaded to drink one glass of it that he might judge not from recollection which might be dim but from immediate sensation he shook his head and said poor stuff no sir claret is the liquor for boys port for men but he who aspires to be a hero smiling must drink brandy in the first place the flavor of brandy is most grateful to the palate and then brandy will do soonest for a man what drinking can do for him there are ndeed few who are able to drink brandy that is a power rather to be wished for than attained and yet proceeded he as in all pleasure hope is a considerable part i know not but fruition comes too quick by brandy florence wine i think the worst it is wine only to the eye it is wine neither while you are drinking it nor after you have drunk it it neither pleases the taste nor exhilarates the spirits i reminded him how heartily he and i used to drink wine together when we were first acquainted and how i used to have a headache after sitting up with him he did not like to have this recalled or perhaps thinking that i boasted improperly resolved to have a witty stroke at me nay sir it was not the wine that made your head ache but the sense that i put into it boswell what sir will sense make the head ache johnson yes sir with a smile when it is not used to it no man who has a true relish of pleasantry could be offended at this especially if johnson in a long intimacy had given him repeated proofs of his regard and good estimation i used to say that as he had given me a thousand pounds in praise he had a good right now and then to take a guinea from me  on thursday april   i dined with him at mr allan ramsays with lord graham and some other company we talked of shakspeares witches johnson they are beings of his own creation they are a compound of malignity and meanness without any abilities and are quite different from the italian magician king james says in his daemonology magicians command the devils witches are their servants the italian magicians are elegant beings ramsay opera witches not drury lane witches johnson observed that abilities might be employed in a narrow sphere as in getting money which he said he believed no man could do without vigorous parts though concentrated to a point ramsay yes like a strong horse in a mill he pulls better  lord graham while he praised the beauty of lochlomond on the banks of which is his family seat complained of the climate and said he could not bear it johnson nay my lord dont talk so you may bear it well enough your ancestors have borne it more years than i can tell this was a handsome compliment to the antiquity of the house of montrose his lordship told me afterward that he had only affected to complain of the climate lest if he had spoken as favorably of his country as he really thought dr johnson might have attacked it johnson was very courteous to lady margaret macdonald madam said he when i was in the isle of sky i heard of the people running to take the stones off the road lest lady margarets horse should stumble  lord graham commended dr drummond at naples as a man of extraordinary talents and added that he had a great love of liberty johnson he is young my lord looking to his lordship with an arch smile all boys love liberty till experience convinces them they are not so fit to govern themselves as they imagined we are all agreed as to our own liberty we would have as much of it as we can get but we are not agreed as to the liberty of others for in proportion as we take others must lose i believe we hardly wish that the mob should have liberty to govern us when that was the case some time ago no man was at liberty not to have candles in his windows ramsay the result is that order is better than confusion johnson the result is that order cannot be had but by subordination  on friday april    i had been present at the trial of the unfortunate mr hackman who in a fit of frantic jealous love had shot miss ray the favorite of a nobleman johnson in whose company i dined today with some other friends was much interested by my account of what passed and particularly with his prayer for the mercy of heaven he said in a solemn fervid tone i hope he shall find mercy  this day a violent altercation arose between johnson and beauclerk which having made much noise at the time i think it proper in order to prevent any future misrepresentation to give a minute account of it  in talking of hackman johnson argued as judge blackstone had done that his being furnished with two pistols was a proof that he meant to shoot two persons mr beauclerk said no for that every wise man who intended to shoot himself took two pistols that he might be sure of doing it at once lord  s cook shot himself with one pistol and lived ten days in great agony mr  who loved buttered muffins but durst not eat them because they disagreed with his stomach resolved to shoot himself and then he eat three buttered muffins for breakfast before shooting himself knowing that he should not be troubled with indigestion he had two charged pistols one was found lying charged upon the table by him after he had shot himself with the other  well said johnson with an air of triumph you see here one pistol was sufficient beauclerk replied smartly because it happened to kill him and either then or a very little afterward being piqued at johnsons triumphant remark added this is what you dont know and i do there was then a cessation of the dispute and some minutes intervened during which dinner and the glass went on cheerfully when johnson suddenly and abruptly exclaimed mr beauclerk how came you to talk so petulantly to me as this is what you dont know but what i know one thing i know which you dont seem to know that you are very uncivil beauclerk because you began by being uncivil which you always are the words in parenthesis were i believe not heard by dr johnson here again there was a cessation of arms johnson told me that the reason why he waited some time at first without taking any notice of what mr beauclerk said was because he was thinking whether he should resent it but when he considered that there were present a young lord and an eminent traveller two men of the world with whom he had never dined before he was apprehensive that they might think they had a right to take such liberties with him as beauclerk did and therefore resolved he would not let it pass adding that he would not appear a coward a little while after this the conversation turned on the violence of hackmans temper johnson then said it was his business to command his temper as my friend mr beauclerk should have done some time time ago beauclerk i should learn of you sir johnson sir you have given me opportunities enough of learning when i have been in your company no man loves to be treated with contempt beauclerk with a polite inclination toward johnson sir you have known me twenty years and however i may have treated others you may be sure i could never treat you with contempt johnson sir you have said more than was necessary thus it ended and beauclerks coach not having come for him till very late dr johnson and another gentleman sat with him a long time after the rest of the company were gone and he and i dined at beauclerks on the saturday sennight following  after this tempest had subsided i recollect the following particulars of his conversation  i am always for getting a boy forward in his learning for that is a sure good i would let him at first read any english book which happens to engage his attention because you have done a great deal when you have brought him to have entertainment from a book he will get better books afterward  mallet i believe never wrote a single line of his projected life of the duke of marlborough he groped for materials and thought of it till he had exhausted his mind thus it sometimes happens that men entangle themselves in their own schemes  to be contradicted in order to force you to talk is mighty unpleasing you shine indeed but it is by being ground  of a gentleman who made some figure among the literati of his time he said what eminence he had was by a felicity of manner he had no more learning than what he could not help  on saturday april    i dined with him at mr beauclerks with sir joshua reynolds mr jones now sir william mr langton mr steevens mr paradise and dr higgins i mentioned that a mr wilkes had attached garrick to me as a man who had no friend johnson i believe he is right sir   he had friends but no friend garrick was so diffused he had no man to whom he wished to unbosom himself he found people always ready to applaud him and that always for the same thing so he saw life with great uniformity i took upon me for once to fight with goliaths weapons and play the sophist  garrick did not need a friend as he got from every body all he wanted what is a friend one who supports you and comforts you while others do not friendship you know sir is the cordial drop to make the nauseous draught of life go down but if the draught be not nauseous if it be all sweet there is no occasion for that drop johnson many men would not be content to live so i hope i should not they would wish to have an intimate friend with whom they might compare minds and cherish private virtues one of the company mentioned lord chesterfield as a man who had no friend johnson there were more materials to make friendship in garrick had he not been so diffused boswell garrick was pure gold but beat out to thin leaf lord chesterfield was tinsel johnson garrick was a very good man the cheerfullest man of his age a decent liver in a profession which is supposed to give indulgence to licentiousness and a man who gave away freely money acquired by himself he began the world with a great hunger for money the son of a halfpay officer bred in a family whose study was to make fourpence do as much as others made fourpence halfpenny do but when he had got money he was very liberal  i presumed to animadvert on his eulogy on garrick in his lives of the poets you say sir his death eclipsed the gaiety of nations johnson i could not have said more nor less it is the truth eclipsed not extinguished and his death did eclipse it was like a storm boswell but why nations did his gaiety extend farther than his own nation johnson why sir some exaggeration must be allowed besides nations may be said if we allow the scotch to be a nation and to have gaiety which they have not you are an exception though come gentlemen let us heartily admit that there is one scotchman who is cheerful beauclerk but he is a very unnatural scotchman i however continued to think the compliment to garrick hyperbolically untrue his acting had ceased some time before his death at any rate he had acted in ireland but a short time at an early period of his life and never in scotland i objected also to what appears an anticlymax of praise when contrasted with the preceding panegyric  and diminished the public stock of harmless pleasure  is not harmless pleasure very tame johnson nay sir harmless pleasure is the highest praise pleasure is a word of dubious import pleasure is in general dangerous and pernicious to virtue to be able therefore to furnish pleasure that is harmless pleasure pure and unalloyed is as great a power as man can possess this was perhaps as ingenious a defense as could be made still however i was not satisfied  a celebrated wit being mentioned he said one may say of him as was said of a french wit il na de lesprit que contre dieu i have been several times in company with him but never perceived any strong power of wit he produces a general effect by various means he has a cheerful countenance and a gay voice besides his trade is wit it would be as wild in him to come into company without merriment as for a highwayman to take the road without his pistols  talking of the effects of drinking he said drinking may be practiced with great prudence a man who exposes himself when he is intoxicated has not the art of getting drunk a sober man who happens occasionally to get drunk readily enough goes into a new company which a man who has been drinking should never do such a man will undertake any thing he is without skill in inebriation i used to slink home when i had drunk too much a man accustomed to selfexamination will be conscious when he is drunk though an habitual drunkard will not be conscious of it i knew a physician who for twenty years was not sober yet in a pamphlet which he wrote upon fevers he appealed to garrick and me for his vindication from a charge of drunkenness a bookseller naming him who got a large fortune by trade was so habitually and equably drunk that his most intimate friends never perceived that he was more sober at one time than another  talking of celebrated and successful irregular practisers in physic he said tailor was the most ignorant man i ever knew but sprightly ward the dullest tailor challenged me once to talk latin with him laughing i quoted some of horace which he took to be a part of my own speech he said a few words well enough beauclerk i remember sir you said that tailor was an instance how far impudence could carry ignorance mr beauclerk was very entertaining this day and told us a number of short stories in a lively elegant manner and with that air of the world which has i know not what impressive effect as if there were something more than is expressed or than perhaps we could perfectly understand as johnson and i accompanied sir joshua reynolds in his coach johnson said there is in beauclerk a predominance over his company that one does not like but he is a man who has lived so much in the world that he has a short story on every occasion he is always ready to talk and is never exhausted  johnson and i passed the evening at miss reynoldss sir joshuas sister i mentioned that an eminent friend of ours talking of the common remark that affection descends said that this was wisely contrived for the preservation of mankind for which it was not so necessary that there should be affection from children to parents as from parents to children nay there would be no harm in that view though children should at a certain age eat their parents johnson but sir if this were known generally to be the case parents would not have affection for children boswell true sir for it is in expectation of a return that parents are so attentive to their children and i know a very pretty instance of a little girl of whom her father was very fond who once when he was in a melancholy fit and had gone to bed persuaded him to rise in good humor by saying my dear papa please to get up and let me help you on with your clothes that i may learn to do it when you are an old man  soon after this time a little incident occurred which i will not suppress because i am desirous that my work should be as much as is consistent with the strictest truth an antidote to the false and injurious notions of his character which have been given by others and therefore i infuse every drop of genuine sweetness into my biographical cup  to dr johnson my dear sir i am in great pain with an inflamed foot and obliged to keep my bed so am prevented from having the pleasure to dine at mr ramsays today which is very hard and my spirits are sadly sunk will you be so friendly as to come and sit an hour with me in the evening  i am ever your most faithful and affectionate humble servant james boswell south audleystreet monday april     to mr boswell mr johnson laments the absence of mr boswell and will come to him  harleystreet  he came to me in the evening and brought sir joshua reynolds i need scarcely say that their conversation while they sat by my bedside was the most pleasing opiate to pain that could have been administered  johnson being now better disposed to obtain information concerning pope than he was last year see p   0 of this volume  sent by me to my lord marchmont a present of those volumes of his lives of the poets which were at this time published with a request to have permission to wait on him and his lordship who had called on him twice obligingly appointed saturday the first of may for receiving us  on that morning johnson came to me from streatham and after drinking chocolate at general paolis in southaudleystreet we proceeded to lord marchmonts in curzonstreet his lordship met us at the door of his library and with great politeness said to johnson i am not going to make an encomium upon myself by telling you the high respect i have for you sir johnson was exceedingly courteous and the interview which lasted about two hours during which the earl communicated his anecdotes of pope was as agreeable as i could have wished when we came out i said to johnson that considering his lordships civility i should have been vexed if he had again failed to come sir said he i would rather have given twenty pounds than not have come i accompanied him to streatham where we dined and returned to town in the evening  on monday may   i dined with him at mr dillys i pressed him this day for his opinion on the passage in parnell concerning which i had in vain questioned him in several letters and at length obtained it in due form of law case for dr johnsons opinion  d of may      parnell in his hermit has the following passage  to clear this doubt to know the world by sight to find if books and swains report it right for yet by swains alone the world he knew whose feet came wandering over the nightly dew is there not a contradiction in its being first supposed that the hermit knew both what books and swains reported of the world yet afterward said that he knew it by swains alone  i think it an inaccuracy  he mentions two instructors in the first line and says he had only one in the next  this evening i set out for scotland  to mrs lucy porter in lichfield dear madam mr green has informed me that you are much better i hope i need not tell you that i am glad of it i cannot boast of being much better my old nocturnal complaint still pursues me and my respiration is difficult though much easier than when i left you the summer before last mr and mrs thrale are well miss has been a little indisposed but she is got well again they have since the loss of their boy had two daughters but they seem likely to want a son  i hope you had some books which i sent you i was sorry for poor mrs adeys death and am afraid you will be sometimes solitary but endeavor whether alone or in company to keep yourself cheerful my friends likewise die very fast but such is the state of man  i am dear love your most humble servant sam johnson may         he had before i left london resumed the conversation concerning the appearance of a ghost at newcastle upon tyne which mr john wesley believed but to which johnson did not give credit i was however desirous to examine the question closely and at the same time wished to be made acquainted with mr john wesley for though i differed from him in some points i admired his various talents and loved his pious zeal at my request therefore dr johnson gave me a letter of introduction to him  to the reverend mr john wesley sir mr boswell a gentleman who has been long known to me is desirous of being known to you and has asked this recommendation which i give him with great willingness because i think it very much to be wished that worthy and religious men should be acquainted with each other  i am sir your most humble servant sam johnson may         mr wesley being in the course of his ministry at edinburgh i presented this letter to him and was very politely received i begged to have it returned to me which was accordingly done his state of the evidence as to the ghost did not satisfy me  i did not write to johnson as usual upon my return to my family but tried how he would be affected by my silence mr dilly sent me a copy of a note which he received from him on the   th of july in these words to mr dilly sir since mr boswells departure i have never heard from him please to send word what you know of him and whether you have sent my books to his lady  i am etc sam johnson     my readers will not doubt that his solicitude about me was very flattering  to james boswell esquire dear sir what can possibly have happened that keeps us two such strangers to each other i expected to have heard from you when you came home i expected afterward i went into the country and returned and yet there is no letter from mr boswell no ill i hope has happened and if ill should happen why should it be concealed from him who loves you is it a fit of humor that has disposed you to try who can hold out longest without writing if it be you have the victory but i am afraid of something bad set me free from my suspicions  my thoughts are at present employed in guessing the reason of your silence you must not expect that i should tell you any thing if i had any thing to tell write pray write to me and let me know what is or what has been the cause of this long interruption  july         i am dear sir your most affectionate humble servant sam johnson   to dr samuel johnson my dear sir edinburgh july         what may be justly denominated a supine indolence of mind has been my state of existence since i last returned to scotland in a livelier state i had often suffered severely from long intervals of silence on your part and i had even been chid by you for expressing my uneasiness i was willing to take advantage of my insensibility and while i could bear the experiment to try whether your affection for me would after an unusual silence on my part make you write first this afternoon i have had very high satisfaction by receiving your kind letter of inquiry for which i most gratefully thank you i am doubtful if it was right to make the experiment though i have gained by it i was beginning to grow tender and to upbraid myself especially after having dreamt two nights ago that i was with you i and my wife and my four children are all well i would not delay one post to answer your letter but as it is late i have not time to do more you shall soon hear from me upon many and various particulars and i shall never again put you to any test  i ever am with veneration my dear sir your much obliged and faithful humble servant james boswell   on the   d of july i wrote to him again and gave him an account of my last interview with my worthy friend mr edward dilly at his brothers house at southill in bedfordshire where he died soon after i parted from him leaving me a very kind remembrance of his regard  i informed him that lord hailes who had promised to furnish him with some anecdotes for his lives of the poets had sent me three instances of priors borrowing from gombauld in recueil des poets tome   epigram to john i owed great obligation p    to the duke of noailles p    sauntering jack and idle joan p     my letter was a pretty long one and contained a variety of particulars but he it would seem had not attended to it for his next to me was as follows to james boswell esquire my dear sir are you playing the same trick again and trying who can keep silence longest remember that all tricks are either knavish or childish and that it is as foolish to make experiments upon the constancy of a friend as upon the chastity of a wife  what can be the cause of this second fit of silence i cannot conjecture but after one trick i will not be cheated by another nor will harrass my thoughts with conjectures about the motives of a man who probably acts only by caprice i therefore suppose you are well and that mrs boswell is well too and that the fine summer has restored lord auchinleck i am much better than you left me i think i am better than when i was in scotland  i forgot whether i informed you that poor thrale has been in great danger mrs thrale likewise has miscarried and been much indisposed every body else is well langton is in camp i intend to put lord hailess description of dryden which i communicated to him from his lordship but it has not yet been published i have a copy of it into another edition and as i know his accuracy wish he would consider the dates which i could not always settle to my own mind  mr thrale goes to brighthelmston about michaelmas to be jolly and ride a hunting i shall go to town or perhaps to oxford exercise and gaiety or rather carelessness will i hope dissipate all remains of his malady and i likewise hope by the change of place to find some opportunities of growing yet better myself  i am dear sir your humble servant sam johnson streatham sept           my readers will not be displeased at being told every slight circumstance of the manner in which dr johnson contrived to amuse his solitary hours he sometimes employed himself in chemistry sometimes in watering and pruning a vine and sometimes in small experiments at which those who may smile should recollect that there are moments which admit of being soothed only by trifles in one of his manuscript diaries there is the following entry which marks his curious minute attention aug        partem brachii dextri carpo proximam et cuem pectoris  maxillam dxtram rasi ut notum fieret quanto temporis pili renovarentur  another of the same kind appears july         i shaved my nail by accident in whetting the knife about an eighth of an inch from the bottom and about a fourth from the top this i measure that i may know the growth of nails the whole is about five eighths of an inch  and aug         i cut from the vine    leaves which weighed five oz and a half and eight scruples  i lay them upon my bookcase to see what weight they will lose by drying     on the  0th of september i defended myself against his suspicion of me which i did not deserve and i added pray let us write frequently a whim strikes me that we should each send off a sheet once a week like a stagecoach whether it be full or not nay though it should be empty the very sight of your handwriting would comfort me and were a sheet to be thus sent regularly we should much oftener convey something were it only a few kind words  my friend colonel james stuart second son of the earl of bute who had distinguished himself as a good officer of the bedfordshire militia had taken a publickspirited resolution to serve his country in its difficulties by raising a regular regiment and taking the command of it himself this in the heir of the immense property of wortley was highly honorable having been in scotland recruiting he obligingly asked me to accompany him to leeds then the headquarters of his corpse from thence to london for a short time and afterward to other places to which the regiment might be ordered such an offer at a time of the year when i had full leisure was very pleasing especially as i was to accompany a man of sterling good sense information discernment and conviviality and was to have a second crop in one year of london and johnson of this i informed my illustrious friend in characteristical warm terms in a letter dated the  0th of september from leeds  on monday october   i called at his house before he was up he sent for me to his bedside and expressed his satisfaction at this incidental meeting with as much vivacity as if he had been in the gaiety of youth he called briskly frank go and get coffee and let us breakfast in splendor  during this visit to london i had several interviews with him which it is unnecessary to distinguish particularly i consulted him as to the appointment of guardians to my children in case of my death sir said he do not appoint a number of guardians when they are many they trust one to another and the business is neglected i would advise you to choose only one let him be a man of respectable character who for his own credit will do what is right let him be a rich man so that he may be under no temptation to take advantage and let him be a man of business who is used to conduct affairs with ability and expertness to whom therefore the execution of the trust will not be burdensome  on sunday october  0 we dined together at mr strahans the conversation having turned on the prevailing practice of going to the east indies in quest of wealth  johnson a man had better have ten thousand pounds at the end of ten years passed in england than twenty thousand pounds at the end of ten years passed in india because you must compute what you give for money and a man who has lived ten years in india has given up ten years of social comfort and all those advantages which arise from living in england the ingenious mr brown distinguished by the name of capability brown told me that he was once at the seat of lord clive who had returned from india with great wealth and that he showed him at the door of his bedchamber a large chest which he said he had once had full of gold upon which brown observed i am glad you can bear it so near your bedchamber  we talked of the state of the poor in london  johnson saunders welsh the justice who was once highconstable of holborn and had the best opportunities of knowing the state of the poor told me that i underrated the number when i computed that twenty a week that is above a thousand a year died of hunger not absolutely of immediate hunger but of the wasting and other diseases which are the consequences of hunger this happens only in so large a place as london where people are not known what we are told about the great sums got by begging is not true the trade is overstocked and you may depend upon it there are many who cannot get work a particular kind of manufacture fails those who have been used to work at it can for some time work at nothing else you meet a man begging you charge him with idleness he says i am willing to labor will you give me work  i cannot  why then you have no right to charge me with idleness  we left mr strahans at seven as johnson had said he intended to go to evening prayers as we walked along he complained of a little gout in his toe and said i shall not go to prayers tonight i shall go tomorrow whenever i miss church on a sunday i resolve to go another day but i do not always do it this was a fair exhibition of that vibration between pious resolutions and indolence which many of us have too often experienced  i went home with him and we had a long quiet conversation  i read him a letter from dr hugh blair concerning pope in writing whose life he was now employed which i shall insert as a literary curiosity the reverend dr law bishop of carlisle in the preface to his valuable edition of archbishop kings essay on the origin of evil mentions that the principles maintained in it had been adopted by pope in his essay on man and adds the fact notwithstanding such denial bishop warburtons might have been strictly verified by an unexceptionable testimony viz that of the late lord bathurst who saw the very same system of the  taken from the archbishop in lord bolingbrokes own hand lying before mr pope while he was composing his essay this is respectable evidence but that of dr blait is more direct from the fountainhead as well as more full   to james boswell esquire dear sir in the year      being at london i was carried by dr john blair prebendary of westminster to dine at old lord bathursts where we found the late mr mallet sir james porter who had been ambassador at constantinople the late dr macaulay and two or three more the conversation turning on mr pope lord bathurst told us that the essay on man was originally composed by lord bolingbroke in prose and that mr pope did no more than put it into verse that he had read lord bolingbrokes manuscript in his own handwriting and remembered well that he was at a loss whether most to admire the elegance of lord bolingbrokes prose or the beauty of mr popes verse when lord bathurst told this mr mallet bade me attend and remember this remarkable piece of information as by the course of nature i might survive his lordship and be a witness of his having said so the conversation was indeed too remarkable to be forgotten a few days after meeting with you who were then also at london you will remember that i mentioned to you what had passed on this subject as i was much struck with this anecdote but what ascertains my recollection of it beyond doubt is that being accustomed to keep a journal of what passed when i was at london which i wrote out every evening i find the particulars of the above information just as i have now given them distinctly marked and am thence enabled to fix this conversation to have passed on friday the   d of april       i remember also distinctly though i have not for this the authority of my journal that the conversation going on concerning mr pope i took notice of a report which had been sometimes propagated that he did not understand greek lord bathurst said to me that he knew that to be false for that part of the iliad was translated by mr pope in his house in the country and that in the mornings when they assembled at breakfast mr pope used frequently to repeat with great rapture the greek lines which he had been translating and then to give them his version of them and to compare them together  if these circumstances can be of any use to dr johnson you have my full liberty to give them to him i beg you will at the same time present to him my most respectful compliments with best wishes for his success and fame in all his literary undertakings  i am with great respect my dearest sir your most affectionate and obliged humble servant hugh blair broughtonpark sept          johnson depend upon it sir this is too strongly stated pope may have had from bolingbroke the philosophic stamina of his essay and admitting this to be true lord bathurst did not intentionally falsify but the thing is not true in the latitude that blair seems to imagine we are sure that the poetical imagery which makes a great part of the poem was popes own it is amazing sir what deviations there are from precise truth in the account which is given of almost every thing i told mrs thrale you have so little anxiety about truth that you never tax your memory with the exact thing now what is the use of the memory to truth if one is careless of exactness lord hailess annals of scotland are very exact but they contain mere dry particulars they are to be considered as a dictionary you know such things are there and may be looked at when you please robertson paints but the misfortune is you are sure he does not know the people whom he paints so you cannot suppose a likeness characters should never be given by an historian unless he knew the people whom he describes or copies from those who knew them  boswell why sir do people play this trick which i observe now when i look at your grate putting the shovel against it to make the fire burn johnson they play the trick but it does not make the fire burn there is a better setting the poker perpendicularly up at right angles with the grate in days of superstition they thought as it made a cross with the bars it would drive away the witch  boswell by associating with you sir i am always getting an accession of wisdom but perhaps a man after knowing his own character  the limited strength of his own mind should not be desirous of having too much wisdom considering quid valiant humeri how little he can carry johnson sir be as wise as you can let a man be aliis laetus sapiens sibi though pleased to see the dolphins play i mind my compass and my way you may be wise in your study in the morning and gay in company at a tavern in the evening every man is to take care of his own wisdom and his own virtue without minding too much what others think  he said dodsley first mentioned to me the scheme of an english dictionary but i had long thought of it boswell you did not know what you was undertaking johnson yes sir i knew very well what i was undertaking  and very well how to do it  and have done it very well boswell an excellent climax and it has availed you in your preface you say what would it avail me in this gloom of solitude you have been agreeably mistaken  in his life of milton he observes i cannot but remark a kind of respect perhaps unconsciously paid to this great man by his biographers every house in which he resided is historically mentioned as if it were an injury to neglect naming any place that he honored by his presence i had before i read this observation been desirous of showing that respect to johnson by various inquiries finding him this evening in a very good humor i prevailed on him to give me an exact list of his places of residence since he entered the metropolis as an author which i subjoin in a note   exeterstreet off catherinestreet strand   greenwich   woodstockstreet near hanoversquare   castlestreet cavendishsquare   strand   boswellcourt   strand again   bowstreet   holborn  0 fetterlane    holborn again    goughsquare    staple inn    grays inn    inner templelane no      johnsonscourt no      boltcourt no      i mentioned to him a dispute between a friend of mine and his lady concerning conjugal infidelity which my friend had maintained was by no means so bad in the husband as in the wife johnson your friend was in the right sir between a man and his maker it is a different question but between a man and his wife a husbands infidelity is nothing they are connected by children by fortune by serious considerations of community wise married women dont trouble themselves about infidelity in their husbands boswell to be sure there is a great difference between the offense of infidelity in a man and that of his wife johnson the difference is boundless the man imposes no bastards upon his wife  here it may be questioned whether johnson was entirely in the right i suppose it will not be controverted that the difference in the degree of criminality is very great on account of consequences but still it may be maintained that independent of moral obligation infidelity is by no means a light offense in a husband because it must hurt a delicate attachment in which a mutual constancy is implied with such refined sentiments as massinger has exhibited in his play of the picture johnson probably at another time would have admitted this opinion and let it be kept in remembrance that he was very careful not to give any encouragement to irregular conduct a gentleman not adverting to the distinction made by him upon this subject supposed a case of singular perverseness in a wife and heedlessly said that then he thought a husband might do as he pleased with a safe conscience johnson nay sir this is wild indeed smiling you must consider that fornication is a crime in a single man and you cannot have more liberty by being married  he this evening expressed himself strongly against the roman catholics observing in every thing in which they differ from us they are wrong he was even against the invocation of saints in short he was in the humor of opposition  having regretted to him that i had learnt little greek as is too generally the case in scotland that i had for a long time hardly applied at all to the study of that noble language and that i was desirous of being told by him what method to follow he recommended to me as easy helps sylvanuss first book of the iliad dawsons lexicon to the greek new testament and hesiod with pasoris lexicon at the end of it  on tuesday october    i dined with him at mr ramsays with lord newhaven and some other company none of whom i recollect but a beautiful miss graham a relation of his lordships who asked dr johnson to hob or nob with her he was flattered by such pleasing attention and politely told her he never drank wine but if she would drink a glass of water he was much at her service she accepted oho sir said lord newhaven you are caught johnson nay i do not see how i am caught but if i am caught i dont want to get free again if i am caught i hope to be kept then when the two glasses of water were brought smiling placidly to the young lady madam let us reciprocate  lord newhaven and johnson carried on an argument for some time concerning the middlesex election johnson said parliament may be considered as bound by law as a man is bound where there is nobody to tie the knot as it is clear that the house of commons may expel and expel again and again why not allow of the power to incapacitate for that parliament rather than have a perpetual contest kept up between parliament and the people lord newhaven took the opposite side but respectfully said i speak with great deference to you dr johnson i speak to be instructed this had its full effect upon my friend he bowed his head almost as low as the table to a complimenting nobleman and called out my lord my lord i do not desire all this ceremony let us tell our minds to one another quietly after the debate was over he said i have got lights on the subject today which i had not before this was a great deal from him especially as he had written a pamphlet upon it  he observed the house of commons was originally not a privilege of the people but a check for the crown on the house of lords i remember henry the eighth wanted them to do something they hesitated in the morning but did it in the afternoon he told them it is well you did or half your heads should have been upon temple bar but the house of commons is now no longer under the power of the crown and therefore must be bribed he added i have no delight in talking of public affairs  of his fellowcollegian the celebrated mr george whitefield he said whitefield never drew as much attention as a mountebank does he did not draw attention by doing better than others but by doing what was strange were astley to preach a sermon standing upon his head on a horses back he would collect a multitude to hear him but no wise man would say he had made a better sermon for that i never treated whitefields ministry with contempt i believe he did good he had devoted himself to the lower classes of mankind and among them he was of use but when familiarity and noise claim the praise due to knowledge art and elegance we must beat down such pretensions  what i have preserved of his conversation during the remainder of my stay in london at this time is only what follows i told him that when i objected to keeping company with a notorious infidel a celebrated friend of ours said to me i do not think that men who live laxly in the world as you and i do can with propriety assume such an authority dr johnson may who is uniformly exemplary in his conduct but it is not very consistent to shun an infidel today and get drunk tomorrow johnson nay sir this is sad reasoning because a man cannot be right in all things is he to be right in nothing because a man sometimes gets drunk is he therefore to steal this doctrine would very soon bring a man to the gallows  after all however it is a difficult question how far sincere christians should associate with the avowed enemies of religion for in the first place almost every mans mind may be more or les corrupted by evil communications secondly the world may very naturally suppose that they are not really in earnest in religion who can easily bear its opponents and thirdly if the prosane find themselves quite well received by the pious one of the checks upon an open declaration of their insidelity and one of the probable chances of obliging them seriously to reflect which their being shunned would do is removed  he i know not why showed upon all occasions an aversion to go to ireland where i proposed to him that we should make a tour johnson it is the last place where i should wish to travel boswell should you not like to see dublin sir johnson no sir dublin is only a worse capital boswell is not the giantscauseway worth seeing johnson worth seeing yes but not worth going to see  of an acquaintance of ours whose manners and every thing about him though expensive were coarse he said sir you see in him vulgar prosperity  a foreign minister of no very high talents who had been in his company for a considerable time quite overlooked happened luckily to mention that he had read some of his rambler in italian and admired it much this pleased him greatly he observed that the title had been translated il genio errante though i have been told it was rendered more ludicrously il vagabondo and finding that this minister gave such a proof of his taste he was all attention to him and on the first remark which he made however simple exclaimed the ambassador says well  his excellency observes   and then he expanded and enriched the little that had been said in so strong a manner that it appeared something of consequence this was exceedingly entertaining to the company who were present and many a time afterward it furnished a pleasant topic of merriment the ambassador says well became a laughable term of applause when no mighty matter had been expressed  i left london on monday october    and accompanied colonel stuart to chester where his regiment was to lie for some time  mr boswell to dr johnson my dear sir chester    october      it was not till one oclock on monday morning that colonel stuart and i left london for we chose to bid a cordial adieu to lord mountstuart who was to set out on that day on his embassy to turin we drove on excellently and reached lichfield in good time enough that night the colonel had heard so preferable a character of the george that he would not put up at the three crowns so that i did not see our host wilkins we found at the george as good accommodation as we could wish to have and i fully enjoyed the comfortable thought that i was in lichfield again next morning it rained very hard and as i had much to do in a little time i ordered a postchaise and between eight and nine sallied forth to make a round of visits i first went to mr green hoping to have had him to accompany me to all my other friends but he was engaged to attend the bishop of sodor and man who was then lying at lichfield very ill of the gout having taken a hasty glance at the additions to greens museum from which it was not easy to break away i next went to the friery where i at first occasioned some tumult in the ladies who were not prepared to receive company so early but my name which has by wonderful felicity come to be so closely associated with yours soon made all easy and mrs cobb and miss adye reassumed their seats at the breakfasttable which they had quitted with some precipitation they received me with the kindness of old acquaintance and after we had joined in a cordial chorus to your praise mrs cobb gave me the high satisfaction of hearing that you said boswell is a man who i believe never left a house without leaving a wish for his return and she afterward added that she bid you tell me that if ever i came to lichfield she hoped i would take a bed at the friery from thence i drove to peter garricks where i also found a very flattering welcome he appeared to me to enjoy his usual cheerfulness and he very kindly asked me to come when i could and pass a week with him from mr garricks i went to the palace to wait on mr seward i was first entertained by his lady and daughter he himself being in bed with a cold according to his valetudinary custom but he desired to see me and i found him dressed in his black gown with a white flannel nightgown above it so that he looked like a dominican friar he was goodhumoured and polite and under his roof too my reception was very pleasing i then proceeded to stowhill and first paid my respects to mrs gastrell whose conversation i was not willing to quit but my sandglass was now beginning to run low as i could not trespass too long on the colonels kindness who obligingly waited for me so i hastened to mrs astons whom i found much better than i feared i should and there i met a brotherinlaw of these ladies who talked much of you and very well too as it appeared to me it then only remained to visit mrs lucy porter which i did i really believe with sincere satisfaction on both sides i am sure i was glad to see her again and as i take her to be very honest i trust she was glad to see me again for she expressed herself so that i could not doubt of her being in earnest what a great keystone of kindness my dear sir was you that morning for we were all held together by our common attachment to you i cannot say that i ever passed two hours with more selfcomplacency than i did those two at lichfield let me not entertain any suspicion that this is idle vanity will not you confirm me in my persuasion that he who finds himself so regarded has just reason to be happy  we got to chester about midnight on tuesday and here again i am in a state of much enjoyment colonel stuart and his officers treat me with all the civility i could wish and i play my part admirably laetus aliis sapiens sibi the classical sentence which you i imagine invented the other day is exemplified in my present existence the bishop to whom i had the honor to be known several years ago shows me much attention and i am edified by his conversation i must not omit to tell you that his lordship admires very highly your prefaces to the poets i am daily obtaining an extension of agreeable acquaintance so that i am kept in animated variety and the study of the place itself by the assistance of books and of the bishop is sufficient occupation chester pleases my fancy more than any town i ever saw but i will not enter upon it at all in this letter  how long i shall stay here i cannot yet say i told a very pleasing young lady niece to one of the prebendaries at whose house i saw her i have come to chester madam i cannot tell how and far less can i tell how i am to get away from it do not think me too juvenile i beg it of you my dear sir to favor me with a letter while i am here and add to the happiness of a happy friend who is ever with affectionate veneration  most sincerely yours james boswell if you do not write directly so as to catch me here i shall be disappointed two lines from you will keep my lamp burning bright     to james boswell esquire dear sir why should you importune me so earnestly to write of what importance can it be to hear of distant friends to a man who finds himself welcome wherever he goes and makes new friends faster than he can want them if to the delight of such universal kindness of reception any thing can be added by knowing that you retain my good will you may indulge yourself in the full enjoyment of that small addition  i am glad that you made the round of lichfield with so much success the oftener you are seen the more you will be liked it was pleasing to me to read that mrs aston was so well and that lucy porter was so glad to see you  in the place where you now are there is much to be observed and you will easily procure yourself skilful directors but what will you do to keep away the black dog that worries you at home if you would in compliance with your fathers advice enquire into the old tenures and old charters of scotland you would certainly open to yourself many striking scenes of the manners of the middle ages the feudal system in a country half barbarous is naturally productive of great anomalies in civil life the knowledge of past times is naturally growing less in all cases not of public record and the past time of scotland is so unlike the present that it is already difficult for a scotchman to image the economy of his grandfather do not be tardy nor negligent but gather up eagerly what can yet be found i have a valuablecollection made by my father which with some additions and illustrations of my own i intend to publish i have some hereditary claim to be an antiquary not only from my father but as being descended by the mothers side of the able and learned sir john skene whose merit bids defiance to all the attempts which have been made to lessen his fame   we have i think once talked of another project a history of the late insurrection in scotland with all its incidents many falsehoods are passing into uncontradicted history voltaire who loved a striking story has told what we could not find to be true  you may make collections for either of these projects or for both as opportunities occur and digest your materials at leisure the great direction which burton has left to men disordered like you be not solitary be not idle which i would thus modify  if you are idle be not solitary if you are solitary be not idle  there is a letter for you from  your humble servant sam johnson london oct          to dr samuel johnson my dear sir carlisle nov        that i should importune you to write to me at chester is not wonderful when you consider what an avidity i have for delight and that the amor of pleasure like the amor nummi increases in proportion with the quantity which we possess of it your letter so full of polite kindness and masterly counsel came like a large treasure upon me while already glittering with riches i was quite enchanted at chester so that i could with difficulty quit it but the enchantment was the reverse of that of circe for so far was there from being any thing sensual in it that i was all mind i do not mean all reason only for my fancy was kept finely in play and why not  if you please i will send you a copy or an abridgement of my chester journal which is truly a logbook of felicity  the bishop treated me with a kindness which was very flattering i told him that you regretted you had seen so little of chester his lordship bid me tell you that he should be glad to show you more of it i am proud to find the friendship with which you honor me is known in so many places  i arrived here late last night our friend the dean has been gone from hence some months but i am told at my inn that he is very populous popular however i found mr law the archdeacon son to the bishop and with him i have breakfasted and dined very agreeably i got acquainted with him at the assizes here about a year and a half ago he is a man of great variety of knowledge uncommon genius and i believe sincere religion i received the holy sacrament in the cathedral in the morning this being the first sunday of the month and was at prayers there in the evening it is divinely cheering to me to think that there is a cathedral so near auchinleck and i now leave old england in such a state of mind as i am thankful to god for granting me  the black dog that worries me at home i cannot but dread yet as i have been for some time past in a military train i trust i shall repulse him to hear from you will animate me like the sound of a trumpet i therefore hope that soon after my return to the northern field i shall receive a few lines from you  colonel stuart did me the honor to escort me in his carriage to show me liverpool and from thence back again to warrington where we parted his regiment was afterward ordered to jamaica where he accompanied it and almost lost his life by the climate this impartial order i should think a sufficient refutation of the idle rumor that there was still something behind the throne greater than the throne itself  in justice to my valuable wife i must inform you that as i was so happy she would not be so selfish as to wish me to return sooner than business absolutely required my presence she made my clerk write to me a post or two after to the same purpose by commission from her and this day a kind letter from her met me at the post office here acquainting me that she and the little ones were well and expressing all their wishes for my return home  i am more and more my dear sir your affectionate and obliged humble servant james boswell   to james boswell esquire dear sir your last letter was not only kind but fond but i wish you to get rid of all intellectual excesses and neither to exalt your pleasures nor aggravate your vexations beyond their real and natural state why should you not be as happy at edinburgh as at chester in culpa est animus qui se non effugit usquam please yourself with your wife and children and studies and practice  i have sent a petition requesting me to inquire concerning the family of a gentleman who was then paying his addresses to miss doxy from lucy porter with which i leave it to your discretion whether it is proper to comply return me her letter which i have sent that you may know the whole case and not be seduced to any thing that you may afterward repent miss doxy perhaps you know to be mr garricks niece  if dean percy can be popular at carlisle he may be very happy he has in his disposal two livings each equal or almost equal in value to the deanery he may take one himself and give the other to his son  how near is the cathedral to auchinleck that you are so much delighted with it it is i suppose at least an hundred and fifty miles off however if you are pleased it is so far well  let me know what reception you have from your father and the state of his health please him as much as you can and add no pain to his last years  of our friends here i can recollect nothing to tell you i have neither seen nor heard of langton beauclerk is just returned from brighthelmston i am told much better mr thrale and his family are still there and his health is said to be visibly improved he has not bathed but hunted  at boltcourt there is much malignity but of late little open hostility i have had a cold but it is gone  make my compliments to mrs boswell etc  i am sir your humble servant sam johnson london nov          on november    and december    i wrote to him from edinburgh giving a very favorable report of the family of miss doxys lover  that after a good deal of inquiry i had discovered the sister of mr francis stewart one of his amanuenses when writing his dictionary  that i had as desired by him paid her a guinea for an old pocketbook of her brothers which he had retained and that the good woman who was in very moderate circumstances but contented and placid wondered at his scrupulous and liberal honesty and received the guinea as if sent her by providence  that i had repeatedly begged of him to keep his promise to send me his letter to lord chesterfield and that this memento like delenda est carthago must be in every letter that i should write to him till i had obtained my object  lives of the poets upon which he was employed so far as his indolence allowed him to labor  i wrote to him on january   and march    sending him my notes of lord marchmonts information concerning pope  complaining that i had not heard from him for almost four months though he was two letters in my debt  that i had suffered again from melancholy  hoping that he had been in so much better company the poets that he had not time to think of his distant friends for if that were the case i should have some recompense for my uneasiness  that the state of my affairs did not admit of my coming to london this year  and begging he would return me goldsmiths two poems with his lines marked  his friend dr lawrence having now suffered the greatest affliction to which a man is liable and which johnson himself had felt in the most severe manner johnson wrote to him in an admirable strain of sympathy and pious consolation  to dr lawrence dear sir at a time when all your friends ought to show their kindness and with a character which ought to make all that know you your friends you may wonder that you have yet heard nothing from me  i have been hindered by a vexatious and incessant cough for which within these ten days i have been bled once fasted four or five times taken physic five times and opiates i think six this day it seems to remit    our first recourse in this distressful solitude is perhaps for want of habitual piety to a gloomy acquiescence in necessity of two mortal beings one must lose the other but surely there is a higher and a better comfort to be drawn from the consideration of that providence which watches over all and a belief that the living and the dead are equally in the hands of god who will reunite those whom he has separated or who sees that it is best not to reunite them  i am dear sir your most affectionate and most humble servant sam johnson jan  0    0  to james boswell esquire dear sir well i had resolved to send you the chesterfield letter but i will write once again without it never impose tasks upon mortals to require two things is the way to have them both undone  for the difficulties which you mention in your affairs i am sorry but difficulty is now very general it is not therefore less grievous for there is less hope of help i pretend not to give you advice not knowing the state of your affairs and general counsels about prudence and frugality would do you little good you are however in the right not to increase your own perplexity by a journey hither and i hope that by staying at home you will please your father  poor dear beauclerk  nec ut soles dabis joca his wit and his folly his acuteness and maliciousness his merriment and reasoning are now over such another will not often be found among mankind he directed himself to be buried by the side of his mother an instance of tenderness which i hardly expected he has left his children to the care of lady di and if she dies of mr langton and of mr leicester his relation and a man of good character his library has been offered to sale to the ruffian ambassador  dr percy notwithstanding all the noise of the newspapers has had no literary loss by a fire in northumberlandhouse where he had an apartment in which i have passed many an agreeable hour  clothes and movables were burnt to the value of about one hundred pounds but his papers and i think his books were all preserved  poor mr thrale has been in extreme danger from an apoplectical disorder and recovered beyond the expectation of his physicians he is now at bath that his mind may be quiet and mrs thrale and miss are with him  having told you what has happened to your friends let me say something to you of yourself you are always complaining of melancholy and i conclude from those complaints that you are fond of it no man talks of that which he is desirous to conceal and every man desires to conceal that of which he is ashamed do not pretend to deny it manifestum habemus furem make it an invariable and obligatory law to yourself never to mention your own mental diseases if you are never to speak of them you will think on them but little and if you think little of them they will molest you rarely when you talk of them it is plain that you want either praise or pity for praise there is no room and pity will do you no good therefore from this hour speak no more think no more about them  your transaction with mrs stuart gave me great satisfaction i am much obliged to you for your attention do not lose sight of her your countenance may be of great credit and of consequence of great advantage to her the memory of her brother is yet fresh in my mind he was an ingenious and worthy man  please to make my compliments to your lady and to the young ladies i should like to see them pretty loves  i am dear sir yours affectionately sam johnson april      0  mrs thrale being now at bath with her husband the correspondence between johnson and her was carried on briskly i shall present my readers with one of her original letters to him at this time which will amuse them probably more than those wellwritten but studied epistles which she has inserted in her collection because it exhibits the easy vivacity of their literary intercourse it is also of value as a key to johnsons answer which she has printed by itself and of which i shall subjoin extracts  mrs thrale to dr johnson i had a very kind letter from you yesterday dear sir with a most circumstantial date you took trouble with my circulating letter mr evans writes me word and i thank you sincerely for so doing one might do mischief else not being on the spot  yesterdays evening was passed at mrs montagus there was mr melmoth i do not like him though nor he me it was expected we should have pleased each other he is however just tory enough to hate the bishop of peterborough for whiggism and whig enough to abhor you for toryism  mrs montagu flattered him finely so he had a good afternoon on it this evening we spend at a concert poor queeneys a kind of nickname given to mrs thrales eldest daughter whose name being fsther she might be assimilated to a queen sore eyes have just released her she had a long confinement and could neither read nor write so my master mr thrale treated her very goodnaturedly with the visits of a young woman in this town a taylors daughter who professes music and teaches so as to give six lessons a day to ladies at five and threepence a lesson miss burney says she is a great performer and i respect the wench for getting her living so prettily she is very modest and pretty mannered and not seventeen years old  you live in a fine whirl indeed if i did not write regularly you would half forget me and that would be very wrong for i felt my regard for you in my face last night when the criticisms were going on  this morning it was all connoisseurship we went to see some pictures painted by a gentleman artist mr tailor of this place my master makes one every where and he has got a dawling companion to ride with him now         he looks well enough but i have no notion of health for a man whose mouth cannot be sewed up burney and i and queeney teize him every meal he eats and mr montagu is quite serious with him but what can one do he will eat i think and if he does eat i know he will not live it makes me very unhappy but i must bear it let me always have your friendship  i am most sincerely dear sir your faithful servant h l t bath friday april     dr johnson to mrs thrale dearest madam mr thrale never will live abstinently till he can persuade himself to live by rule i have taken the liberty to leave out a few lines          encourage as you can the musical girl  nothing is more common than mutual dislike where mutual approbation is particularly expected there is often on both sides a vigilance not over benevolent and as attention is strongly excited so that nothing drops unheeded any difference in taste or opinion and some difference where there is no restraint will commonly appear it immediately generates dislike  never let criticisms operate upon your face or your mind it is very rarely that an author is hurt by his critics the blaze of reputation cannot be blown out but it often dies in the socket a very few names may be considered as perpetual lamps that shine unconsumed from the author of fitzosbornes letters i cannot think myself in much danger i met him only once about thirty years ago and in some small dispute reduced him to whistle having not seen him since that is the last impression poor moore the fabulist was one of the company  mrs montagus long stay against her own inclination is very convenient you would by your own confession want a companion and she is par pluribus conversing with her you may find variety in one  london may      0  on the  d of may i wrote to him and requested that we might have another meeting somewhere in the north of england in the autumn of this year  from mr langton i received soon after this time a letter of which i extract a passage relative at once to mr beauclerk and dr johnson  the melancholy information you have received concerning mr beauclerks death is true had his talents been directed in any sufficient degree as they ought i have always been strongly of opinion that they were calculated to make an illustrious figure and that opinion as it had been in part formed upon dr johnsons judgment receives more and more confirmation by hearing that since his death dr johnson has said concerning them a few evenings ago he was at mr veseys where lord althorpe who was one of a numerous company there addressed dr johnson on the subject of mr beauclerks death saying our club has had a great loss since we met last he replied a loss that perhaps the whole nation could not repair the doctor then went on to speak of his endowments and particularly extolled the wonderful ease with which he uttered what was highly excellent he said that no man ever was so free when he was going to say a good thing from a look that expressed that it was coming or when he had said it from a look that expressed that it had come at mr thrales some days before when we were talking on the same subject he said referring to the same idea of his wonderful facility that beauclerks talents were those which he had felt himself more disposed to envy than those of any whom he had known  at the evening i have spoken of above at mr veseys you would have been much gratified as it exhibited an instance of the high importance in which dr johnsons character is held i think even beyond any i ever before was witness to the company consisted chiefly of ladies among whom were the duchess dowager of portland the duchess of beaufort whom i suppose from her rank i must name before her mother mrs boscawen and her elder sister mrs lewson who was likewise there lady lucan lady clermont and others of note both for their station and understandings among the gentlemen were lord althorpe whom i have before named lord macartney sir joshua reynolds lord lucan mr wraxal whose book you have probably seen the tour to the northern parts of europe a very agreeable ingenious man dr warren mr pepys the master in chancery whom i believe you know and dr barnard the provost of eton as soon as dr johnson was come in and had taken a chair the company began to collect round him till they became not less than four if not five deep those behind standing and listening over the heads of those that were sitting near him the conversation for some time was chiefly between dr johnson and the provost of eton while the others contributed occasionally their remarks without attempting to detail the particulars of the conversation which perhaps if i did i should spin my account out to a tedious length i thought my dear sir this general account of the respect with which our valued friend was attended to might be acceptable  to the reverend dr farmer sir may      0 i know your disposition to second any literary attempt and therefore venture upon the liberty of entreating you to procure from college or university registers all the dates or other informations which they can supply relating to ambrose philips broom and gray who were all of cambridge and of whose lives i am to give such accounts as i can gather be pleased to forgive this trouble from sir  your most humble servant sam johnson   while johnson was thus engaged in preparing a delightful literary entertainment for the world the tranquillity of the metropolis of great britain was unexpectedly disturbed by the most horrid series of outrage that ever disgraced a civilized country a relaxation of some of the severe penal provisions against our fellow subjects of the catholic communion had been granted by the legislature with an opposition so inconsiderable that the genuine mildness of christianity united with liberal policy seemed to have become general in this island but a dark and malignant spirit of persecution soon showed itself in an unworthy petition for the repeal of the wise and humane statute that petition was brought forward by a mob with the evident purpose of intimidation and was justly rejected but the attempt was accompanied and followed by such daring violence as is unexampled in history of this extraordinary tumult dr johnson has given the following concise lively and just account in his letters to mrs thrale vol ii p     et seq i have selected passages from several letters without mentioning dates   on friday the good protestants met in st georgesfields at the summons of lord george gordon and marching to westminster insulted the lords and commons who all bore it with great tameness at night the outrages began by the demolition of the masshouse by lincolns end  an exact journal of a weeks defiance of government i cannot give you on monday mr strahan who had been insulted spoke to lord mansfield who had i think been insulted too of the licentiousness of the populace and his lordship treated it as a very slight irregularity on tuesday night they pulled down fieldings house and burnt his goods in the street they had gutted on monday sir george saviles house but the building was saved on tuesday evening leaving fieldings ruins they went to newgate to demand their companions who had been seized demolishing the chapel the keeper could not release them but by the mayors permission which he went to ask at his return he found all the prisoners released and newgate in a blaze they then went to bloomsbury and fastened upon lord mansfields house which they pulled down and as for his goods they totally burnt them they have since gone to caenwood but a guard was there before them they plundered some papists i think and burnt a masshouse in moorfields the same night  on wednesday i walked with dr scot to look at newgate and found it in ruins with the fire yet glowing as i went by the protestants were plundering the sessions house at the old bailey there were not i believe a hundred but they did their work at leisure in full security without sentinels without trepidation as men lawfully employed in full day such is the cowardice of a commercial place on wednesday they broke open the fleet and the kings bench and the marshalsea and woodstreet compter and clerkenwell bridewell and released all the prisoners  at night they set fire to the fleet and to the kings bench and i know not how many other places and one might see the glare of conflagration fill the sky from many parts the sight was dreadful some people were threatened mr strahan advised me to take care of myself such a time of terror you have been happy in not seeing  the king said in council that the magistrates had not done their duty but that he would do his own and a proclamation was published directing us to keep our servants within doors as the peace was now to be preserved by force the soldiers were sent out to different parts and the town is now at quiet  the soldiers are stationed so as to be every where within call there is no longer any body of rioters and the individuals are haunted to their holes and led to prison lord george was last night sent to the tower mr john wilkes was this day in my neighborhood to seize the publishes of a seditious paper  several chapels have been destroyed and several inoffensive papists have been plundered but the high sport was to burn the gaols this was a good rabble trick the debtors and the criminals were all set at liberty but of the criminals as has always happened many are already retaken and two pirates have surrendered themselves and it is expected that they will be pardoned  government now acts again with its proper force and we are all again under the protection of the king and the law i thought that it would be agreeable to you and my master to have my testimony to the public security and that you would sleep more quietly when i told you that you are safe  there has indeed been an universal panick from which the king was the first that recovered without the concurrence of his ministers or the assistance of the civil magistrate he put the soldiers in motion and saved the town from calamities such as a rabbles government must naturally produce  the public has escaped a very heavy calamity the rioters attempted the bank on wednesday night but in no great number and like other thieves with no great resolution jack wilkes headed the party that drove them away it is agreed that if they had seized the bank on tuesday at the height of the panick when no resistance had been prepared they might have carried irrecoverably away whatever they had found jack who was always zealous for order and decency declares that if he be trusted with power he will not leave a rioter alive there is however now no longer any need of heroism or bloodshed no blue ribband is any longer worn  such was the end of this miserable sedition from which london was delivered by the magnanimity of the sovereign himself whatever some may maintain i am satisfied that there was no combination or plan either domestic or foreign but that the mischief spread by a gradual contagion of frenzy augmented by the quantities of fermented liquors of which the deluded populace possessed themselves in the course of their depredations  i should think myself very much to blame did i here neglect to do justice to my esteemed friend mr akerman the keeper of newgate who has long discharged a very important trust with an uniform intrepid firmness and at the same time a tenderness and a liberal charity which entitle him to be recorded with distinguished honor  upon this occasion from the timidity and negligence of magistracy on the one hand and the almost incredible exertions of the mob on the other the first prison of this great country was laid open and the prisoners set free but that mr akerman whose house was burnt would have prevented all this had proper aid been sent to him in due time there can be no doubt  many years ago a fire broke out in the brick part which was built as an addition to the old gaol of newgate the prisoners were in consternation and tumult calling out we shall be burnt  we shall be burnt down with the gate  down with the gate mr akerman hastened to them showed himself at the gate and having after some confused vociferation of hear him  hear him obtained a silent attention he then calmly told them that the gate must not go down that they were under his care and that they should not be permitted to escape but that he could assure them they need not be afraid of being burnt for that the fire was not in the prison properly so called which was strongly built with stone and that if they would engage to be quiet he himself would come in to them and conduct them to the further end of the building and would not go out till they gave him leave to this proposal they agreed upon which mr akerman having first made them fall back from the gate went in and with a determined resolution ordered the outer turnkey upon no account to open the gate even though the prisoners though he trusted they would not should break their word and by force bring himself to order it never mind me said he should that happen the prisoners peaceably followed him while he conducted them through passages of which he had the keys to the extremity of the gaol which was most distant from the fire having by this very judicious conduct fully satisfied them that there was no immediate risk if any at all he then addressed them thus gentlemen you are now convinced that i told you true i have no doubt that the engines will soon extinguish this fire if they should not a sufficient guard will come and you shall all be taken out and lodged in the compters i assure you upon my word and honor that i have not a farthing insured i have left my house that i might take care of you i will keep my promise and stay with you if you insist upon it but if you will allow me to go out and look after my family and property i will be obliged to you struck with his behavior they called out master akerman you have done bravely it was very kind in you by all means go and take care of your own concerns he did so accordingly while they remained and were all preserved  johnson has been heard to relate the substance of this story with high praise in which he was joined by mr burke my illustrious friend speaking of mr akermans kindness to his prisoners pronounced this eulogy upon his character  he who has long had constantly in his view the worst of mankind and is yet eminent for the humanity of his disposition must have had it originally in a great degree and continued to cultivate it very carefully  in the course of this month my brother david waited upon dr johnson with the following letter of introduction which i had taken care should be lying ready on his arrival in london  to dr samuel johnson my dear sir edinburgh april       0 this will be delivered to you by my brother david on his return from spain you will be glad to see the man who vowed to stand by the old castle of auchinleck with heart purse and sword that romantic family solemnity devised by me of which you and i talked with complacency upon the spot i trust that twelve years of absence have not lessened his feudal attachment and that you will find him worthy of being introduced to your acquaintance  i have the honor to be with affectionate veneration  my dear sir your most faithful humble servant james boswell   johnson received him very politely and has thus mentioned him in a letter to mrs thrale vol ii p     mrs piozzi has omitted the name she best knows why  i have had with me a brother of boswells a spanish merchant now settled in london  whom the war has driven from his residence at valencia he is gone to see his friends and will find scotland but a sorry place after twelve years residence in a happier climate he is a very agreeable man and speaks no scotch  to dr beattie at aberdeen sir more years i had been five years absent from london beattie than i have any delight to reckon have past since you and i saw one another of this however there is no reason for making any reprehensory complaint sic fata ferunt but methinks there might pass some small interchange of regard between us if you say that i ought to have written i now write and i write to tell you that i have much kindness for you and mrs beattie and that i wish your health better and your life long try change of air and come a few degrees southwards a softer climate may do you both good winter is coming on and london will be warmer and gayer and busier and more fertile of amusement than aberdeen  my health is better but that will be little in the balance when i tell you that mrs montagu has been very ill and is i doubt now but weakly mr thrale has been very dangerously disordered but is much better and i hope will totally recover he has withdrawn himself from business the whole summer sir joshua and his sister are well and mr davies has had great success as an author meaning his entertaining memoirs of david garrick esquire of which johnson as davies informed me wrote the first sentence thus giving as it were the keynote to the performance it is indeed very characteristical of its author beginning with a maxim and proceeding to illustrate  all excellence has a right to be recorded i shall therefore think it superfluous to apologize for writing the life of a man who by an uncommon assemblage of private virtues adorned the highest eminence in a public professin  generated by the corruption of a bookseller more news i have not to tell you and therefore you must be contented with hearing what i know not whether you much wish to hear i wish he had omitted the suspicion expressed here though i believe he meant nothing but jocularity for though he and i differed sometimes in opinion he well knew how much i loved and revered him beattie  that i am sir  your most humble servant sam johnson boltcourt fleet street august       0  to james boswell esquire dear sir i find you have taken one of your fits of taciturnity and have resolved not to write till you are written to it is but a peevish humor but you shall have your way  i have sat at home in boltcourt all the summer thinking to write the lives and a great part of the time only thinking several of them however are done and i still think to do the rest  mr thrale and his family have since his illness passed their time first at bath and then at brighthelmston but i have been at neither place i would have gone to lichfield if i could have had time and i might have had time if i had been active but i have missed much and done little  in the late disturbances mr thrales house and stock were in great danger the mob was pacified at their first invasion with about fifty pounds in drink and meat and at their second were driven away by the soldiers mr strahan got a garrison into his house and maintained them a fortnight he was so frighted that he removed part of his goods mrs williams took shelter in the country  i know not whether i shall get a ramble this autumn it is now about the time when we were traveling i have however better health than i had then and hope you and i may yet show ourselves on some part of europe asia or africa it will no doubt be remarked how he avoids the rebellious land of america this puts me in mind of an anecdote for which i am obliged to my worthy social friend governor penn at one of miss e herveys assemblies dr johnson was following her up and down the room upon which lord abingdon observed to her your great friend is very fond of you you can go no where without him  aye said she he would follow me to any part of the world  then said the earl ask him to go with you to america  in the mean time let us play no trick but keep each others kindness by all means in our power  the bearer of this is dr dunbar of aberdeen who has written and published a very ingenious book essays on the history of mankind  and who i think has a kindness for me and will when he knows you have a kindness for you  i suppose your little ladies are grown tall and your son is become a learned young man i love them all and i love your naughty lady whom i never shall persuade to love me when the lives are done i shall send them to complete her collection but must send them in paper as for want of a pattern i cannot bind them to fit the rest  i am sir yours most affectionately sam johnson london aug       0  this year he wrote to a young clergyman in the country the following very excellent letter which contains valuable advice to divines in general dear sir not many days ago dr lawrence showed me a letter in which you make mention of me i hope therefore you will not be displeased that i endeavor to preserve your good will by some observations which your letter suggested to me  you are afraid of falling into some improprieties in the daily service by reading to an audience that requires no exactness your fear i hope secures you from danger they who contract absurd habits are such as have no fear it is impossible to do the same thing very often without some peculiarity of manner but that manner may be good or bad and a little care will at least preserve it from being bad to make it very good there must i think be something of natural or casual felicity which cannot be taught  your present method of making your sermons seems very judicious few frequent preachers can be supposed to have sermons more their own than yours will be take care to register somewhere or other the authors from whom your several discourses are borrowed and do not imagine that you shall always remember even what perhaps you now think it impossible to forget  my advice however is that you attempt from time to time an original sermon and in the labor of composition do not burden your mind with too much at once do not exact from yourself at one effort of excogitation propriety of thought and elegance of expression invent first and then embellish the production of something where nothing was before is an act of greater energy than the expansion or decoration of the thing produced set down diligently your thoughts as they rise in the first words that occur and when you have matter you will easily give it form nor perhaps will this method be always necessary for by habit your thoughts and diction will flow together  the composition of sermons is not very difficult the divisions not only help the memory of the hearer but direct the judgment of the writer they supply sources of invention and keep every part in its proper place  what i like least in your letter is your account of the manners of your parish from which i gather that it has been long neglected by the parson the dean of carlisle dr percy now bishop of dromore  who was then a little rector in northamptonshire told me that it might be discerned whether or no there was a clergyman resident in a parish by the civil or savage manner of the people such a congregation as yours stands in much need of reformation and i would not have you think it impossible to reform them a very savage parish was civilized by a decayed gentlewoman who came among them to teach a petty school my learned friend dr wheeler of oxford when he was a young man had the care of a neighboring parish for fifteen pounds a year which he was never paid but he counted it a convenience that it compelled him to make a sermon weekly one woman he could not bring to the communion and when he reproved or exhorted her she only answered that she was no scholar he was advised to set some good woman or man of the parish a little wiser than herself to talk to her in language level to her mind such honest i may call them holy artifices must be practiced by every clergyman for all means must be tried by which souls may be saved talk to your people however as much as you can and you will find that the more frequently you converse with them upon religious subjects the more willingly they will attend and the more submissively they will learn a clergymans diligence always makes him venerable i think i have now only to say that in the momentous work you have undertaken i pray god to bless you  i am sir your most humble servant sam johnson boltcourt aug  0    0    my next letters to him were of dates august    september   and october   and from them i extract the following passages  my brother david and i find the long indulged fancy of our comfortable meeting again at auchinleck so well realised that it in some degree confirms the pleasing hope of o praeclarum diem in a future state  i beg that you may never again harbor a suspicion of my indulging a peevish humor or playing tricks you will recollect that when i confessed to you that when i had once been intentionally silent to try your regard i gave you my word and honor that i should not do so again  i rejoice to hear of your good state of health i pray god to continue it long i have often said that i would willingly have ten years added to my life to have ten taken from yours i mean that i would be ten years older to have you ten years younger but let me be thankful for the years during which i have enjoyed your friendship and please myself with the hopes of enjoying it many years to come in this state of being trusting always that in another state we shall meet never to be separated of this we can form no notion but the thought though indistinct is delightful when the mind is calm and clear  the riots in london were certainly horrible but you give me no account of your own situation during the barbarous anarchy a description of it by dr johnson would be a great painting i had not then seen his letters to mrs thrale  you might write another london a poem  i am charmed with your condescending affectionate expression let us keep each others kindness by all the means in our power my revered friend how elevating is it to my mind that i am found worthy to be a companion to dr samuel johnson all that you have said in grateful praise of mr walmsley i have long thought of you but we are both tories which has a very general influence upon our sentiments i hope that you will agree to meet me at york about the end of this month or if you will come to carlisle that would be better still in case the dean be there please to consider that to keep each others kindness we should every year have that free and intimate communication of mind which can be had only when we are together we should have both our solemn and our pleasant talk  i write now for the third time to tell you that my desire for our meeting this autumn is much increased i wrote to squire godfrey bosville my yorkshire chief that i should perhaps pay him a visit as i was to hold a conference with dr johnson at york i give you my word and honor that i said not a word of his inviting you but he wrote to me as follows  i need not tell you i shall be happy to see you here the latter end of this month as you propose and i shall likewise be in hopes that you will persuade dr johnson to finish the conference here it will add to the favor of your own company if you prevail upon such an associate to assist your observations i have often been entertained with his writings and i once belonged to a club of which he was a member and i never spent an evening there but i heard something from him well worth remembering  we have thus my dear sir good comfortable quarters in the neighborhood of york where you may be assured we shall be heartily welcome i pray you then resolve to set out and let not the year    0 be a blank in our social calendar and in that record of wisdom and wit which i keep with so much diligence to your honor and the instruction and delight of others  mr thrale had now another contest for the representation in parliament of the borough of southwark and johnson kindly lent him his assistance by writing advertisements and letters for him i shall insert one as a specimen   to the worthy electors of the borough of southwark gentlemen a new parliament being now called i again solicit the honor of being elected for one of your representatives and solicit it with the greater confidence as i am not conscious of having neglected my duty or of having acted otherwise than as becomes the independent representative of independent constituents superior to fear hope and expectation who has no private purposes to promote and whose prosperity is involved in the prosperity of his country as my recovery from a very severe distemper is not yet perfect i have declined to attend the hall and hope an omission so necessary will not be harshly censured  i can only send my respectful wishes that all your deliberations may tend to the happiness of the kingdom and the peace of the borough  i am gentlemen your most faithful and obedient servant henry thrale southwark sept      0  on his birthday johnson has this note i am now beginning the seventysecond year of my life with more strength of body and greater vigor of mind than i think is common at that age but still he complains of sleepless nights and idle days and forgetfulness or neglect of resolutions he thus pathetically expresses himself surely i shall not spend my whole life with my own total disapprobation prayers and meditations p       mr macbean whom i have mentioned more than once as one of johnsons humble friends a deserving but unfortunate man being now oppressed by age and poverty johnson solicited the lord chancellor thurlow to have him admitted into the charter house i take the liberty to insert his lordships answer as i am eager to embrace every occasion of augmenting the respectable notion which should ever be entertained of my illustrious friend to dr samuel johnson sir london oct       0 i have this moment received your letter dated the   th and returned from bath  in the beginning of the summer i placed one in the chartreux without the sanction of a recommendation so distinct and so authoritative as yours of macbean and i am afraid that according to the establishment of the house the opportunity of making the charity so good amends will not soon recur but whenever a vacancy shall happen if you will savor me with notice of it i will try to recommend him to the place even though it should not be my turn to nominate  i am sir with great regard your most faithful and obedient servant thurlow   to james boswell esquire dear sir i am sorry to write you a letter that will not please you and yet it is at last what i resolve to do this year must pass without an interview the summer has been foolishly lost like many other of my summers and winters i hardly saw a green field but staid in town to work without working much  mr thrales loss of health has lost him the election he is now going to brighthelmston and expects me to go with him and how long i shall stay i cannot tell i do not much like the place but yet i shall go and stay while my stay is desired we must therefore content ourselves with knowing what we know as well as man can know the mind of man that we love one another and that we wish each others happiness and that the lapse of a year cannot lessen our mutual kindness  i was pleased to be told that i accused mrs boswell unjustly in supposing that she bears me ill will i love you so much that i would be glad to love all that love you and that you love and i have love very ready for mrs boswell if she thinks it worthy of acceptance i hope all the young ladies and gentlemen are well  i take a great liking to your brother he tells me that his father received him kindly but not fondly however you seem to have lived well enough at auchinleck while you staid make your father as happy as you can  you lately told me of your health i can tell you in return that my health has been for more than a year past better than it has been for many years before perhaps it may please god to give us some time together before we are parted  i am dear sir yours most affectionately sam johnson oct       0    being disappointed in my hopes of meeting johnson this year so that i could hear none of his admirable sayings i shall compensate for this want by inserting a collection of them for which i am indebted to my worthy friend mr langton whose kind communications have been separately interwoven in many parts of this work a very few articles of this collection were committed to writing by himself he not having that habit which he regrets and which those who know the numerous opportunities he had of gathering the rich fruits of johnsonian wit and wisdom must ever regret i however found in conversations with him that a good store of johnsoniana was treasured in his mind and i compared it to herculaneum or some old roman field which when dug fully rewards the labor employed the authenticity of every article is unquestionable for the expression i who wrote them down in his presence am partly answerable  theocritus is not deserving of very high respect as a writer as to the pastoral part virgil is very evidently superior he wrote when there had been a larger influx of knowledge into the world than when theocritus lived theocritus does not abound in description though living in a beautiful country the manners painted are coarse and gross virgil has much more description more sentiment more of nature and more of art some of the most excellent parts of theocritus are where castor and pollux going with the other argonauts land on the bebrycian coast and there fall into a dispute with amycus the king of that country which is as well conducted as euripides could have done it and the battle is well related afterward they carry off a woman whose two brothers come to recover her and expostulate with castor and pollux on their injustice but they pay no regard to the brothers and a battle ensues where castor and his brother are triumphant theocritus seems not to have seen that the brothers have the advantage in their argument over his argonaut heroes  the sicilian gossips is a piece of merit  callimachus is a writer of little excellence the chief thing to be learned from him is his account of rites and mythology which though desirable to be known for the sake of understanding other parts of ancient authors is the least pleasing or valuable part of their writings  mattaires account of the stephani is a heavy book he seems to have been a puzzleheaded man with a large share of scholarship but with little geometry or logic in his head without method and possessed of little genius he wrote latin verses from time to time and published a set in his old age which he called senilia in which he shows so little learning or taste in writing as to make carteret a dactyl  in matters of genealogy it is necessary to give the bare names as they are but in poetry and in prose of any elegance in the writing they require to have inflection given to them  his book of the dialects is a sad heap of confusion the only way to write on them is to tabulate them with notes added at the bottom of the page and references  it may be questioned whether there is not some mistake as to the methods of employing the poor seemingly on a supposition that there is a certain portion of work left undone for want of persons to do it but if that is otherwise and all the materials we have are actually worked up or all the manufactures we can use or dispose of are already executed then what is given to the poor who are to be set at work must be taken from some who now have it as time must be taken for learning according to sir william pettys observation a certain part of those very materials that as it is are properly worked up must be spoiled by the unskilfulness of novices we may apply to wellmeaning but misjudging persons in particular of this nature what giannone said to a monk who wanted what he called to convert him tu se santo ma tu non se filosofo  it is an unhappy circumstance that one might give away five hundred pounds in a year to those that importune in the streets and not do any good  there is nothing more likely to betray a man into absurdity than condescension when he seems to suppose his understanding too powerful for his company  having asked mr langton if his father and mother had sat for their pictures which he thought it right for each generation of a family to do and being told they had opposed it he said sir among the infractuosities of the human mind i know not if it may not be one that there is a superstitious reluctance to sit for a picture  john gilbert cooper related that soon after the publication of his dictionary garrick being asked by johnson what people said of it told him that among other animadversions it was objected that he cited authorities which were beneath the dignity of such a work and mentioned richardson nay said johnson i have done worse than that i have cited thee david  talking of expense he observed with what munificence a great merchant will spend his money both from his having it at command and from his enlarged views by calculation of a good effect upon the whole whereas said he you will hardly ever find a country gentleman who is not a good deal disconcerted at an unexpected occasion for his being obliged to lay out ten pounds  when in good humor he would talk of his own writings with a wonderful frankness and candor and would even criticize them with the closest severity one day having read over one of his ramblers mr langton asked him how he liked that paper he shook his head and answered too wordy and at another time when one was reading his tragedy of irene to a company at a house in the country he left the room and somebody having asked him the reason of this he replied sir i thought it had been better  talking of a point of delicate scrupulosity of moral conduct he said to mr langton men of harder minds than ours will do many things from which you and i would shrink yet sir they will perhaps do more good in life than we but let us try to help one another if there be a wrong twist it may be set right it is not probable that two people can be wrong the same way  of the preface to capels shakspeare he said if the man would have come to me i would have endeavored to endow his purposes with words for as it is he does gabble monstrously  he related that he had once in a dream a contest of wit with some other person and that he was very much mortified by imagining that his opponent had the better of him now said he one may mark here the effect of sleep in weakening the power of reflection for had not my judgment failed me i should have seen that the wit of this supposed antagonist by whose superiority i felt myself depressed was as much furnished by me as that which i thought i had been uttering in my own character  one evening in company an ingenious and learned gentleman read a letter of compliment to him from one of the professors of a foreign university johnson in an irritable fit thinking there was too much ostentation said i never receive any of these tributes of applause from abroad one instance i recollect of a foreign publication in which mention is made of lillustre lockman  of sir joshua reynolds he said sir i know no man who has passed through life with more observation than reynolds  he repeated to mr langton with great energy in the greek our saviors gracious expression concerning the forgiveness of mary magdalen  thy faith has saved thee go in peace luke vii  0  he said the manner of this dismission is exceedingly affecting  he thus defined the difference between physical and moral truth physical truth is when you tell a thing as it actually is moral truth is when you tell a thing sincerely and precisely as it appears to you i say such a one walked across the street if he really did so i told a physical truth if i thought so though i should have been mistaken i told a moral truth  huggins the translator of ariosto and mr thomas warton in the early part of his literary life had a dispute concerning that poet of whom mr warton in his observations on spencers fairy queen gave some account which huggins attempted to answer with violence and said i will militate no longer against his nescience huggins was master of the subject but wanted expression mr wartons knowledge of it was then imperfect but his manner lively and elegant johnson said it appears to me that huggins has ball without powder and warton powder without ball  talking of the farce of high life below stairs he said here is a farce which is really very diverting when you see it acted and yet one may read it and not know that one has been reading any thing at all  he used at one time to go occasionally to the greenroom of drury lane theater where he was much regarded by the players and was very easy and facetious with them he had a very high opinion of mrs clives comic powers and conversed more with her than with any of them he said clive sir is a good thing to sit by she always understands what you say and she said of him i love to sit by dr johnson he always entertains me one night when the recruiting officer was acted he said to mr holland who had been expressing an apprehension that dr johnson would disdain the works of farquhar no sir i think farquhar a man whose writings have considerable merit  his friend garrick was so busy in conducting the drama that they could not have so much intercourse as mr garrick used to profess an anxious wish that there should be there might indeed be something in the contemptuous severity as to the merit of acting which his old preceptor nourished in himself that would mortify garrick after the great applause which he received from the audience for though johnson said of him sir a man who has a nation to admire him every night may well be expected to be somewhat elated yet he would treat theatrical matters with a iudicrous slight he mentioned one evening i met david coming off the stage dressed in a womans ridinghood when he acted in the wonder i came full upon him and i believe he was not pleased  once he asked tom davies whom he saw dressed in a fine suit of clothes and what art thou tonight tom answered the thane of ross which it will be recollected is a very inconsiderable character o brave said johnson  of mr longley at rochester a gentleman of very considerable learning whom dr johnson met there he said my heart warms toward him i was surprised to find in him such a nice acquaintance with the meter in the learned languages though i was somewhat mortified that i had it not so much to myself as i should have thought  talking of the minuteness with which people will record the sayings of eminent persons a story was told that when pope was on a visit to spence at oxford as they looked from the window they saw a gentleman commoner who was just come in from riding amusing himself with whipping at a post pope took occasion to say that young gentleman seems to have little to do mr beauclerk observed then to be sure spence turned round and wrote that down and went on to say to dr johnson pope sir would have said the same of you if he had seen you distilling johnson sir if pope had told me of my distilling i would have told him of his grotto  he would allow no settled indulgence of idleness upon principle and always repelled every attempt to urge excuses for it a friend one day suggested that it was not wholesome to study soon after dinner johnson ah sir dont give way to such a fancy at one time of my life i had taken it into my head that it was not wholesome to study between breakfast and dinner  mr beauclerk one day repeated to dr johnson popes lines let modest foster if he will excel ten metropolitans in preaching well then asked the doctor why did pope say this johnson sir he hoped it would vex somebody  dr goldsmith upon occasion of mrs lennoxs bringing out a play said to dr johnson at the club that a person had advised him to go and hiss it because she had attacked shakspeare in her book called shakspeare illustrated johnson and did not you tell him that he was a rascal goldsmith no sir i did not perhaps he might not mean what he said johnson nay sir if he lied it is a different thing colman slily said but it is believed dr johnson did not hear him then the proper expression should have been  sir if you dont lie youre a rascal  his affection for topham beauclerk was so great that when beauclerk was laboring under that severe illness which at last occasioned his death johnson said with a voice faultering with emotion sir i would walk to the extent of the diameter of the earth to save beauclerk  one night at the club he produced a translation of an epitaph which lord elibank had written in english for his lady and requested of johnson to turn into latin for him having read domina de north et gray he said to dyer you see sir what barbarisms we are compelled to make use of when modern titles are to be specifically mentioned in latin inscriptions when he had read it once aloud and there had been a general approbation expressed by the company he addressed himself to mr dyer in particular and said sir i beg to have your judgment for i know your nicety dyer then very properly desired to read it over again which having done he pointed out an incongruity in one of the sentences johnson immediately assented to the observation and said sir this is owing to an alteration of a part of the sentence from the form in which i had first written it and i believe sir you may have remarked that it is a very frequent cause of error in composition when one has made a partial change without a due regard to the general structure of the sentence  johnson was well acquainted with mr dossie author of a treatise on agriculture and said of him sir of the objects which the society of arts have chiefly in view the chemical effects of bodies operating upon other bodies he knows more than almost any man johnson in order to give mr dossie his vote to be a member of this society paid up an arrear which had run on for two years on this occasion he mentioned a circumstance as characteristick of the scotch one of that nation said he who had been a candidate against whom i had voted came up to me with a civil salutation now sir this is their way an englishman would have stomached it and been sulky and never have taken further notice of you but a scotchman sir though you vote nineteen times against him will accost you with equal complaisance after each time and the twentieth time sir he will get your vote  talking on the subject of toleration one day when some friends were with him in his study he made his usual remark that the state has a right to regulate the religion of the people who are the children of the state a clergyman having readily acquiesced in this johnson who loved discussion observed but sir you must go round to other states than our own you do not know what a bramin has to say for himself in short sir i have got no farther than this every man has a right to utter what he thinks truth and every other man has a right to knock him down for it martyrdom is the test  a man he observed should begin to write soon for if he waits till his judgment is matured his inability through want of practice to express his conceptions will make the disproportion so great between what he sees and what he can attain that he will probably be discouraged from writing at all as a proof of the justness of this remark we may instance what is related of the great lord granville that after he had written his letter giving an account of the battle of dettingen he said here is a letter expressed in terms not good enough for a tollowchandler to have used  talking of a court martial that was sitting upon a very momentous public occasion he expressed much doubt of an enlightened decision and said that perhaps there was not a member of it who in the whole course of his life had ever spent an hour by himself in balancing probabilities  goldsmith one day brought to the club a printed ode which he with others had been hearing read by its author in a public room at the rate of five shillings each for admission one of the company having read it aloud dr johnson said bolder words and more timorous meaning i think never were brought together  talking of grays odes he said they are forced plants raised in a hotbed and they are poor plants they are but cucumbers after all a gentleman present who had been running down odewriting in general as a bad species of poetry unluckily said had they been literally cucumbers they had been better things than odes  yes sir said johnson for a hog  his distinction of the different degrees of attainment of learning was thus marked upon two occasions of queen elizabeth he said she had learning enough to have given dignity to a bishop and of mr thomas davies he said sir davies has learning enough to give credit to a clergyman  he used to quote with great warmth the saying of aristotle recorded by diogenes laertius that there was the same difference between one learned and unlearned as between the living and the dead  it is very remarkable that he retained in his memory very slight and trivial as well as important things as an instance of this it seems that an inferior domestic of the duke of leeds had attempted to celebrate his graces marriage in such homely rhymes as he could make and this curious composition having been sung to dr johnson he got it by heart and used to repeat it in a very pleasant manner two of the stanzas were these when the duke of leeds shall married be to a fine young lady of high quality how happy will that gentlewoman be in his grace of leedss good company she shall have all that is fine and fair and the best of silk and satin shall wear and ride in a coach to take the air and have a house in st jamesssquare to hear a man of the weight and dignity of johnson repeating such humble attempts at poetry had a very amusing effect he however seriously observed of the last stanza that it nearly comprised all the advantages that wealth can give  an eminent foreigner when he was shown the british museum was very troublesome with many absurd inquiries now there sir said he is the difference between an englishman and a frenchman a frenchman must be always talking whether he knows any thing of the matter or not an englishman is content to say nothing when he has nothing to say  his unjust contempt for foreigners was indeed extreme one evening at old slaughters coffeehouse when a number of them were talking loud about little matters he said does not this confirm old meynells observation  for any thing i see foreigners are fools  he said that once when he had a violent toothache a frenchman accosted him thus ah monsieur vous etudiez trop  having spent an evening at mr langtons with the reverend dr parr he was much pleased with the conversation of that learned gentleman and after he was gone said to mr langton sir i am obliged to you for having asked me this evening parr is a fair man i do not know when i have had an occasion of such free controversy it is remarkable how much of a mans life may pass without meeting with any instance of this kind of open discussion  we may fairly institute a criticism between shakspeare and corneille as they both had though in a different degree the lights of a latter age it is not so just between the greek dramatick writers and shakspeare it may be replied to what is said by one of the remarkers on shakspeare that though dariuss shade had prescience it does not necessarily follow that he had all past particulars revealed to him  spanish plays being wildly and improbably farcical would please children here as children are entertained with stories full of prodigies their experience not being sufficient to cause them to be so readily startled at deviations from the natural course of life the machinery of the pagans is uninteresting to us when a goddess appears in homer or virgil we grow weary still more so in the grecian tragedies as in that kind of composition a nearer approach to nature is intended yet there are good reasons for reading romances as the fertility of invention the beauty of style and expression the curiosity of seeing with what kind of performances the age and country in which they were written was delighted for it is to be apprehended that at the time when very wild improbable tales were well received the people were in a barbarous state and so on the footing of children as has been explained  it is evident enough that no one who writes now can use the pagan deities and mythology the only machinery therefore seems that of ministering spirits the ghosts of the departed witches and fairies though these latter as the vulgar superstition concerning them which while in its force infected at least the imagination of those that had more advantage in education and only their reason set them free from it is every day wearing out seem likely to be of little further assistance in the machinery of poetry as i recollect hammond introduces a hag or witch into one of his love elegies where the effect is unmeaning and disgusting  the man who uses his talent of ridicule in creating or grossly exaggerating the instances he gives who imputes absurdities that did not happen or when a man was a little ridiculous describes him as having been very much so abuses his talents greatly the great use of delineating absurdities is that we may know how far human folly can go the account therefore ought of absolute necessity to be faithful a certain character naming the person as to the general cast of it is well described by garrick but a great deal of the phraseology he uses in it is quite his own particularly in the proverbial comparisons obstinate as a pig etc but i dont know whether it might not be true of him that from a too great eagerness for praise and popularity and a politeness carried to a ridiculous excess he was likely after asserting a thing in general to give it up again in parts for instance if he had said reynolds was the first of painters he was capable enough of giving up as objections might happen to be severally made first his outline  then the grace in form  then the coloring  and lastly to have owned that he was such a mannerist that the disposition of his pictures was all alike  for hospitality as formerly practiced there is no longer the same reason heretofore the poorer people were more numerous and from want of commerce their means of getting a livelihood more difficult therefore the supporting them was an act of great benevolence now that the poor can find maintenance for themselves and their labor is wanted a general undiscerning hospitality tends to ill by withdrawing them from their work to idleness and drunkenness then formerly rents were received in kind so that there was a great abundance of provisions in possession of the owners of the lands which since the plenty of money afforded by commerce is no longer the case  hospitality to strangers and foreigners in our country is now almost at an end since from the increase of them that come to us there have been a sufficient number of people that have found an interest in providing inns and proper accommodations which is in general a more expedient method for the entertainment of travelers where the travelers and strangers are few more of that hospitality subsists as it has not been worth while to provide places of accommodation in ireland there is still hospitality to strangers in some degree in hungary and poland probably more  colman in a note on his translation of terence talking of shakspeares learning asks what says farmer to this  what says johnson upon this he observed sir let farmer answer for himself i never engaged in this controversy i always said shakspeare had latin enough to grammatticise his english  a clergyman whom he characterised as one who loved to say little oddities was affecting one day at a bishops table a sort of slyness and freedom not in character and repeated as if part of the old mans wish a song by dr walter pope a verse bordering on licentiousness johnson rebuked him in the finest manner by first showing him that he did not know the passage he was aiming at and thus humbling him sir that is not the song it is thus and he gave it right then looking steadfastly on him sir there is a part of that song which i should wish to exemplify in my own life may i govern my passions with absolute sway   being asked if barnes knew a good deal of greek he answered i doubt sir he was unoculus inter caecos  he used frequently to observe that men might be very eminent in a profession without our perceiving any particular power of mind in them in conversation it seems strange said he that a man should see so far to the right who sees so short a way to the left burke is the only man whose common conversation corresponds with the general fame which he had in the world take up whatever topic you please he is ready to meet you  a gentleman by no means deficient in literature having discovered less acquaintance with one of the classicks than johnson expected when the gentleman left the room he observed you see now how little any body reads mr langton happening to mention his having read a good deal in clinarduss greek grammar why sir said he who is there in this town who knows any thing of clinardus but you and i and upon mr langtons mentioning that he had taken the pains to learn by heart the epistle of st basil which is given in that grammar as a praxis sir said he i never made such an effort to attain greek  of dodsleys publick virtue a poem he said it was fine blank meaning to express his usual contempt for blank verse however this miserable poem did not sell and my poor friend doddy said public virtue was not a subject to interest the age  mr langton when a very young man read dodsleys cleone a tragedy to him not aware of his extreme impatience to be read to as it went on he turned his face to the back of his chair and put himself into various attitudes which marked his uneasiness at the end of an act however he said come let us have some more let us go into the slaughterhouse again lanky but i am afraid there is more blood than brains yet he afterward said when i heard you read it i thought higher of its power of language when i read it myself i was more sensible of its pathetick effect and then paid it a compliment which many will think very extravagant sir said he if otway had written this play no other of his pieces would have been remembered dodsley himself upon this being repeated to him said it was too much it must be remembered that johnson always appeared not to be sufficiently sensible of the merit of otway  snatches of reading said he will not make a bentley or a clarke they are however in a certain degree advantageous i would put a child into a library where no unfit books are and let him read at his choice a child should not be discouraged from reading any thing that he takes a liking to from a notion that it is above his reach if that be the case the child will soon find it out and desist if not he of course gains the instruction which is so much the more likely to come from the inclination with which he takes up the study  though he used to censure carelessness with great vehemence he owned that he once to avoid the trouble of locking up five guineas hid them he forgot where so that he could not find them  a gentleman who introduced his brother to dr johnson was earnest to recommend him to the doctors notice which he did by saying when we have sat together some time you will find my brother grow very entertaining  sir said johnson i can wait  when the rumor was strong that we should have a war because the french would assist the americans he rebuked a friend with some asperity for supposing it saying no sir national faith is not yet sunk so low  in the latter part of his life in order to satisfy himself whether his mental faculties were impaired he resolved that he would try to learn a new language and fixed upon the low dutch for that purpose and this he continued till he had read about one half of thomas a kempis and finding that there appeared no abatement of his power of acquisition he then desisted as thinking the experiment had been duly tried mr burke justly observed that this was not the most vigorous trial low dutch being a language so near to our own had it been one of the languages entirely different he might have been very soon satisfied  mr langton and he having gone to see a freemasons funeral procession when they were at rochester and some solemn music being played on frenchhorns he said this is the first time that i have ever been affected by musical sounds adding that the impression made upon him was of a melancholy kind mr langton saying that this effect was a fine one johnson yes if it softens the mind so as to prepare it for the reception of salutary feelings it may be good but inasmuch as it is melancholy per se it is bad  goldsmith had long a visionary project that some time or other when his circumstances should be easier he would go to aleppo in order to acquire a knowledge as far as might be of any arts peculiar to the east and introduce them into britain when this was talked of in dr johnsons company he said of all men goldsmith is the most unfit to go out upon such an inquiry for he is utterly ignorant of such arts as we already possess and consequently could not know what would be accessions to our present stock of mechanical knowledge sir he would bring home a grindingbarrow which you see in every street in london and think that he had furnished a wonderful improvement  greek sir said he is like lace every man gets as much of it as he can  when lord charles hay after his return from america was preparing his defense to be offered to the court martial which he had demanded having heard mr langton as high in expressions of admiration of johnson as he usually was he requested that dr johnson might be introduced to him and mr langton having mentioned it to johnson he very kindly and readily agreed and being presented to his lordship while under arrest by mr langton he saw him several times upon one of which occasions lord charles read to him what he had prepared which johnson signified his approbation of saying it is a very good soldierly defense johnson said that he had advised his lordship that as it was in vain to contend with those who were in possession of power if they would offer him the rank of lieutenant general and a government it would be better judged to desist from urging his complaints it is well known that his lordship died before the trial came on  johnson one day gave high praise to dr bentleys verses dr johnson in his life of cowley says that these are the only english verses which bentley is known to have written i shall here insert them and hope my readers will apply them  who strives to mount parnassus hill and thence poetic laurels bring must first acquire due force and skill must fly with swans or eagles wing who natures treasures would explore her mysteries and arcana know must high as lofty newton soar must stoop as delving woodward low who studies ancient laws and rites tongues arts and arms and history must drudge like seldon days and nights and in the endless labor die who travels in religious jars truth mixed with error shades with rays like whiston wanting pyx or stars in ocean wide or sinks or strays but grant our heros hope long toil and comprehensive genius crown all sciences all arts his spoil yet what reward or what renown envy innate in vulgar souls envy steps in and stops his rise envy with poisoned tarnish fouls his luster and his worth decries he lives inglorious or in want to college and old books confined instead of learned he is called pedant dunces advanced he is left behind yet left content a genuine stoic he great without patron rich without south sea  in dodsleys collection which he recited with his usual energy dr adam smith who was present observed in his decisive professorial manner very well  very well johnson however added yes they are very well sir but you may observe in what manner they are well they are the forcible verses of a man of a strong mind but not accustomed to write verse for there is some uncouthness in the expression  drinking tea one day at garricks with mr langton he was questioned if he was not somewhat of a heretic as to shakspeare said garrick i doubt he is a little of an infidel  sir said johnson i will stand by the lines i have written on shakspeare in my prologue at the opening of your theater mr langton suggested that in the line and panting time toiled after him in vain johnson might have had in his eye the passage in the tempest where prospero says of miranda   she will outstrip all praise and make it halt behind her johnson said nothing garrick then ventured to observe i do not think that the happiest line in the praise of shakspeare johnson exclaimed smiling prosaical rogues next time i write i will make both time and space pant i am sorry to see in the transactions of the royal society of edinburgh vol ii an essay on the character of hamlet written i should suppose by a very young man though called reverend who speaks with presumptuous petulance of the first literary character of his age amidst a cloudy confusion of words which has of late too often passed in scotland for metaphysics he thus ventures to criticize one of the noblest lines in our language  dr johnson has remarked that time toiled after him in vain but i should apprehend that this is entirely to mistake the character time toils after every great man as well as after shakspeare the workings of an ordinary mind keep pace indeed with time they move no faster they have their beginning their middle and their end but superior natures can reduce these into a point they do no not indeed suppress them but they suspnd or they lock them up in the breast the learned society under whose sanction such gabble is ushered into the world would do well to offer a premium to any one who will discover its meaning   it is well known that there was formerly a rude custom for those who were sailing upon the thames to accost each other as they passed in the most abusive language they could invent generally however with as much satirical humor as they were capable of producing addison gives a specimen of this ribaldry in number     of the spectator when sir roger de coverley and he are going to springgarden johnson was once eminently successful in this species of contest a fellow having attacked him with some coarse raillery johnson answered thus sir your wife under pretense of keeping a bawdy house is a receiver of stolengoods one evening when he and mr burke and mr langton were in company together and the admirable scolding of timon of athens was mentioned this instance of johnsons was quoted and thought to have at least equal excellence  as johnson always allowed the extraordinary talents of mr burke so mr burke was fully sensible of the wonderful powers of johnson mr langton recollects having passed an evening with both of them when mr burke repeatedly entered upon topics which it was evident he would have illustrated with extensive knowledge and richness of expression but johnson always seized upon the conversation in which however he acquitted himself in a most masterly manner as mr burke and mr langton were walking home mr burke observed that johnson had been very great that night mr langton joined in this but added he could have wished to hear more from another person plainly intimating that he meant mr burke o no said mr burke it is enough for me to have rung the bell to him  talking of dr blagdens copiousness and precision of communication dr johnson said blagden sir is a delightful fellow  this year the reverend dr franklin having published a translation of lucian inscribed to him the demonax thus  to dr samuel johnson the demonax of the present age this piece is inscribed by a sincere admirer of his respectable talents  the translator  though upon a particular comparison of demonax and johnson there does not seem to be a great deal of similarity between them this dedication is a just compliment from the general character given by lucian of the ancient sage  the best philosopher whom i have ever seen or known  lives of the poets of which he gives this account sometime in march i finished the lives of the poets which i wrote in my usual way dilatorily and hastily unwilling to work and working with vigor and haste prayers and meditations p   0  in a memorandum previous to this he says of them written i hope in such a manner as may tend to the promotion of piety ibid       this is the work which of all dr johnsons writings will perhaps be read most generally and with most pleasure philology and biography were his favorite pursuits and those who lived most in intimacy with him heard him upon all occasions when there was a proper opportunity take delight in expatiating upon the various merits of the english poets upon the niceties of their characters and the events of their progress through the world which they contributed to illuminate his mind was so full of that kind of information and it was so well arranged in his memory that in performing what he had undertaken in this way he had little more to do than to put his thoughts upon paper exhibiting first each poets life and then subjoining a critical examination of his genius and works but when he began to write the subject swelled in such a manner that instead of prefaces to each poet of no more than a few pages as he had originally intended his design is thus announced in his adrtisement the booksellers having determined to publish a body of english poetry i was persuaded to promise them a preface to the works of each author an undertaking as it was then presented to my mind not very tedious or difficult  my purpose was only to have allotted to every poet an advertisement like that which we find in the french miscellanies containing a few dates and a general character but i have been led beyond my intention i hope by the honest desire of giving useful pleasure    he produced an ample rich latius se tamen aperiente materia plus quam imponebatur oneris sponte suscepi the booksellers justly sensible of the great additional value of the copyright presented him with another hundred pounds over and above two hundred for which his agreement was to furnish such prefaces as he thought fit  this was however but a small recompense for such a collection of biography and such principles and illustrations of criticism as if digested and arranged in one system by some modern aristotle or longinus might form a code upon that subject such as no other nation can show as he was so good as to make me a present of the greatest part of the original and indeed only manuscript of this admirable work i have an opportunity of observing with wonder the correctness with which he rapidly struck off such glowing composition he may be assimilated to the lady in waller who could impress with love at first sight  some other nymphs with colors faint and pencil slow may cupid paint and a weak heart in time destroy she has a stamp and prints the boy that he however had a good deal of trouble and some anxiety in carrying on the work we see from a series of his notes to mr nichols the printer thus  in the life of waller mr nichols will find a reference to the parliamentary history from which a long quotation is to be inserted if mr nichols cannot easily find the book mr johnson will send it from streatham  clarendon is here returned  by some accident i laid your note upon duke up so safely that i cannot find it your informations have been of great use to me i must beg it again with another list of our authors for i have laid that with the other i have sent stepneys epitaph let me have the revises as soon as can be dec       i have sent philips with his epitaphs to be inserted the fragment of a preface is hardly worth the impression but that we may seem to do something it may be added to the life of philips the latin page is to be added to the life of smith i shall be at home to revise the two sheets of milton march         please to get me the last edition of hughess letters and try to get dennis upon blackmore and upon cato and any thing of the same writer against pope our materials are defective  as waller professed to have imitated fairfax do you think a few pages of fairfax would enrich our edition few readers have seen it and it may please them but it is not necessary  an account of the lives and works of some of the most eminent english poets by etc  the english poets biographically and critically considered by sam johnson  let mr nichols take his choice or make another to his mind may       you somehow forgot the advertisement for the new edition it was not enclosed of gays letters i see not that any use can be made for they give no information of any thing that he was a member of the philosophical society is something but surely he could be but a corresponding member however not having his life here i know not how to put it in and it is of little importance  see several more in the gentlemans magazine      the editor of that miscellany in which johnson wrote for several years seems justly to think that every fragment of so great a man is worthy of being preserved    whose variety of literary inquiry and obliging disposition rendered him very useful to johnson mr steevens appears from the papers in my possession to have supplied him with some anecdotes and quotations and i observe the fair hand of mrs thrale as one of his copyists of select passages  it is not my intention to dwell upon each of johnsons lives of the poets or attempt an analysis of their merits which were i able to do it would take up too much room in this work yet i shall make a few observations upon some of them and insert a few various readings  the life of cowley he himself considered as the best of the whole on account of the dissertation which it contains on the metaphysical poets dryden whose critical abilities were equal to his poetical had mentioned them in one of his excellent prefatory discourses to his plays but had barely mentioned them johnson has exhibited them at large with such happy illustration from their writings and in so luminous a manner that indeed he may be allowed the full merit of novelty to have discovered to us as it were a new planet in the poetical hemisphere  it is remarked by johnson in considering the works of a poet life of sheffield  that amendments are seldom made without some token of a rent but i do not find that this is applicable to prose we shall see that though his amendments in this work are for the better there is nothing of the pannus assutus the texture is uniform and indeed what has been there at first is very seldom unfit to have remained  various readings the original reading is enclosed in brackets and the present one is printed in italicks in the life of cowley all future votaries of that may hereafter pant for solitude  to conceive and execute the agitation or perception pains and the pleasures of other minds  the wide effulgence of the blazing a summer noon  in the life of waller johnson gives a distinct and animated narrative of public affairs in that variegated period with strong yet nice touches of character and having a fair opportunity to display his political principles does it with an unqualified manly confidence and satisfies his readers how nobly he might have executed a tory history of his country  so easy is his style in these lives that i do not recollect more than three uncommon or learned words one when giving an account of the approach of wallers mortal disease he says he found his legs grow tumid by using the expression his legs swelled he would have avoided this and there would have been no impropriety in its being followed by the interesting question to his physician what that swelling meant another when he mentions that pope had emitted proposals when published or issued would have been more readily understood and a third when he calls orrery and dr delany writers both undoubtedly veracious when true honest or faithful might have been used yet it must be owned that none of these are hard or too big words that custom would make them seem as easy as any others and that a language is richer and capable of more beauty of expression by having a greater variety of synonimes  his dissertation upon the unfitness of poetry for the aweful subjects of our holy religion though i do not entirely agree with him has all the merit of originality with uncommon force of reasoning  various readings in the life of waller consented to the insertion of their names their own nomination  after paying a fine of ten thousand pounds  congratulating charles the second on his coronation recovered right  he that has flattery ready for all whom the vicissitudes of the world happen to exalt must be confessed to degrade his powers scorned as a prostituted mind  the characters by which waller intended to distinguish his writings are elegance sprightliness and dignity  blossoms to be valued only as they fetch foretell fruits  images such as the superficies of nature easily readily supplies  his some applications are sometimes may be thought too remote and unconsequential  his images are sometimes confused not always distinct  against his life of milton the hounds of whiggism have opened in full cry but of miltons great excellence as a poet where shall we find such a blazon as by the hand of johnson i shall select only the following passage concerning paradise lost  fancy can hardly forbear to conjecture with what temper milton surveyed the silent progress of his work and marked his reputation stealing its way in a kind of subterraneous current through fear and silence i cannot but conceive him calm and confident little disappointed not at all dejected relying on his own merit with steady consciousness and waiting without impatience the vicissitudes of opinion and the impartiality of a future generation  indeed even dr towers who may be considered as one of the warmest zealots of the revolution society itself allows that johnson has spoken in the highest terms of the abilities of that great poet and has bestowed on his principal poetical compositions the most honorable encomiums see an essay on the life character and writings of dr samuel johnson london      which is very well written making a proper allowance for the democratical bigotry of its author who i cannot however but admire for his liberality in speaking thus of my illustrious friend  he possessed extraordinary powers of understanding which were much cultivated by study and still more by meditation and reflection his memory was remarkably retentive his imagination uncommonly vigorous and his judgment keen and penetrating he had a strong sense of the importance of religion his piety was sincere and sometimes ardent and his zeal for the interests of virtue was often manifested in his conversation and in his writings the same energy which was displayed in his literary productions was exhibited also in his conversation which was various striking and instructive and perhaps no man ever equalled him for nervous and pointed repartees  his dictionary his moral essays and his productions in polite literature will convey useful instruction and elegant entertainment as long as the language in which they are written shall be understood     that a man who venerated the church and monarchy as johnson did should speak with a just abhorrence of milton as a politician or rather as a daring foe to good polity was surely to be expected and to those who censure him i would recommend his commentary on miltons celebrated complaint of his situation when by the lenity of charles the second a lenity of which as johnson well observes the world has had perhaps no other example he who had written in justification of the murder of his sovereign was safe under an act of oblivion no sooner is he safe than he finds himself in danger fallen on evil days and evil tongues and with darkness and with danger compassed round this darkness had his eyes been better employed had undoubtedly deserved compassion but to add the mention of danger was ungrateful and unjust he was fallen indeed on evil days the time was come in which regicides could no longer boast their wickedness but of evil tongues to complain required impudence at least equal to his other powers milton whose warmest advocates must allow that he never spared any asperity of reproach or brutality of insolence  i have indeed often wondered how milton an acrimonious and surly republican a man who in his domestic relations was so severe and arbitrary and whose head was filled with the hardest and most dismal tenets of calvinism should have been such a poet should not only have written with sublimity but with beauty and even gayety should have exquisitely painted the sweetest sensations of which our nature is capable imaged the delicate raptures of connubial love nay seemed to be animated with all the spirit of revelry it is a proof that in the human mind the departments of judgment and imagination perception and temper may sometimes be divided by strong partitions and that the light and shade in the same character may be kept so distinct as never to be blended  in the life of milton johnson took occasion to maintain his own and the general opinion of the excellence of rhyme over blank verse in english poetry and quotes this apposite illustration of it by an ingenious critic that it seems to be verse only to the eye one of the most natural instances of the effect of blank verse happened to the late earl of hopeton his lordship observed one of his shepherds poring in the fields upon miltons paradise lost and having asked him what book it was the man answered ant please your lordship this is a very odd sort of an author he would fain rhyme but cannot get at it  the gentleman whom he thus characterises is as he told mr seward mr lock of norbury park in surrey whose knowledge and taste in the fine arts is universally celebrated with whose elegance of manners the writer of the present work has felt himself much impressed and to whose virtues a common friend who has known him long and is not much addicted to flattery gives the highest testimony  various readings in the life of milton i cannot find any meaning but this which his most bigoted advocates even kindness and reverence can give  perhaps no scarcely any man ever wrote so much and praised so few  a certain rescue preservative from oblivion  let me not be censured for this digression as contracted pedantick or paradoxical  socrates rather was of opinion that what we had to learn was how to obtain and communicate happiness do good and avoid evil  its elegance who can exhibit is less attainable  i could with pleasure expatiate upon the masterly execution of the life of dryden which we have seen see page    of this volume was one of johnsons literary projects at an early period and which it is remarkable that after desisting from it from a supposed scantiness of materials he should at an advanced age have performed so amply  his defense of that great poet against the illiberal attacks upon him as if his embracing the roman catholic communion had been a timeserving measure is a piece of reasoning at once able and candid indeed dryden himself in his hind and panther has given such a picture of his mind that they who know the anxiety for repose as to the aweful subject of our state beyond the grave though they may think his opinion illfounded must think charitably of his sentiment  but gracious god how well do thou provide for erring judgments an unerring guide thy throne is darkness in the abyss of light a blaze of glory that forbids the sight o teach me to believe thee thus concealed and search no farther than thyself revealed but her alone for my director take whom thou have promised never to forsake my thoughtless youth was winged with vain desires my manhood long misled by wandering fires followed false lights and when their glimpse was gone my pride struck out new sparkles of her own such was i such by nature still i am be thine the glory and be mine the shame good life be now my task my doubts are done what more could shock my faith than three in one in drawing drydens character johnson has given though i suppose unintentionally some touches of his own thus the power that predominated in his intellectual operations was rather strong reason than quick sensibility upon all occasions that were presented he studied rather than felt and produced sentiments not such as nature enforces but meditation supplies with the simple and elemental passions as they spring separate in the mind he seems not much acquainted he is therefore with all his variety of excellence not often pathetick and had so little sensibility of the power of effusions purely natural that he did not esteem them in others  it may indeed be observed that in all the numerous writings of johnson whether in prose or verse and even in his tragedy of which the subject is the distress of an unfortunate princess there is not a single passage that ever drew a tear  various readings in the life of dryden the reason of this general perusal addison has attempted to find in derive from the delight which the mind feels in the investigation of secrets  his best actions are but convenient inability of wickedness  when once he had engaged himself in disputation matter thoughts flowed in on either side  the abyss of unideal emptiness vacancy  these like many other harlots the harlots of other men had his love though not his approbation  he sometimes displays descends to display his knowledge with pedantick ostentation  french words which were then used in had then crept into conversation  the life of pope was written by johnson con amore both from the early possession which that writer had taken of his mind and from the pleasure which he must have felt in for ever silencing all attempts to lessen his poetical fame by demonstrating his excellence and pronouncing a triumphant apotheosis  after all this it is surely superfluous to answer the question that has once been asked whether pope was a poet otherwise than by asking in return if pope be not a poet where is poetry to be found to circumscribe poetry by a definition will only show the narrowness of the definer though a definition which shall exclude pope will not easily be made let us look round upon the present time and back upon the past let enquire to whom the voice of mankind has decreed the wreath of poetry let their productions be examined and their claims stated and the pretensions of pope will be no more disputed  i remember once to have heard johnson say sir a thousand years may elapse before there shall appear another man with a power of versification equal to that of pope that power must undoubtedly be allowed its due share in enhancing the value of his captivating composition  johnson who had done liberal justice to warburton in his edition of shakspeare which was published during the life of that powerful writer with still greater liberality took an opportunity of paying the tribute due to him when he was no longer in high place but numbered with the dead of johnsons conduct toward warburton a very honorable notice is taken by the editor of tracts by warburton and a warburtonian not admitted into the collection of their respective works after an able and fond though not undistinguishing consideration of warburtons character he says in two immortal works johnson has stood forth in the foremost rank of his admirers by the testimony of such a man impertinence must be abashed and malignity itself must be softened of literary merit johnson as we all know was a sagacious but a most severe judge such was his discernment that he pierced into the most secret springs of human actions and such was his integrity that he always weighed the moral characters of his fellow creatures in the balance of the sanctuary he was too courageous to propitiate a rival and too proud to truckle to a superior warburton he knew as i know him and as every man of sense and virtue would wish to be known  i mean both from his own writings and from the writings of those who dissented from his principles or who envied his reputation but as to favors he had never received or asked any from the bishop of gloucester and if my memory fails me not he had seen him only once when they met almost without design conversed without much effort and parted without any lasting impressions of hatred or affection yet with all the ardour of sympathetick genius johnson has done that spontaneously and ably which by some writers had been before attempted injudiciously and which by others from whom more successful attempts might have been expected has not hitherto been done at all he spoke well of warburton without insulting those whom warburton despised he suppressed not the imperfections of this extraordinary man while he endeavored to do justice to his numerous and transcendental excellencies he defended him when living amidst the clamours of his enemies and praised him when dead amidst the silence of his friends  having availed myself of this editors eulogy on my departed friend for which i warmly thank him let me not suffer the luster of his reputation honestly acquired by profound learning and vigorous eloquence to be tarnished by a charge of illiberality he has been accused of invidiously dragging again into light certain writings of a person respectable by his talents his learning his station and his age which were published a great many years ago and have since it is said been silently given up by their author but when it is considered that these writings were not sins of youth but deliberate works of one well advanced in life overflowing at once with flattery to a great man of great interest in the church and with unjust and acrimonious abuse of two men of eminent merit and that though it would have been unreasonable to expect an humiliating recantation no apology whatever has been made in the cool of the evening for the oppressive fervor of the heat of the day no slight relenting indication has appeared in any note or any corner of later publications is it not fair to understand him as superciliously persevering when he allows the shafts to remain in the wounds and will not stretch forth a lenient hand is it wrong is it not generous to become an indignant avenger     it seems strange that two such men as johnson and warburton who lived in the same age and country should not only not have been in any degree of intimacy but been almost personally unacquainted but such instances though we must wonder at them are not rare if i am rightly informed after a careful inquiry they never met but once which was at the house of mrs french in london well known for her elegant assemblies and bringing eminent characters together the interview proved to be mutually agreeable  i am well informed that warburton said of johnson i admire him but i cannot bear his style and that johnson being told of this said that is exactly my case as to him the manner in which he expressed his admiration of the fertility of warburtons genius and of the variety of his materials was the table is always full sir he brings things from the north and the south and from every quarter in his divine legation you are always entertained he carries you round and round without carrying you forward to the point but then you have no wish to be carried forward he said to the reverend mr strahan warburton is perhaps the last man who has written with a mind full of reading and reflection  it is remarkable that in the life of broom johnson takes notice of dr warburtons using a mode of expression which he himself used and that not seldom to the great offense of those who did not know him having occasion to mention a note stating the different parts which were executed by the associated translators of the odyssey he says dr warburton told me in his warm language that he thought the relation given in the note a lie the language is warm indeed and i must own cannot be justified in consistency with a decent regard to the established forms of speech johnson had accustomed himself to use the word lie to express a mistake or an error in relation in short when the thing was not so as told though the relator did not mean to deceive when he thought there was intentional falsehood in the relator his expression was he lies and he knows he lies  speaking of popes not having been known to excel in conversation johnson observes that traditional memory retains no sallies of raillery or sentences of observation nothing either pointed or solid wise or merry and that one apophthegm only is recorded in this respect pope differed widely from johnson whose conversation was perhaps more admirable than even his writings however excellent mr wilkes has however favored me with one repartee of pope of which johnson was not informed johnson after justly censuring him for having nursed in his mind a foolish disesteem of kings tells us yet a little regard shown him by the prince of wales melted his obduracy and he had not much to say when he was asked by his royal highness how he could love a prince while he disliked kings the answer which pope made was the young lion is harmless and even playful but when his claws are full grown he becomes cruel dreadful and mischievous  but although we have no collection of popes sayings it is not therefore to be concluded that he was not agreeable in social intercourse for johnson himself has been heard to say that the happiest conversation is that of which nothing is distinctly remembered but a general effect of pleasing impression the late lord somerville let me here express my grateful remembrance of lord somervilles kindness to me at a very early period he was the first person of high rank that took particular notice of me in the way most flattering to a young man fondly ambitious of being distinguished for his literary talents and by the honor of his encouragement made me think well of myself and aspire to deserve it better he had a happy art of communicating his varied knowledge of the world in short remarks and anecdotes with a quiet pleasant gravity that was exceedingly engaging never shall i forget the hours which i enjoyed with him at his apartments in the royal palace of holyrood house and at his seat near edinburgh which he himself had formed with an elegant taste  who saw much both of great and brilliant life told me that he had dined in company with pope and that after dinner the little man as he called him drank his bottle of burgundy and was exceedingly gay and entertaining  i cannot withold from my great friend a censure of at least culpable inattention to a nobleman who it has been shown behaved to him with uncommon politeness he says except lord bathurst none of popes noble friends were such as that a good man would wish to have his intimacy with them known to posterity this will not apply to lord mansfield who was not ennobled in popes lifetime but johnson should have recollected that lord marchmont was one of those noble friends he includes his lordship along with lord bolingbroke in a charge of neglect of the papers which pope left by his will when in truth as i myself pointed out to him before he wrote that poets life the papers were committed to the sole care and judgment of lord bolingbroke unless he lord bolingbroke shall not survive me so that lord marchmont had no concern whatever with them after the first edition of the lives mr malone whose love of justice is equal to his accuracy made in my hearing the same remark to johnson yet he omitted to correct the erroneous statement these particulars i mention in the belief that there was only forgetfulness in my friend but i owe this much to the earl of marchmonts reputation who were there no other memorials will be immortalised by that line of pope in the verses on his grotto and the bright flame was shot through marchmonts soul   various readings in the life of pope somewhat free sufficiently bold in his criticisms  all the gay niceties varieties of diction  strikes the imagination with far more greater force  it is probably certainly the noblest version of poetry which the world has ever seen  every sheet enabled him to write the next with less trouble more facility  no man sympathizes with vanity depressed the sorrows of vanity  it had been criminal less easily excused  when he threatened to lay down talked of laying down his pen  society is so named emphatically in opposition to politically regulated is a state contradistinguished from a state of nature  a fictitious life of an absurd infatuated scholar  a foolish contempt disregard disesteem of kings  his hopes and fears his joys and sorrows were like those of other mortals acted strongly upon his mind  eager to pursue knowledge and attentive to accumulate retain it  a mind excursive active ambitious and adventurous  in its noblest widest searches still longing to go forward  he wrote in such a manner as might expose him to few neglects hazards  the reasonableness justice of my determination  a favourite delicious employment of the poets  more terrifick and more powerful beings phantoms perform on the stormyocean  the inventor of those this petty beings nation  the mind heart naturally loves truth  in the life of addison we find an unpleasing account of his having lent steel a hundred pounds and reclaimed his loan by an execution in the new edition of the biographia britannica the authenticity of this anecdote is denied but mr malone has obliged me with the following note concerning it  many persons having doubts concerning this fact i applied to dr johnson to learn on what authority he asserted it he told me he had it from savage who lived in intimacy with steel and who informed him that steel told him the story with tears in his eyes  ben victor dr johnson said likewise informed him of this remarkable transaction from the relation of mr wilkes the comedian who was also an intimate of steeles  some in defense of addison have said that the act was done with the goodnatured view of rousing steel and correcting that profusion which always made him necessitous  if that were the case said johnson and that he only wanted to alarm steel he would afterward have returned the money to his friend which it is not pretended he did  this too he added might be retorted by an advocate for steel who might allege that he did not repay the loan intentionally merely to see whether addison would be mean and ungenerous enough to make use of legal process to recover it but of such speculations there is no end we cannot dive into the hearts of men but their actions are open to observation  i then mentioned to him that some people thought that mr addisons character was so pure that the fact though true ought to have been suppressed he saw no reason for this if nothing but the bright side of characters should be shown we should sit down in despondency and think it utterly impossible to imitate them in any thing the sacred writers he observed related the vicious as well as the virtuous actions of men which had this moral effect that it kept mankind from despair into which otherwise they would naturally fall were they not supported by the recollection that others had offended like themselves and by penitence and amendment of life had been restored to the favor of heaven  em march         the last paragraph of this note is of great importance and i request that my readers may consider it with particular attention it will be afterward referred to in this work  various readings in the life of addison but he was our first great example he was however one of our earliest

curiosity by gentle and unsuspected conveyance among into the gay the idle and the wealthy  framed rather for those that wish are learning to write  domestic manners scenes  in his life of parnell i wonder that johnson omitted to insert an epitaph which he had long before composed for that amiable man without ever writing it down but which he was so good as at my request to dictate me by which means it has been preserved  hic requiescit thomas parnell s t p qui sacerdos pariter et poeta utrasque parts it a implevit ut neque sacerdoti suavitas poetae nec poetae sacerdotis sanctitas deesset

away all his powers of enjoying either profit or pleasure the death of his wife whom he is said to have lamented with such sorrow as hastened his end i should have thought that johnson who had felt the severe affliction from which parnell never recovered would have preserved this passage  his end whatever was the cause was now approaching  in the hermit the composition narrative as it is less airy is less pleasing  in the life of blackmore we find that writers reputation generously cleared by johnson from the cloud of prejudice which the malignity of contemporary wits had raised around it in this spirited exertion of justice he has been imitated by sir joshua reynolds in his praise of the architecture of vanburgh  we trace johnsons own character in his observation on blackmores magnanimity as an author  the incessant attacks of his enemies whether serious or merry are never discovered to have disturbed his quiet or to have lessened his confidence in himself johnson i recollect once told me laughing heartily that he understood it had been said of him he appears not to feel but when he is alone depend upon it he suffers sadly i am as certain as i can be of any mans

the life of lyttelton johnson seems to have been not favorably disposed toward that nobleman mrs thrale suggests that he was offended by molly astons preference of his lordship to him let not my readers smile to think of johnsons being a candidate for female favor mr peter garrick assured me that he was told by a lady that in her opinion johnson was a very seducing man disadvantages of person and manner may be forgotten where intellectual pleasure is communicated to a susceptible mind and that johnson was capable of feeling the most delicate and disinterested attachment appears from the following letter which is published by mrs thrale with some others to the same person of which the excellence is not so apparent to miss boothby dearest madam january      though i am afraid your illness leaves you little leisure for the reception of airy civilities yet i cannot forbear to pay you my congratulations on the new year and to declare my wishes that your years to come may be many and happy in this wish indeed i include myself who have none but you on whom my heart reposes yet surely i wish your good even though your situation were such as should permit you to communicate no gratifications to dearest dearest madam  your etc sam johnson       i can by no means join the censure bestowed by johnson on his lordship whom he calls poor lyttelton for returning thanks to the critical reviewers for having kindly commended his dialogues of the dead such acknowledgements says my friend never can be proper since they must be paid either for flattery or for justice in my opinion the most upright man who has been tried on a false accusation may when he is acquitted make a bow to his jury and when those who no matter by what right are so much the arbiters of literary merit as in a considerable degree to influence the public opinion review an authors work placido lumine when i am afraid mankind in general are better pleased with severity he may surely express a grateful sense of their civility  various readings in the life of lyttelton he solaced himself his grief by writing a long poem to her memory  the production rather of a mind that means well than thinks vigorously as it seems of leisure than of study rather effusions than compositions  his last literary work production  found the way undertook to persuade  as the introduction to his critical examination of the genius and writings of young he did mr herbert croft then a barrister of lincolns end now a clergyman the honor to adopt a life of young written by that gentleman who was the friend of dr youngs son and wished to vindicate him from some very mistaken remarks to his prejudice mr crofts performance was subjected to the revision of dr johnson as appears from the following note to mr john nichols  this life of dr young was written by a friend of his son what is crossed with black is expunged by the author what is crossed with red is expunged by me if you find any thing more that can be well omitted i shall not be sorry to see it yet shorter  it has always appeared to me to have a considerable share of merit and to display a pretty successful imitation of johnsons style when i mentioned this to a very eminent literary character he opposed me vehemently exclaiming no no it is not a good imitation of johnson it has all his pomp without his force it has all the nodosities of the oak without its strength this was an image so happy that one might have thought he would have been satisfied with it but he was not and setting his mind again to work he added with exquisite felicity it has all the contortions of the sybil without the inspiration  mr croft very properly guards us against supposing that young was a gloomy man and mentions that his parish was indebted to the goodhumour of the author of the night thoughts for an assembly and a bowlinggreen a letter from a noble foreigner is quoted in which he is said to have been very pleasant in conversation  mr langton who frequently visited him informs me that there was an air of benevolence in his manner but that he could obtain from him less information than he had hoped to receive from one who had lived so much in intercourse with the brightest men of what has been called the augustan age of england and that he showed a degree of eager curiosity concerning the common occurrences that were then passing which appeared somewhat remarkable in a man of such intellectual stores of such an advanced age and who had retired from life with declared disappointment in his expectations  an instance at once of his pensive turn of mind and his cheerfulness of temper appeared in a little story which he himself told to mr langton when they were walking in his garden here said he i had put a handsome sundial with this inscription eheu fugaces which speaking with a smile was sadly verified for by the next morning my dial had been carried off  it gives me much pleasure to observe that however johnson may have casually talked yet when he sits as an ardent judge zealous to his trust giving sentence upon the excellent works of young he allows them the high praise to which they are justly entitled the universal passion says he is indeed a very great performance  his distichs have the weight of solid sentiment and his points the sharpness of resistless truth  but i was most anxious concerning johnsons decision upon night thoughts which i esteem as a mass of the grandest and richest poetry that human genius has ever produced and was delighted to find this character of that work in his night thoughts he has exhibited a very wide display of original poetry variegated with deep reflections and striking allusions a wilderness of thought in which the fertility of fancy scatters flowers of every hue and of every odor this is one of the few poems in which blank verse could not be changed for rhyme but with disadvantage and afterward particular lines are not to be regarded the power is in the whole and in the whole there is a magnificence like that ascribed to chinese plantation the magnificence of vast extent and endless diversity  but there is in this poem not only all that johnson so well brings in view but a power of the pathetick beyond almost any example that i have seen he who does not feel his nerves shaken and his heart pierced by many passages in this extraordinary work particularly by that most affecting one which describes the gradual torment suffered by the contemplation of an object of affectionate attachment visibly and certainly decaying into dissolution must be of a hard and obstinate frame  to all the other excellencies of night thoughts let me add the great and peculiar one that they contain not only the noblest sentiments of virtue and the immortality of the soul but the christian sacrifice the divine propitiation with all its interesting circumstances and consolations to a wounded spirit solemnly and poetically displayed in such imagery and language as cannot fail to exalt animate and soothe the truly pious no book whatever can be recommended to young persons with better hopes of seasoning their minds with vital religion than youngs night thoughts  in the life of swift it appears to me that johnson had a certain degree of prejudice against that extraordinary man of which i have elsewhere had occasion to speak mr thomas sheridan imputed it to a supposed apprehension in johnson that swift had not been sufficiently active in obtaining for him an irish degree when it was solicited see page    of vol i  but of this there was not sufficient evidence and let me not presume to charge johnson with injustice because he did not think so highly of the writings of this author as i have done from my youth upwards yet that he had an unfavourable bias is evident were it only from that passage in which he speaks of swifts practice of saving as first ridiculous and at last detestable and yet after some examination of circumstances finds himself obliged to own that it will perhaps appear that he only liked one mode of expense better than another and saved merely that he might have something to give  one observation which johnson makes in swifts life should be often inculcated it may be justly supposed that there was in his conversation what appears so frequently in his letters an affectation of familiarity with the great an ambition of momentary equality sought and enjoyed by the neglect of those ceremonies which custom has established as the barriers between one order of society and another this transgression of regularity was by himself and his admirers termed greatness of soul but a great mind disdains to hold any thing by courtesy and therefore never usurps what a lawful claimant may take away he that encroaches on anothers dignity puts himself in his power he is either repelled with helpless indignity or endured by clemency and condescension  various readings in the life of swift charity may be persuaded to think that it might be written by a man of a peculiar opinions character without ill intention  he did not disown deny it  to by whose kindness it is not unlikely that he was indebted for advanced to his benefices  with for this purpose he had recourse to mr harley  sharp whom he represents describes as the harmless tool of others hate  harley was slow because he was irresolute doubtful  when readers were not many we were not yet a nation of readers  every man who he that could say he knew him  every man of known influence has so many more petitions than which he can cannot grant that he must necessarily offend more than he can gratify gratifies  ecclesiastical preferments benefices  swift procured contrived an interview  as a writer in his works he has given very different specimens  on all common occasions he habitually assumes affects a style of superiority arrogance  by the omission neglect of those ceremonies  that their merits filled the world and or that there was no room for hope of more  i have not confined myself to the order of the lives in making my few remarks indeed a different order is observed in the original publication and in the collection of johnsons works and should it be objected that many of my various readings are inconsiderable those who make the objection will be pleased to consider that such small particulars are intended for those who are nicely critical in composition to whom they will be an acceptable selection  spences anecdotes which are frequently quoted and referred to in johnsons lives of the poets are in a manuscript collection made by the reverend dr joseph spence containing a number of particulars concerning eminent men to each anecdote is marked the name of the person on whose authority it is mentioned this valuable collection is the property of the duke of newcastle who upon the application of sir lucas pepys was pleased to permit it to be put into the hands of dr johnson who i am sorry to think made but an awkward return great assistance says he has been given me by mr spences collection of which i consider the communication as a favor worthy of public acknowledgement but he has not owned to whom he was obliged so that the acknowledgement is unappropriated to his grace  while the world in general was filled with admiration of johnsons lives of the poets there were narrow circles in which prejudice and resentment were fostered and from whence attacks of different sorts issued against him by some violent whigs he was arraigned of injustice to milton by some cambridge men of depreciating gray and his expressing with a dignified freedom what he really thought of george lord lyttelton gave offense to some of the friends of that nobleman and particularly produced a declaration of war against him from mrs montague the ingenious essayist on shakspeare between whom and his lordship a commerce of reciprocal compliments had long been carried on in this war the smaller powers in alliance with him were of course led to engage at least on the defensive and thus i for one was excluded from the enjoyment of a feast of reason such as mr cumberland has described with a keen yet just and delicate pen in his observer these minute inconveniences gave not the least disturbance to johnson he nobly said when i talked to him of the feeble though shrill outcry which had been raised sir i considered myself as entrusted with a certain portion of truth i have given my opinion sincerely let them show where they think me wrong  while my friend is thus contemplated in the splendor derived from his last and perhaps most admirable work i introduce him with peculiar propriety as the correspondent of warren hastings a man whose regard reflects dignity even upon johnson a man the extent of whose abilities was equal to that of his power and who by those who are fortunate enough to know him in private life is admired for his literature and taste and beloved for the candor moderation and mildness of his character were i capable of paying a suitable tribute of admiration to him i should certainly not withhold it at a moment january      when it is not possible that i should be suspected of being an interested flatterer but how weak would be my voice after that of the millions whom he governed his condescending and obliging compliance with my solicitation i with humble gratitude acknowledge and while by publishing his letter to me accompanying the valuable communication i do eminent honor to my great friend i shall entirely disregard any invidious suggestions that as i in some degree participate in the honor i have at the same time the gratification of my own vanity in view  to james boswell esquire sir parklane dec      0 i have been fortunately spared the troublesome suspense of a long search to which in performance of my promise i had devoted this morning by lighting upon the objects of it among the first papers that i laid my hands on my veneration for your great and good friend dr johnson and the pride or i hope something of a better sentiment which i indulged in possessing such memorials of his good will toward me having induced me to bind them in a parcel containing other select papers and labelled with the titles appertaining to them they consist but of three letters which i believe were all that i ever received from dr johnson of these one which was written in quadruplicate under the different dates of its respective dispatches has already been made public but not from any communication of mine this however i have joined to the rest and have now the pleasure of sending them to you for the use to which you informed me it was your desire to destine them  my promise was pledged with the condition that if the letters were found to contain any thing which should render them improper for the public eye you would dispense with the performance of it you will have the goodness i am sure to pardon my recalling this stipulation to your recollection as i should be loath to appear negligent of that obligation which is always implied in an epistolary confidence in the reservation of that right i have read them over with the most scrupulous attention but have not seen in them the slightest cause on that ground to withold them from you but though not on that yet on another ground i own i feel a little yet but a little reluctance to part with them i mean on that of my own credit which i fear will suffer by the information conveyed by them that i was early in the possession of such valuable instructions for the beneficial employment of the influence of my late station and as it may seem have so little availed myself of them whether i could if it were necessary defend myself against such an imputation it little concerns the world to know i look only to the effect which these relics may produce considered as evidences of the virtues of their author and believing that they will be found to display an uncommon warmth of private friendship and a mind ever attentive to the improvement and extension of useful knowledge and solicitous for the interests of mankind i can cheerfully submit to the little sacrifice of my own fame to contribute to the illustration of so great and venerable a character they cannot be better applied for that end than by being entrusted to your hands allow me with this offering to infer from it a proof of the very great esteem with which i have the honor to profess myself  sir your most obedient and most humble servant warren hastings p s at some futur time and when you have no further occasion for these papers i shall be obliged to you if you would return them     the last of the three letters thus graciously put into my hands and which has already appeared in public belongs to this year but i shall previously insert the two first in the order of their dates they altogether form a grand group in my biographical picture  to the honcurable warren hastings esquire sir though i have had but little personal knowledge of you i have had enough to make me wish for more and though it be now a long time since i was honored by your visit i had too much pleasure from it to forget it by those whom we delight to remember we are unwilling to be forgotten and therefore i cannot omit this opportunity of reviving myself in your memory by a letter which you will receive from the hands of my friend mr chambers now sir robert chalmers one of his majestys judges in india  a man whose purity of manners and vigor of mind are sufficient to make every thing welcome that he brings  that this is my only reason for writing will be too apparent by the uselessness of my letter to any other purpose i have no questions to ask not that i want curiosity after either the ancient or present state of regions in which have been seen all the power and splendor of wideextended empire and which as by some grant of natural superiority supply the rest of the world with almost all that pride desires and luxury enjoys but my knowledge of them is too scanty to furnish me with proper topics of enquiry i can only wish for information and hope that a mind comprehensive like yours will find leisure amidst the cares of your important station to enquire into many subjects of which the european world either thinks not at all or thinks with deficient intelligence and uncertain conjecture i shall hope that he who once intended to increase the learning of his country by the introduction of the persian language will examine nicely the traditions and histories of the east that he will survey the wonders of its ancient edifices and trace the vestiges of its ruined cities and that at his return we shall know the arts and opinions of a race of men from whom very little has been hitherto derived  you sir have no need of being told by me how much may be added by your attention and patronage to experimental knowledge and natural history there are arts of manufacture practiced in the countries in which you preside which are yet very imperfectly known here either to artificers or philosophers of the natural productions animate and inanimate we yet have so little intelligence that our books are filled i fear with conjectures about things which an indian peasant knows by his senses  many of those things my first wish is to see my second to know by such accounts as a man like you will be able to give  as i have not skill to ask proper questions i have likewise no such access to great men as can enable me to send you any political information of the agitations of an unsettled government and the struggles of a feeble ministry care is doubtless taken to give you more exact accounts than i can obtain if you are inclined to interest yourself much in public transactions it is no misfortune to you to be so distant from them  that literature is not totally forsaking us and that your favorite language is not neglected will appear from the book jones persian grammar  which i should have pleased myself more with sending if i could have presented it bound but time was wanting i beg however sir that you will accept it from a man very desirous of your regard and that if you think me able to gratify you by any thing more important you will employ me  i am now going to take leave perhaps a very long leave of my dear mr chambers that he is going to live where you govern may justly alleviate the regret of parting and the hope of seeing both him and you again which i am not willing to mingle with doubt must at present comfort as it can  sir your most humble servant sam johnson march  0       to the same sir being informed that by the departure of a ship there is now an opportunity of writing to bengal i am unwilling to slip out of your memory by my own negligence and therefore take the liberty of reminding you of my existence by sending you a book which is not yet made public  i have lately visited a region less remote and less illustrious than india which afforded some occasions for speculation what occurred to me i have put into the volume journey to the western islands of scotland  of which i beg your acceptance  men in your station seldom have presents totally disinterested my book is received let me now make my request  there is sir somewhere within your government a young adventurer one chauncy lawrence whose father is one of my oldest friends be pleased to show the young man what countenance is fit whether he wants to be restrained by your authority or encouraged by your favor his father is now president of the college of physicians a man venerable for his knowledge and more venerable for his virtue  i wish you a prosperous government a safe return and a long enjoyment of plenty and tranquillity  i am sir your most obedient and most humble servant sam johnson london dec  0       to the same sir jan        amidst the importance and multiplicity of affairs in which your great office engages you i take the liberty of recalling your attention for a moment to literature and will not prolong the interruption by an apology which your character makes needless  mr hoole a gentleman long known and long esteemed in the indiahouse after having translated tasso has undertaken ariosto how well he is qualified for his undertaking he has already shown he is desirous sir of your favor in promoting his proposals and flatters me by supposing that my testimony may advance his interest  it is a new thing for a clerk of the indiahouse to translate poets  it is new for a governor of bengal to patronize learning that he may find his ingenuity rewarded and that learning may flourish under your protection is the wish of  sir your most humble servant sam johnson   i wrote to him in february complaining of having been troubled by a recurrence of the perplexing question of liberty and necessity  and mentioning that i hoped soon to meet him again in london  to james boswell esquire dear sir i hoped you had got rid of all this hypocrisy of misery what have you to do with liberty and necessity or what more than to hold your tongue about it do not doubt but i shall be most heartily glad to see you here again for i love every part about you but your affectation of distress  i have at last finished my lives and have laid up for you a load of copy all out of order so that it will amuse you a long time to set it right come to me my dear bozzy and let us be as happy as we can we will go again to the mitre and talk old times over  i am dear sir yours affectionately sam johnson march          on monday march    i arrived in london and on tuesday the  0th met him in fleet street walking or rather indeed moving along for his march is thus described in a very just and picturesque manner in a short life with this wellchosen motto    from his cradle he was a scholar and a ripe and good one and to add greater honors to his age than man could give him he died fearing heaven  of him published by kearsley very soon after his death when he walked the streets what with the constant roll of his head and the concomitant motion of his body he appeared to make his way by that motion independent of his feet that he was often much stared at while he advanced in this manner may easily be believed but it was not safe to make sport of one so robust as he was mr langton saw him one day in a fit of absence by a sudden start drive the load off a porters back and walk forward briskly without being conscious of what he had done the porter was very angry but stood still and eyed the huge figure with much earnestness till he was satisfied that his wisest course was to be quiet and take up his burden again  our accidental meeting in the street after a long separation was a pleasing surprise to us both he stepped aside with me into falconcourt and made kind inquiries about my family and as we were in a hurry going different ways i promised to call on him next day he said he was engaged to go out in the morning early sir said i johnson why sir a london morning does not go with the sun  i waited on him next evening and he gave me a quantity of his original manuscript of his lives of the poets which he had preserved for me  i found that his friend mr thrale was now very ill and had removed i suppose by the solicitation of mrs thrale to a house in grosvenorsquare i was sorry to find him sadly changed in his appearance  he told me i might now have the pleasure to see dr johnson drink wine again for he had lately returned to it when i mentioned this to johnson he said i drink it now sometimes but not socially the first evening that i was with him at thrales i observed he poured a quantity of it into a large glass and swallowed it greedily every thing about his character and manners was forcible and violent there never was any moderation many a day did he fast many a year did he refrain from wine but when he did eat it was voraciously when he did drink wine it was copiously he could practice abstinence but not temperance  mrs thrale and i had a dispute whether shakspeare or milton had drawn the most admirable picture of a man shakspeare makes hamlet thus describe his father  see what a grace was seated on this brow hyperions curls the front of jove himself an eye like mars to threaten and command a station like the herald mercury new lighted on a heavenkissing hill a combination and a form indeed where every god did seem to set his seal to give the world assurance of a man milton thus pourtrays our first parent adam  his fair large front and eye sublime declared absolute rule and hyacinthin locks round from his parted forelock manly hung clustring but not beneath his shoulders broad   i was for shakspeare mrs thrale for milton and upon a fair hearing johnson decided for my opinion  i told him of one of mr burkes playful sallies upon dean marlay i dont like the deanery of ferns it sounds so like a barren title  dr heath should have it said i johnson laughed and condescending to trifle in the same mode of conceit suggested dr moss  he said mrs montagu has dropped me now sir there are people whom one should like very well to drop but would not wish to be dropped by he certainly was vain of the society of ladies and could make himself very agreeable to them when he chose it sir joshua reynolds agreed with me that he could mr gibbon with his usual sneer controverted it perhaps in resentment of johnsons having talked with some disgust of his ugliness which one should think a philosopher would not mind dean marlay wittily observed a lady may be vain when she can turn a wolfdog into a lapdog  the election for ayrshire my own county was this spring tried upon a petition before a committee of the house of commons i was one of the counsel for the sitting member and took the liberty of previously stating different points to johnson who never failed to see them clearly and to supply me with some good hints he dictated to me the following note upon the registration of deeds  all laws are made for the convenience of the community what is legally done should be legally recorded that the state of things may be known and that wherever evidence is requisite evidence may be had for this reason the obligation to frame and establish a legal register is enforced by a legal penalty which penalty is the want of that perfection and plenitude of right which a register would give thence it follows that this is not an objection merely legal for the reason on which the law stands being equitable makes it an equitable objection  this said he you must enlarge on when speaking to the committee you must not argue there as if you were arguing in the schools close reasoning will not fix their attention you must say the same thing over and over again in different words if you say it but once they miss it in a moment of inattention it is unjust sir to censure lawyers for multiplying words when they argue it is necessary for them to multiply words  his notion of the duty of a member of parliament sitting upon an election committee was very high and when he was told of a gentleman upon one of those committees who read the newspapers part of the time and slept the rest while the merits of a vote were examined by the counsel and as an excuse when challenged by the chairman for such behavior bluntly answered i had made up my mind upon that case johnson with an indignant contempt said if he was such a rogue as to make up his mind upon a case without hearing it he should not have been such a fool as to tell it  i think said mr dudley long the doctor has pretty plainly made him out to be both rogue and fool  johnsons profound reverence for the hierarchy made him expect from bishops the highest degree of decorum he was offended even at their going to taverns a bishop said he has nothing to do at a tipplinghouse it is not indeed immoral in him to go to a tavern neither would it be immoral in him to whip a top in grosvenorsquare but if he did i hope the boys would fall upon him and apply the whip to him there are gradations in conduct there is morality  decency  propriety none of these should be violated by a bishop a bishop should not go to a house where he may meet a young fellow leading out a wench boswell but sir every tavern does not admit women johnson depend upon it sir any tavern will admit a welldrest man and a welldrest woman they will not perhaps admit a woman whom they see every night walking by their door in the street but a welldrest man may lead in a welldrest woman to any tavern in london taverns sell meat and drink and will sell them to any body who can eat and can drink you may as well say that a mercer will not sell silks to a woman of the town  he also disapproved of bishops going to routs at least of their staying at them longer than their presence commanded respect he mentioned a particular bishop poh said mrs thrale the bishop of  is never minded at a rout boswell when a bishop places himself in a situation where he has no distinct character and is of no consequence he degrades the dignity of his order johnson mr boswell madam has said it as correctly as could be  nor was it only in the dignitaries of the church that johnson required a particular decorum and delicacy of behavior he justly considered that the clergy as men set apart for the sacred office of serving at the altar and impressing the minds of men with the aweful concerns of a future state should be somewhat more serious than the generality of mankind and have a suitable composure of manners a due sense of the dignity of their profession independent of higher motives will ever prevent them from losing their distinction in an indiscriminate sociality and did such as affect this know how much it lessens them in the eyes of those whom they think to please by it they would feel themselves much mortified  johnson and his friend beauclerk were once together in company with several clergymen who thought they should appear to advantage by assuming the lax jollity of men of the world which as it may be observed in similar cases they carried to noisy excess johnson who they expected would be entertained sat grave and silent for some time at last turning to beauclerk he said by no means in a whisper this merriment of parsons is mighty offensive  even the dress of a clergyman should be in character and nothing can be more despicable than conceited atempts at avoiding the appearance of the clerical order attempts which are as ineffectual as they are pitiful dr porteus now bishop of london in his excellent charge when presiding over the diocese of chester justly animadverts upon this subject and observes of a reverend sop that he can be but half a beau  addison in the spectator has given us a fine portrait of a clergyman who is supposed to be a member of his club and johnson has exhibited a model in the character of mr mudge see vol i p  0   which has escaped the collectors of his works but which he owned to me and which indeed he showed to sir joshua reynolds at the time when it was written it bears the genuine marks of johnsons best manner and is as follows  the reverend mr zachariah mudge prebendary of exeter and vicar of st andrews in plymouth a man equally eminent for his virtues and abilities and at once beloved as a companion and reverenced as a pastor he had that general curiosity to which no kind of knowledge is indifferent or superfluous and that general benevolence by which no order of men is hated or despised  his principles both of thought and action were great and comprehensive by a solicitous examination of objections and judicious comparison of opposite arguments he attained what enquiry never gives but to industry and perspicuity a firm and unshaken settlement of conviction but his firmness was without asperity for knowing with how much difficulty truth was sometimes found he did not wonder that many missed it  the general course of his life was determined by his profession he studied the sacred volumes in the original languages with what diligence and success his notes upon the psalms give sufficient evidence he once endeavored to add the knowledge of arabic to that of hebrew but finding his thoughts too much diverted from other studies after some time desisted from his purpose  his discharge of parochial duties was exemplary how his sermons were composed may be learned from the excellent volume which he has given to the public but how they were delivered can be known only to those that heard them for as he appeared in the pulpit words will not easily describe him his delivery though unconstrained was not negligent and though forcible was not turbulent disdaining anxious nicety of emphasis and labored artifice of action it captivated the hearer by its natural dignity it roused the sluggish and fixed the volatile and detained the mind upon the subject without directing it to the speaker  the grandeur and solemnity of the preacher did not intrude upon his general behavior at the table of his friends he was a companion communicative and attentive of unaffected manners of manly cheerfulness willing to please and easy to be pleased his acquaintance was universally solicited and his presence obstructed no enjoyment which religion did not forbid though studious he was popular though argumentative he was modest though inflexible he was candid and though metaphysical yet orthodox london chronicle may        this respectable man is there mentioned to have died on the  d of april that year at coflect the seat of thomas veale esquire in his way to london   on friday march  0 i dined with him at sir joshua reynoldss with the earl of charlemont sir annesley stewart mr eliot of porteliot mr burke dean marlay now bishop of clonfert mr langton a most agreeable day of which i regret that every circumstance is not preserved but it is unreasonable to require such a multiplication of felicity  mr eliot with whom dr walter heart had traveled talked to us of his history of gustavus adolphus which he said was a very good book in the german translation johnson heart was excessively vain he put copies of his book in manuscript into the hands of lord chesterfield and lord granville that they might revise it now how absurd was it to suppose that two such noblemen would revise so big a manuscript poor man he left london the day of the publication of his book that he might be out of the way of the great praise he was to receive and he was ashamed to return when he found how ill his book had succeeded it was unlucky in coming out on the same day with robertsons history of scotland his husbandry however is good boswell so he was fitter for that than for heroic history he did well when he turned his sword into a ploughshare  mr eliot mentioned a curious liquor peculiar to his country which the cornish fishermen drink they call it mahogany and it is made of two parts gin and one part treacle well beat together i begged to have some of it made which was done with proper skill by mr eliot i thought it very good liquor and said it was a counterpart of what is called athol porridge in the highlands of scotland which is a mixture of whisky and honey johnson said that must be a better liquor than the cornish for both its component parts are better he also observed  mahogany must be a modern name for it was not long since the wood called mahogany was known in this country i mentioned his scale of liquors  claret for boys  port for men  brandy for heroes then said mr burke let me have claret i love to be a boy to have the careless gaiety of boyish days johnson i should drink claret too if it would give me that but it does not it neither makes boys men nor men boys you will be drowned by it before it has any effect upon you  i ventured to mention a ludicrous paragraph in the newspapers that dr johnson was learning to dance of vestris lord charlemont wishing to excite him to talk proposed in a whisper that he should be asked whether it was true shall i ask him said his lordship we were by a great majority clear for the experiment upon which his lordship very gravely and with a courteous air said pray sir is it true that you are taking lessons of vestris this was risking a good deal and required the boldness of a general of irish volunteers to make the attempt johnson was at first startled and in some heat answered how can your lordship ask so simple a question but immediately recovering himself whether from unwillingness to be deceived or to appear deceived or whether from real good humor he kept up the joke nay but if any body were to answer the paragraph and contradict it i would have a reply and would say that he who contradicted it was no friend either to vestris or me for why should not dr johnson add to his other powers a little corporeal agility socrates learnt to dance at an advanced age and cato learnt greek at an advanced age then it might proceed to say that this johnson not content with dancing on the ground might dance on the rope and they might introduce the elephant dancing on the rope a nobleman wrote a play called love in a hollow tree he found out that it was a bad one and therefore wished to buy up all the copies and burn them the duchess of marlborough had kept one and when he was against her at an election she had a new edition of it printed and prefixed to it as a frontispiece an elephant dancing on a rope to show that his lordships writing comedy was as awkward as an elephant dancing on a rope  on sunday april   i dined with him at mr thrales with sir philip jennings clerk and mr perkins who had the superintendence of mr thrales brewery with a salary of five hundred pounds a year sir philip had the appearance of a gentleman of ancient family well advanced in life he wore his own white hair in a bag of goodly size a black velvet coat with an embroidered waistcoat and very rich laced ruffles which mrs thrale said were old fashioned but which for that reason i thought the more respectable more like a tory yet sir philip was then in opposition in parliament ah sir said johnson ancient ruffles and modern principles do not agree sir philip defended the opposition to the american war ably and with temper and i joined him he said the majority of the nation was against the ministry johnson  i sir am against the ministry but it is for having too little of that of which opposition thinks they have too much were i minister if any man wagged his finger against me he should be turned out for that which it is in the power of government to give at pleasure to one or to another should be given to the supporters of government if you will not oppose at the expense of losing your place your opposition will not be honest you will feel no serious grievance and the present opposition is only a contest to get what others have sir robert walpole acted as i would do as to the american war the sense of the nation is with the ministry the majority of those who can understand is with it the majority of those who can only hear is against it and as those who can only hear are more numerous than those who can understand and opposition is always loudest a majority of the rabble will be for opposition  this boisterous vivacity entertained us but the fact really was that those who could understand the best were against the american war as almost every man now is when the question has been coolly considered  mrs thrale gave high praise to a gentleman of our acquaintance johnson nay my dear lady dont talk so mr s character is very short it is nothing he fills a chair he is a man of a genteel appearance and that is all i know nobody who blasts by praise as you do for whenever there is exaggerated praise every body is set against a character they are provoked to attack it now there is  you praised that man with such disproportion that i was incited to lessen him perhaps more than he deserves his blood is upon your head by the same principle your malice defeats itself for your censure is too violent and yet looking to her with a leering smile she is the first woman in the world could she but restrain that wicked tongue of hers  she would be the only woman could she but command that little whirligig  upon the subject of exaggerated praise i took the liberty to say that i thought there might be very high praise given to a known character which deserved it and therefore it would not be exaggerated thus one might say of mr edmund burke he is a very wonderful man johnson no sir you would not be safe if another man had a mind perversely to contradict he might answer where is all the wonder burke is to be sure a man of uncommon abilities with a great quantity of matter in his mind and a great fluency of language in his mouth but we are not be stunned and astonished by him so you see sir even burke would suffer not from any fault of his own but from your folly  mrs thrale mentioned a gentleman who had acquired a fortune of four thousand a year in trade but was absolutely miserable because he could not talk in company so miserable that he was impelled to lament his situation in the street to  whom he hates and who he knows despises him i am a most unhappy man said he i am invited to conversations i go to conversations but alas i have no conversation johnson man commonly cannot be successful in different ways this gentleman has spent in getting four thousand pounds a year the time in which he might have learnt to talk and now he cannot talk mr perkins made a shrewd and droll remark if he had got his four thousand a year as a mountebank he might have learnt to talk at the same time that he was getting his fortune  some other gentlemen came in the conversation concerning the person whose character dr johnson had treated so slightingly as he did not know his merit was resumed mrs thrale said you think so of him sir because he is quiet and does not exert himself with force you will be saying the same thing of mr  there who sits as quiet   this was not well bred and johnson did not let it pass without correction nay madam what right have you to talk thus both mr  and i have reason to take it ill you may talk so of mr  but why do you make me do it have i said any thing against mr  you have set him that i might shoot him but i have not shot him  one of the gentlemen said he had seen three folio volumes of dr johnsons sayings collected by me i must put you right sir said i for i am very exact in authenticity you could not see folio volumes for i have none you might have seen some in quarto and octavo this is inattention which one should guard against johnson sir it is a want of concern about veracity he does not know that he saw any volumes if he had seen them he could have remembered their size  mr thrale appeared very lethargick today i saw him again on monday evening at which time he was not thought to be in immediate danger but early in the morning of wednesday the  th he expired johnson was in the house and thus mentions the event i felt almost the last flutter of his pulse and looked for the last time upon the face that for fifteen years had never been turned upon me but with respect and benignity prayers and meditations p      upon that day there was a call of the literary club but johnson apologized for his absence by the following note  mr johnson knows that sir joshua reynolds and the other gentlemen will excuse his incompliance with the call when they are told that mr thrale died this morning  wednesday  mr thrales death was a very essential loss to johnson who although he did not foresee all that afterward happened was sufficiently convinced that the comforts which mr thrales family afforded him would now in a great measure cease he however continued to show a kind attention to his widow and children as long as it was acceptable and he took upon him with a very earnest concern the office of one of his executors the importance of which seemed greater than usual to him from his circumstances having been always such that he had scarcely any share in the real business of life his friends of the club were in hopes that mr thrale might have made a liberal provision for him for his life which as mr thrale left no son and a very large fortune it would have been highly to his honor to have done and considering dr johnsons age could not have been of long duration but he bequeathed him only two hundred pounds which was the legacy given to each of his executors i could not but be somewhat diverted by hearing johnson talk in a pompous manner of his new office and particularly of the concerns of the brewery which it was at last resolved should be sold lord lucan tells a very good story which if not precisely exact is certainly characteristical that when the sale of thrales brewery was going forward johnson appeared bustling about with an inkhorn and pen in his buttonhole like an exciseman and on being asked what he really considered to be the value of the property which was to be disposed of answered we are not here to sell a parcel of boilers and vats but the potentiality of growing rich beyond the dreams of avarice  on friday april   he carried me to dine at a club which at his desire had been lately formed at the queens arms in st pauls churchyard he told mr hoole that he wished to have a city club and asked him to collect one but said he dont let them be patriots the company today were very sensible wellbehaved men i have preserved only two particulars of his conversation he said he was glad lord george gordon had escaped rather than that a precedent should be established for hanging a man for constructive treason which in consistency with his true manly constitutional toryism he considered would be a dangerous engine of arbitrary power and upon its being mentioned that an opulent and very indolent scotch nobleman who totally resigned the management of his affairs to a man of knowledge and abilities had claimed some merit by saying the next best thing to managing a mans own affairs well is being sensible of incapacity and not attempting it but having full confidence in one who can do it johnson nay sir this is paltry there is a middle course let a man give application and depend upon it he will soon get above a despicable state of helplessness and attain the power of acting for himself  on saturday april   i dined with him at mr hooles with governor boucher and captain orme both of whom had been long in the east indies and being men of good sense and observation were very entertaining johnson defended the oriental regulation of different casts of men which was objected to as totally destructive of the hopes of rising in society by personal merit he showed that there was a principle in it sufficiently plausible by analogy we see said he in metals that there are different species and so likewise in animals though one species may not differ very widely from another as in the species of dogs  the cur the spaniel the mastiff the bramins are the mastiffs of mankind  on thursday april    i dined with him at a bishops where were sir joshua reynolds mr berrenger and some more company he had dined the day before at another bishops i have unfortunately recorded none of his conversation at the bishops where we dined together but i have preserved his ingenious defense of his dining twice abroad in passionweek a laxity in which i am convinced he would not have indulged himself at the time when he wrote his solemn paper in the rambler upon that aweful season it appeared to me that by being much more in company and enjoying more in luxurious living he had contracted a keener relish of pleasure and was consequently less rigorous in his religious rites this he would not acknowledge but he reasoned with admirable sophistry as follows why sir a bishops calling company together in this week is to use the vulgar phrase not the thing but you must consider laxity is a bad thing but preciseness is also a bad thing and your general character may be more hurt by preciseness than by dining with a bishop in passionweek there might be a handle for reflection it might be said he refused to dine with a bishop in passionweek but was three sundays absent from church boswell very true sir but suppose a man to be uniformly of good conduct would it not be better that he should refuse to dine with a bishop in this week and so not encourage a bad practice by his example johnson why sir you are to consider whether you might not do more harm by lessening the influence of a bishops character by your disapprobation in refusing him than by going to him  to mrs lucy porter in lichfield dear madam life is full of troubles i have just lost my dear friend thrale i hope he is happy but i have had a great loss i am otherwise pretty well i require some care myself but that care is not ineffectual and when i am out of order i think it often my own fault  the spring is now making quick advances as it is the season in which the whole world is enlivened and invigorated i hope that both you and i shall partake of its benefits my desire is to see lichfield but being left executor to my friend i know not whether i can be spared but i will try for it is now long since we saw one another and how little we can promise ourselves many more interviews we are taught by hourly examples of mortality let us try to live so as that mortality may not be an evil write to me soon my dearest your letters will give me great pleasure  i am sorry that mr porter has not had his box but by sending it to mr mathias who very readily undertook its conveyance i did the best i could and perhaps before now he has it  be so kind as to make my compliments to my friends i have a great value for their kindness and hope to enjoy it before summer is past do write to me  i am dearest love your most humble servant sam johnson london april          on friday april    being good friday i went to st clementschurch with him as usual there i saw again his old fellowcollegian edwards to whom i said i think sir dr johnson and you meet only at church  sir said he it is the best place we can meet in except heaven and i hope we shall meet there too dr johnson told me that there was very little communication between edwards and him after their unexpected renewal of acquaintance but said he smiling he met me once and said i am told you have written a very pretty book called the rambler i was unwilling that he should leave the world in total darkness and sent him a set  mr berrenger visited him today and was very pleasing we talked of an evening society for conversation at a house in town of which we were all members but of which johnson said it will never do sir there is nothing served about there neither tea nor coffee nor lemonade nor any thing whatever and depend upon it sir a man does not love to go to a place from whence he comes out exactly as he went in i endeavored for arguments sake to maintain that men of learning and talents might have very good intellectual society without the aid of any little gratifications of the senses berrenger joined with johnson and said that without these any meeting would be dull and insipid he would therefore have all the slight refreshments nay it would not be amiss to have some cold meat and a bottle of wine upon a sideboard sir said johnson to me with an air of triumph mr berrenger knows the world every body loves to have good things furnished to them without any trouble i told mrs thrale once that as she did not choose to have cardtables she should have a profusion of the best sweetmeats and she would be sure to have company enough come to her the event proved the justice of johnsons opinion as to the impracticability of getting people to meet when they know there is absolutely nothing to touch the palate for this society though held at the house of a person deservedly much esteemed and composed of very eminent men could not be preserved from gradual decay  on sunday april    being easter day after solemn worship in st pauls church i found him alone dr scott of the commons came he talked of its having been said that addison wrote some of his best papers in the spectator when warm with wine dr johnson did not seem willing to admit this dr scott as a confirmation of it related that blackstone composed his commentaries with a bottle of port before him  i told him that in a company where i had lately been a desire was expressed to know his authority for the shocking story of addisons sending an execution into steeles house sir said he it is generally known it is known to all who are acquainted with the literary history of that period it is as well known as that he wrote cato mr thomas sheridan once defended addison to me by alleging that he did it in order to cover steeles goods from other creditors who were going to seize them  we talked of the difference between the mode of education at oxford and that in the colleges where instruction is chiefly conveyed by lectures johnson lectures were once useful but now when all can read and books are so numerous lectures are unnecessary if your attention fails and you miss a part of a lecture it is lost you cannot go back as you do upon a book dr scott agreed with him but yet said i dr scott you yourself gave lectures at oxford he smiled you laughed then said i at those who came to you  dr scott left us and soon afterward we went to dinner our company consisted of mrs williams mrs desmoulins mr levett mr allen the printer and mrs hall sister of the reverend mr john wesley and resembling him as i thought both in figure and manner johnson produced now for the first time some handsome silver salvers which he told me he had bought fourteen years ago so it was a great day i was not a little amused by observing allen perpetually struggling to talk in the manner of johnson like the little frog in the fable blowing himself up to resemble the stately ox  i mentioned a kind of religious robinhood society which met every sunday evening at coachmakershall for free debate and that the subject for this night was the text which relates with other miracles which happened at our saviors death and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many mrs hall said it was a very curious subject and she should like to hear it discussed johnson somewhat warmly one would not go to such a place to hear it  one would not be seen in such a place  to give countenance to such a meeting i however resolved that i would go but sir said she to johnson i should like to hear you discuss it he seemed reluctant to engage in it she talked of the resurrection of the human race in general and maintained that we shall be raised with the same bodies johnson nay madam we see that it is not to be the same body for the scripture uses the illustration of grain sown and we know that the grain which grows is not the same with what is sown you cannot suppose that we shall rise with a diseased body it is enough if there be such a sameness as to distinguish identity of person she seemed desirous of knowing more but he left the question in obscurity  of apparitions he observed a total disbelief of them is adverse to the opinion of the existence of the soul between death and the last day the question simply is whether departed spirits ever have the power of making themselves perceptible to us a man who thinks he has seen an apparition can only be convinced himself his authority will not convince another and his conviction if rational must be founded on being told something which cannot be known but by supernatural means  he mentioned a thing as not unfrequent of which i had never heard before  being called that is hearing ones name pronounced by the voice of a known person at a great distance far beyond the possibility of being reached by any sound uttered by human organs an acquaintance on whose veracity i can depend told me that walking home one evening to kilmarnock he heard himself called from a wood by the voice of a brother who had gone to america and the next packet brought accounts of that brothers death macbean asserted that this inexplicable calling was a thing very well known dr johnson said that one day at oxford as he was turning the key of his chamber he heard his mother distinctly call sam she was then at lichfield but nothing ensued this phenomenon is i think as wonderful as any other mysterious fact which many people are very slow to believe or rather indeed reject with an obstinate contempt  some time after this upon his making a remark which escaped my attention mrs williams and mrs hall were both together striving to answer him he grew angry and called out loudly nay when you both speak at once it is intolerable but checking himself and softening he said this one may say though you are ladies then he brightened into gay humor and addressed them in the words of one of the songs in the beggars opera but two at a time there is no mortal can bear what sir said i are you going to turn captain macheath there was something as pleasantly ludicrous in this scene as can be imagined the contrast between macheath polly and lucy  and dr samuel johnson blind peevish mrs williams and lean lank preaching mrs hall was exquisite  i stole away to coachmakershall and heard the difficult text of which we had talked discussed with great decency and some intelligence by several speakers there was a difference of opinion as to the appearance of ghosts in modern times though the arguments for it supported by mr addisons authority preponderated the immediate subject of debate was embarrassed by the bodies of the saints having been said to rise and by the question what became of them afterward did they return again to their graves or were they translated to heaven only one evangelist mentions the fact st matthew chap xxvii v        and the commentators whom i have looked at do not make the passage clear there is however no occasion for our understanding it farther than to know that it was one of the extraordinary manifestations of divine power which accompanied the most important event that ever happened  on friday april  0 i spent with him one of the happiest days that i remember to have enjoyed in the whole course of my life mrs garrick whose grief for the loss of her husband was i believe as sincere as wounded affection and admiration could produce had this day for the first time since his death a select party of his friends to dine with her the company was miss hannah more who lived with her and whom she called her chaplain mrs boscawen mrs elizabeth carter sir joshua reynolds dr burney dr johnson and myself we found ourselves very elegantly entertained at her house in the adelphi where i have passed many a pleasing hour with him who gladdened life she looked very well talked of her husband with complacency and while she cast her eyes on his portrait which hung over the chimneypiece said that death was now the most agreeable object to her the very semblance of david garrick was cheering mr beauclerk with happy propriety inscribed under that fine portrait of him which by lady dianas kindness is now the property of my friend mr langton the following passage from his beloved shakspeare    a merrier man within the limit of becoming mirth i never spent an hours talk withal his eye begets occasion for his wit for every object that the one does catch the other turns to a mirthmoving jest which his fair tongue conceits expositor delivers in such apt and gracious words that aged ears play truant at his tales and younger hearings are quite ravished so sweet and voluble is his discourse we were all in fine spirits and i whispered to mrs boscawen i believe this is as much as can be made of life in addition to a splendid entertainment we were regaled with lichfield ale which had a peculiar appropriated value sir joshua and dr burney and i drank cordially of it to dr johnsons health and though he would not join us he as cordially answered gentlemen i wish you all as well as you do me  the general effect of this day dwells upon my mind in fond remembrance but i do not find much conversation recorded what i have preserved shall be faithfully given  somebody mentioned mr thomas hollis the strenuous whig who used to send over europe presents of democratical books with their boards stamped with daggers and caps of liberty mrs carter said he was a bad man he used to talk uncharitably johnson poh poh madam who is the worse for being talked of uncharitably besides he was a dull poor creature as ever lived and i believe he would not have done harm to a man whom he knew to be of very opposite principles to his own i remember once at the society of arts when an advertisement was to be drawn up he pointed me out as the man who could do it best this you will observe was kindness to me i however slipped away and escaped it  mrs carter having said of a certain person i doubt he was an atheist johnson i dont know that he might perhaps have become one if he had had time to ripen smiling he might have exuberated into an atheist  sir joshua reynolds praised mudges sermons johnson mudges sermons are good but not practical he grasps more sense than he can hold he takes more corn than he can make into meal he opens a wide prospect but it is so distant it is indistinct i love blairs sermons though the dog is a scotchman and a presbyterian and every thing he should not be i was the first to praise them such was my candor smiling mrs boscawen such his great merit to get the better of all your prejudices johnson why madam let us compound the matter let us ascribe it to my candor and his merit  in the evening we had a large company in the drawing room several ladies the bishop of killaloe d percy mr chamberlayne of the treasury etc etc somebody said the life of a mere literary man could not be very entertaining johnson but it certainly may this is a remark which has been made and repeated without justice why should the life of a literary man be less entertaining than the life of any other man are there not as interesting varieties in such a life as a literary life it may be very entertaining boswell but it must be better surely when it is diversified with a little active variety  such as his having gone to jamaica  or  his having gone to the hebrides johnson was not displeased at this  talking of a very respectable author he told us a curious circumstance in his life which was that he had married a printers devil reynolds a printers devil sir why i thought a printers devil was a creature with a black face and in rags johnson yes sir but i suppose he had her face washed and put clean clothes on her then looking very serious and very earnest and she did not disgrace him  the woman had a bottom of good sense the word bottom thus introduced was so ludicrous when contrasted with his gravity that most of us could not forbear tittering and laughing though i recollect that the bishop of killaloe kept his countenance with perfect steadiness while miss hannah more slyly hid her face behind a ladys back who sat on the same settee with her his pride could not bear that any expression of his should excite ridicule when he did not intend it he therefore resolved to assume and exercise despotick power glanced sternly around and called out in a strong tone where is the merriment then collecting himself and looking aweful to make us feel how he could impose restraint and as it were searching his mind for a still more ludicrous word he slowly pronounced i say the woman was fundamentally sensible as if he had said hear this now and laugh if you dare we all sat composed as at a funeral  he and i walked away together we stopped a little while by the rails of the adelphi looking on the thames and i said to him with tenderness that i thought of two friends we had lost who once lived in the buildings behind us beauclerk and garrick aye sir said he tenderly and two such friends as cannot be supplied  for some time after this day i did not see him very often and of the conversation which i did enjoy i am sorry to find i have preserved but little i was at this time engaged in a variety of other matters which required exertion and assiduity and necessarily occupied almost all my time  one day having spoken very freely of those who were then in power he said to me between ourselves sir i do not like to give opposition the satisfaction of knowing how much i disapprove of the ministry and when i mentioned that mr burke had boasted how quiet the nation was in george the seconds reign when whigs were in power compared with the present reign when tories governed why sir said he you are to consider that tories having more reverence for government will not oppose with the same violence as whigs who being unrestrained by that principle will oppose by any means  this month he lost not only mr thrale but another friend mr william strahan junior printer the eldest son of his old and constant friend printer to his majesty  to mrs strahan dear madam the grief which i feel for the loss of a very kind friend is sufficient to make me know how much you must suffer by the death of an amiable son a man of whom i think it may truly be said that no one knew him who does not lament him i look upon myself as having a friend another friend taken from me  comfort dear madam i would give you if i could but i know how little the forms of consolation can avail let me however counsel you not to waste your health in unprofitable sorrow but go to bath and endeavor to prolong your own life but when we have all done all that we can one friend must in time lose the other  i am dear madam your most humble servant sam johnson april          on tuesday may   i had the pleasure of again dining with him and mr wilkes at mr dillys no negotiation was now required to bring them together for johnson was so well satisfied with the former interview that he was very glad to meet wilkes again who was this day seated between dr beattie and dr johnson between truth and reason as general paoli said when i told him of it wilkes i have been thinking dr johnson that there should be a bill brought into parliament that the controverted elections for scotland should be tried in that country at their own abbey of holyrood house and not here for the consequence of trying them here is that we have an inundation of scotchmen who come up and never go back again now here is boswell who has come up upon the election for his own county which will not last a fortnight johnson nay sir i see no reason why they should be tried at all for you know one scotchman is as good as another wilkes pray boswell how much may be got in a year by an advocate at the scotch bar boswell i believe two thousand pounds wilkes how can it be possible to spend that money in scotland johnson why sir the money may be spent in england but there is a harder question if one man in scotland gets possession of two thousand pounds what remains for all the rest of the nation wilkes you know in the last war the immense booty which thurot carried off from the complete plunder of seven scotch isles he reimbarked with three and sixpence here again johnson and wilkes joined in extravagant sportive raillery upon the supposed poverty of scotland which dr beattie and i did not think it worth our while to dispute  the subject of quotation being introduced mr wilkes censured it as pedantry johnson no sir it is a good thing there is a community of mind in it classical quotation is the parole of literary men all over the world wilkes upon the continent they all quote the vulgate bible shakspeare is chiefly quoted here and we quote also pope prior butler waller and sometimes cowley  we talked of letterwriting johnson it is now become so much the fashion to publish letters that in order to avoid it i put as little into mine as i can boswell do what you will sir you cannot avoid it should you even write as ill as you can your letters would be published as curiosities behold a miracle instead of wit see two dull lines with stanhopes pencil writ   he gave us an entertaining account of bet flint a woman of the town who with some eccentrick talents and much effrontery forced herself upon his acquaintance bet said he wrote her own life in verse johnson whose memory was wonderfully retentive remembered the first four lines of this curious production which have been communicated to me by a young lady of his acquaintance  when first i drew my vital breath a little minikin i came upon earth and then i came from a dark abode into this gay and gaudy world   which she brought to me wishing that i would furnish her with a preface to it laughing i used to say of her that she was generally slut and drunkard  occasionally whore and thief she had however genteel lodgings a spinnet on which she played and a boy that walked before her chair poor bet was taken up on a charge of stealing a counterpane and tried at the oldbailey chief justice  who loved a wench summed up favorably and she was acquitted after which bet said with a gay and satisfied air now that the counterpane is my own i shall make a petticoat of it  talking of oratory mr wilkes described it as accompanied with all the charms of poetical expression johnson no sir oratory is the power of beating down your adversarys arguments and putting better in their place wilkes but this does not move the passions johnson he must be a weak man who is to be so moved wilkes naming a celebrated orator amidst all the brilliancy of  s imagination and the exuberance of his wit there is a strange want of taste it was observed of apelless venus that her flesh seemed as if she had been nourished by roses his oratory would sometimes make one suspect that he eats potatoes and drinks whisky  mr wilkes observed how tenacious we are of forms in this country and gave us an instance the vote of the house of commons for remitting money to pay the army in america in portugal pieces when in reality the remittance is made not in portugal money but in our own specie johnson is there not a law sir against exporting the current coin of the realm wilkes yes sir but might not the house of commons in case of real evident necessity order our own current coin to be sent into our own colonies  here johnson with that quickness of recollection which distinguished him so eminently gave the middlesex patriot an admirable retort upon his own ground sure sir you dont think a resolution of the house of commons equal to the law of the land wilkes at once perceiving the application god forbid sir  to hear what had been treated with such violence in the false alarm now turned into pleasant repartee was extremely agreeable johnson went on  lock observes well that a prohibition to export the current coin is impolitick for when the balance of trade happens to be against a state the current coin must be exported  mr beauclerks great library was this season sold in london by auction mr wilkes said he wondered to find in it such a numerous collection of sermons seeming to think it strange that a gentleman of mr beauclerks character in the gay world should have chosen to have many compositions of that kind johnson why sir you are to consider that sermons make a considerable branch of english literature so that a library must be very imperfect if it has not a numerous collection of sermons mr wilkes probably did not know that there is in an english sermon the most comprehensive and lively account of that entertaining faculty for which he himself is so much admired it is in dr barrows first volume and fourteenth sermon against foolish talking and jesting my old acquaintance the late corbyn morris in his ingenious essay on wit humor and ridicule calls it a profuse description of wit but i do not see how it could be curtailed without leaving out some good circumstance of discrimination as it is not generally known and may perhaps dispose some to read sermons from which they may receive real advantage while looking only for entertainment i shall here quote it  but first says the learned preacher it may be demanded what the thing we speak of is or what this facetiousness or wit as he calls it before does import to which questions i might reply as democritus did to him that asked the definition of a man it is that which we all see and know any one better apprehends what it is by acquaintance than i can inform him by description it is indeed a thing so versatile and multiform appearing in so many shapes so many postures so many garbs so variously apprehended by several eyes and judgments that it seems no less hard to settle a clear and certain notion thereof than to make a portrait of proteus or to define the figure of the fleeting air sometimes it lies in pat allusion to a known story or in seasonable application of a trivial saying or in forging an apposite tale sometimes it plays in words and phrases taking advantage from the ambiguity of their sense or the affinity of their sound sometimes it is wrapped in a dress of humourous expression sometimes it lurketh under an odd similitude sometimes it is lodged in a sly question in a smart answer in a quirkish reason in a shrewd intimation in cunningly diverting or cleverly retorting an objection sometimes it is couched in a bold scheme of speech in a tart irony in a lusty hyperbole in a startling metaphor in a plausible reconciling of contradictions or in acute nonsense sometimes a scenical representation of persons or things a counterfeit speech a mimical look or gesture passes for it sometimes an affected simplicity sometimes a presumptuous bluntness gives it being sometimes it rises only from a lucky hitting upon what is strange sometimes from a crafty wresting obvious matter to the purpose often it consists in one knows not what and springs up one can hardly tell how its ways are unaccountable and inexplicable being answerable to the numberless rovings of fancy and windings of language it is in short a manner of speaking out of the simple and plain way such as reason teaches and proves things by which by a pretty surprising uncouthness in conceit or expression does affect and amuse the fancy stirring in it some wonder and breeding some delight thereto it raises admiration as signifying a nimble sagacity of apprehension a special felicity of invention a vivacity of spirit and reach of wit more than vulgar it seeming to argue a rare quickness of parts that one can fetch in remote conceits applicable a notable skill that he can dexterously accommodate them to the purpose before him together with a lively briskness of humor not apt to damp those sportful flashes of imagination whence in aristotle such persons are termed  dexterous men and  men of facile or versatile manners who can easily turn themselves to all things or turn all things to themselves it also procures delight by gratifying curiosity with its rareness as semblance of difficulty as monsters not for their beauty but their rarity as juggling tricks not for their use but their abstruseness are beheld with pleasure by diverting the mind from its road of serious thoughts by instilling gaiety and airiness of spirit by provoking to such dispositions of spirit in way of emulation or complaisance and by seasoning matters otherwise distasteful or insipid with an unusual and thence grateful tang    and in all collections sir the desire of augmenting it grows stronger in proportion to the advance in acquisition as motion is accelerated by the continuance of the impetus besides sir looking at mr wilkes with a placid but significant smile a man may collect sermons with intention of making himself better by them i hope mr beauclerk intended that some time or other that should be the case with him  mr wilkes said to me loud enough for dr johnson to hear dr johnson should make me a present of his lives of the poets as i am a poor patriot who cannot afford to buy them johnson seemed to take no notice of this hint but in a little while he called to mr dilly pray sir be so good as to send a set of my lives to mr wilkes with my compliments this was accordingly done and mr wilkes paid dr johnson a visit was courteously received and sat with him a long time  the company gradually dropped away mr dilly himself was called down stairs upon business i left the room for some time when i returned i was struck with observing dr samuel johnson and john wilkes esquire literally tete a tete for they were reclined upon their chairs with their heads leaning almost close to each other and talking earnestly in a kind of confidential whisper of the personal quarrel between george the second and the king of prussia such a scene of perfectly easy sociality between two such opponents in the war of political controversy as that which i now beheld would have been an excellent subject for a picture it presented to my mind the happy days which are foretold in scripture when the lion shall lie down with the kid when i mentioned this to the bishop of killaloe with the goat said his lordship such however is the engaging politeness and pleasantry of mr wilkes and such the social good humor of the bishop that when they dined together at mr dillys where i also was they were mutually agreeable   after this day there was another pretty long interval during which dr johnson and i did not meet when i mentioned it to him with regret he was pleased to say then sir let us live double  about this time it was much the fashion for several ladies to have evening assemblies where the fair sex might participate in conversation with literary and ingenious men animated by a desire to please these societies were denominated bluestocking clubs the origin of which title being little known it may be worth while to relate it one of the most eminent members of those societies when they first commenced was mr stillingfleet whose dress was remarkably grave and in particular it was observed that he wore bluestockings such was the excellence of his conversation that his absence was felt as so great a loss that it used to be said we can do nothing without the bluestockings and thus by degrees the title was established miss hannah more has admirably described a bluestocking club in her bas bleu a poem in which many of the persons who were most conspicuous there are mentioned  johnson was prevailed with to come sometimes into these circles and did not think himself too grave even for the lively miss monckton now countess of cork who used to have the finest bit of blue at the house of her mother lady galway her vivacity enchanted the sage and they used to talk together with all imaginable ease a singular instance happened one evening when she insisted that some of sternes writings were very pathetick johnson bluntly denied it i am sure said she they have affected me  why said johnson smiling and rolling himself about that is because dearest youre a dunce when she some time afterward mentioned this to him he said with equal truth and politeness madam if i had thought so i certainly should not have said it  another evening johnsons kind indulgence toward me had a pretty difficult trial i had dined at the duke of montroses with a very agreeable party and his grace according to his usual custom had circulated the bottle very freely lord graham and i went together to miss moncktons where i certainly was in extraordinary spirits and above all fear or awe in the midst of a great number of persons of the first rank amongst whom i recollect with confusion a noble lady of the most stately decorum i placed myself next to johnson and thinking myself now fully his match talked to him in a loud and boisterous manner desirous to let the company know how i could contend with ajax i particularly remember pressing him upon the value of the pleasures of the imagination and as an illustration of my argument asking him what sir supposing i were to fancy that the naming the most charming duchess in his majestys dominions were in love with me should i not be very happy my friend with much address evaded my interrogatories and kept me as quiet as possible but it may easily be conceived how he must have felt next day i endeavored to give what had happened the most ingenious turn i could by the following verses  to the honorable miss monckton not that with the excellent montrose i had the happiness to dine not that i late from table rose from grahams wit from generous wine it was not these alone which led on sacred manners to encroach and made me eel what most i dread johnsons just frown and selfreproach but when i entered not abashed from your bright eyes were shot such rays at once intoxication flashed and all my frame was in a blaze but not a brilliant blaze i own of the dull smoke i am yet ashamed i was a dreary ruin grown and not enlightened though inflamed victim at once to wine and love i hope maria you will forgive while i invoke the powers above that henceforth i may wiser live the lady was generously forgiving returned me an obliging answer and i thus obtained an act of oblivion and took care never to offend again    when a few days afterward i waited upon him and made an apology he behaved with the most friendly gentleness  while i remained in london this year johnson and i dined together at several places i recollect a placid day at dr butterss who was now removed from derby to lower grosvenorstreet london but of his conversation on that and other occasions during this period i neglected to keep any regular record and shall therefore insert here some miscellaneous articles which i find in my johnsonian notes  his disorderly habits when making provision for the day that was passing over him appear from the following anecdote communicated to me by mr john nichols  in the year      a young bookseller who was an apprentice to mr whiston waited on him with a subscription to his shakspeare and observing that the doctor made no entry in any book of the subscribers name ventured diffidently to ask whether he would please to have the gentlemans address that it might be properly inserted in the printed list of subscribers  i shall print no list of subscribers said johnson with great abruptness but almost immediately recollecting himself added very complacently sir i have two very cogent reasons for not printing any list of subscribers  one that i have lost all the names  the other that i have spent all the money  johnson could not brook appearing to be worsted in argument even when he had taken the wrong side to show the force and dexterity of his talents when therefore he perceived that his opponent gained ground he had recourse to some sudden mode of robust sophistry once when i was pressing upon him with visible advantage he stopped me thus  my dear boswell let us have no more of this you will make nothing of it i would rather have you whistle a scotch tune  care however must be taken to distinguish between johnson when he talked for victory and johnson when he had no desire but to inform and illustrate  one of johnsons principal talents says an eminent friend was shown in maintaining the wrong side of an argument and in a splendid perversion of the truth  if you could contrive to have his fair opinion on a subject and without any bias from personal prejudice or from a wish to be victorious in argument it was wisdom itself not only convincing but overpowering  he had however all his life habituated himself to consider conversation as a trial of intellectual vigor and skill and to this i think we may venture to ascribe that unexampled richness and brilliancy which appeared in his own as a proof at once of his eagerness for colloquial distinction and his high notion of this eminent friend he once addressed him thus   we now have been several hours together and you have said but one thing for which i envied you  he disliked much all speculative desponding considerations which tended to discourage men from diligence and exertion he was in this like dr shaw the great traveller who mr daines barrington told me used to say i hate a cui bono man upon being asked by a friend what he should think of one who was apt to say non est tanti  that he is a stupid fellow sir answered johnson what would these tanti men be doing the while when i in a lowspirited fit was talking to him with indifference of the pursuits which generally engage us in a course of action and inquiring a reason for taking so much trouble sir said he in an animated tone it is driving on the system of life  he told me that he was glad that i had by general oglethorpes means become acquainted with dr shebbeare indeed that gentleman whatever objections were made to him had knowledge and abilities much above the class of ordinary writers and deserves to be remembered as a respectable name in literature were it only for his admirable letters on the english nation under the name of battista angeloni a jesuit  johnson and shebbeare i recollect a ludicrous paragraph in the newspapers that the king had pensioned both a hebear and a shebear  were frequently named together as having in former reigns had no predilection for the family of hanover the author of the celebrated heroic epistle to sir william chambers introduces them in one line in a list of those who tasted the sweets of his present majestys reign such was johnsons fair taste of the merit of that satire that he allowed dr goldsmith as he told me to read it to him from beginning to end and did not refuse his praise to its execution  goldsmith could sometimes take adventurous liberties with him and escape unpunished beauclerk told me that when goldsmith talked of a project for having a third theater in london solely for the exhibition of new plays in order to deliver authors from the supposed tyranny of managers johnson treated it slightingly upon which goldsmith said aye aye this may be nothing to you who can now shelter yourself behind the corner of a pension and that johnson bore this with good humor  johnson praised the earl of carlisles poems which his lordship had published with his name as not disdaining to be a candidate for literary fame my friend was of opinion that when a man of rank appeared in that character he deserved to have his merit handsomely allowed men of rank and fortune however should be pretty well assured of having a real claim to the approbation of the public as writers before they venture to stand forth dryden in his presace to all for love thus expresses himself  men of pleasant conversation at least esteemed so and endued with a trifling kind of fancy perhaps helped out by a smattering of latin are ambitious to distinguish themselves from the herd of gentlemen by their poetry rarus euim ferme sensus communis illa fortuna  and is not this a wretched affectation not to be contented with what fortune has done for them and sit down quietly with their estates but they must call their wits in question and needlessly expose their nakedness to public view not considering that they are not to expect the same approbation from sober men which they have found from their flatterers after the third bottle if a little glittering in discourse has passed them on us for witty men where was the necessity of undeceiving the world would a man who has an ill title to an estate but yet is in possession of it would he bring it of his own accord to be tried at westminster we who write if we want the talents yet have the excuse that we do it for a poor subsistence but what can be urged in their defense who not having the vocation of poverty to scribble out of mere wantonness take pains to make themselves ridiculous horace was certainly in the right where he said that no man is satisfied with his own condition a poet is not pleased because he is not rich and the rich are discontented because the poets will not admit them of their number    in this i think he was more liberal than mr william whitehead in his elegy to lord villiers in which under the pretext of superior toils demanding all their care he discovers a jealousy of the great paying their court to the muses    to the chosen few who dare excel thy fostring aid afford their arts their magic powers with honors due exalt  but be thyself what they record johnson had called twice on the bishop of killaloe before his lordship set out for ireland having missed him the first time he said it would have hung heavy on my heart if i had not seen him no man ever paid more attention to another than he has done to me this gave me a very great pleasure for there had been once a pretty smart altercation between dr barnard and him upon a question whether a man could improve himself after the age of fortyfive when johnson in a hasty humor expressed himself in a manner not quite civil dr barnard made it the subject of a copy of pleasant verses in which he supposed himself to learn different perfections from different men they concluded with delicate irony  johnson shall teach me how to place in fairest light each borrowed grace from him i will learn to write copy his clear familiar style and by the roughness of his file grow  like himself  polite i know not if johnson ever saw the poem but i had occasion to find that as dr barnard and he knew each other better their mutual regard increased    and i have neglected him not wilfully but from being otherwise occupied always sir set a high value on spontaneous kindness he whose inclination prompts him to cultivate your friendship of his own accord will love you more than one whom you have been at pains to attach to you  johnson told me that he was once much pleased to find that a carpenter who lived near him was very ready to show him some things in his business which he wished to see it was paying said he respect to literature  i asked him if he was not dissatisfied with having so small a share of wealth and none of those distinctions in the state which are the objects of ambition he had only a pension of three hundred a year why was he not in such circumstances as to keep his coach why had he not some considerable office johnson sir i have never complained of the world nor do i think that i have reason to complain it is rather to be wondered at that i have so much my pension is more out of the usual course of things than any instance that i have known here sir was a man avowedly no friend to the government at the time gets a pension without asking for it i never courted the great they sent for me but i think they now give me up they are satisfied they have seen enough of me upon my observing that i could not believe this for they must certainly be highly pleased by his conversation conscious of his own superiority he answered no sir great lords and great ladies dont love to have their mouths stopped this was very expressive of the effect which the force of his understanding and brilliancy of his fancy could not but produce and to be sure they must have found themselves strangely diminished in his company when i warmly declared how happy i was at all times to hear him  yes sir said he but if you were lord chancellor it would not be so you would then consider your own dignity  there was much truth and knowledge of human nature in this remark but certainly one should think that in whatever elevated state of life a man who knew the value of the conversation of johnson might be placed though he might prudently avoid a situation in which he might appear lessened by comparison yet he would frequently gratify himself in private with the participation of the rich intellectual entertainment which johnson could furnish strange however it is to consider how few of the great sought his society so that if one were disposed to take occasion for satire on that account very conspicuous objects present themselves his noble friend lord elibank well observed that if a great man procured an interview with johnson and did not wish to see him more it showed a mere idle curiosity and a wretched want of relish for extraordinary powers of mind mrs thrale justly and wittily accounted for such conduct by saying that johnsons conversation was by much too strong for a person accustomed to obsequiousness and flattery it was mustard in a young childs mouth  one day when i told him that i was a zealous tory but not enough according to knowledge and should be obliged to him for a reason he was so candid and expressed himself so well that i begged of him to repeat what he had said and i wrote down as follows  of tory and whig a wise tory and a wise whig i believe will agree their principles are the same though their modes of thinking are different a high tory makes government unintelligible it is lost in the clouds a violent whig makes it impracticable he is for allowing so much liberty to every man that there is not power enough to govern any man the prejudice of the tory is for establishment the prejudice of the whig is for innovation a tory does not wish to give more real power to government but that government should have more reverence then they differ as to the church the tory is not for giving more legal power to the clergy but wishes they should have a considerable influence founded on the opinion of mankind the whig is for limiting and watching them with a narrow jealousy  on saturday june   i set out for scotland and had engaged as i sometimes did to pay a visit in my way at southill in bedfordshire at the hospitable mansion of squire dilly the elder brother of my worthy friends the booksellers in the poultry dr johnson agreed to be of the party this year with mr charles dilly and me and to go and see lord butes seat at luton hoe he talked little to us in the carriage being chiefly occupied in reading dr watsons second volume of chemical essays which he liked very well and his own prince of abyssinia on which he seemed to be intensely fixed having told us that he had not looked at it since it was first published i happened to take it out of my pocket today and he seized upon it with avidity he pointed out to me the following remarkable passage by what means said the prince are the europeans thus powerful or why since they can so easily visit asia and africa for trade or conquest cannot the asiaticks and africans invade their coasts plant colonies in their ports and give laws to their natural princes the same wind that carries them back would bring us hither  they are more powerful sir than we answered imlac because they are wiser knowledge will always predominate over ignorance as man governs the other animals but why their knowledge is more than ours i know not what reason can be given but the unsearchable will of the supreme being he said this sir no man can explain otherwise  we stopped at welwyn where i wished much to see in company with dr johnson the residence of the author of night thoughts which was then possessed by his son mr young here some address was requisite for i was not acquainted with mr young and had i proposed to dr johnson that we should send to him he would have checked my wish and perhaps been offended i therefore concerted with mr dilly that i should steal away from dr johnson and him and try what reception i could procure from mr young if unfavourable nothing was to be said but if agreeable i should return and notify it to them i hastened to mr youngs found he was at home sent in word that a gentleman desired to wait upon him and was shown into a parlour where he and a young lady his daughter were sitting he appeared to be a plain civil country gentleman and when i begged pardon for presuming to trouble him but said i wished much to see his place if he would give me leave he behaved very courteously and answered by all means sir we are just going to drink tea will you sit down i thanked him but said that dr johnson had come with me from london and i must return to the inn and drink tea with him that my name was boswell i had traveled with him in the hebrides sir said he i should think it a great honor to see dr johnson here will you allow me to send for him availing myself of this opening i said that i would go myself and bring him when he had drunk tea he knew nothing of my calling here having been thus successful i hastened back to the inn and informed dr johnson that mr young son of dr young the author of night thoughts whom i had just left desired to have the honor of seeing him at the house where his father lived dr johnson luckily made no inquiry how this invitation had arisen but agreed to go and when we entered mr youngs parlour he addressed him with a very polite bow sir i had a curiosity to come and see this place i had the honor to know that great man your father we went into the garden where we found a gravel walk on each side of which was a row of trees planted by dr young which formed a handsome gothic arch dr johnson called it a fine grove i beheld it with reverence  we sat some time in the summer house on the outside wall of which was inscribed ambulantes in horto audiebant vocem dei and in reference to a brook by which it is situated  vivendi recte qui prorogat horam etc i said to mr young that i had been told his father was cheerful sir said he he was too wellbred a man not to be cheerful in company but he was gloomy when alone he never was cheerful after my mothers death and he had met with many disappointments dr johnson observed to me afterward that this was no favorable account of dr young for it is not becoming in a man to have so little acquiescence in the ways of providence as to be gloomy because he has not obtained as much preferment as he expected nor to continue gloomy for the loss of his wife grief has its time the last part of this censure was theoretically made practically we know that grief for the loss of a wise may be continued very long in proportion as affection has been sincere no man knew this better than dr johnson  we went into the church and looked at the monument erected by mr young to his father mr young mentioned an anecdote that his father had received several thousand pounds of subscriptionmoney for his universal passion but had lost it in the south sea dr johnson thought this must be a mistake for he had never seen a subscriptionbook  upon the road we talked of the uncertainty of profit with which authors and booksellers engage in the publication of literary works johnson my judgment i have found is no certain rule as to the sale of a book boswell pray sir have you been much plagued with authors sending you their works to revise johnson no sir i have been thought a sour surly fellow boswell very lucky for you sir  in that respect i must however observe that notwithstanding what he now said which he no doubt imagined at the time to be the fact there was perhaps no man who more frequently yielded to the solicitations even of very obscure authors to read their manuscripts or more liberally assisted them with advice and correction  he found himself very happy at mr dillys where there is always abundance of excellent fare and hearty welcome  on sunday june   we all went to southill church which is very near to mr dillys house it being the first sunday of the month the holy sacrament was administered and i staid to partake of it when i came afterward into dr johnsons room he said you did right to stay and receive the communion i had not thought of it this seemed to imply that he did not choose to approach the altar without a previous preparation as to which good men entertain different opinions some holding that it is irreverent to partake of that ordinance without considerable premeditation others that whoever is a sincere christian and in a proper frame to discharge any other ritual duty of our religion may without scruple discharge this most solemn one a middle notion i believe to be the just one which is that communicants need not think a long train of preparatory forms indispensibly necessary but neither should they rashly and lightly venture upon so aweful and mysterious an institution christians must judge each for himself what degree of retirement and selfexamination is necessary upon each occasion  being in a frame which i hope for the felicity of human nature many experience  in fine weather  at the country house of a friend  consoled and elevated by pious exercises  i expressed myself with an unrestrained servour to my guide philosopher and friend my dear sir i would fain be a good man and i am very good now i fear god and honor the king i wish to do no ill and to be benevolent to all mankind he looked at me with a benignant indulgence but took occasion to give me able and salutary caution do not sir accustom yourself to trust to impressions there is a middle state of mind between conviction and hypocrisy of which many are conscious by trusting to impressions a man may gradually come to yield to them and at length be subject to them so as not to be a free agent or what is the same thing in effect to suppose that he is not a free agent a man who is in that state should not be suffered to live if he declares he cannot help acting in a particular way but is irresistibly impelled there can be no confidence in him no more than in a tiger but sir no man believes himself to be impelled irresistibly we know that he who says he believes it lies favorable impressions at particular moments as to the state of our souls may be deceitful and dangerous in general no man can be sure of his acceptance with god some indeed may have had it revealed to them st paul who wrought miracles may have had a miracle wrought on himself and may have obtained supernatural assurance of pardon and mercy and beatitude yet st paul though he expresses strong hope also expresses fear lest having preached to others he himself should be a castaway  the opinion of a learned bishop of our acquaintance as to there being merit in religious faith being mentioned johnson why yes sir the most licentious man were hell open before him would not take the most beautiful strumpet to his arms we must as the apostle says live by faith not by sight  i talked to him of original sin dr ogden in his second sermon on the articles of the christian faith with admirable acuteness thus addresses the opposers of that doctrine which accounts for the confusion sin and misery which we find in this life it would be severe in god you think to degrade us to such a sad state as this for the offense of our first parents but you can allow him to place us in it without any inducement are our calamities lessened for not being ascribed to adam if your condition be unhappy is it not still unhappy whatever was the occasion with the aggravation of this reflection that if it was as good as it was at first designed there seems to be somewhat the less reason to look for its amendment  in consequence of the fall of man and of the atonement made by our savior after some conversation which he desired me to remember he at my request dictated to me as follows  with respect to original sin the inquiry is not necessary for whatever is the cause of human corruption men are evidently and confessedly so corrupt that all the laws of heaven and earth are insufficient to restrain them from crimes  whatever difficulty there may be in the conception of vicarious punishments it is an opinion which has had possession of mankind in all ages there is no nation that has not used the practice of sacrifices whoever therefore denies the propriety of vicarious punishments holds an opinion which the sentiments and practice of mankind have contradicted from the beginning of the world the great sacrifice for the sins of mankind was offered at the death of the messiah who is called in scripture the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world to judge of the reasonableness of the scheme of redemption it must be considered as necessary to the government of the universe that god should make known his perpetual and irreconcilable detestation of moral evil he might indeed punish and punish only the offenders but as the end of punishment is not revenge of crimes but propagation of virtue it was more becoming the divine clemency to find another manner of proceeding less destructive to man and at least equally powerful to promote goodness the end of punishment is to reclaim and warn that punishment will both reclaim and warn which shows evidently such abhorrence of sin in god as may deter us from it or strike us with dread of vengeance when we have committed it this is effected by vicarious punishment nothing could more testify the opposition between the nature of god and moral evil or more amply display his justice to men and angels to all orders and successions of beings than that it was necessary for the highest and purest nature even for divinity itself to pacify the demands of vengeance by a painful death of which the natural effect will be that when justice is appeased there is a proper place for the exercise of mercy and that such propitiation shall supply in some degree the imperfections of our obedience and the inefficacy of our repentance for obedience and repentance such as we can perform are still necessary our savior has told us that he did not come to destroy the law but to fulfill to fulfill the typical law by the performance of what those types had foreshewn and the moral law by precepts of greater purity and higher exaltation  here he said god bless you with it i acknowledged myself much obliged to him but i begged that he would go on as to the propitiation being the chief object of our most holy faith he then dictated this one other paragraph  the peculiar doctrine of christianity is that of an universal sacrifice and perpetual propitiation other prophets only proclaimed the will and the threatenings of god christ satisfied his justice  the reverend mr palmer fellow of queenscollege cambridge dined with us he expressed a wish that a better provision were made for parishclerks johnson yes sir a parishclerk should be a man who is able to make a will or write a letter for any body in the parish  i mentioned lord monboddos notion that the ancient egyptians with all their learning and all their arts were not only black but woollyhaired mr palmer asked how did it appear upon examining the mummies dr johnson approved of this test  although upon most occasions i never heard a more strenuous advocate for the advantages of wealth than dr johnson he this day i know not from what caprice took the other side i have not observed said he that men of very large fortunes enjoy any thing extraordinary that makes happiness what has the duke of bedford what has the duke of devonshire the only great instance that i have ever known of the enjoyment of wealth was that of jamaica dawkins who going to visit palmyra and hearing that the way was infested by robbers hired a troop of turkish horse to guard him  dr gibbons the dissenting minister being mentioned he said i took to dr gibbons and addressing himself to mr charles dilly added i shall be glad to see him tell him if he will call on me and dawdle over a dish of tea in an afternoon i shall take it kind  the reverend mr smith vicar of southill a very respectable man with a very agreeable family sent an invitation to us to drink tea i remarked dr johnsons very formal politeness though always fond of changing the scene he said we must have mr dillys leave we cannot go from your house sir without your permission we all went and were well satisfied with our visit i however remember nothing particular except a nice distinction which dr johnson made with respect to the power of memory maintaining that forgetfulness was a mans own fault to remember and to recollect said he are different things a man has not the power to recollect what is not in his mind but when a thing is in his mind he may remember it the remark was occasioned by my leaning back on a chair which a little before i had perceived to be broken and pleading forgetfulness as an excuse sir said he its being broken was certainly in your mind  when i observed that a housebreaker was in general very timorous johnson no wonder sir he is afraid of being shot getting into a house or hanged when he has got out of it  he told us that he had in one day written six sheets of a translation from the french adding i should be glad to see it now i wish that i had copies of all the pamphlets written against me as it is said pope had had i known that i should make so much noise in the world i should have been at pains to collect them i believe there is hardly a day in which there is not something about me in the newspapers  on monday june   we all went to lutonhoe to see lord butes magnificent seat for which i had obtained a ticket as we entered the park i talked in a high style of my old friendship with lord mountstuart and said i shall probably be much at this place the sage aware of human vicissitudes gently checked me dont you be too sure of that he made two or three peculiar observations as when shown the botanical garden is not every garden a botanical garden when told that there was a shrubbery to the extent of several miles that is making a very foolish use of the ground a little of it is very well when it was proposed that we should walk on the pleasureground dont let us fatigue ourselves why should we walk there here is a fine tree let us get to the top of it but upon the whole he was very much pleased he said this is one of the places i do not regret having come to see it is a very stately place indeed in the house magnificence is not sacrificed to convenience nor convenience to magnificence the library is very splendid the dignity of the rooms is very great and the quantity of pictures is beyond expectation beyond hope  it happened without any previous concert that we visited the seat of lord bute upon the kings birthday we dined and drank his majestys health at an inn in the village of luton  in the evening i put him in mind of his promise to favor me with a copy of his celebrated letter to the earl of chesterfield see page     of vol i  and he was at last pleased to comply with this earnest request by dictating it to me from his memory for he believed that he himself had no copy there was an animated glow in his countenance while he thus recalled his highminded indignation  he laughed heartily at a ludicrous action in the court of session in which i was counsel the society of procurators or attorneys entitled to practice in the inferior courts at edinburgh had obtained a royal charter in which they had taken care to have their ancient designation of procurators changed into that of solicitors from a notion as they supposed that it was more genteel and this new title they displayed by a public advertisement for a general meeting at their hall  it has been said that the scottish nation is not distinguished for humor and indeed what happened on this occasion may in some degree justify the remark for although this society had contrived to make themselves a very prominent object for the ridicule of such as might stoop to it the only joke that appeared was the following paragraph sent as a card to the newspaper called the caledonian mercury  a correspondent informs us that the worshipful society of chaldeans cadies or running stationers of this city are resolved in imitation and encouraged by the singular success of their brethren of an equally respectable society to apply for a charter of their privileges particularly of the sole privilege of procuring in the most extensive sense of the word exclusive of chairmen porters pennypost men and other inferior ranks their brethren the r  y  l s  ll  rs alias p  c  rs before the inferior courts of this city always excepted  should the worshipful society be successful they are farther resolved not to be puffed up thereby but to demean themselves with more equanimity and decency than their ryl learned and very modest brethren above mentioned have done upon their late dignification and exaltation  a majority of the members of the society prosecuted mr robertson the publisher of the paper for damages and the first judgment of the whole court very wisely dismissed the action solventur risu tabulae tu missus abibis but a new trial or review was granted upon a petition according to the forms in scotland this petition i was engaged to answer and dr johnson with great alacrity furnished tonight what follows  all injury is either of the person the fortune or the fame now it is a certain thing it is proverbially known that a jest breaks no bones they never have gained halfacrown less in the whole profession since this mischievous paragraph has appeared and as to their reputation what is their reputation but an instrument of getting money if therefore they have lost no money the question upon reputation may be answered by a very old position de minimis non curat praetor  whether there was or was not an animus injuriandi is not worth inquiring if no injuria can be proved but the truth is there was no animus injuriandi it was only an animus irritandi mr robertson altered this word to jocandi he having found in blackstone that to irritate is actionable  which happening to be exercised upon a genus irritable produced unexpected violence of resentment their irritability arose only from an opinion of their own importance and their delight in their new exaltation what might have been borne by a procurator could not be borne by a solicitor your lordships well know that honores mutant mores titles and dignities play strongly upon the fancy as a madman is apt to think himself grown suddenly great so he that grows suddenly great is apt to borrow a little from the madman to cooperate with their resentment would be to promote their phrenzy nor is it possible to guess to what they might proceed if to the new title of solicitor should be added the elation of victory and triumph  we consider your lordships as the protectors of our rights and the guardians of our virtues but believe it not included in your high office that you should flatter our vices or solace our vanity and as vanity only dictates this prosecution it is humbly hoped your lordships will dismiss it  if every attempt however light or ludicrous to lessen anothers reputation is to be punished by a judicial sentence what punishment can be sufficiently severe for him who attempts to diminish the reputation of the supreme court of justice by reclaiming upon a cause already determined without any change in the state of the question does it not imply hopes that the judges will change their opinion is not uncertainty and inconstancy in the highest degree disreputable to a court does it not suppose that the former judgment was temerarious or negligent does it not lessen the confidence of the public will it not be said that jus est aut incognitum aut vagum and will not the consequence be drawn misera est servitus will not the rules of action be obscure will not he who knows himself wrong today hope that the courts of justice will think him right tomorrow surely my lords these are attempts of dangerous tendency which the solicitors as men versed in the law should have foreseen and avoided it was natural for an ignorant printer to appeal from the lord ordinary but from lawyers the descendents of lawyers who have practiced for three hundred years and have now raised themselves to a higher denomination it might be expected that they should know the reverence due to a judicial determination and having been once dismissed should sit down in silence  i am ashamed to mention that the court by a plurality of voices without having a single additional circumstance before them reversed their own judgment made a serious matter of this dull and foolish joke and adjudged mr robertson to pay to the society five pounds sterling money and costs of suit the decision will seem strange to english lawyers  on tuesday june   johnson was to return to london he was very pleasant at breakfast i mentioned a friend of mine having resolved never to marry a pretty woman johnson sir it is a very foolish resolution to resolve not to marry a pretty woman beauty is of itself very estimable no sir i would prefer a pretty woman unless there are objections to her a pretty woman may be foolish a pretty woman may be wicked a pretty woman may not like me but there is no such danger in marrying a pretty woman as is apprehended she will not be persecuted if she does not invite persecution a pretty woman if she has a mind to be wicked can find a readier way than another and that is all  i accompanied him in mr dillys chaise to shefford where talking of lord butes never going to scotland he said as an englishman i should wish all the scotch gentlemen to be educated in england scotland would become a province they would spend all their rents in england this is a subject of much consequence and much delicacy the advantage of an english education is unquestionably very great to scotch gentlemen of talents and ambition and regular visits and i should think other means might be effectually used to prevent them from being totally estranged from their native country any more than a cumberland or northumberland gentleman who has been educated in the south of england i own indeed that it is no small misfortune for scotch gentlemen who have neither talents nor ambition to be educated in england where they may be perhaps distinguished only by a nickname lavish their fortune in giving expensive entertainments to those who laugh at them and saunter about as mere idle insignificant hangers on even upon the foolish great when if they had been judiciously brought up at home they might have been comfortable and creditable members of society  at shefford i had another affectionate parting from my revered friend who was taken up by the bedford coach and carried to the metropolis i went with messieurs dilly to see some friends at bedford dined with the officers of the militia of the county and next day proceeded on my journey  to bennet langton esquire dear sir how welcome your account of yourself and your invitation to your new house was to me i need not tell you who consider our friendship not only as formed by choice but as matured by time we have been now long enough acquainted to have many images in common and therefore to have a source of conversation which neither the learning nor the wit of a new companion can supply  my lives are now published and if your will tell me whither i shall send them that they may come to you i will take care that you shall not be without them  you will perhaps be glad to hear that mrs thrale is disincumbred of her brewhouse and that it seemed to the purchaser so far from an evil that he was content to give for it an hundred and thirtyfive thousand pounds is the nation ruined  please to make my respectful compliments to lady rothes and keep me in the memory of all the little dear family particularly pretty mrs jane  i am sir your affectionate humble servant sam johnson boltcourt june          to thomas astle esquire sir i am ashamed that you have been forced to call so often for your books but it has been by no fault on either side they have never been out of my hands nor have i ever been at home without seeing you for to see a man so skilful in the antiquities of my country is an opportunity of improvement not willingly to be missed  your notes on alfred the will of king alsred alluded to in this letter is now printing from the original saxon in the library of mr astle at the expense of the university of oxford it is not to be sold but is to be distributed in presents appear to me very judicious and accurate but they are too few many things familiar to you are unknown to me and to most others and you must not think too favorably of your readers by supposing them knowing you will leave them ignorant measure of land and value of money it is of great importance to state with care had the saxons any gold coin  i have much curiosity after the manners and transactions of the middle ages but have wanted either diligence or opportunity in both you sir have great opportunities and i wish you both diligence and success  i am sir etc sam johnson july          the following curious anecdote i insert in dr burneys own words dr burney related to dr johnson the partiality which his writings had excited in a friend of dr burneys the late mr bewley well known in norfolk by the name of the philosopher of massingham who from the ramblers and plan of his dictionary and long before the authors fame was established by the dictionary itself or any other work had conceived such a reverence for him that he urgently begged dr burney to give him the cover of the first letter he had received from him as a relick of so estimable a writer this was in      in    0 when dr burney visited dr johnson at the temple in london where he had then chambers he happened to arrive there before he was up and being shown into the room where he was to breakfast finding himself alone he examined the contents of the apartment to try whether he could undiscovered steal any thing to send to his friend bewley as another relick of the admirable dr johnson but finding nothing better to his purpose he cut some bristles off his hearthbroom and enclosed them in a letter to his country enthusiast who received them with due reverence the doctor was so sensible of the honor done him by a man of genius and science to whom he was an utter stranger that he said to dr burney sir there is no man possessed of the smallest portion of modesty but must be flattered with the admiration of such a man i will give him a set of my lives if he will do me the honor to accept of them in this he kept his word and dr burney had not only the pleasure of gratifying his friend with a present more worthy of his acceptance than the segment from the hearthbroom but soon after of introducing him to dr johnson himself in boltcourt with whom he had the satisfaction of conversing a considerable time not a fortnight before his death which happened in st martinsstreet during his visit to dr burney in the house where the great sir isaac newton had lived and died before  in one of his little memorandumbooks is the following minute  august     p m aetat    in the summer house at streatham  after innumerable resolutions formed and neglected i have retired hither to plan a life of greater diligence in hope that i may yet be useful and be daily better prepared to appear before my creator and my judge from whose infinite mercy i humbly call for assistance and support  my purpose is  to pass eight hours every day in some serious employment  having prayed i purpose to employ the next six weeks upon the italian language for my settled study  how venerably pious does he appear in these moments of solitude and how spirited are his resolutions for the improvement of his mind even in elegant literature at a very advanced period of life and when afflicted with many complaints  in autumn he went to oxford birmingham lichfield and ashbourne for which very good reasons might be given in the conjectural yet positive manner of writers who are proud to account for every event which they relate he himself however says the motives of my journey i hardly know i omitted it last year and am not willing to miss it again prayers and meditations p  0   but some good considerations arise amongst which is the kindly recollection of mr hector surgeon at birmingham hector is likewise an old friend the only companion of my childhood that passed through the school with me we have always loved one another perhaps we may be made better by some serious conversation of which however i have no distinct hope  he says too at lichfield my native place i hope to show a good example by frequent attendance on public worship  my correspondence with him during the rest of this year was i know not why very scanty and all on my side i wrote him one letter to introduce mr sinclair now sir john the member for caithness to his acquaintance and informed him in another that my wife had again been affected with alarming symptoms of illness    to james boswell esquire dear sir i sit down to answer your letter on the same day in which i received it and am pleased that my first letter of the year is to you no man ought to be at ease while he knows himself in the wrong and i have not satisfied myself with my long silence the letter relating to mr sinclair however was i believe never brought  my health has been tottering this last year and i can give no very laudable account of my time i am always hoping to do better than i have ever hitherto done    i hope that dear mrs boswell will surmount her complaints in losing her you would lose your anchor and be tossed without stability by the waves of life the truth of this has been proved by sad experience  i wish both her and you very many years and very happy  for some months past i have been so withdrawn from the world that i can send you nothing particular all your friends however are well and will be glad of your return to london  i am dear sir yours most affectionately sam johnson january         at a time when he was less able than he had once been to sustain a shock he was suddenly deprived of mr levett which he thus communicated to dr lawrence sir our old friend mr levett who was last night eminently cheerful died this morning the man who lay in the same room hearing an uncommon noise got up and tried to make him speak but without effect he then called mr holder the apothecary who though when he came he thought him dead opened a vein but could draw no blood so has ended the long life of a very useful and very blameless man  i am sir your most humble servant sam johnson jan            in one of his memorandumbooks in my possession is the following entry january  0 sunday robert levett was buried in the churchyard of bridewell between one and two in the afternoon he died on thursday    about seven in the morning by an instantaneous death he was an old and faithful friend i have known him from about    commendari may god have mercy on him may he have mercy on me  such was johnsons affectionate regard for levett see an account of him in gentlemans magazine feb       that he honored his memory with the following verses  condemned to hopes delusive mine as on we toil from day to day by sudden blast or slow decline our social comforts drop away well tried through many a varying year see levett to the grave descend officious innocent sincere of every friendless name the friend yet still he fills affections eye obscurely wise and coarsely kind nor lettered arrogance in both editions of sir john hawkinss life of dr johnson lettered ignorance is printed  deny the praise to merit unrefind when fainting nature called for aid and hovering death prepared the blow his vigorous remedy displayed the power of art without the show in miserys darkest caverns known his ready help was ever nigh where hopeless anguish pours his groan and lonely want retired to die johnson repeated this line to me thus and labor steals an hour to die but he afterward altered it to the present reading  no summons mocked by chill delay no petty gains disdained by pride the modest wants of every day the toil of every day supplied his virtues walked their narrow round nor made a pause nor left a void and sure the eternal master found his single talent well employed the busy day the peaceful night unfelt uncounted glided by his frame was firm his powers were bright though now his eightieth year was nigh then with no throbs of fiery pain no cold gradations of decay death broke at once the vital chain and freed his soul the nearest way in one of his registers of this year there occurs the following curious passage jan  0 the ministry is dissolved i prayed with francis and gave thanks prayers and meditations p  0   it has been the subject of discussion whether there are two distinct particulars mentioned here or that we are to understand the giving of thanks to be in consequence of the dissolution of the ministry in support of the last of these conjectures may be urged his mean opinion of that ministry which has frequently appeared in the course of this work and it is strongly confirmed by what he said on the subject to mr seward  i am glad the ministry is removed such a bunch of imbecility never disgraced a country if they sent a messenger into the city to take up a printer the messenger was taken up instead of the printer and committed by the sitting alderman if they sent one army to the relief of another the first army was defeated and taken before the second arrived i will not say that what they did was always wrong but it was always done at a wrong time  to mrs strahan dear madam mrs williams showed me your kind letter this little habitation is now but a melancholy place clouded with the gloom of disease and death of the four inmates one has been suddenly snatched away two are oppressed by very afflictive and dangerous illness and i tried yesterday to gain some relief by a third bleeding from a disorder which has for some time distressed me and i think myself today much better  i am glad dear madam to hear that you are so far recovered as to go to bath let me once more entreat you to stay till your health is not only obtained but confirmed your fortune is such as that no moderate expense deserves your care and you have a husband who i believe does not regard it stay therefore till you are quite well i am for my part very much deserted but complaint is useless i hope god will bless you and i desire you to form the same wish for me  i am dear madam your most humble servant sam johnson feb         to edmond malone esquire sir i have for many weeks been so much out of order that i have gone out only in a coach to mrs thrales where i can use all the freedom that sickness requires do not therefore take it amiss that i am not with you and dr farmer i hope hereafter to see you often  i am sir your most humble servant sam johnson feb          to the same dear sir i hope i grow better and shall soon be able to enjoy the kindness of my friends i think this wild adherence to chatterton more unaccountable than the obstinate defense of ossian in ossian there is a national pride which may be forgiven though it cannot be applauded in chatterton there is nothing but the resolution to say again what has once been said  i am sir your humble servant sam johnson march         these short letters show the regard which dr johnson entertained for mr malone who the more he is known is the more highly valued it is much to be regretted that johnson was prevented from sharing the elegant hospitality of that gentlemans table at which he would in every respect have been fully gratified mr malone who has so ably succeeded him as an editor of shakspeare has in his preface done great and just honor to johnsons memory  to mrs lucy porter in lichfield dear madam i went away from lichfield ill and have had a troublesome time with my breath for some weeks i have been disordered by a cold of which  could not get the violence abated till i had been let blood three times i have not however been so bad but that i could have written and i am sorry that i neglected it  my dwelling is but melancholy both williams and defmoulins and myself are very sickly frank is not well and poor levett died in his bed the other day by a sudden stroke i suppose not one minute passed between health and death so uncertain are human things  such is the appearance of the world about me i hope your scenes are more cheerful but whatever befalls us though it is wise to be serious it is useless and foolish and perhaps sinful to be gloomy let us therefore keep ourselves as easy as we can though the loss of friends will be felt and poor levett had been a faithful adherent for thirty years  forgive me my dear love the omission of writing i hope to mend that and my other faults let me have your prayers  make my compliments to mr cobb and miss adey and mr pearson and the whole company of my friends  i am my dear your most humble servant sam johnson london march         to the same dear madam my last was but a dull letter and i know not that this will be much more cheerful i am however willing to write because you are desirous to hear from me  my disorder has now begun its ninth week for it is not yet over i was last thursday blooded for the fourth time and have since found myself much relieved but i am very tender and easily hurt so that since we parted i have had little comfort but i hope that the spring will recover me and that in the summer i shall see lichfield again for i will not delay my visit another year to the end of autumn  i have by advertising found poor mr levetts brothers in yorkshire who will take the little that he has left it is but little yet it will be welcome for i believe they are of very low condition  to be sick and to see nothing but sickness and death is but a gloomy state but i hope better times even in this world will come and whatever this world may withold or give we shall be happy in a better state pray for me my dear lucy  make my compliments to mrs cobb and miss adey and my old friend hetty bailey and to all the lichfield ladies  i am dear madam yours affectionately sam johnson boltcourt fleet street march          on the day on which this letter was written he thus feelingly mentions his respected friend and physician dr lawrence  poor lawrence has almost lost the sense of hearing and i have lost the conversation of a learned intelligent and communicative companion and a friend whom long familiarity has much endeared lawrence is one of the best men whom i have known  nostrum omnium misera deus prayers and meditations p  0    it was dr johnsons custom when he wrote to dr lawrence concerning his own health to use the latin language i have been favored by miss lawrence with one of these letters as a specimen  t lawrentio medico s novum frigus nova tussis nova spirandi difficultas novam sanguinis missionem suadent quam tamen te inconsulto nolim fieri ad te venire vix possum nec est cur ad me venias licere vel non licere uno verbo dicendum est caetera mihi et holdero mr holder dr johnsons apothecary reliqueris si per te licet imperatur nuncio holderum ad me deducere  maiis calendis      postquam tu discesseris quo me vertam soon after the above letter dr lawrence left london but not before the palsy had made so great a progress as to render him unable to write for himself  the following are extracts from letters addressed to one of his daughters  you will easily believe with what gladness i read that you had heard once again that voice to which we have all so often delighted to attend may you often hear it if we had his mind and his tongue we could spare the rest  i am not vigorous but much better than when dear dr lawrence held my pulse the last time be so kind as to let me know from one little interval to another the state of his body i am pleased that he remembers me and hope that it never can be possible for me to forget him  july          i am much delighted even with the small advances which dear dr lawrence makes toward recovery if we could have again but his mind and his tongue in his mind and his right hand we should not much lament the rest i should not despair of helping the swelled hand by electricity if it were frequently and diligently supplied  let me know from time to time whatever happens and hope i need not tell you how much i am interested in every change  aug          though the accounts with which you favored me in your last letter could not give me the pleasure that i wished yet i was glad to receive it for my affection to my dear friend makes me desirous of knowing his state whatever it be i beg therefore that you continue to let me know from time to time all that you observe  many fits of severe illness have for about three months past forced my kind physician often upon my mind i am now better and hope gratitude as well as distress can be a motive to remembrance  boltcourt fleet street feb               to captain langton mr langton being at this time on duty at rochester he is addressed by his military title  in rochester dear sir it is now long since we saw one another and whatever has been the reason neither you have written to me nor i to you to let friendship die away by negligence and silence is certainly not wise it is voluntarily to throw away one of the greatest comforts of this weary pilgrimage of which when it is as it must be taken finally away he that travels on alone will wonder how his esteem could be so little do not forget me you see that i do not forget you it is pleasing in the silence of solitude to think that there is one at least however distant of whose benevolence there is little doubt and whom there is yet hope of seeing again  of my life from the time we parted the history is mournful the spring of last year deprived me of thrale a man whose eye for fifteen years had scarcely been turned upon me but with respect or tenderness for such another friend the general course of human things will not suffer man to hope i passed the summer at streatham but there was no thrale and having idled away the summer with a weakly body and neglected mind i made a journey to staffordshire on the edge of winter the season was dreary i was sickly and found the friends sickly whom i went to see after a sorrowful sojourn i returned to a habitation possessed for the present by two sick women where my dear old friend mr levett to whom as he used to tell me i owe your acquaintance died a few weeks ago suddenly in his bed there passed not i believe a minute between health and death at night as at mrs thrales i was musing in my chamber i thought with uncommon earnestness that however i might alter my mode of life or whithersoever i might remove i would endeavor to retain levett about me in the morning my servant brought me word that levett was called to another state a state for which i think he was not unprepared for he was very useful to the poor how much soever i valued him i now wish that i had valued him more  i have myself been ill more than eight weeks of a disorder from which at the expense of about fifty ounces of blood i hope i am now recovering  you dear sir have i hope a more cheerful scene you see george sond of his book and the pretty misses airy and lively with my own little jenny equal to the best and in whatever can contribute to your quiet or pleasure you have lady rothes ready to concur may whatever you enjoy of good be increased and whatever you suffer of evil be diminished  i am dear sir your humble servant sam johnson boltcourt fleet street march  0       to mr hector in birmingham a part of this letter having been torn off i have from the evident meaning supplied a few words and half words at the ends and beginnings of lines  dear sir i hope i do not very grossly flatter myself to imagine that you and dear mrs careless will be glad to hear some account of me i performed the journey to london with very little inconvenience and came safe to my habitation where i found nothing but ill health and of consequence very little cheerfulness i then went to visit a little way into the country where i got a complaint by a cold which has hung eight weeks upon me and from which i am at the expense of fifty ounces of blood not yet free i am afraid i must once more owe my recovery to warm weather which seems to make the advances toward us  such is my health which will i hope soon grow better in other respects i have no reason to complain i know not that i have written any thing more generally commended than the lives of the poets and have found the world willing enough to caress me if my health had invited me to be in much company but this season i have been almost wholly employed in nursing myself  when summer comes i hope to see you again and will not put off my visit to the end of the year i have lived so long in london that i did not remember the difference of seasons  your health when i saw you was much improved you will be prudent enough not to put it in danger i hope when we meet again we shall all congratulate each other upon fair prospects of longer life though what are the pleasures of the longest life when placed in comparison with a happy death  i am dear sir yours most affectionately sam johnson london march          to the same dear sir without a date but supposed to be about this time that you and dear mrs careless should have care or curiosity about my health gives me that pleasure which every man feels from finding himself not forgotten in age we feel again that love of our native place and our early friends which in the bustle or amusements of middle life were overborn and suspended you and i should now naturally cling to one another we have outlived most of those who could pretend to rival us in each others kindness in our walk through life we have dropped our companions and are now to pick up such as chance may offer us or to travel on alone you indeed have a sister with whom you can divide the day i have no natural friend left but providence has been pleased to preserve me from neglect i have not wanted such alleviations of life as friendship could supply my health has been from my twentieth year such as has seldom afforded me a single day of ease but it is at least not worse and i sometimes make myself believe that it is better my disorders are however still sufficiently oppressive  i think of seeing staffordshire again this autumn and intend to find my way through birmingham where i hope to see you and dear mrs careless well  i am sir your affectionate friend sam johnson   i wrote to him at different dates regretted that i could not come to london this spring but hoped we should meet somewhere in the summer mentioned the state of my affairs and suggested hopes of some preferment informed him that as the beauties of johnson had been published in london some obscure scribbler had published at edinburgh what he called deformities of johnson  to james boswell esquire dear sir the pleasure which we used to receive from each other on good friday and easter day we must be this year content to miss let us however pray for each other and hope to see one another yet from time to time with mutual delight my disorder has been a cold which impeded the organs of respiration and kept me many weeks in a state of great uneasiness but by repeated phlebotomy it is now relieved and next to the recovery of mrs boswell i flatter myself that you will rejoice at mine  what we shall do in the summer it is yet too early to consider you want to know what you shall do now i do not think this time of bustle and confusion likely to produce any advantage to you every man has those to reward and gratify who have contributed to his advancement to come hither with such expectations at the expense of borrowed money which i find you know not where to borrow can hardly be considered as prudent i am sorry to find what your solicitation seems to imply that you have already gone the whole length of your credit this is to set the quiet of your whole life at hazard if you anticipate your inheritance you can at last inherit nothing all that you receive must pay for the past you must get a place or pine in penury with the empty name of a great estate poverty my dear friend is so great an evil and pregnant with so much temptation and so much misery that i cannot but earnestly enjoin you to avoid it live on what you have live if you can on less do not borrow either for vanity or pleasure the vanity will end in shame and the pleasure in regret stay therefore at home till you have saved money for your journey hither  the beauties of johnson are said to have got money to the collector if the deformities have the same success i shall be still a more extensive benefactor  make my compliments to mrs boswell who is i hope reconciled to me and to the young people whom i never have offended  you never told me the success of your plea against the solicitors  i am dear sir your most affectionate sam johnson london march          notwithstanding his afflicted state of body and mind this year the following correspondence affords a proof not only of his benevolence and conscientious readiness to relieve a good man from error but by his clothing one of the sentiments in his rambler in different language not inferior to that of the original shows his extraordinary command of clear and forcible expression  a clergyman at bath wrote to him that in the morning chronicle a passage in the beauties of johnson article death had been pointed out as supposed by some readers to recommend suicide the words being to die is the fate of man but to die with lingering anguish is generally his folly and respectfully suggesting to him that such an erroneous notion of any sentence in the writings of an acknowledged friend of religion and virtue should not pass uncontradicted  johnson thus answered the clergymans letter to the reverend mr  at bath sir being now in the country in a state of recovery as i hope from a very oppressive disorder i cannot neglect the acknowledgement of your christian letter the book called the beauties of johnson is the production of i know not whom i never saw it but by casual inspection and considered myself as utterly disengaged from its consequences of the passage you mention i remember some notice in some paper but knowing that it must be misrepresented i thought of it no more nor do i know where to find it in my own books i am accustomed to think little of newspapers but an opinion so weighty and serious as yours has determined me to do what i should without your seasonable admonition have omitted and i will direct my thought to be shown in its true state what follows appeared in the morning chronicle of may          a correspondent having mentioned in the morning chronicle of december    the last clause of the following paragraph as seeming to favor suicide we are requested to print the whole passage that its true meaning may appear which is not to recommend suicide but exercise  exercise cannot secure us from that dissolution to which we are decreed but while the soul and body continue united it can make the association pleasing and give probable hopes that they shall be disjoined by an easy separation it was a principle among the ancients that aute diseases are from heaven and chronical from ourselves the dart of death indeed falls from heaven but we poison it by our own misconduct to die is the fate of man but to die with lingering anguish is generally his folly      if i could find the passage i would direct you to it i suppose the tenor is this  acute diseases are the immediate and inevitable strokes of heaven but of them the pain is short and the conclusion speedy chronical disorders by which we are suspended in tedious torture between life and death are commonly the effect of our own misconduct and intemperance to die etc  this sir you see is all true and all blameless i hope some time in the next week to have all rectified my health has been lately much shaken if you favor this with any answer it will be a comfort to me to know that i have your prayers  i am etc sam johnson may            this letter as might be expected had its full effect and the clergyman acknowledged it in grateful and pious terms the correspondence may be seen at length in the gentlemans magazine feb        the following letters require no extracts from mine to introduce them  to james boswell esquire dear sir the earnestness and tenderness of your letter is such that i cannot think myself showing it more respect than it claims by sitting down to answer it the day on which i received it  this year has afflicted me with a very irksome and severe disorder my respiration has been much impeded and much blood has been taken away i am now harrassed by a catarrhous cough from which my purpose is to seek relief by change of air and i am therefore preparing to go to oxford  whether i did right in dissuading you from coming to london this spring i will not determine you have not lost much by missing my company i have scarcely been well for a single week i might have received comfort from your kindness but you would have seen me afflicted and perhaps found me peevish whatever might have been your pleasure or mine i know not how i could have honestly advised you to come hither with borrowed money do not accustom yourself to consider debts only as an inconvenience you will find it a calamity poverty takes away so many means of doing good and produces so much inability to resist evil both natural and moral that it is by all virtuous means to be avoided consider a man whose fortune is very narrow whatever be his rank by birth or whatever his reputation by intellectual excellence what good can he do or what evil can he prevent that he cannot help the needy is evident he has nothing to spare but perhaps his advice or admonition may be useful his poverty will destroy his influence many more can find that he is poor than that he is wise and few will reverence the understanding that is of so little advantage to its owner i say nothing of the personal wretchedness of a debtor which however has passed into a proverb of riches it is not necessary to write the praise let it however be remembered that he who has money to spare has it always in his power to benefit others and of such power a good man must always be desirous  i am pleased with your account of easter which i celebrated in the churchofengland chapel at edinburgh founded by lord chief baron smith of respectable and pious memory  we shall meet i hope in autumn both well and both cheerful and part each the better for the others company  make my compliments to mrs boswell and to the young charmers  i am etc sam johnson london june         to james boswell esquire dear sir being uncertain whether i should have any call this autumn into the country i did not immediately answer your kind letter i have no call but if you desire to meet me at ashbourne i believe i can come thither if you had rather come to london i can stay at streatham take your choice  this year has been very heavy from the middle of january to the middle of june i was battered by one disorder after another i am now very much recovered and hope still to be better what happiness it is that mrs boswell has escaped  my lives are reprinting and i have forgotten the author of grays character the reverend mr temple vicar of st gluvias cornwall  write immediately and it may be perhaps yet inserted  of london or ashbourne you have your free choice at any place i shall be glad to see you  i am dear sir your etc sam johnson aug          on the  0th of august i informed him that my honored father had died that morning a complaint under which he had long labored having suddenly come to a crisis while i was upon a visit at the seat of sir charles preston from whence i had hastened the day before upon receiving a letter by express  to james boswell esquire dear sir i have struggled through this year with so much infirmity of body and such strong impressions of the fragility of life that death wherever it appears fills me with melancholy and i cannot hear without emotion of the removal of any one whom i have known into another state  your fathers death had every circumstance that could enable you to bear it it was at a mature age and it was expected and as his general life had been pious his thoughts had doubtless for many years past been turned upon eternity that you did not find him sensible must doubtless grieve you his disposition toward you was undoubtedly that of a kind though not of a fond father kindness at least actual is in our power but fondness is not and if by negligence or imprudence you had extinguished his fondness he could not at will rekindle it nothing then remained between you but mutual forgiveness of each others faults and mutual desire of each others happiness  i shall long to know his final disposition of his fortune  you dear sir have now a new station and have therefore new cares and new employments life as cowley seems to say ought to resemble a well ordered poem of which one rule generally received is that the exordium should be simple and should promise little begin your new course of life with the least show and the least expense possible you may at pleasure increase both but you cannot easily diminish them do not think your estate your own while any man can call upon you for money which you cannot pay therefore begin with timorous parsimony let it be your first care not to be in any mans debt  when the thoughts are extended to a future state the present life seems hardly worthy of all those principles of conduct and maxims of prudence which one generation of men has transmitted to another but upon a closer view when it is perceived how much evil is produced and how much good is impeded by embarrassment and distress and how little room the expedients of poverty leave for the exercise of virtue its sorrows manifest that the boundless importance of the next life enforces some attention to the interests of this  be kind to the old servants and secure the kindness of the agents and factors do not disgust them by asperity or unwelcome gaiety or apparent suspicion from them you must learn the real slate of your affairs the characters of your tenants and the value of your lands  make my compliments to mrs boswell i think her expectations from air and exercise are the best that she can form i hope she will live long and happily  i forget whether i told you that rasay has been here we dined cheerfully together i entertained lately a young gentleman from coriatachat  i received your letters only this morning  i am dear sir yours etc sam johnson london sept         in answer to my next letter i received one from him dissuading me from hastening to him as i had proposed what is proper for publication is the following paragraph equally just and tender  one expense however i would not have you to spare let nothing be omitted that can preserve mrs boswell though it should be necessary to transplant her for a time into a softer climate she is the prop and stay of your life how much must your children suffer by losing her  my wife was now so much convinced of his sincere friendship for me and regard for her that she without any suggestion on my part wrote him a very polite and grateful letter  dr johnson to mrs boswell dear lady i have not often received so much pleasure as from your invitation to auchinleck the journey thither and back is indeed too great for the latter part of the year but if my health were fully recovered i would suffer no little heat and cold nor a wet or a rough road to keep me from you i am indeed not without hope of seeing auchinleck again but to make it a pleasant place i must see its lady well and brisk and airy for my sake therefore among many greater reasons take care dear madam of your health spare no expense and want no attendance that can procure ease or preserve it be very careful to keep your mind quiet and do not think it too much to give an account of your recovery to madam  your etc sam johnson london sept         to james boswell esquire dear sir having passed almost this whole year in a succession of disorders i went in october to brighthelmston whither i came in a state of so much weakness that i rested four times in walking between the inn and the lodging by physic and abstinence i grew better and am now reasonably easy though at a great distance from health i am afraid however that health begins after seventy and often long before to have a meaning different from that which it had at thirty but it is culpable to murmur at the established order of the creation as it is vain to oppose it he that lives must grow old and he that would rather grow old than die has god to thank for the infirmities of old age  at your long silence i am rather angry you do not since now you are the head of your house think it worth your while to try whether you or your friend can live longer without writing nor suspect after so many years of friendship that when i do not write to you i forget you put all such useless jealousies out of your head and disdain to regulate your own practice by the practice of another or by any other principle than the desire of doing right  your economy i suppose begins now to be settled your expenses are adjusted to your revenue and all your people in their proper places resolve not to be poor whatever you have spend less poverty is a great enemy to human happiness it certainly destroys liberty and it makes some virtues impracticable and others extremely difficult  let me know the history of your life since your accession to your estate how many houses how many cows how much land in your own hand and what bargains you make with your tenants  of my lives of the poets they have printed a new edition in octavo i hear of three thousand did i give a set to lord hailes if i did not i will do it out of these what did you make of all your copy  mrs thrale and the three misses are now for the winter in argyllstreet sir joshua reynolds has been out of order but is well again and i am  dear sir your affectionate humble servant sam johnson london dec         to dr samuel johnson dear sir edinburgh dec  0      i was made happy by your kind letter which gave us the agreeable hopes of seeing you in scotland again  i am much flattered by the concern you are pleased to take in my recovery i am better and hope to have it in my power to convince you by my attention of how much consequence i esteem your health to the world and to myself  i remain sir with grateful respect your obliged and obedient servant margaret boswell   the death of mr thrale had made a very material alteration upon johnson with respect to his reception in that family the manly authority of the husband no longer curbed the lively exuberance of the lady and as her vanity had been fully gratified by having the colossus of literature attached to her for many years she gradually became less assiduous to please him whether her attachment to him was already divided by another object i am unable to ascertain but it is plain that johnsons penetration was alive to her neglect or forced attention for on the  th of october this year we find him making a parting use of the library at streatham and pronouncing a prayer which he composed on leaving mr thrales family prayers and meditations p       almighty god father of all mercy help me by thy grace that i may with humble and sincere thankfulness remember the comforts and conveniences which i have enjoyed at this place and that i may resign them with holy submission equally trusting in thy protection when thou give and when thou take away have mercy upon me o lord have mercy upon me  to thy fatherly protection o lord i commend this family bless guide and defend them that they may so pass through this world as finally to enjoy in thy presence everlasting happiness for jesus christs sake amen  one cannot read this prayer without some emotions not very favorable to the lady whose conduct occasioned it  in one of his memorandumbooks i find sunday went to church at streatham templo valedixi cum osculo  he met mr philip metcalfe often at sir joshua reynoldss and other places and was a good deal with him at brighthelmston this autumn being pleased at once with his excellent table and animated conversation mr metcalfe showed him great respect and sent him a note that he might have the use of his carriage whenever he pleased johnson  d october      returned this polite answer  mr johnson is very much obliged by the kind offer of the carriage but he has no desire of using mr metcalfes carriage except when he can have the pleasure of mr metcalfes company mr metcalfe could not but be highly pleased that his company was thus valued by johnson and he frequently attended him in airings they also went together to cirencester and they visited petworth and cowdery the venerable seat of the lords montacute sir said johnson i should like to stay here fourandtwenty hours we see here how our ancestors lived  that his curiosity however was unabated appears from two letters to mr john nichols of the  0th and  0th of october this year in one he says i have looked into your anecdotes and you will hardly thank a lover of literary history for telling you that he has been much informed and gratified i wish you would add your own discoveries and intelligence to those of dr rawlinson and undertake the supplement to wood think of it in the other i wish sir you could obtain some fuller information of jortin markland and thirlby they were three contemporaries of great eminence  to sir joshua reynolds dear sir i heard yesterday of your late disorder and should think ill of myself if i had heard of it without alarm i heard likewise of your recovery which i sincerely wish to be complete and permanent your country has been in danger of losing one of its brightest ornaments and i of losing one of my oldest and kindest friends but i hope you will still live long for the honor of the nation and that more enjoyment of your elegance your intelligence and your benevolence is still reserved for  dear sir your most affectionate etc sam johnson brighthelmston nov          the reverend mr wilson having dedicated to him his archeological dictionary that mark of respect was thus acknowledged  to the reverend mr wilson clitheroe lancashire reverend sir that i have long omitted to return you thanks for the honor conferred upon me by your dedication i entreat you with great earnestness not to consider as more faulty than it is a very importunate and oppressive disorder has for some time debarred me from the pleasures and obstructed me in the duties of life the esteem and kindness of wise and good men is one of the last pleasures which i can be content to lose and gratitude to those from whom this pleasure is received is a duty of which i hope never to be reproached with the final neglect i therefore now return you thanks for the notice which i have received from you and which i consider as giving to my name not only more bulk but more weight not only as extending its superficies but as increasing its value your book was evidently wanted and will i hope find its way into the school to which however i do not mean to confine it for no man has so much skill in ancient rites and practices as not to want it as i suppose myself to owe part of your kindness to my excellent friend dr patten he has likewise a just claim to my acknowledgements which i hope you sir will transmit there will soon appear a new edition of my poetical biography if you will accept of a copy to keep me in your mind be pleased to let me know how it may be conveniently conveyed to you the present is small but it is given with good will by reverend sir  your most etc sam johnson dec            having given dr johnson a full account of what i was doing at auchinleck and particularly mentioned what i knew would please him  my having brought an old man of eightyeight from a lonely cottage to a comfortable habitation within my enclosures where he had good neighbors near to him i received an answer in february of which i extract what follows  i am delighted with your account of your activity at auchinleck and wish the old gentleman whom you have so kindly removed may live long to promote your prosperity by his prayers you have now a new character and new duties think on them and practice them  make an impartial estimate of your revenue and whatever it is live upon less resolve never to be poor frugality is not only the basis of quiet but of beneficence no man can help others that wants help himself we must have enough before we have to spare  i am glad to find that mrs boswell grows well and hope that to keep her well no care nor caution will be omitted may you long live happily together  when you come hither pray bring with you baxters anacreon i cannot get that edition in london  on friday march    having arrived in london the night before i was glad to find him at mrs thrales house in argyllstreet appearances of friendship between them being still kept up i was shown into his room and after the first salutation he said i am glad you are come i am very he looked pale and was distressed with a difficulty of breathing but he soon assumed his usual strong animated style of conversation seeing me now for the first time as a lord or proprietor of land he began sir the superiority of a countrygentleman over the people upon his estate is very agreeable and he who says he does not feel it to be agreeable lies for it must be agreeable to have a casual superiority over those who are by nature equal with us boswell yet sir we see great proprietors of land who prefer living in london johnson why sir the pleasure of living in london the intellectual superiority that is enjoyed there may counterbalance the other besides sir a man may prefer the state of the countrygentleman upon the whole and yet there may never be a moment when he is willing to make the change to quit london for it he said it is better to have five per cent out of land than out of money because it is more secure but the readiness of transference and promptness of interest make many people rather choose the funds nay there is another disadvantage belonging to land compared with money a man is not so much afraid of being a hard creditor as of being a hard landlord boswell because there is a sort of kindly connection between a landlord and his tenants johnson no sir many landlords with us never see their tenants it is because if a landlord drives away his tenants he may not get others whereas the demand for money is so great it may always be lent  he talked with regret and indignation of the factious opposition to government at this time and imputed it in a great measure to the revolution sir said he in a low voice having come nearer to me while his old prejudices seemed to be fermenting in his mind this hanoverian family is isolee here they have no friends now the stuarts had friends who stuck by them so late as      when the right of the king is not reverenced there will not be reverence for those appointed by the king  his observation that the present royal family has no friends has been too much justified by the very ungrateful behavior of many who were under great obligations to his majesty at the same time there are honorable exceptions and the very next year after this conversation and ever since the king has had as extensive and generous support as ever was given to any monarch and has had the satisfaction of knowing that he was more and more endeared to his people  he repeated to me his verses on mr levett with an emotion which gave them full effect and then he was pleased to say you must be as much with me as you can you have done me good you cannot think how much better i am since you came in  he sent a message to acquaint mrs thrale that i was arrived i had not seen her since her husbands death she soon appeared and favored me with an invitation to stay to dinner which i accepted there was no other company but herself and three of her daughters dr johnson and i she too said she was very glad i was come for she was going to bath and should have been sorry to leave dr johnson before i came this seemed to be attentive and kind and i who had not been informed of any change imagined all to be as well as formerly he was little inclined to talk at dinner and went to sleep after it but when he joined us in the drawing room he seemed revived and was again himself  talking of conversation he said there must in the first place be knowledge there must be materials  in the second place there must be a command of words  in the third place there must be imagination to place things in such views as they are not commonly seen in  and in the fourth place there must be presence of mind and a resolution that is not to be overcome by failures this last is an essential requisite for want of it many people do not excel in conversation now i want it i throw up the game upon losing a trick i wondered to hear him talk thus of himself and said i dont know sir how this may be but i am sure you beat other peoples cards out of their hands i doubt whether he heard this remark while he went on talking triumphantly i was fixed in admiration and said to mrs thrale o for shorthand to take this down  you will carry it all in your head said she a long head is as good as shorthand  it has been observed and wondered at that mr charles fox never talked with any freedom in the presence of dr johnson though it is well known and i myself can witness that his conversation is various fluent and exceedingly agreeable johnsons experience however founded him in going on thus fox never talks in private company not from any determination not to talk but because he has not the first motion a man who is used to the applause of the house of commons has no wish for that of a private company a man accustomed to throw for a thousand pounds if set down to throw for sixpence would not be at the pains to count his dice burkes talk is the ebullition of his mind he does not talk from a desire of distinction but because his mind is full  he thus curiously characterised one of our old acquaintance  is a good man sir but he is a vain man and a liar he however only tells lies of vanity of victories for instance in conversation which never happened this alluded to a story which i had repeated from that gentleman to entertain johnson with its wild bravado this johnson sir said he whom you are all afraid of will shrink if you come close to him in argument and roar as loud as he he once maintained the paradox that there is no beauty but in utility sir said i what say you to the peacocks tail which is one of the most beautiful objects in nature but would have as much utility if its feathers were all of one color he felt what i thus produced and had recourse to his usual expedient ridicule exclaiming a peacock has a tail and a fox has a tail and then he burst out into a laugh well sir said i with a strong voice looking him full in the face you have unkennelled your fox pursue him if you dare he had not a word to say sir johnson told me that this was a fiction from beginning to end were i to insert all the stories which have been told of contests boldly maintained with him imaginary victories obtained over him of reducing him to silence and of making him own that his antagonists had the better of him in argument my volumes would swell to an immoderate size one instance i find has circulated both in conversation and in print that when he would not allow the scotch writers to have merit the late dr rose of chiswick asserted that he could name one scotch writer who dr johnson himself would allow to have written better than any man of the age and upon johnsons asking who it was answered lord bute when he signed the warrant for your pension upon which johnson struck with the repartee acknowledged that this was true when i mentioned it to johnson sir said he if rose said this i never heard it   after musing for some time he said i wonder how i should have any enemies for i do harm to nobody this reflection was very natural in a man of a good heart who was not conscious of any ill will to mankind though the sharp sayings which were sometimes produced by his discrimination and vivacity and which he perhaps did not recollect were i am afraid too often remembered with resentment  boswell in the first place sir you will be pleased to recollect that you set out with attacking the scotch so you got a whole nation for your enemies johnson why i own that by my definition of oats i meant to vex them boswell pray sir can you trace the cause of your antipathy to the scotch johnson i can not sir boswell old mr sheridan says it was because they sold charles the first johnson then sir old mr sheridan has found out a very good reason  surely the most obstinate and sulky nationality the most determined aversion to this great and good man must be cured when he is seen thus playing with one of his prejudices of which he heartily admitted that he could not tell the reason it was however probably owing to his having had in his view the worst part of the scottish nation the needy adventurers many of whom he thought were advanced beyond their merits by means which he did not approve had he in his early life been in scotland and seen the worthy sensible independent gentlemen who live rationally and hospitably at home he never could have entertained such unfavourable and unjust notions of his fellow subjects and accordingly we find that when he did visit scotland in the latter period of his life he was fully sensible of all that it deserved as i have already pointed out when speaking of his journey to the western islands  next day saturday march    i found him still at mrs thrales but he told me that he was to go to his own house in the afternoon he was better but i perceived he was but an unruly patient for dr pepys who visited him while i was with him said if you were tractable sir i should prescribe for you  i related to him a remark which a respectable friend had made to me upon the then state of government when those who had been long in opposition had attained to power it was supposed against the inclination of the sovereign you need not be uneasy said this gentleman about the king he laughs at them all he plays them one against another johnson dont think so sir the king is as much oppressed as a man can be if he plays them one against another he wins nothing  i had paid a visit to general oglethorpe in the morning and was told by him that dr johnson saw company on saturday evenings and he would meet me at johnsons that night when i mentioned this to johnson not doubting that it would please him as he had a great value for oglethorpe the sretfulness of his disease unexpectedly showed itself his anger suddenly kindled and he said with vehemence did not you tell him not to come am i to be hunted in this manner i satisfied him that i could not divine that the visit would not be convenient and that i certainly could not take it upon me of my own accord to forbid the general  i found dr johnson in the evening in mrs williamss room at tea and coffee with her and mrs desmoulins who were also both ill it was a sad scene and he was not in a very good humor he said of a performance that had lately come out sir if you should search all the madhouses in england you would not find ten men who would write so and think it sense  i was glad when general oglethorpes arrival was announced and we left the ladies dr johnson attended him in the parlour and was as courteous as ever the general said he was busy reading the writers of the middle age johnson said they were very curious oglethorpe the house of commons has usurped the power of the nations money and used it tyrannically government is now carried on by corrupt influence instead of the inherent right in the king johnson sir the want of inherent right in the king occasions all this disturbance what we did at the revolution was necessary but it broke our constitution i have in my journal of a tour to the hebrides fully expressed my sentiments upon this subject the revolution was necessary but not a subject for glory because it for a long time blasted the generous feelings of loyalty and now when by the benignant effect of time the present royal family are established in our affections how unwise is it to revive by celebrations the memory of a shock which it would surely have been better that our constitution had not required  oglethorpe my father did not think it necessary  on sunday march    i breakfasted with dr johnson who seemed much relieved having taken opium the night before he however protested against it as a remedy that should be given with the utmost reluctance and only in extreme necessity i mentioned how commonly it was used in turkey and therefore it could not be so pernicious as he apprehended he grew warm and said turks take opium and christians take opium but russel in his account of aleppo tells us that it is as disgraceful in turkey to take too much opium as it is with us to get drunk sir it is amazing how things are exaggerated a gentleman was lately telling in a company where i was present that in france as soon as a man of fashion marries he takes an opera girl into keeping and this he mentioned as a general custom pray sir said i how many opera girls may there be he answered about fourscore well then sir said i you see there can be no more than fourscore men of fashion who can do this  mrs desmoulins made tea and she and i talked before him upon a topic which he had once borne patiently from me when we were by ourselves  his not complaining of the world because he was not called to some great office nor had attained to great wealth he flew into a violent passion i confess with some justice and commanded us to have done nobody said he has a right to talk in this manner to bring before a man his own character and the events of his life when he does not choose it should be done i never have sought the world the world was not to seek me it is rather wonderful that so much has been done for me all the complaints which are made of the world are unjust i never knew a man of merit neglected it was generally by his own fault that he failed of success a man may hide his head in a hole he may go into the country and publish a book now and then which nobody reads and then complain he is neglected there is no reason why any person should exert himself for a man who has written a good book he has not written it for any individual i may as well make a present to the postman who brings me a letter when patronage was limited an author expected to find a mecaenas and complained if he did not find one why should he complain this mecaenas has others as good as he or others who have got the start of him boswell but surely sir you will allow that there are many men of merit at the bar who never get practice johnson sir you are sure that practice is got from an opinion that the person employed deserves it best so that if a man of merit at the bar does not get practice it is from error not from injustice he is not neglected a horse that is brought to market may not be bought though he is a very good horse but that is from ignorance not from intention  there was in this discourse much novelty ingenuity and discrimination such as is seldom to be found yet i cannot help thinking that men of merit who have no success in life may be forgiven for lamenting if they are not allowed to complain they may consider it as hard that their merit should not have its suitable distinction if there is no internal injustice toward them on the part of the world because their merit has not been perceived they may repine against fortune or fate or by whatever name they choose to call the supposed mythological power of destiny it has however occurred to me as a consolatory thought that men of merit should consider thus  how much harder would it be if the same men had both all the merit and all the prosperity would not this be a miserable distribution for the poor dunces would men of merit exchange their intellectual superiority and the enjoyments arising from it for external distinction and the pleasures of wealth if they would not let them not envy others who are poor where they are rich a compensation which is made to them let them look inwards and be satisfied recollecting with conscious pride what virgil finely says of the corycius senex and which i have in another place letter to the people of scotland against the attempt to diminish the number of the lords of session       with truth and sincerity applied to mr burke regum aequabat opes animis   on the subject of the right employment of wealth johnson observed a man cannot make a bad use of his money so far as regards society if he does not hoard it for if he either spends it or lends it out society has the benefit it is in general better to spend money than to give it away for industry is more promoted by spending money than by giving it away a man who spends his money is sure he is doing good with it he is not so sure when he gives it away a man who spends ten thousand a year will do more good than a man who spends two thousand and gives away eight  in the evening i came to him again he was rather fretful from his illness a gentleman asked him whether he had been abroad today dont talk so childishly said he you may as well ask if i hanged myself today i mentioned politics johnson sir i would as soon have a man to break my bones as talk to me of public affairs internal or external i have lived to see things all as bad as they can be  having mentioned his friend the second lord southwell he said lord southwell was the highest bred man without insolence that i ever was in company with the most qualified i ever saw lord orrery was not dignified lord chesterfield was but he was insolent lord  is a man of coarse manners but a man of abilities and information i dont say he is a man i would set at the head of a nation though perhaps he may be as good as the next prime minister that comes but he is a man to be at the head of a club  i dont say our club  for there is no such club boswell but sir was not he once a factious man johnson o yes sir as factious a fellow as could be found one who was for sinking us all into the mob boswell how then sir did he get into favor with the king johnson because sir i suppose he promised the king to do whatever the king pleased  he said goldsmiths blundering speech to lord shelburne which has been so often mentioned and which he really did make to him was only a blunder in emphasis  i wonder they should call your lordship malagrida for malagrida was a very good man  meant i wonder they should use malagrida as a term of reproach  soon after this time i had an opportunity of seeing by means of one of his friends a proof that his talents as well as his obliging service to authors were ready as ever he had revised the village an admirable poem by the reverend mr crabbe its sentiments as to the false notions of rustic happiness and rustic virtue were quite congenial with his own and he had taken the trouble not only to suggest slight corrections and variations but to furnish some lines when he thought he could give the writers meaning better than in the words of the manuscript i shall give an instance marking the original by roman and johnsons substitution in italick characters  in fairer scenes where peaceful pleasures spring tityrus the pride of mantuan swains might sing but charmed by him or smitten with his views shall modern poets court the mantuan muse from truth and nature shall we widely stray where fancy leads or virgil led the way on mincios banks in caesars bounteous reign if tityrus found the golden age again must sleepy bards the flattering dream prolong mechanic echos of the mantuan song from truth and nature shall we widely stray where virgil not where fancy leads the way here we find johnsons poetical and critical powers undiminished i must however observe that the aids he gave to this poem as to the traveller and deserted village of goldsmith were so small as by no means to impair the distinguished merit of the author     on sunday march  0 i found him at home in the evening and had the pleasure to meet with dr brocklesby whose reading and knowledge of life and good spirits supply him with a neverfailing source of conversation he mentioned a respectable gentleman who became extremely penurious near the close of his life johnson said there must have been a degree of madness about him not at all sir said dr brocklesby his judgment was entire unluckily however he mentioned that although he had a fortune of twentyseven thousand pounds he denied himself many comforts from an apprehension that he could not afford them nay sir cried johnson when the judgment is so disturbed that a man cannot count that is pretty well  i shall here insert a few of johnsons sayings without the formality of dates as they have no reference to any particular time or place  the more a man extends and varies his acquaintance the better this however was meant with a just restriction for he on another occasion said to me sir a man may be so much of every thing that he is nothing of any thing  raising the wages of daylabourers is wrong for it does not make them live better but only makes them idler and idleness is a very bad thing for human nature  it is a very good custom to keep a journal for a mans own use he may write upon a card a day all that is necessary to be written after he has had experience of life at first there is a great deal to be written because there is a great deal of novelty but when once a man has settled his opinions there is seldom much to be set down  there is nothing wonderful in the journal which we see swift kept in london for it contains flight topics and it might soon be written  i praised the accuracy of an account book of a private person whom i mentioned johnson keeping accounts sir is of no use when a man is spending his own money and has nobody to whom he is to account you will not eat less beef today because you have written down what it cost yesterday i mentioned a lady who thought as he did so that her husband could not get her to keep an account of the expense of the family as she thought it enough that she never exceeded the sum allowed her johnson sir it is fit she should keep an account because her husband wishes it but i do not see its use i maintained that keeping an account has this advantage that it satisfies a man that his money has not been lost or stolen which he might sometimes be apt to imagine were there no written state of his expense and besides a calculation of economy so as not to exceed ones income cannot be made without a view of the different articles in figures that one may see how to retrench in some particulars less necessary than others this he did not attempt to answer  talking of an acquaintance of ours whose narratives which abounded in curious and interesting topics were unhappily found to be very fabulous i mentioned lord mansfields having said to me suppose we believe one half of what he tells johnson aye but we dont know which half to believe by his lying we lose not only our reverence for him but all comfort in his conversation boswell may we not take it as amusing fiction johnson sir the misfortune is that you will insensibly believe as much of it as you incline  it is remarkable that notwithstanding their congeniality in politics he never was acquainted with a late eminent noble judge whom i have heard speak of him as a writer with great respect johnson i know not upon what degree of investigation entertained no exalted opinion of his lordships intellectual character talking of him to me one day he said it is wonderful sir with how little real superiority of mind men can make an eminent figure in public life he expressed himself to the same purpose concerning another law lord who it seems once took a fancy to associate with the wits of london but with so little success that foot said what can he mean by coming among us he is not only dull himself but the cause of dullness in others trying him by the test of his colloquial powers johnson had found him very defective he once said to sir joshua reynolds this man now has been ten years about town and has made nothing of it meaning as a companion knowing as well as i do what precision and elegance of oratory his lordship can display i cannot but suspect that his unfavourable appearance in a social circle which drew such animadversions upon him must be owing to a cold affectation of consequence from being reserved and stiff if it be so and he might be an agreeable man if he would we cannot be sorry that he misses his aim  he said to me i never heard any thing from him in company that was at all striking and depend upon it sir it is when you come close to a man in conversation that you discover what his real abilities are to make a speech in a public assembly is a knack now i honor thurlow sir thurlow is a fine fellow he fairly puts his mind to yours  after repeating to him some of his pointed lively sayings i said it is a pity sir you dont always remember your own good things that you may have a laugh when you will johnson nay sir it is better that i forget them that i may be reminded of them and have a laugh brought to my recollection  when i recalled his having said as we sailed upon lochlomond that if he wore any thing fine it should be very fine i observed that all his thoughts were upon a great scale johnson depend upon it sir every man will have as fine a thing as he can get as a large diamond for his ring boswell pardon me sir a man of a narrow mind will not think of it a sliight trinket will satisfy him nec sufferre queat majoris pondera gemmae   i told him i should send him some essays which i had written which i hoped he would be so good as to read and pick out the good ones johnson nay sir send me only the good ones dont make me pick them  on thursday april  0 i introduced to him at his house in boltcourt the honorable and reverend william stuart son of the earl of bute a gentleman truly worthy of being known to johnson being with all the advantages of high birth learning travel and elegant manners an exemplary parish priest in every respect  after some compliments on both sides the tour which johnson and i had made to the hebrides was mentioned  johnson i got an acquisition of more ideas by it than by any thing that i remember i saw quite a different system of life boswell you would not like to make the same journey again johnson why no sir not the same it is a tale told gravina an italian critic observes that every man desires to see that of which he has read but no man desires to read an account of what he has seen so much does description fall short of reality description only excites curiosity seeing satisfies it other people may go and see the hebrides boswell i should wish to go and see some country totally different from what i have been used to such as turkey where religion and every thing else are different johnson yes sir there are two objects of curiosity  the christian world and the mohammedan world all the rest may be considered as barbarous boswell pray sir is the turkish spy a genuine book johnson no sir mrs manley in her life says that her father wrote the two first volumes and in another book duntons life and errors we find that the rest was written by one sault at two guineas a sheet under the direction of dr midgeley  boswell this has been a very factious reign owing to the too great indulgence of government johnson  i think so sir what at first was lenity grew timidity yet this is reasoning a posteriori and may not be just supposing a few had at first been punished i believe faction would have been crushed but it might have been said that it was a sanguinary reign a man cannot tell a priori what will be best for government to do this reign has been very unfortunate we have had an unsuccessful war but that does not prove that we have been ill governed one side or other must prevail in war as one or other must win at play when we beat louis we were not better governed nor were the french better governed when louis beat us  on saturday april    i visited him in company with mr windham of norfolk whom though a whig he highly valued one of the best things he ever said was to this gentleman who before he set out for ireland as secretary to lord northington when lord lieutenant expressed to the sage some modest and virtuous doubts whether he could bring himself to practice those arts which it is supposed a person in that situation has occasion to employ dont be afraid sir said johnson with a pleasant smile you will soon make a very pretty rascal  he talked today a good deal of the wonderful extent and variety of london and observed that men of curious enquiry might see in it such modes of life as very few could even imagine he in particular recommended to us to explore wapping which we resolved to do and certainly shall  mr low the painter who was with him was very much distressed that a large picture which he had painted was refused to be received into the exhibition of the royal academy mrs thrale knew johnsons character so superficially as to represent him as unwilling to do small acts of benevolence and mentions in particular that he would hardly take the trouble to write a letter in favor of his friends the truth however is that he was remarkable in an extraordinary degree for what she denies to him and above all for this very sort of kindness writing letters for those to whom his solicitations might be of service he now gave mr low the following of which i was diligent enough with his permission to take copies at the next coffeehouse while mr windham was so good as to stay by me  to sir joshua rernolds sir mr low considers himself as cut off from all credit and all hope by the rejection of his picture from the exhibition upon this work he has exhausted all his powers and suspended all his expectations and certainly to be refused an opportunity of taking the opinion of the public is in itself a very great hardship it is to be condemned without a trial  if you could procure the revocation of this incapacitating edict you would deliver an unhappy man from great affliction the council has sometimes reversed its own determination and i hope that by your interposition this luckless picture may be got admitted  i am etc sam johnson april          to mr barry sir mr lowes exclusion from the exhibition gives him more trouble than you and the other gentlemen of the council could imagine or intend he considers disgrace and ruin as the inevitable consequence of your determination  he says that some pictures have been received after rejection and if there be any such precedent i earnestly entreat that you will use your interest in his favor of his work i can say nothing i pretend not to judge of painting and this picture i never saw but i conceive it extremely hard to shut out any man from the possibility of success and therefore i repeat my request that you will propose the reconsideration of mr lowes case and if there be any among the council with whom my name can have any weight be pleased to communicate to them the desire of  sir your most humble servant sam johnson april          such intercession was too powerful to be resisted and mr lowes performance was admitted at somerset house the subject as i recollect was the deluge at that point of time when the water was verging to the top of the last uncovered mountain near to the spot was seen the last of the antediluvian race exclusive of those who were saved in the ark of noah this was one of those giants then the inhabitants of the earth who had still strength to swim and with one of his hands held aloft his infant child upon the small remaining dry spot appeared a famished lion ready to spring at the child and devour it mr low told me that johnson said to him sir yonr picture is noble and probable  a compliment indeed said mr low from a man who cannot lie and cannot be mistaken  about this time he wrote to mrs lucy porter mentioning his bad health and that he intended a visit to lichfield it is says he with no great expectation of amendment that i make every year a journey into the country but it is pleasant to visit those whose kindness has been often experienced  on april    being good friday i found him at breakfast in his usual manner upon that day drinking tea without milk and eating a crossbun to prevent faintness we went to st clements church as formerly when we came home from church he placed himself on one of the stone seats at his gardendoor and i took the other and thus in the open air and in a placid frame he talked away very easily johnson were i a country gentleman i should not be very hospitable i should not have crowds in my house boswell sir alexander dick tells me that he remembers having a thousand people in a year to dine at his house that is reckoning each person one each time that he dined there johnson that sir is about three a day boswell how your statement lessens the idea johnson that sir is the good of counting it brings every thing to a certainty which before floated in the mind indefinitely boswell but omne ignotum pro magnifico est one is sorry to have this diminished johnson sir you should not allow yourself to be delighted with error boswell three a day seem but few johnson nay sir he who entertains three a day does very liberally and if there is a large family the poor entertain those three for they eat what the poor would get there must be superfluous meat it must be given to the poor or thrown out boswell i observe in london that the poor go about and gather bones which i understand are manufactured johnson yes sir they boil them and extract a grease from them for greasing wheels and other purposes of the best pieces they make a mock ivory which is used for hafts to knives and various other things the coarser pieces they burn and pound them and sell the ashes boswell for what purpose sir johnson why sir for making a furnace for the chemists for melting iron a paste made of burnt bones will stand a stronger heat than any thing else consider sir if you are to melt iron you cannot line your pot with brass because it is softer than iron and would melt sooner nor with iron for though malleable iron is harder than cast iron yet it would not do but a paste of burnt bones will not melt boswell do you know sir i have discovered a manufacture to a great extent of what you only piddle at  scraping and drying the peel of oranges at a place in newgatestreet there is a prodigious quantity done which they sell to the distillers johnson sir i believe they make a higher thing out of them than a spirit they make what is called orangebutter the oil of the orange inspissated which they mix perhaps with common pomatum and make it fragrant the oil does not fly off in the drying  boswell i wish to have a good walled garden johnson i dont think it would be worth the expense to you we compute in england a parkwall at a thousand pounds a mile now a gardenwall must cost at least as much you intend your trees should grow higher than a deer will leap now let us see  for a hundred pounds you could only have fortyfour square yards which is very little for two hundred pounds you may have eightyfour square yards which is very well but when will you get the value of two hundred pounds of walls in your climate no sir such contention with nature is not worth while i would plant an orchard and have plenty of such fruit as ripen well in your country my friend dr madan of ireland said that in an orchard there should be enough to eat enough to lay up enough to be stolen and enough to rot upon the ground cherries are an early fruit you may have them and you may have the early apples and pears boswell we cannot have nonpareils johnson sir you can no more have nonpareils than you can have grapes boswell we have them sir but they are very bad johnson nay sir never try to have a thing merely to show that you cannot have it for ground that would let for forty shillings you may have a large orchard and you see it costs you only forty shillings nay you may graze the ground when the trees are grown up you cannot while they are young boswell is not a good garden a very common thing in england sir johnson not so common sir as you imagine in lincolnshire there is hardly an orchard in staffordshire very little fruit boswell has langton no orchard johnson no sir boswell how so sir johnson why sir from the general negligence of the county he has it not because nobody else has it boswell a hothouse is a certain thing i may have that johnson a hothouse is pretty certain but you must first build it then you must keep fires in it and you must have a gardener to take care of it boswell but if i have a gardener at any rate johnson why yes boswell i would have it near my house there is no need to have it in the orchard johnson yes i would have it near my house  i would plant a great many currants the fruit is good and they make a pretty sweetmeat  i record this minute detail which some may think trifling in order to show clearly how this great man whose mind could grasp such large and extensive subjects as he has shown in his literary labors was yet wellinformed in the common affairs of life and loved to illustrate them  mr walker the celebrated master of elocution came and then we went up stairs into the study i asked him if he had taught many clergymen johnson i hope not walker i have taught only one and he is the best reader i ever heard not by my teaching but by his own natural talents johnson were he the best reader in the world i would not have it told that he was taught here was one of his peculiar prejudices could it be any disadvantage to the clergyman to have it known that he was taught an easy and graceful delivery boswell will you not allow sir that a man may be taught to read well johnson why sir so far as to read better than he might do without being taught yes formerly it was supposed that there was no difference in reading but that one read as well as another boswell it is wonderful to see old sheridan as enthusiastic about oratory as ever walker his enthusiasm as to what oratory will do may be too great but he reads well johnson he reads well but he reads low and you know it is much easier to read low than to read high for when you read high you are much more limited your loudest note can be but one and so in proportion to loudness now some people have occasion to speak to an extensive audience and must speak loud to be heard walker the art is to read strong though low  talking of the origin of language  johnson it must have come by inspiration a thousand nay a million of children could not invent a language while the organs are pliable there is not understanding enough to form a language by the time that there is understanding enough the organs are become stiff we know that after a certain age we cannot learn to pronounce a new language no foreigner who comes to england when advanced in life ever pronounces english tolerably well at least such instances are very rare when i maintain that language must have come by inspiration i do not mean that inspiration is required for rhetoric and all the beauties of language for when once man has language we can conceive that he may gradually form modifications of it i mean only that inspiration seems to me to be necessary to give man the faculty of speech to inform him that he may have speech which i think he could no more find out without inspiration than cows or hogs would think of such a faculty walker do you think sir that there are any perfect synonimes in any language johnson originally there were not but by using words negligently or in poetry one word comes to be confounded with another  he talked of dr dodd a friend of mine said he came to me and told me that a lady wished to have dodds picture in a bracelet and asked me for a motto i said i could think of no better than currat lex i was very willing to have him pardoned that is to have the sentence changed to transportation but when he was once hanged i did not wish he should be made a saint  mrs burney wife of his friend dr burney came in and he seemed to be entertained with her conversation  garricks funeral was talked of as extravagantly expensive johnson from his dislike to exaggeration would not allow that it was distinguished by any extraordinary pomp were there not six horses in each coach said mrs burney johnson madam there were no more six horses than six phoenixes  mrs burney wondered that some very beautiful new buildings should be erected in moorfields in so shocking a situation as between bedlam and st lukes hospital and said she could not live there johnson nay madam you see nothing there to hurt you you no more think of madness by having windows that look to bedlam than you think of death by having windows that look to a churchyard mrs burney we may look to a churchyard sir for it is right that we should be kept in mind of death johnson nay madam if you go to that it is right that we should be kept in mind of madness which is occasioned by too much indulgence of imagination i think a very moral use may be made of these new buildings i would have those who have heated imaginations live there and take warning mrs burney but sir many of the poor people that are mad have become so from disease or from distressing events it is therefore not their faults but their misfortune and therefore to think of them is a melancholy consideration  time passed on in conversation till it was too late for the service of the church at three oclock i took a walk and left him alone for some time then returned and we had coffee and conversation again by ourselves  i stated the character of a noble friend of mine as a curious case for his opinion  he is the most inexplicable man to me that i ever knew can you explain him sir he is i really believe nobleminded generous and princely but his most intimate friends may be separated from him for years without his ever asking a question concerning them he will meet them with a formality a coldness a stately indifference but when they come close to him and fairly engage him in conversation they find him as easy pleasant and kind as they could wish one then supposes that what is so agreeable will soon be renewed but stay away from him for half a year and he will neither call on you nor send to inquire about you johnson why sir i cannot ascertain his character exactly as i do not know him but i should not like to have such a man for my friend he may love study and wish not to be interrupted by his friends amici fures temporis he may be a frivolous man and be so much occupied with petty pursuits that he may not want friends or he may have a notion that there is a dignity in appearing indifferent while he in fact may not be more indifferent at his heart than another  we went to evening prayers at st clements at seven and then parted  on sunday april  0 being easter day after attending solemn service at st pauls i came to dr johnson and found mr low the painter sitting with him mr low mentioned the great number of new buildings of late in london yet that dr johnson had observed that the number of inhabitants was not increased johnson why sir the bills of mortality prove that no more people die now than formerly so it is plain no more live births are nothing for not one tenth of the people of london are born there boswell i believe sir a great many of the children born in london die early johnson why yes sir boswell but those who do live are as stout and strong people as any dr price says they must be naturally stronger to get through johnson that is system sir a great traveller observes that it is said there are no weak or deformed people among the indians but he with much sagacity assigns the reason of this which is that the hardship of their life as hunters and fishers does not allow weak or diseased children to grow up now had i been an indian i must have died early my eyes would not have served me to get food i indeed now could fish give me english tackle but had i been an indian i must have starved or they would have knocked me on the head when they saw i could do nothing boswell perhaps they would have taken care of you we are told they are fond of oratory you would have talked to them johnson nay sir i should not have lived long enough to be fit to talk i should have been dead before i was ten years old depend upon it sir a savage when he is hungry will not carry about with him a looby of nine years old who cannot help himself they have no affection sir boswell i believe natural affection of which we hear so much is very small johnson sir natural affection is nothing but affection from principle and established duty is sometimes wonderfully strong low a hen sir will feed her chickens in preference to herself johnson but we dont know that the hen is hungry let the hen be fairly hungry and i will warrant she will peck the corn herself a cock i believe will feed hens instead of himself but we dont know that the cock is hungry boswell and that sir is not from affection but gallantry but some of the indians have affection johnson sir that they help some of their children is plain for some of them live which could not do without being helped  i dined with him the company were mrs williams mrs desmoulins and mr low he seemed not to be well talked little grew drowsy soon after dinner and retired upon which i went away  having next day gone to mr burkes seat in the country from whence i was recalled by an express that a near relation of mine had killed his antagonist in a duel and was himself dangerously wounded i saw little of dr johnson till monday april    when i spent a considerable part of the day with him and introduced the subject which chiefly occupied my mind johnson i do not see sir that fighting is absolutely forbidden in scripture i see revenge forbidden but not selfdefence boswell the quakers say it is unto him that smites thee on one cheek offer also the other johnson but stay sir the text is meant only to have the effect of moderating passion it is plain that we are not to take it in a literal sense we see this from the context where there are other recommendations which i warrant you the quaker will not take literally as for instance from him that would borrow of thee turn thou not away let a man whose credit is bad come to a quaker and say well sir lend me a hundred pounds he will find him as unwilling as any other man no sir a man may shoot the man who invades his character as he may shoot him who attempts to break into his house so in      my friend tom cumming the quaker said he would not fight but he would drive an ammunitioncart and we know that the quakers have sent flannel waistcoats to our soldiers to enable them to fight better boswell when a man is the aggressor and by illusage forces on a duel in which he is killed have we not little ground to hope that he is gone into a state of happiness johnson sir we are not to judge determinately of the state in which a man leaves this life he may in a moment have repented effectually and it is possible may have been accepted by god there is in camdens remains an epitaph upon a very wicked man who was killed by a fail from his horse in which he is supposed to say between the stirrup and the ground i mercy asked i mercy found boswell is not the expression in the burialservice in the sure and certain hope of a blessed resurrection too strong to be used indiscriminately and indeed sometimes when those over whose bodies it is said have been notoriously profane johnson it is sure and certain hope sir not belief i did not insist further but cannot help thinking that less positive words would be more proper  talking of a man who was grown very fat so as to be incommoded with corpulency he said he eats too much sir boswell i dont know sir you will see one man sat who eats moderately and another lean who eats a great deal johnson nay sir whatever may be the quantity that a man eats it is plain that if he is too fat he has eaten more than he should have done one man may have a digestion that consumes food better than common but it is certain that solidity is increased by putting something to it boswell but may not solids swell and be distended johnson yes sir they may swell and be distended but that is not fat  we talked of the accusation against a gentleman for supposed delinquencies in india johnson what foundation there is for accusation i know not but they will not get at him where bad actions are committed at so great a distance a delinquent can obscure the evidence till the scent becomes cold there is a cloud between which cannot be penetrated therefore all distant power is bad i am clear that the best plan for the government of india is a despotick governor for if he be a good man it is evidently the best government and supposing him to be a bad man it is better to have one plunderer than many a governor whose power is checked lets others plunder that he himself may be allowed to plunder but if despotick he sees that the more he lets others plunder the less there will be for himself so he restrains them and though he himself plunders the country is a gainer compared with being plundered by numbers  i mentioned the very liberal payment which had been received for reviewing and as evidence of this that it had been proved in a trial that dr shebbeare had received six guineas a sheet for that kind of literary labor johnson sir he might get six guineas for a particular sheet but not communibus sheetibus boswell pray sir by a sheet of review is it meant that it shall be all of the writers own composition or are extracts made from the book reviewed deducted johnson no sir it is a sheet no matter of what boswell i think that it is not reasonable johnson yes sir it is a man will more easily write a sheet all his own than read an octavo volume to get extracts to one of johnsons wonderful fertility of mind i believe writing was really easier than reading and extracting but with ordinary men the case is very different a great deal indeed will depend upon the care and judgment with which the extracts are made i can suppose the operation to be tedious and difficult but in many instances we must observe crude morsels cut out of books as if at random and when a large extract is made from one place it surely may be done with very little trouble one however i must acknowledge might be led from the practice of reviewers to suppose that they take a pleasure in original writing for we often find that instead of giving an accurate account of what has been done by the author whose work they are reviewing which is surely the proper business of a literary journal they produce some plausible and ingenious conceits of their own upon the topics which have been discussed  upon being told that old mr sheridan indignant at the neglect of his oratorical plans had threatened to go to america  johnson i hope he will go to america boswell the americans dont want oratory johnson but we can want sheridan  on monday april    i found him at home in the forenoon and mr seward with him horace having been mentioned  boswell there is a great deal of thinking in his works one finds there almost every thing but religion seward he speaks of his returning to it in his ode parcus deorum cultor et infrequens johnson sir he was not in earnest this was merely poetical boswell there are i am afraid many people who have no religion at all seward and sensible people too johnson why sir not sensible in that respect there must be either a natural or a moral stupidity if one lives in a total neglect of so very important a concern seward i wonder that there should be people without religion johnson sir you need not wonder at this when you consider how large a protion of almost every mans life is passed without thinking of it i mys  or some years totally regardless of religion it had dropped out of  it was at an early part of my life sickness brought it back and  i have never lost it since boswell my dear sir what a man st you have been without religion why you must have gone on drinking and swearing and   johnson with a smile i drank enough and swore enough to be sure seward one should think that sickness and the view of death would make more men religious johnson sir they do not know how to go about it they have not the first notion a man who has never had religion before no more grows religious when he is sick than a man who has never learnt figures can count when he has need of calculation  i mentioned a worthy friend of ours whom we valued much but observed that he was too ready to introduce religious discourse upon all occasions johnson why yes sir he will introduce religious discourse without seeing whether it will end in instruction and improvement or produce some profane jest he would introduce it in the company of wilkes and twenty more such  i mentioned dr johnsons excellent distinction between liberty of conscience and liberty of teaching johnson consider sir if you have children whom you wish to educate in the principles of the church of england and there comes a quaker who tries to pervert them to his principles you would drive away the quaker you would not trust to the predomination of right which you believe is in your opinions you would keep wrong out of their heads now the vulgar are the children of the state if any one attempts to teach them doctrines contrary to what the state approves the magistrate may and ought to restrain him seward would you restrain private conversation sir johnson why sir it is difficult to say where private conversation begins and where it ends if we three should discuss even the great question concerning the existence of a supreme being by ourselves we should not be restrained for that would be to put an end to all improvement but if we should discuss it in the presence of ten boardingschool girls and as many boys i think the magistrate would do well to put us in the stocks to finish the debate there  lord hailes had sent him a present of a curious little printed poem on repairing the university of aberdeen by david malloch which he thought would please johnson as affording clear evidence that mallet had appeared even as a literary character by the name of malloch his changing which to one of softer sound had given johnson occasion to introduce him into his dictionary under the article alias this piece was i suppose one of mallets first essays it is preserved in his works with several variations johnson now read aloud from the beginning of it where there were some commonplace assertions as to the superiority of ancient times how false is all this to say that in ancient times learning was not a disgrace to a peer as it is now in ancient times a peer was as ignorant as any one else he would have been angry to have it thought he could write his name men in ancient times dared to stand forth with a degree of ignorance with which nobody would dare now to stand forth i am always angry when i hear ancient times praised at the expense of modern times there is now a great deal more learning in the world than than there was formerly for it is universally diffused you have perhaps no man who knows as much greek and latin as bentley or no man who knows as much mathematics as newton but you have many more men who know greek and latin and who know mathematics  on thursday may   i visited him in the evening along with young mr burke he said it is strange that there should be so little reading in the world and so much writing people in general do not willingly read if they can have any thing else to amuse them there must be an external impulse emulation or vanity or avarice the progress which the understanding makes through a book has more pain than pleasure in it language is scanty and inadequate to express the nice gradations and mixtures of our feelings no man reads a book of science from pure inclination the books that we do read with pleasure are light compositions which contain a quick succession of events however i have this year read all virgil through i read a book of the aeneid every night so it was done in twelve nights and i had great delight in it the georgicks did not give me so much pleasure except the fourth book the eclogues i have almost all by heart i do no think the story of the aeneid interesting i like the story of the odyssey much better and this not on account of the wonderful things which it contains for there are wonderful things enough in the aeneid  the ships of the trojans turned to seanymphs  the tree at polydoruss tomb dropping blood the story of the odyssey is interesting as a great part of it is domestic it has been said there is pleasure in writing particularly in writing verses i allow you may have pleasure from writing after it is over if you have written well but you dont go willingly to it again i know when i have been writing verses i have run my finger down the margin to see how many i had made and how few i had to make  he seemed to be in a very placid humor and although i have no note of the particulars of young mr burkes conversation it is but justice to mention in general that it was such that dr johnson said to me afterward he did very well indeed i have a mind to tell his father  i have no minute of any interview with johnson till thursday may    when i find what follows  boswell i wish much to be in parliament sir johnson why sir unless you come resolved to support any administration you would be the worse for being in parliament because you would be obliged to live more expensively boswell perhaps sir i should be the less happy for being in parliament i never would sell my vote and i should be vexed if things went wrong johnson that is cant sir it would not vex you more in the house than in the gallery public affairs vex no man boswell have not they vexed yourself a little sir have not you been vexed by all the turbulence of this reign and by that absurd vote of the house of commons that the influence of the crown has increased is increasing and ought to be diminished johnson sir i have never slept an hour less nor eat an ounce less meat i would have knocked the factious dogs on the head to be sure but i was not vexed boswell i declare sir upon my honor i did imagine i was vexed and took a pride in it but it was perhaps cant for i own i neither eat less nor slept less johnson my dear friend clear your mind of cant you may talk as other people do you may say to a man sir i am your most humble servant you are not his most humble servant you may say these are sad times it is a melancholy thing to be reserved to such times you dont mind the times you tell a man i am sorry you had such bad weather the last day of your journey and were so much wet you dont care sixpence whether he was wet or dry you may talk in this manner it is a mode of talking in society but dont think foolishly  i talked of living in the country johnson dont set up for what is called hospitality it is a waste of time and a waste of money you are eat up and not the more respected for your liberality if your house be like an inn nobody cares for you a man who stays a week with another makes him a slave for a week boswell but there are people sir who make their houses a home to their guests and are themselves quite easy johnson then sir home must be the same to the guests and they need not come  here he discovered a notion common enough in persons not much accustomed to entertain company that there must be a degree of elaborate attention otherwise company will think themselves neglected and such attention is no doubt very fatiguing he proceeded i would not however be a stranger in my own county i would visit my neighbors and receive their visits but i would not be in haste to return visits if a gentleman comes to see me i tell him he does me a great deal of honor i do not go to see him perhaps for ten weeks then we are very complaisant to each other no sir you will have much more influence by giving or lending money where it is wanted than by hospitality  on saturday may    i saw him for a short time having mentioned that i had that morning been with old mr sheridan he remembered their former intimacy with a cordial warmth and said to me tell mr sheridan i shall be glad to see him and shake hands with him boswell it is to me very wonderful that resentment should be kept up so long johnson why sir it is not altogether resentment that he does not visit me it is partly falling out of the habit  partly disgust as one has at a drug that has made him sick besides he knows that i laugh at his oratory  another day i spoke of one of our friends of whom he as well as i had a very high opinion he expatiated in his praise but added sir he is a cursed whig a bottomless whig as they all are now  i mentioned my expectations from the interest of an eminent person then in power adding but i have no claim but the claim of friendship however some people will go a great way from that motive johnson sir they will go all the way from that motive a gentleman talked of retiring never think of that said johnson the gentleman urged i should then do no ill johnson nor no good either sir it would be a civil suicide  on monday may    i found him at tea and the celebrated miss burney the author of evelina and cecilia with him i asked if there would be any speakers in parliament if there were no places to be obtained johnson yes sir why do you speak here either to instruct and entertain which is a benevolent motive or for distinction which is a selfish motive i mentioned cecilia johnson with an air of animated satisfaction sir if you talk of cecilia talk on  we talked of mr barrys exhibition of his pictures johnson whatever the hand may have done the mind has done its part there is a grasp of mind there which you find no where else in mr barrys printed analysis or description of these pictures he speaks of johnsons character in the highest terms   i asked whether a man naturally virtuous or one who has overcome wicked inclinations is the best johnson sir to you the man who has overcome wicked inclinations is not the best he has more merit to himself i would rather trust my money to a man who has no hands and so a physical impossibility to steal than to a man of the most honest principles there is a witty satirical story of foot he had a small bust of garrick placed upon his bureau you may be surprised said he that i allow him to be so near my gold  but you will observe he has no hands  on friday may    being to set out for scotland next morning i passed a part of the day with him in more than usual earnestness as his health was in a more precarious state than at any time when i had parted from him he however was quick and lively and critical as usual i mentioned one who was a very learned man johnson yes sir he has a great deal of learning but it never lies straight there is never one idea by the side of another it is all entangled and then he drives it so aukwardly upon conversation  i stated to him an anxious thought by which a sincere christian might be disturbed even when conscious of having lived a good life so far as is consistent with human infirmity he might fear that he should afterward fall away and be guilty of such crimes as would render all his former religion vain could there be upon this aweful subject such a thing as balancing of accounts suppose a man who has led a good life for seven years commits an act of wickedness and instantly dies will his former good life have any effect in his favor johnson sir if a man has led a good life for seven years and then is hurried by passion to do what is wrong and is suddenly carried off depend upon it he will have the reward of his seven years good life god will not take a catch of him upon this principle richard baxter believes that a suicide may be saved if says he it should be objected that what i maintain may encourage suicide i answer i am not to tell a lie to prevent it boswell but does not the text say as the tree falls so it must lye johnson yes sir as the tree falls but  after a little pause  that is meant as to the general state of the tree not what is the effect of a sudden blast in short he interpreted the expression as refering to condition not to position the common notion therefore seems to be erroneous and shenstones witty remark on divines trying to give the tree a jerk upon a deathbed to make it lie favorably is not well founded  i asked him what works of richard baxters i should read he said read any of them they are all good  he said get as much force of mind as you can live within your income always have something saved at the end of the year let your imports be more than your exports and you will never go far wrong  i assured him that in the extensive and various range of his acquaintance there never had been any one who had a more sincere respect and affection for him than i had he said i believe it sir were i in distress there is no man to whom i should sooner come than to you i should like to come and have a cottage in your park toddle about live mostly on milk and be taken care of by mrs boswell she and i are good friends now are we not  talking of devotion he said though it be true that god dwells not in temples made with hands yet in this state of being our minds are more piously affected in places appropriated to divine worship than in others some people have a particular room in their house where they say their prayers of which i do not disapprove as it may animate their devotion  he embraced me and gave me his blessing as usual when i was leaving him for any length of time i walked from his door today with a fearful apprehension of what might happen before i returned  to the right honorable william windham sir the bringer of this letter is the father of miss philips a singer who comes to try her voice on the stage at dublin  mr philips is one of my old friends and as i am of opinion that neither he nor his daughter will do any thing that can disgrace their benefactors i take the liberty of entreating you to countenance and protect them so far as may be suitable to your station and character and shall consider myself as obliged by any favorable notice which they shall have the honor of receiving from you  i am sir your most humble servant sam johnson london may          the following is another instance of his active benevolence to sir joshua reynolds dear sir i have sent you some of my godsons performances of which i do not pretend to form any opinion when i took the liberty of mentioning him to you i did not know what i have since been told that mr moser had admitted him among the students of the academy what more can be done for him i earnestly entreat you to consider for i am very desirous that he should derive some advantage from my connection with him if you are inclined to see him i will bring him to wait on you at any time that you shall be pleased to appoint  i am sir your most humble servant sam johnson june           my anxious apprehensions at parting with him this year proved to be but too well founded for not long afterward he had a dreadful stroke of the palsy of which there are very full and accurate accounts in letters written by himself which show with what composure his steady piety enabled him to behave  to the reverend dr john tailor dear sir it has pleased god by a paralytick stroke in the night to deprive me of speech  i am very desirous of dr heberdens assistance as i think my case is not past remedy let me see you as soon as it is possible bring dr heberden with you if you can but come yourself at all events i am glad you are so well when i am so dreadfully attacked  i think that by a speedy application of stimulants much may be done i question if a vomit vigorous and rough would not rouse the organs of speech to action as it is too early to send i will try to recollect what i can that can be suspected to have brought on this dreadful distress  i have been accustomed to bleed frequently for an asthmatick complaint but have forborne for some time by dr pepyss persuasion who perceived my legs beginning to swell i sometimes alleviate a painful or more properly an oppressive constriction of my chest by opiates and have lately taken opium frequently but the last or two last times in smaller quantities my largest dose is three grains and last night i took but two you will suggest these things and they are all that i can call to mind to dr heberden  i am etc sam johnson june          two days after he wrote thus to mrs thrale vol ii p     of mrs thrales collection   on monday the   th i sat for my picture and walked a considerable way with little inconvenience in the afternoon and evening i felt myself light and easy and began to plan schemes of life thus i went to bed and in a short time walked and sat up as has been long my custom when i felt a confusion and indistinctness in my head which lasted i suppose about half a minute i was alarmed and prayed god that however he might afflict my body he would spare my understanding this prayer that i might try the integrity of my faculties i made in latin verse the lines were not very good but i knew them not to be very good i made them easily and concluded myself to be unimpaired in my faculties  soon after i perceived that i had suffered a paralytick stroke and that my speech was taken from me i had no pain and so little dejection in this dreadful state that i wondered at my own apathy and considered that perhaps death itself when it should come would excite less horror than seems now to attend it  in order to rouse the vocal organs i took two drams wine has been celebrated for the production of eloquence i put myself into violent motion and i think repeated it but all was vain i then went to bed and strange as it may seem i think slept when i saw light it was time to contrive what i should do though god stopped my speech he left me my hand i enjoyed a mercy which was not granted to my dear friend lawrence who now perhaps overlooks me as i am writing and rejoices that i have what he wanted my first note was necessarily to my servant who came in talking and could not immediately comprehend why he should read what i put into his hands  i then wrote a card to mr allen that i might have a discreet friend at hand to act as occasion should require in penning this note i had some difficulty my hand i knew not how nor why made wrong letters i then wrote to dr tailor to come to me and bring dr heberden and i sent to dr brocklesby who is my neighbor my physicians are very friendly and give me great hopes but you may imagine my situation i have so far recovered my vocal powers as to repeat the lords prayer with no very imperfect articulation my memory i hope yet remains as it was but such an attack produces solicitude for the safety of every faculty   to mr thomas davies dear sir i have had indeed a very heavy blow but god who yet spares my life i humbly hope will spare my understanding and restore my speech as i am not at all helpless i want no particular assistance but am strongly affected by mrs daviess tenderness and when i think she can do me good shall be very glad to call upon her i had ordered friends to be shut out but one or two have found the way in and if you come you shall be admitted for i know not whom i can see that will bring more amusement on his tongue or more kindness in his heart  i am etc sam johnson june          it gives me great pleasure to preserve such a memorial of johnsons regard for mr davies to whom i was indebted for my introduction to him poor derrick however though he did not himself introduce me to dr johnson as he promised had the merit of introducing me to davies the immediate introductor  he indeed loved davies cordially of which i shall give the following little evidence one day when he had treated him with too much asperity tom who was not without pride and spirit went off in a passion but he had hardly reached home when frank who had been sent after him delivered this note  come come dear davies i am always sorry when we quarrel send me word that we are friends  to james boswell esquire dear sir your anxiety about my health is very friendly and very agreeable with your general kindness i have indeed had a very frightful blow on the   th of last month about three in the morning as near as i can guess i perceived myself almost totally deprived of speech i had no pain my organs were so obstructed that i could say no but could scarcely say yes i wrote the necessary directions for it pleased god to spare my hand and sent for dr heberden and dr brocklesby between the time in which i discovered my own disorder and that in which i sent for the doctors i had i believe in spite of my surprise and solicitude a little sleep and nature began to renew its operations they came and gave the directions which the disease required and from that time i have been continually improving in articulation i can now speak but the nerves are weak and i cannot continue discourse long but strength i hope will return the physicians consider me as cured i was last sunday at church on tuesday i took an airing to hampstead and dined with the club where lord palmerston was proposed and against my opinion was rejected his lordship was soon after chosen and is now a member of the club  i design to go next week with mr langton to rochester where i purpose to stay about ten days and then try some other air i have many kind invitations your brother has very frequently enquired after me most of my friends have indeed been very attentive thank dear lord hailes for his present  i hope you found at your return every thing gay and prosperous and your lady in particular quite recovered and confirmed pay her my respects  i am dear sir your most humble servant sam johnson london july         to mrs lucy porter in lichfield dear madam the account which you give of your health is but melancholy may it please god to restore you my disease affected my speech and still continues in some degree to obstruct my utterance my voice is distinct enough for awhile but the organs being still weak are quickly weary but in other respects i am i think rather better than i have lately been and can let you know my state without the help of any other hand  in the opinion of my friends and in my own i am gradually mending the physicians consider me as cured and i had leave four days ago to wash the cantharides from my head last tuesday i dined at the club  i am going next week into kent and purpose to change the air frequently this summer whether i shall wander so far as staffordshire i cannot tell i should be glad to come return my thanks to mrs cobb and mr pearson and all that have shown attention to me  let us my dear pray for one another and consider our sufferings as notices mercifully given us to prepare ourselves for another state  i live now but in a melancholy way my old friend mr levett is dead who lived with me in the house and was useful and companionable mrs desmoulins is gone away and mrs williams is so much decayed that she can add little to anothers gratifications the world passes away and we are passing with it but there is doubtless another world which will endure for ever let us all fit ourselves for it  i am etc sam johnson london july         such was the general vigor of his constitution that he recovered from this alarming and severe attack with wonderful quickness so that in july he was able to make a visit to mr langton at rochester where he passed about a fortnight and made little excursions as easily as at any time of his life in august he went as far as the neighborhood of salibury to heal the seat of william bowls esquire a gentleman whom i have heard him praise for exemplary religious order in his family in his diary i find a short but honorable mention of this visit  august    i came to heal without fatigue  0 i am entertained quite to my mind  to dr brocklesby dear sir heal near salisbury aug         without appearing to want a just sense of your kind attention i cannot omit to give an account of the day which seemed to appear in some sort perilous i rose at five and went out at six and having reached salisbury about nine went forward a few miles in my friends chariot i was no more wearied with the journey though it was a high hung rough coach than i should have been forty years ago we shall now see what air will do the country is all a plain and the house in which i am so far as i can judge from my window for i write before i have left my chamber is sufficiently pleasant  be so kind as to continue your attention to mrs williams it is great consolation to the well  ill greater to the sick that they find themselves not neglected  now that you will be desirous of giving comfort even where you have no great hope of giving help  since i wrote the former part of the letter i find that by the course of the post i cannot send it before the thirtyfirst  i am etc sam johnson   while he was here he had a letter from dr brocklesby acquainting him of the death of mrs williams which affected him a good deal though for several years her temper had not been complacent she had valuable qualities and her departure left a blank in his house upon this occasion he according to his habitual course of piety composed a prayer prayers and meditations p       i shall here insert a few particulars concerning him with which i have been favored by one of his friends  he had once conceived the design of writing the life of oliver cromwell saying that he thought it must be highly curious to trace his extraordinary rise to the supreme power from so obscure a beginning he at length laid aside his scheme on discovering that all that can be told of him is already in print and that it is impracticable to procure any authentic information in addition to what the world is already possessed of  he had likewise projected but at what part of his life is not known a work to show how small a quantity of real fiction there is in the world and how the same images with very little variation have served all the authors who have ever written  his thoughts in the latter part of his life were frequently employed on his deceased friends he often muttered these or such like sentences poor man and then he died  speaking of a certain literary friend he is a very pompous puzzling fellow says the doctor he lent me a letter once that somebody had written to him no matter what it was about but he wanted to have the letter back and expressed a mighty value for it he hoped it was to be met with again he would not lose it for a thousand pounds i laid my hand upon it soon afterward and gave it him i believe i said i was very glad to have met with it o then he did not know that it signified any thing so you see when the letter was lost it was worth a thousand pounds and when it was found it was not worth a farthing  the style and character of his conversation is pretty generally known it was certainly conducted in conformity with  of lord bacon but it is not clear i apprehend that this conformity was either perceived or intended by johnson the precept alluded to is as follows in all kinds of speech either pleasant grave severe or ordinary it is convenient to speak leisurely and rather drawingly than hastily because hasty speech confounds the memory and oftentimes besides the unseemliness drives a man either to stammering a nonplus or harping on that which should follow whereas a slow speech confirms the memory adds a conceit of wisdom to the hearers besides a seemliness of speech and countenance dr johnsons method of conversation was certainly calculated to excite attention and to amufe or instruct as it happened without wearying or confusing his company he was always most perfectly clear and conspicuous and his language was so accurate and his sentences so neatly constructed that his conversation might have been all printed without any correction at the same time it was easy and natural the accuracy of it had no appearance of labor constraint or stiffness he seemed more correct than others by the force of habit and the customary exercises of his powerful mind  he spoke often in praise of french literature the french are excellent in this he would say they have a book on every subject from what he had seen of them he denied them the praise of superior politeness and mentioned with very visible disgust the custom they have of spitting on the floors of their apartment this says the doctor is as gross a thing as can well be done and one wonders how any man or set of men can persist in so offensive a practice for a whole day together one should expect that the first effort toward civilization would remove it even amongst savages  baxters reasons of the christian religion he thought contained the best collection of the evidences of the divinity of the christian system  chemistry was always an interesting pursuit with dr johnson whilst he was in wiltshire he attended some experiments that were made by a physician at salisbury on the new kinds of air in the course of the experiments frequent mention being made of dr priestley dr johnson knit his brows and in a stern manner enquired why do we hear so much of dr priestley i do not wonder at johnsons displeasure when the name of dr priestley was mentioned for i know no writer who has been suffered to publish more pernicious doctrines i shall instance only three first materialism by which mind is denied to human nature which if believed must deprive us of every elevated principle secondly necessity or the doctrine that every action whether good or bad is included in an unchangeable and unavoidable system a notion utterly subversive of moral government thirdly that we have no reason to think that the future world which as he is pleased to inform us will be adapted to our merely improved nature will be materially different from this which if believed would sink wretched mortals into despair as they could no longer hope for the rest that remains for the people of god or for that happiness which is revealed to us as something beyond our present conceptions but would seel themselves doomed to a continuation of the uneasy state under which they now groan i say nothing of the petulant intemperance with which he dares to insult the venerable establishments of his country  he was very properly answered sir because we are indebted to him for these important discoveries on this dr johnson appeared well content and replied well well i believe we are and let every man have the honor he has merited  a friend was one day about two years before his death struck with some instance of dr johnsons great candor well sir said he i will always say that you are a very candid man  will you replied the doctor i doubt then you will be very singular but indeed sir continued he i look upon myself to be a man very much misunderstood i am not an uncandid nor am i a severe man i sometimes say more than i mean in jest and people are apt to believe me serious however i am more candid than i was when i was younger as i know more of mankind i expect less of them and am ready now to call a man a good man upon easier terms than i was formerly  on his return from heal he wrote to dr burney i came home on the   th at noon to a very disconsolate house you and i have lost our friends but you have more friends at home my domestic companion is taken from me she is much missed for her acquisitions were many and her curiosity universal so that she partook of every conversation i am not well enough to go much out and to sit and eat or fast alone is very wearisome i always mean to send my compliments to all the ladies  his fortitude and patience met with severe trials during this year the stroke of the palsy has been related circumstantially but he was also afflicted with the gout and was besides troubled with a complaint which not only was attended with immediate inconvenience but threatened him with a painful chirurgical operation from which most men would shrink the complaint was a sarcocele which johnson bore with uncommon firmness and was not at all frightened while he looked forward to amputation he was attended by mr pott and also mr cruikshank i have before me a letter of the  0th of july this year to mr cruikshank in which he says i am going to put myself into your hands and another accompanying a set of his lives of the poets in which he says i beg your acceptance of these volumes as an acknowledgement of the great favors which you have bestowed on sir your most obliged and most humble servant i have in my possession several more letters from him to mr cruikshank and also to dr mudge at plymouth which it would be improper to insert as they are filled with unpleasing technical details i shall however extract from his letters to dr mudge such passages as show either a felicity of expression or the undaunted state of his mind  my conviction of your skill and my belief of your friendship determine me to entreat your opinion and advice  in this state i with great earnestness desire you to tell me what is to be done excision is doubtless necessary to the cure and i know not any means of palliation the operation is doubtless painful but is it dangerous the pain i hope to endure with decency but i am loath to put life into much hazard  by representing the gout as an antagonist to the palsy you have said enough to make it welcome this is not strictly the first fit but i hope it is as good as the first for it is the second that ever confined me and the first was ten years ago much less fierce and fiery than this  write dear sir what you can to inform or encourage me the operation is not delayed by any fears or objections of mine  happily the complaint abated without his being put to the torture of amputation but we must surely admire the manly resolution which he discovered while it hung over him  to bennet langton esquire dear sir you may very reasonably charge me with insensibility of your kindness and that of lady rothes since i have suffered so much time to pass without paying any acknowledgement i now at last return my thanks and why i did it not sooner i ought to tell you i went into wiltshire as soon as i well could and was there much employed in palliating my own malady disease produces much selfishness a man in pain is looking after ease and lets most other things go as chance shall dispose of them in the mean time i have lost a companion to whom i have had recourse for domestic amusement for thirty years and whose variety of knowledge never was exhausted and now return to a habitation vacant and desolate i carry about a very troublesome and dangerous complaint which admits no cure but by the chirurgical knife let me have your prayers  i am etc sam johnson london sept          in his next letter to the same gentleman he writes the gout has within these four days come upon me with a violence which i never experienced before it made me helpless as an infant  and in the following having mentioned mrs williams says whose death following that of levett has now made my house a solitude she left her little substance to a charityschool she is i hope where there is neither darkness nor want nor sorrow  i wrote to him begging to know the state of his health and mentioned that baxters anacreon which is in the library at auchinleck was i find collated by my father in      with the m s belonging to the university of leyden and he has made a number of notes upon it would you advise me to publish a new edition of it  his answer was dated september  0  you should not make your letters such rarities when you know or might know the uniform state of my health it is very long since i heard from you and that i have not answered is a very insufficient reason for the silence of a friend  your anacreon is a very uncommon book neither london nor cambridge can supply a copy of that edition whether it should be reprinted you cannot do better than consult lord hailes  besides my constant and radical disease i have been for these ten days much harrassed with the gout but that has now remitted i hope god will yet grant me a little longer life and make me less unfit to appear before him  he this autumn received a visit from the celebrated mrs siddons he gives this account of it in one of his letters to mrs thrale  mrs siddons in her visit to me behaved with great modesty and propriety and left nothing behind her to be censured or despised neither praise nor money the two powerful corrupters of mankind seem to have depraved her i shall be glad to see her again her brother kemble calls on me and pleases me very well mrs siddons and i talked of plays and she told me her intention of exhibiting this winter the characters of constance catherine and isabella in shakspeare  mr kemble has favored me with the following minute of what passed at this visit  when mrs siddons came into the room there happened to be no chair ready for her which he observing said with a smile madam you who so often occasion a want of seats to other people will the more easily excuse the want of one yourself  having placed himself by her he with great good humor entered upon a consideration of the english drama and among other enquiries particularly asked her which of shakspeares characters she was most pleased with upon her answering that she thought the character of queen catherine in henry the eighth the most natural i think so too madam said he and whenever you perform it i will once more hobble out to the theater myself mrs siddons promised she would do herself the honor of acting his favorite part for him but many circumstances happened to prevent the representation of king henry the eighth during the doctors life  in the course of the evening he thus gave his opinion upon the merits of some of the principal performers whom he remembered to have seen upon the stage mrs porter in the vehemence of rage and mrs clive in the sprightliness of humor i have never seen equalled what clive did best she did better than garrick but could not do half so many things well she was a better romp than any i ever saw in nature pritchard in common life was a vulgar idiot she would talk of her gownd but when she appeared upon the stage seemed to be inspired by gentility and understanding i once talked with colley cibber and thought him ignorant of the principles of his art garrick madam was no declaimer there was not one of his own sceneshifters who could not have spoken to be or not to be better than he did yet he was the only actor i ever saw whom i could call a master both in tragedy and comedy though i liked him best in comedy a true conception of character and natural expression of it were his distinguishing excellencies having expatiated with his usual force and eloquence on mr garricks extraordinary eminence as an actor he concluded with this compliment to his social talents and after all madam i thought him less to be envied on the stage than at the head of a table  johnson indeed had thought more upon the subject of acting than might be generally supposed talking of it one day to mr kemble he said are you sir one of those enthusiasts who believe yourself transformed into the very character you represent upon mr kembles answering that he had never felt so strong a persuasion himself to be sure not sir said johnson the thing is impossible and if garrick really believed himself to be that monster richard the third he deserved to be hanged every time he performed it  a pleasing instance of the generous attention of one of his friends has been discovered by the publication of mrs thrales collection of letters in a letter to one of the miss thrales vol ii p      he writes a friend whose name i will tell when your mamma has tried to guess it sent to my physician to enquire whether this long train of illness had brought me into difficulties for want of money with an invitation to send to him for what occasion required i shall write this night to thank him having no need to borrow and afterward in a letter to mrs thrale since you cannot guess i will tell you that the generous man was gerard hamilton i returned him a very thankful and respectful letter ibid p       i applied to mr hamilton by a common friend and he has been so obliging as to let me have johnsons letter to him upon this occasion to adorn my collection  to the right honorable william gerard hamilton dear sir your kind enquiries after my affairs and your generous offers have been communicated to me by dr brocklesby i return thanks with great sincerity having lived long enough to know what gratitude is due to such friendship and entreat that my refusal may not be imputed to fullenness or pride i am indeed in no want sickness is by the generosity of my physicians of little expense to me but if any unexpected exigence should press me you shall see dear sir how cheerfully i can be obliged to so much liberality  i am sir your most obedient and most humble servant sam johnson nov          i find in this as in former years notices of his kind attention to mrs gardener who though in the humble station of a tallowchandler upon snowhill was a woman of excellent good sense pious and charitable she told me she had been introduced to him by mrs masters the poetess whose volumes he revised and it is said illuminated here and there with a ray of his own genius mrs gardener was very zealous for the support of a welsh charityschool and johnson this year i find obtained for it a sermon from the late bishop of st asaph dr shipley whom he in one of his letters to mrs thrale characterises as knowing and conversible and whom all who knew his lordship even those who differed from him in politics remember with much respect  the earl of carlisle having written a tragedy entitled the fathers revenge some of his lordships friends applied to mrs chapone to prevail on dr johnson to read and give his opinion of it which he accordingly did in a letter to that lady sir joshua reynolds having informed me that this letter was in lord carlisles possession though not fortunate enough to have the honor of being known to his lordship trusting to the general courtesy of literature i wrote to him requesting the favor of a copy of it and to be permitted to insert it in my life of dr johnson his lordship was so good as to comply with my request and has thus enabled me to enrich my work with a very fine piece of writing which displays at once the critical skill and politeness of my illustrious friend and perhaps the curiosity which it will excite may induce the noble and elegant author to gratify the world by the publication a few copies only of this tragedy have been printed and given to the authors friends of a performance of which dr johnson has spoken in such terms  to mrs chapone madam by sending the tragedy to me a second time dr johnson having been very ill when the tragedy was first sent to him had declined the consideration of it  i think that a very honorable distinction has been shown me and i did not delay the perusal of which i am now to tell the effect  the construction of the play is not completely regular the stage is too often vacant and the scenes are not sufficiently connected this however would be called by dryden only a mechanical defect which takes away little from the power of the poem and which is seen rather than felt  a rigid examiner of the diction might perhaps wish some words changed and some lines more vigorously terminated but from such petty imperfections what writer was ever free  the general form and force of the dialogue is of more importance it seems to want that quickness of reciprocation which characterises the english drama and is not always sufficiently fervid or animated  of the sentiments i remember not one that i wished omitted in the imagery i cannot forbear to distinguish the comparison of joy succeeding grief to light rushing on the eye accustomed to darkness it seems to have all that can be desired to make it please it is new just and delightful i could have borne my woes that stranger joy wounds while it smiles  the longimprisond wretch emerging from the night of his damp cell shrinks from the suns bright beams and that which flings gladness over all to him is agony    with the characters either as conceived or preserved i have no fault to find but was much inclined to congratulate a writer who in defiance of prejudice and fashion made the archbishop a good man and scorned all thoughtless applause which a vicious churchman would have brought him  the catastrophe is affecting the father and daughter both culpable both wretched and both penitent divide between them our pity and our sorrow  thus madam i have performed what i did not willingly undertake and could not decently refuse the noble writer will be pleased to remember that sincere criticism ought to raise no resentment because judgment is not under the control of will but involuntary criticism as it has still less of choice ought to be more remote from possibility of offense  i am etc sam johnson nov          i consulted him on two questions of a very different nature one whether the unconstitutional influence exercised by the peers of scotland in the election of the representatives of the commons by means of fictitious qualifications ought not to be resisted  the other what in propriety and humanity should be done with old horses unable to labor i gave him some account of my life at auchinleck and expressed my satisfaction that the gentlemen of the county had at two public meetings elected me their praeses or chairman  to james boswell esquire dear sir like all other men who have great friends you begin to feel the pangs of neglected merit and all the comfort that i can give you is by telling you that you have probably more pangs to feel and more neglect to suffer you have indeed begun to complain too soon and i hope i am the only confidant of your discontent your friends have not yet had leisure to gratify personal kindness they have hitherto been busy in strengthening their ministerial interest if a vacancy happens in scotland give them early intelligence and as you can serve government as powerfully as any of your probable competitors you may make in some sort a warrantable claim  of the exaltations and depressions of your mind you delight to talk and i hate to hear drive all such fancies from you  on the day when i received your letter i think the foregoing page was written to which one disease or another has hindered me from making any additions i am now a little better but sickness and solitude press me very heavily i could bear sickness better if i were relieved from solitude  the present dreadful confusion of the public ought to make you wrap yourself up in your hereditary possessions which though less than you may wish are more than you can want and in an hour of religious retirement return thanks to god who has exempted you from any strong temptation to faction treachery plunder and disloyalty  as your neighbors distinguish you by such honors as they can bestow content yourself with your station without neglecting your profession your estate and the courts will find you full employment and your mind well occupied will be quiet  the usurpation of the nobility for they apparently usurp all the influence they gain by fraud and misrepresentation i think it certainly lawful perhaps your duty to resist what is not their own they have only by robbery  your question about the horses gives me more perplexity i know not well what advice to give you i can only recommend a rule which you do not want  give as little pain as you can i suppose that we have a right to their service while their strength lasts what we can do with them afterward i cannot so easily determine but let us consider nobody denies that man has a right first to milk the cow and to sheer the sheep and then to kill them for his table may he not by parity of reason first work a horse and then kill him the easiest way that he may have the means of another horse or food for cows and sheep man is influenced in both cases by different motives of selfinterest he that rejects the one must reject the other  i am etc sam johnson london dec         a happy and pious christmas and many happy years to you your lady and children     the late ingenious mr mickle some time before his death wrote me a letter concerning dr johnson in which he mentions i was upwards of twelve years acquainted with him was frequently in his company always talked with ease to him and can truly say that i never received from him one rough word  in this letter he relates his having while engaged in translating the lusiad had a dispute of considerable length with johnson who as usual declaimed upon the misery and corruption of a sea life and used this expression  it had been happy for the world sir if your hero gama prince henry of portugal and columbus had never been born or that their schemes had never gone farther than their own imaginations  this sentiment says mr mickle which is to be found in his introduction to the world displayed i in my dissertation prefixed to the lusiad have controverted and though authors are said to be bad judges of their own works i am not ashamed to own to a friend that that dissertation is my favorite above all that i ever attempted in prose next year when the lusiad was published i waited on dr johnson who addressed me with one of his goodhumoured smiles  well you have remembered our dispute about prince henry and have cited me too you have done your part very well indeed you have made the best of your argument but i am not convinced yet  before publishing the lusiad i sent mr hoole a proof of that part of the introduction in which i make mention of dr johnson yourself and other wellwishers to the work begging it might be shown to dr johnson this was accordingly done and in place of the simple mention of him which i had made he dictated to mr hoole the sentence as it now stands  dr johnson told me in      that about twenty years before that time he himself had a design to translate the lusiad of the merit of which he spoke highly but had been prevented by a number of other engagements  mr mickle reminds me in this letter of a conversation when dining one day at mr hooles with dr johnson when mr nicol the kings bookseller and i attempted to controvert the maxim better that ten guilty should escape than one innocent person suffer and were answered by dr johnson with great power of reasoning and eloquence i am very sorry that i have no record of that day but i well recollect my illustrious friends having ably shown that unless civil institutions insure protection to the innocent all the confidence which mankind should have in them would be lost  i shall here mention what should properly have appeared in my account of last year though the controversy was not closed till this the reverend mr shaw a native of one of the hebrides having entertained doubts of the authenticity of the poems ascribed to ossian divested himself of national bigotry and having traveled in the highlands and islands of scotland and also in ireland in order to furnish himself with materials for a gaelick dictionary which he afterward compiled was so fully satisfied that dr johnson was in the right upon the question that he fairly published a pamphlet stating his conviction and the proofs and reasons on which it was founded a person at edinburgh of the name of clark answered this pamphlet with much zeal and much abuse of its author johnson took mr shaw under his protection and gave him his assistance in writing a reply which has been admired by the best judges and by many been considered as conclusive a few paragraphs which sufficiently mark their great author shall be selected  my assertions are for the most part purely negative i deny the existence of fingal because in a long and curious peregrination through the gaelick regions i have never been able to find it what i could not see myself i suspect to be equally invisible to others and i suspect with the more reason as among all those who have seen it no man can show it  mr clark compares the obstinacy of those who disbelieve the genuineness of ossian to a blind man who should dispute the reality of colors and deny that the british troops are clothed in red the blind mans doubt would be rational if he did not know by experience that others have a power which he himself wants but what perspicacity has mr clark which nature has withheld from me or the rest of mankind  the true state of the parallel must be this suppose a man with eyes like his neighbors was told by a boasting corporal that the troops indeed wore red clothes for their ordinary dress but that every soldier had likewise a suit of black velvet which he put on when the king reviews them this he thinks strange and desires to see the fine clothes but finds nobody in forty thousand men that can produce either coat or waistcoat one indeed has left them in his chest at port mahon another has always heard that he ought to have velvet clothes somewhere and a third has heard somebody say that soldiers ought to wear velvet can the enquirer be blamed if he goes away believing that a soldiers red coat is all that he has  but the most obdurate incredulity may be shamed or silenced by facts to overpower contradictions let the soldier show his velvet coat and the fingalist the original of ossian  the difference between us and the blind man is this  the blind man is unconvinced because he cannot see and we because though we can see we find that nothing can be shown  notwithstanding the complication of disorders under which johnson now labored he did not resign himself to despondency and discontent but with wisdom and spirit endeavored to console and amuse his mind with as many innocent enjoyments as he could procure sir john hawkins has mentioned the cordiality with which he insisted that such of the members of the old club in ivylane as survived should meet again and dine together which they did twice at a tavern and once at his house and in order to insure himself society in the evening for three days in the week he instituted a club at the essex head in essexstreet then kept by samuel greaves an old servant of mr thrales  to sir joshua reynolds dear sir it is inconvenient to me to come out i should else have waited on you with an account of a little evening club which we are establishing in essexstreet in the strand and of which you are desired to be one it will be held at the essex head now kept by an old servant of thrales the company is numerous and as you will see by the list miscellaneous the terms are lax and the expenses light mr barry was adopted by dr brocklesby who joined with me in forming the plan we meet thrice a week and he who misses forfeits twopence  if you are willing to become a member draw a line under your name return the list we meet for the first time on monday at eight  i am etc sam johnson dec         it did not suit sir joshua to be one of this club but when i mention only mr daines barrington dr brocklesby mr murphy mr cook mr joddrel mr paradise dr horsley mr windham i was in scotland when this club was founded and during all the winter johnson however declared i should be a member and invented a word upon the occasion boswell said he is a very clubable man when i came to town i was proposed by mr barrington and chosen i believe there are few societies where there is better conversation or more decorum several of us resolved to continue it after our great founder was removed by death other members were added and now above six years since that loss we go on happily  i shall sufficiently obviate the misrepresentation of it by sir john hawkins as if it had been a low alehouse association by which johnson was degraded johnson himself like his namesake old ben composed the rules of his club rules today deep thoughts with me resolve to drench in mirth which after no repenting draws milton the club shall consist of fourandtwenty  the meetings shall be on the monday thursday and saturday of every week but in the week before easter there shall be no meeting  every member is at liberty to introduce a friend once a week but not oftener  two members shall oblige themselves to attend in their turn every night from eight to ten or to procure two to attend in their room  every member present at the club shall spend at least sixpence and every member who stays away shall forfeit threepence  the master of the house shall keep an account of the absent members and deliver to the president of the night a list of the forfeits incurred  when any member returns after absence he shall immediately lay down his forfeits which if he omits to do the president shall require  there shall be no general reckoning but every man shall adjust his own expenses  the night of indispensable attendance will come to every member once a month whoever shall for three months together omit to attend himself or by substitution nor shall make any apology in the fourth month shall be considered as having abdicated the club  when a vacancy is to be filled the name of the candidate and of the member recommending him shall stand in the clubroom three nights on the fourth he may be chosen by ballot six members at least being present and twothirds of the ballot being in his favor or the majority should the numbers not be divisible by three  the master of the house shall give notice six days before to each of those members whose turn of necessary attendance is come  the notice may be in these words  sir on  the  of  will be your turn of presiding at the essex head your company is therefore earnestly requested  one penny shall be left by each member for the waiter  johnsons definition of a club in this sense in his dictionary is an assembly of good fellows meeting under certain conditions     in the end of this year he was seized with a spasmodick asthma of such violence that he was confined to the house in great pain being sometimes obliged to sit all night in his chair a recumbent posture being so hurtful to his respiration that he could not endure lying in bed and there came upon him at the same time that oppressive and fatal disease a dropsy it was a very severe winter which probably aggravated his complaints and the solitude in which mr levett and mrs williams had left him rendered his life very gloomy mrs desmoulins who still lived was herself so very ill that she could contribute very little to his relief he however had none of that unsocial shyness which we commonly see in people afflicted with sickness he did not hide his head in abstraction he did not deny himself to the visits of his friends and acquaintances but at all times when he was not overcome by sleep was ready for conversation as in his best days  to mrs lucy porter in lichfield dear madam you may perhaps think me negligent that i have not written to you again upon the loss of your brother but condolences and consolations are such common and such useless things that the omission of them is no great crime and my own diseases occupy my mind and engage my care my nights are miserably restless and my days therefore are heavy i try however to hold up my head as high as i can  i am sorry that your health is impaired perhaps the spring and the summer may in some degree restore it but if not we must submit to the inconveniences of time as to the other dispensations of eternal goodness pray for me and write to me or let mr pearson write for you  i am etc sam johnson london nov            the following is a remarkable proof of his being alive to the most minute curiosities of literature  to mr dilly bookseller in the poultry sir there is in the world a set of books which used to be sold by the booksellers on the bridge and which i must entreat you to procure me they are called burtons books the title of one is admirable curiosities rarities and wonders in england i believe there are about five or six of them they seem very proper to allure backward readers be so kind as to get them for me and send me them with the best printed edition of baxters call to the unconverted  i am etc sam johnson jan           to richard clark esquire dear sir you will receive a requisition according to the rules of the club to be at the house as president of the night this turn comes once a month and the member is obliged to attend or send another in his place you were enrolled in the club by my invitation and i ought to introduce you but as i am hindered by sickness mr hoole will very properly supply my place as introductor or yours as president i hope in milder weather to be a very constant attendant  i am sir etc sam johnson jan          you ought to be informed that the forfeits began with the year and that every night of nonattendance incurs the mulct of threepence that is ninepence a week  on the  th of january i wrote to him anxiously inquiring as to his health and enclosing my letter to the people of scotland on the present state of the nation  i trust said i that you will be liberal enough to make allowance for my differing from you on two points the middlesex election and the american war when my general principles of government are according to your own heart and when at a crisis of doubtful event i stand forth with honest zeal as an ancient and faithful baron my reason for introducing those two points was that as my opinions with regard to them had been declared at the periods when they were least favorable i might have the credit of a man who is not a worshipper of ministerial power  to james boswell esquire dear sir i hear of many inquiries which your kindness has disposed you to make after me i have long intended you a long letter which perhaps the imagination of its length hindered me from beginning i will therefore content myself with a shorter  having promoted the institution of a new club in the neighborhood at the house of an old servant of thrales i went thither to meet the company and was seized with a spasmodick asthma so violent that with difficulty i got to my own house in which i have been confined eight or nine weeks and from which i know not when i shall be able to go even to church the asthma however is not the worst a dropsy gains ground upon me my legs and thighs are very much swollen with water which i should be content if i could keep there but i am afraid that it will soon be higher my nights are very sleepless and very tedious and yet i am extremely afraid of dying  my physicians try to make me hope that much of my malady is the effect of cold and that some degree at least of recovery is to be expected from vernal breezes and summer suns if my life is prolonged to autumn i should be glad to try a warmer climate though how to travel with a diseased body without a companion to conduct me and with very little money i do not well see ramsay has recovered his limbs in italy and fielding was sent to lisbon where indeed he died but he was i believe past hope when he went think for me what i can do  i received your pamphlet and when i write again may perhaps tell you some opinion about it but you will forgive a man struggling with disease his neglect of disputes politics and pamphlets let me have your prayers my compliments to your lady and young ones ask your physicians about my case and desire sir alexander dick to write me his opinion  i am dear sir etc sam johnson feb          to mrs lucy porter in lichfield my dearest love i have been extremely ill of an asthma and dropsy but received by the mercy of god sudden and unexpected relief last thursday by the discharge of twenty pints of water whether i shall continue free or shall fill again cannot be told pray for me  death my dear is very dreadful let us think nothing worth our care but how to prepare for it what we know amiss in ourselves let us make haste to amend and put our trust in the mercy of god and the intercession of our savior  i am dear madam your most humble servant sam johnson feb          to james boswell esquire dear sir i have just advanced so far toward recovery as to read a pamphlet and you may reasonably suppose that the first pamphlet which i read was yours i am very much of your opinion and like you feel great indignation at the indecency with which the king is every day treated your paper contains very considerable knowledge of the history and of the constitution very properly produced and applied it will certainly raise your character i sent it to mr pit with a letter in which i thus expressed myself my principles may appear to you too monarchical but i know and am persuaded they are not inconsistent with the true principles of liberty be this as it may you sir are now the prime minister called by the sovereign to maintain the rights of the crown as well as those of the people against a violent faction as such you are entitled to the warmest support of every good subject in every department he answered i am extremely obliged to you for the sentiments you do me the honor to express and have observed with great pleasure the zealous and able support given to the cause of the public in the work you were so good to transmit to me  though perhaps it may not make you a minister of state  i desire you to see mrs stewart once again and tell her that in the lettercase was a letter relating to me for which i will give her if she is willing to give it me another guinea the letter is of consequence only to me  i am dear sir etc sam johnson london feb          in consequence of johnsons request that i should ask our physicians about his case and desire sir alexander dick to send his opinion i transmitted him a letter from that very amiable baronet then in his eightyfirst year with his faculties as entire as ever and mentioned his expressions to me in the note accompanying it with my most affectionate wishes for dr johnsons recovery in which his friends his country and all mankind have so deep a stake and at the same time a full opinion upon his case by dr gillespie who like dr cullen had the advantage of having passed through the gradations of surgery and pharmacy and by study and practice had attained to such skill that my father settled on him two hundred pounds a year for five years and fifty pounds a year during his life as an honorarium to secure his particular attendance the opinion was conveyed in a letter to me beginning i am sincerely sorry for the bad state of health your very learned and illustrious friend dr johnson labors under at present  to james boswell esquire dear sir presently after i had sent away my last letter i received your kind medical packet i am very much obliged both to you and your physicians for your kind attention to my disease dr gillespie has sent an excellent consilium medicum all solid practical experimental knowledge i am at present in the opinion of my physicians dr heberden and dr brocklesby as well as my own going on very hopefully i have just begun to take vinegar of squills the powder hurt my stomach so much that it could not be continued  return sir alexander dick my sincere thanks for his kind letter and bring with you the rhubarb from his garden at prestonfield where he cultivated that plant with such success that he was presented with a gold medal by the society of london for the encouragement of arts and sciences which he so tenderly offers me  i hope dear mrs boswell is now quite well and that no evil either real or imaginary now disturbs you  i am etc sam johnson london march         i also applied to three of the eminent physicians who had chairs in our celebrated school of medicine at edinburgh doctors cullen hope and monro to each of whom i sent the following letter dear sir dr johnson has been very ill for some time and in a letter of anxious apprehension he writes to me ask your physicians about my case  this you see is not authority for a regular consultation but i have no doubt of your readiness to give your advice to a man so eminent and who in his life of garth has paid your profession a just and elegant compliment i believe every man has found in physicians great liberality and dignity of sentiment very prompt effusions of beneficence and willingness to exert a lucrative art where there is no hope of lucre  dr johnson is aged seventyfour last summer he had a stroke of the palsy from which he recovered almost entirely he had before that been troubled with a catarrhous cough this winter he was seized with a spasmodick asthma by which he has been confined to his house for about three months dr brocklesby writes to me that upon the least admission of cold there is such a constriction upon his breast that he cannot lie down in his bed but is obliged to sit up all night and gets rest and sometimes sleep only by means of laudanum and syrup of poppies and that there are oedematous tumors on his legs and thighs dr brocklesby trusts a good deal to the return of mild weather dr johnson says that a dropsy gains ground upon him and he seems to think that a warmer climate would do him good i understand he is now rather better and is using vinegar of squills  i am with great esteem dear sir your most obedient humble servant james boswell march           all of them paid the most polite attention to my letter and its  venerable object dr cullens words concerning him were it would give me the greatest pleasure to be of any service to a man whom the public properly esteem and whom i esteem and respect as much as i do dr johnson dr hopes few people have a better claim on me than your friend as hardly a day passes that i do not ask his opinion about this or that word dr monros i most sincerely join you in sympathizing with that very worthy and ingenious character from whom his country has derived much instruction and entertainment  dr hope corresponded with his friend dr brocklesby doctors cullen and monro wrote their opinions and prescriptions to me which i afterward carried with me to london and so far as they were encouraging communicated to johnson the liberality on one hand and grateful sense of it on the other i have great satisfaction in recording  to james boswell esquire dear sir i am too much pleased with the attention which you and your dear lady who had written him a very kind letter show to my welfare not to be diligent in letting you know the progress which i make toward health the dropsy by gods blessing has now run almost totally away by natural evacuation and the asthma if not irritated by cold gives me little trouble while i am writing this i have not any sensation of debility or disease but i do not yet venture out having been confined to the house from the thirteenth of december now a quarter of a year  when it will be fit for me to travel as far as auchinleck i am not able to guess but such a letter as mrs boswells might draw any man not wholly motionless a great way pray tell the dear lady how much her civility and kindness have touched and gratified me  our parliamentary tumults have now begun to subside and the kings authority is in some measure reestablished mr pit will have great power but you must remember that what he has to give must at least for some time be given to those who gave and those who preserve his power a new minister can sacrifice little to esteem or friendship he must till he is settled think only of extending his interest  if you come hither through edinburgh send for mrs stewart and give from me another guinea for the letter in the old case to which i shall not be satisfied with my claim till she gives it me  please to bring with you baxters anacreon and if you procure heads of hector boece the historian and arthur johnston the poet i will put them in my room or any other of the fathers of scottish literature  i wish you an easy and happy journey and hope i need not tell you that you will be welcome to  dear sir your most affectionate humble servant sam johnson london march          i wrote to him march    from york informing him that i had a high gratification in the triumph of monarchical principles over aristocratical influence in that great county in an address to the king that i was thus far on my way to him but that news of the dissolution of parliament having arrived i was to hasten back to my own country where i had carried an address to his majesty by a great majority and had some intention of being a candidate to represent the county in parliament  to james boswell esquire dear sir you could do nothing so proper as to haste back when you found the parliament dissolved with the influence which your address must have gained you it may reasonably be expected that your presence will be of importance and your activity of effect  your solicitude for me gives me that pleasure which every man feels from the kindness of such a friend and it is with delight i relieve it by telling that dr brocklesbys account is true and that i am by the blessing of god wonderfully relieved  you are entering upon a transaction which requires much prudence you must endeavor to oppose without exasperating to practice temporary hostility without producing enemies for life this is perhaps hard to be done yet it has been done by many and seems most likely to be effected by opposing merely upon general principles without descending to personal or particular censures or objections one thing i must enjoin you which is seldom observed in the conduct of elections  i must entreat you to be scrupulous in the use of strong liquors one nights drunkenness may defeat the labors of forty days well employed be firm but not clamorous be active but not malicious and you may form such an interest as may not only exalt yourself but dignify your family  we are as you may suppose all busy here mr fox resolutely stands for westminster and his friends say will carry the election however that be he will certainly have a seat mr hoole has just told me that the city leans toward the king  let me hear from time to time how you are employed and what progress you make  make dear mrs boswell and all the young boswells the sincere compliments of  sir your affectionate humble servant sam johnson london march  0       to mr langton he wrote with that cordiality which was suitable to the long friendship which had subsisted between him and that gentleman  march    since you left me i have continued in my own opinion and in dr brocklesbys to grow better with respect to all my formidable and dangerous distempers though to a body battered and shaken as mine has lately been it is to be feared that weak attacks may be sometimes mischievous i have indeed by standing carelessly at an open window got a very troublesome cough which it has been necessary to appease by opium in larger quantities than i like to take and i have not found it give way so readily as i expected its obstinacy however seems at last disposed to submit to the remedy and i know not whether i should then have a right to complain of any morbid sensation my asthma is i am afraid constitutional and incurable but it is only occasional and unless it be excited by labor or by cold gives me no molestation nor does it lay very close siege to life for sir john floyer whom the physical race consider as author of one of the best books upon it panted on to ninety as was supposed and why were we content with supposing a fact so interesting of a man so conspicuous because he corrupted at perhaps seventy or eighty the register that he might pass for younger than he was he was not much less than eighty when to a man of rank who modestly asked him his age he answered go look though he was in general a man of civility and elegance  the ladies i find are at your house all well except miss langton who will probably soon recover her health by light suppers let her eat at dinner as she will but not take a full stomach to bed pay my sincere respects to the two principal ladies in your house and when you write to dear miss langton in lincolnshire let her know that i mean not to break our league of friendship and that i have a set of lives for her when i have the means of sending it  april   i am still disturbed by my cough but what thanks have i not to pay when my cough is the most painful sensation that i feel and from that i expect hardly to be released while winter continues to gripe us with so much pertinacity the year has now advanced eighteen days beyond the equinox and still there is very little remission of the cold when warm weather comes which surely must come at last i hope it will help both me and your young lady  the man so busy about addresses is neither more nor less than our own boswell who had come as far as york toward london but turned back on the dissolution and is said now to stand for some place whether to wish him success his best friends hesitate  let me have your prayers for the completion of my recovery i am now better than i ever expected to have been may god add to his mercies the grace that may enable me to use them according to his will my compliments to all  april    i had this evening a note from lord portmore to which johnson returned this answer to the right honorable earl of portmore dr johnson acknowledges with great respect the honor of lord portmores notice he is better than he was and will as his lordship directs write to mr langton  boltcourt fleet street apr            desiring that i would give you an account of my health you might have had it with less circumduction i am by gods blessing i believe free from all morbid sensations except a cough which is only troublesome but i am still weak and can have no great hope of strength till the weather shall be softer the summer if it be kindly will i hope enable me to support the winter god who has so wonderfully restored me can preserve me in all seasons  let me enquire in my turn after the state of your family great and little i hope lady rothes and miss langton are both well that is a good basis of content then how goes george on with his studies how does miss mary and how does my own jenny i think i owe jenny a letter which i will take care to pay in the mean time tell her that i acknowledge the debt  be pleased to make my compliments to the ladies if mrs langton comes to london she will favor me with a visit for i am not well enough to go out  to ozias humphrey the eminent painter representative of the ancient family of homfrey now spelt humphrey in the west of england who as appears from their arms which they have invariably used have been as i have seen authenticated by the best authority one of those among the knights and esquires of honor who are represented by holingshead as having issued from the tower of london on coursers apparelled for the justes accompanied by ladies of honor leading every one a knight with a chain of gold passing through the streets of london into smithfield on sunday at three oclock in the afternoon being the first sunday after michaelmas in the fourteenth year of king richard the second this family once enjoyed large possessions but like others have lost them in the progress of ages their blood however remains to them well ascertained and they may hope in the revolution of events to recover that rank in society for which in modern times fortune seems to be an indispensable requisite  esquire sir mr hoole has told me with what benevolence you listened to a request which i was almost afraid to make of leave to a young painter son of mr samuel paterson eminent for his knowledge of books to attend you from time to time in your paintingroom to see your operations and receive your instructions  the young man has perhaps good parts but has been without a regular education he is my godson and therefore i interest myself in his progress and success and shall think myself much favored if i receive from you a permission to send him  my health is by gods blessing much restored but i am not yet allowed by my physicians to go abroad nor indeed do i think myself yet able to endure the weather  i am sir your most humble servant sam johnson april         to the same sir the bearer is my godson whom i take the liberty of recommending to your kindness which i hope he will deserve by his respect to your excellence and his gratitude for your favors  i am sir your most humble servant sam johnson april  0       to the same sir i am very much obliged by your civilities to my godson but must beg of you to add to them the favor of permitting him to see you paint that he may know how a picture is begun advanced and completed  if he may attend you in a few of your operations i hope he will show that the benefit has been properly conferred both by his proficiency and his gratitude at least i shall consider you as enlarging your kindness to  sir your humble servant sam johnson may          to the reverend dr tailor ashbourne derbyshire dear sir what can be the reason that i hear nothing from you i hope nothing disables you from writing what i have seen and what i have felt gives me reason to fear every thing do not omit giving me the comfort of knowing that after all my losses i have yet a friend left  i want every comfort my life is very solitary and very cheerless though it has pleased god wonderfully to deliver me from the dropsy i am yet very weak and have not passed the door since the   th of december i hope for some help from warm weather which will surely come in time  i could not have the consent of the physicians to go to church yesterday i therefore received the holy sacrament at home in the room where i communicated with dear mrs williams a little before her death o my friend the approach of death is very dreadful i am afraid to think on that which i know i cannot avoid it is vain to look round and round for that help which cannot be had yet we hope and hope and fancy that he who has lived today may live tomorrow but let us learn to derive our hope only from god  in the mean time let us be kind to one another i have no friend now living but you and mr hector that was the friend of my youth do not neglect dear sir yours affectionately  sam johnson london eastermonday april          what follows is a beautiful specimen of his gentleness and complacency to a young lady his godchild one of the daughters of his friend mr langton then i think in her seventh year he took the trouble to write it in a large round hand nearly resembling printed characters that she might have the satisfaction of reading it herself the original lies before me but shall be faithfully restored to her and i dare say will be preserved by her as a jewel as long as she lives  to miss jane langton in rochester kent my dearest miss jenny i am sorry that your pretty letter has been so long without being answered but when i am not pretty well i do not always write plain enough for young ladies i am glad my dear to see that you write so well and hope that you mind your pen your book and your needle for they are all necessary your books will give you knowledge and make you respected and your needle will find you useful employment when you do not care to read when you are a little older i hope you will be very diligent in learning arithmetic and above all that through your whole life you will carefully say your prayers and read your bible  i am my dear your most humble servant sam johnson may  0       on wednesday may   i arrived in london and next morning had the pleasure to find dr johnson greatly recovered i but just saw him for a coach was waiting to carry him to islington to the house of his friend the reverend mr strahan where he went sometimes for the benefit of good air which notwithstanding his having formerly laughed at the general opinion upon the subject he now acknowledged was conducive to health  one morning afterward when i found him alone he communicated to me with solemn earnestness a very remarkable circumstance which had happened in the course of his illness when he was much distressed by the dropsy he had shut himself up and employed a day in particular exercises of religion  fasting humiliation and prayer on a sudden he obtained extraordinary relief for which he looked up to heaven with grateful devotion he made no direct inference from this fact but from his manner of telling it i could perceive that it appeared to him as something more than an incident in the common course of events for my own part i have no difficulty to avow that cast of thinking which by many modern pretenders to wisdom is called superstitious but here i think even men of pretty dry rationality may believe that there was an intermediate interposition of divine providence and that the fervent prayer of this righteous man availed upon this subject there is a very fair and judicious remark in the life of dr abernethy in the first edition of the biographia britannica which i should have been glad to see in his life which has been written for the second edition of that valuable work to deny the exercise of a particular providence in the deitys government of the world is certainly impious yet nothing serves the cause of the scorner more than an incautious forward zeal in determining the particular instances of it  in confirmation of my sentiments i am also happy to quote that sensible and elegant writer mr melmoth in letter viii of his collection published under the name of fitzosborne we may safely assert that the belief of a particular providence is founded upon such probable reasons as may well justify our assent it would fcarce therefore be wise to renounce an opinion which affords so firm a support to the soul in those seasons wherein she stands in most need of assistance merely because it is not possible in questions of this kind to solve every difficulty which attends them     on sunday may   i found colonel vallancy the celebrated antiquarian and engineer of ireland with him on monday the  0th i dined with him at mr paradises where was a large company mr bryant mr joddrel mr hawkins brown etc on thursday the   th i dined with him at mr joddrels with another large company the bishop of exeter lord monboddo i was sorry to observe lord monboddo avoid any communication with dr johnson i flattered myself that i had made them very good friends see journal of a tour to the hebrides third edition page    but unhappily his lordship had resumed and cherished a violent prejudice against my illustrious friend to whom i must do the justice to say there was on his part not the least anger but a goodhumoured sportivenes nay though he knew of his lordships disposition toward him he was even kindly as appeared from his inquiring of me after him by an abbreviation of his name well how does monny  mr murphy etc  on saturday may    i dined with him at dr brocklesbys where were colonel vallancy mr murphy and that evercheerful companion mr devaynes apothecary to his majesty of these days and others on which i saw him i have no memorials except the general recollection of his being able and animated in conversation and appearing to relish society as much as the youngest man i find only these three small particulars  one when a person was mentioned who said i have lived fiftyone years in this world without having had ten minutes of uneasiness he exclaimed the man who says so lies he attempts to impose on human credulity the bishop of exeter in vain observed that men were very different his lordships manner was not impressive and i learnt afterward that johnson did not find out that the person who talked to him was a prelate if he had i doubt not that he would have treated him with more respect for once talking of george psalmanazar whom he reverenced for his piety he said i should as soon think of contradicting a bishop one of the company provoked him greatly by doing what he could least of all bear which was quoting something of his own writing against what he then maintained what sir cried the gentleman do you say to the busy day the peaceful night unfelt uncounted glided by johnson having thus had himself presented as giving an instance of a man who had lived without uneasiness was much offended for he looked upon such quotation as unfair his anger burst out in an unjustifiable retort insinuating that the gentlemans remark was a sally of ebriety sir there is one passion i would advise you to command when you have drunk out that glass dont drink another here was exemplified what goldsmith said of him with the aid of a very witty image from one of cibbers comedies there is no arguing with johnson for if his pistol misses fire he knocks you down with the butt end of it  another when a gentleman of eminence in the literary world was violently censured for attacking people by anonymous paragraphs in newspapers he from the spririt of contradiction as i thought took up his defense and said come come this is not so terrible a crime he means only to vex them a little i do not say that i should do it but there is a great difference between him and me what is fit for hephaestion is not fit for alexander  another when i told him that a young and handsome countess had said to me i should think that to be praised by dr johnson would make one a fool all ones life and that i answered madam i shall make him a fool today by repeating this to him he said i am too old to be made a fool but if you say i am i shall not deny it i am much pleased with a compliment especially from a pretty woman  on the evening of saturday may    he was in fine spirits at our essexheadclub he told us i dined yesterday at mrs garricks with mrs carter miss hannah more and miss fanny burney three such women are not to be found i know not where i could find a fourth except mrs lennox who is superior to them all boswell what had you them all to yourself sir johnson i had them all as much as they were had but it might have been better had there been more company there boswell might not mrs montagu have been a fourth johnson sir mrs montagu does not make a trade of her wit but mrs montagu is a very extraordinary woman she has a constant stream of conversation and it is always impregnated it has always meaning boswell mr burke has a constant stream of conversation johnson yes sir if a man were to go by chance at the same time with burke under a shed to shun a shower he would say this is an extraordinary man if burke should go into a stable to see his horse dressed the ostler would say we have had an extraordinary man here boswell foot was a man who never failed in conversation if he had gone into a stable   johnson sir if he had gone into a stable the ostler would have said here has been a comical fellow but he would not have respected him boswell and sir the ostler would have answered him would have given him as good as he brought as the common saying is johnson yes sir and foot would have answered the ostler  when burke does not descend to be merry his conversation is very superior indeed there is no proportion between the powers which he shows in serious talk and in jocularity when he lets himself down to that he is in the kennel i have in another place journal of a tour to the hebrides edit   p  0 opposed and i hope with success dr johnsons very singular and erroneous notion as to mr burkes pleasantry mr windham now said low to me that he differed from our great friend in this observation for that mr burke was often very happy in his merriment it would not have been right for either of us to have contradicted johnson at this time in a society all of whom did not know and value mr burke as much as we did it might have occasioned something more rough and at any rate would probably have checked the flow of johnsons good humor he called to us with a sudden air of exultation as the thought started into his mind o gentlemen i must tell you a very great thing the empress of russia has ordered the rambler to be translated into the russian language i have since heard that the report was not wellfounded but the elation discovered by johnson in the belief that it was true showed a noble ardour for literary fame  so i shall be read on the banks of the wolga horace boasts that his fame would extend as far as the banks of the rhone now the wolga is farther from me than the rhone was from horace boswell you must certainly be pleased with this sir johnson i am pleased sir to be sure a man is pleased to find he has succeeded in that which he has endeavored to do  one of the company mentioned his having seen a noble person driving in his carriage and looking exceedingly well notwithstanding his great age johnson ah sir that is nothing bacon observes that a stout healthy old man is like a tower undermined  on sunday may    i found him alone he talked of mrs thrale with much concern saying sir she has done every thing wrong since thrales bridle was off her neck and was proceeding to mention some circumstances which have since been the subject of public discussion when he was interrupted by the arrival of dr douglas now bishop of carlisle  dr douglas upon this occasion refuted a mistaken notion which is very common in scotland that the ecclesiastical discipline of the church of england though duly enforced is insufficient to preserve the morals of the clergy inasmuch as all delinquents may be screened by appealing to the convocation which being never authorized by the king to sit for the dispatch of business the appeal never can be heard dr douglas observed that this was founded upon ignorance for that the bishops have sufficient power to maintain discipline and that the sitting of the convocation was wholly immaterial in this respect it being not a court of judicature but like a parliament to make canons and regulations as times may require  johnson talking of the fear of death said some people are not afraid because they look upon salvation as the effect of an absolute decree and think they feel in themselves the marks of sanctification others and those the most rational in my opinion look upon salvation as conditional and as they never can be sure that they have complied with the conditions they are afraid  in one of his little manuscript diaries about this time i find a short notice which marks his amiable disposition more certainly than a thousand studied declarations  afternoon spent cheerfully and elegantly i hope without offense to god or man though in no holy duty yet in the general exercise and cultivation of benevolence  on monday may    i dined with him at mr dillys where were colonel vallancy reverend dr gibbons and mr capel lofft who though a most zealous whig has a mind so full of learning and knowledge and so much in exercise in various exertions and withal so much liberality that the stupendous powers of the literary goliath though they did not frighten this little david of popular spirit could not but excite his admiration there was also mr braithwaite of the post office that amiable and friendly man who with modest and unassuming manners has associated with many of the wits of the age johnson was very quiescent today perhaps too i was indolent i find nothing more of him in my notes but that when i mentioned that i had seen in the kings library sixtythree editions of my favorite thomas a kempis amongst which it was in eight languages latin german french italian spanish english arabic and armenian he said he thought it unnecessary to collect many editions of a book which were all the same except as to the paper and print he would have the original and all the translations and all the editions which had any variations in the text he approved of the famous collection of editions of horace by douglas mentioned by pope who is said to have had a closet filled with them and he said every man should try to collect one book in that manner and present it to a public library  on tuesday may    i saw him for a short time in the morning i told him that the mob had called out as the king passed no fox  no fox which i did not like he said they were right sir i said i thought not for it seemed to be making mr fox the kings competitor there being no audience so that there could be no triumph in a victory he fairly agreed with me i said it might do very well if explained thus let us have no fox understanding it as a prayer to his majesty not to appoint that gentleman minister  on wednesday may    i sat a part of the evening with him by ourselves i observed that the death of our friends might be a consolation against the fear of our own dissolution because we might have more friends in the other world than in this he perhaps felt this as a reflection upon his apprehension as to death and said with heat how can a man know where his departed friends are or whether they will be his friends in the other world how many friendships have you known formed upon principles of virtue most friendships are formed by caprice or by chance mere confederacies in vice or leagues in folly  we talked of our worthy friend mr langton he said i know not who will go to heaven if langton does not sir i could almost say sit anima mea cum langtono i mentioned a very eminent friend as a virtuous man johnson yes sir but  has not the evangelical virtue of langton  i am afraid would not scruple to pick up a wench  he however charged mr langton with what he thought want of judgment upon an interesting occasion when i was ill said he i desired he would tell me sincerely in what he thought my life was faulty sir he brought me a sheet of paper on which he had written down several texts of scripture recommending christian charity and when i questioned him what occasion i had given for such an animadversion all that he could say amounted to this  that i sometimes contradicted people in conversation now what harm does it do to any man to be contradicted boswell i suppose he meant the manner of doing it roughly  and harshly johnson and who is the worse for that boswell it hurts people of weak nerves johnson i know no such weaknerved people mr burke to whom i related this conference said it is well if when a man comes to die he has nothing heavier upon his conscience than having been a little rough in conversation  johnson at the time when the paper was presented to him though at first pleased with the attention of his friend whom he thanked in an earnest manner soon exclaimed in a loud and angry tone what is your drift sir sir joshua reynolds pleasantly observed that it was a scene for a comedy to see a penitent get into a violent passion and belabour his confessor after all i cannot but be of opinion that as mr langton was seriously requested by dr johnson to mention what appeared to him erroneous in the character of his friend he was bound as an honest man to intimate what he really thought which he certainly did in the most delicate manner so that johnson himself when in a quiet frame was pleased with it the texts suggested are now before me and i shall quote a few of them blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth mat v    i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love ephesians v      and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness col iii     charity suffers long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly is not easily provoked   cor xiii       i have preserved no more of his conversation at the times when i saw him during the rest of this month till sunday the  0th of may when i met him in the evening at mr hooles where there was a large company both of ladies and gentlemen sir james johnston happened to say that he paid no regard to the arguments of counsel at the bar of the house of commons because they were paid for speaking johnson nay sir argument is argument you cannot help paying regard to their arguments if they are good if it were testimony you might disregard it if you knew that it were purchased there is a beautiful image in bacon upon this subject testimony is like an arrow shot from a long bow the force of it depends on the strength of the hand that draws it argument is like an arrow from a crossbow which has equal force though shot by a child  he had dined that day at mr hooles and miss helen maria williams being expected in the evening mr hoole put into his hands her beautiful ode on the peace the peace made by that very able statesman the earl of shelburne now marquis of lansdowne which may fairly be considered as the foundation of all the prosperity of great britain since that time  johnson read it over and when this amiable elegant and accomplished young lady was presented to him he took her by the hand in the most courteous manner and repeated the finest stanza of her poem this was the most delicate and pleasing compliment he could pay her respectable friend dr kippis from whom i had this anecdote was standing by and was not a little gratified  miss williams told me that the only other time she was fortunate enough to be in dr johnsons company he asked her to sit down by him which she did and upon her enquiring how he was he answered i am very ill indeed madam i am very ill even when you are near me what should i be were you at a distance  he had now a great desire to go to oxford as his first jaunt after his illness we talked of it for some days and i had promised to accompany him he was impatient and fretful tonight because i did not at once agree to go with him on thursday when i considered how ill he had been and what allowance should be made for the influence of sickness upon his temper i resolved to indulge him though with some inconvenience to myself as i wished to attend the musical meeting in honor of handel in westminsterabbey on the following saturday  in the midst of his own diseases and pains he was ever compassionate to the distresses of others and actively earnest in procuring them aid as appears from a note to sir joshua reynolds of june   in these words i am ashamed to ask for some relief for a poor man to whom i hope i have given what i can be expected to spare the man importunes me and the blow goes round i am going to try another air on thursday  on thursday june   the oxford postcoach took us up in the morning at boltcourt the other two passengers were mrs beresford and her daughter two very agreeable ladies from america they were going to worcestershire where they then resided frank had been sent by his master the day before to take places for us and i found from the waybill that dr johnson had made our names be put down mrs beresford who had read it whispered me is this the great dr johnson i told her it was so she was then prepared to listen as she soon happened to mention in a voice so low that johnson did not hear it that her husband had been a member of the american congress i cautioned her to beware of introducing that subject as she must know how very violent johnson was against the people of that country he talked a great deal but i am sorry i have preserved little of the conversation miss beresford was so much charmed that she said to me aside how he does talk every sentence is an essay she amused herself in the coach with knotting he would scarcely allow this species of employment any merit next to mere idleness said he i think knotting is to be reckoned in the scale of insignificance though i once attempted to learn knotting dempsters sister looking to me endeavored to teach me it but i made no progress  i was surprised at his talking without reserve in the public postcoach of the state of his affairs i have said he about the world i think above a thousand pounds which i intend shall afford frank an annuity of seventy pounds a year  at the inn where we stopped he was exceedingly dissatisfied with some roast mutton which we had for dinner the ladies i saw wondered to see the great philosopher whose wisdom and wit they had been admiring all the way get into illhumour from such a cause he scolded the waiter saying it is as bad as bad can be it is illfed illkilled illkept and illdrest  he bore the journey very well and seemed to feel himself elevated as he approached oxford that magnificent and venerable seat of learning orthodoxy and toryism frank came in the heavy coach in readiness to attend him and we were received with the most polite hospitality at the house of his old friend dr adams master of pembroke college who had given us a kind invitation before we were set down i communicated to johnson my having engaged to return to london directly for the reason i have mentioned but that i would hasten down to him again he was pleased that i had made this journey merely to keep him company he was easy and placid with dr adams mrs and miss adams and mrs kennicot widow of the learned hebraean who was here on a visit he soon dispatched the inquiries which were made about his illness and recovery by a short and distinct narrative and then assuming a gay air repeated from swift nor think on our approaching ills and talk of spectacles and pills   dr newton the bishop of bristol having been mentioned johnson recollecting the manner in which he had been mentioned by that prelate dr newton in his account of his own life after animadverting upon mr gibbons history says dr johnson lives of the poets afforded more amusement but candor was much hurt and offended at the malevolence that predominates in every part some passages it must be allowed are judicious and well written but make not sufficient compensation for so much spleen and ill humor never was any biographer more sparing of his praise or more abundant in his censures he seemingly delights more in exposing blemishes than in recommending beauties slightly passes over excellencies enlarges upon imperfections and not content with his own severe reflections revives old scandal and produces large quotations from the forgotten works of former critics his reputation was so high in the republic of letters that it wanted not to be raised upon the ruins of others but these essays instead of raising a higher idea than was before entertained of his understanding have certainly given the world a worse opinion of his temper the bishop was therefore the more surprised and concerned for his townsman for he respected him not only for his genius and learning but valued him much more for the more amiable part of his character his humanity and charity his morality and religion the last sentence we may consider as the general and permanent opinion of bishop newton the remarks which precede it must by all who have read johnsons admirable work be imputed to the disgust and peevishness of old age i wish it had not appeared and that dr johnson had not been provoked by it to express himself not in respectful terms of a prelate whose labors were certainly of considerable advantage both to literature and religion  thus retaliated  tom knew he should be dead before what he has said of me would appear he durst not have printed it while he was alive dr adams i believe his dissertations on the prophecies is his great work johnson why sir it is toms great work but how far it is great or how much of it is toms are other questions i fancy a considerable part of it was borrowed dr adams he was a very successful man johnson i dont think so sir  he did not get very high he was late in getting what he did get and he did not get it by the best means i believe he was a gross flatterer  i fulfilled my intention by going to london and returned to oxford on wednesday the  th of june when i was happy to find myself again in the same agreeable circle at pembroke college with the comfortable prospect of making some stay johnson welcomed my return with more than ordinary glee  he talked with great regard of the honorable archibald campbell whose character he had given at the duke of argylls table when we were at inveraray journal of a tour to the hebrides  d edit p      and at this time wrote out for me in his own hand a fuller account of that learned and venerable writer which i have published in its proper place johnson made a remark this evening which struck me a good deal i never said he knew a nonjuror who could reason surely he did not mean to deny that faculty to many of their writers to hickes brett and other eminent divines of that persuasion and did not recollect that the seven bishops so justly celebrated for their magnanimous resistance of arbitrary power were yet nonjurors to the new government the nonjuring clergy of scotland indeed who excepting a few have lately by a sudden stroke cut off all ties of allegiance to the house of stuart and resolved to pray for our present lawful sovereign by name may be thought to have confirmed this remark as it may be said that the divine indefeasible hereditary right which they professed to believe if ever true must be equally true still many of my readers will be surprised when i mention that johnson assured me he had never in his life been in a nonjuring meetinghouse  next morning at breakfast he pointed out a passage in savages wanderer saying these are fine verses  if said he i had written with hostility of warburton in my shakspeare i should have quoted this couplet here learning blinded first and then beguiled looks dark as ignorance as fancy wild you see they would have fitted him to a t smiling dr adams but you did not write against warburton johnson no sir i treated him with great respect both in my preface and in my notes  mrs kennicot spoke of her brother the reverend mr chamberlayne who had given up good preferments in the church of england on his conversion to the roman catholic faith johnson who warmly admired every man who acted from a conscientious regard to principle erroneous or not exclaimed servently god bless him  mrs kennicot in confirmation of dr johnsons opinion that the present was not worse than former ages mentioned that her brother assured her there was now less infidelity on the continent than there had been voltaire and rousseau were less read i asserted from good authority that humes infidelity was certainly less read johnson all infidel writers drop into oblivion when personal connections and the floridness of novelty are gone though now and then a foolish fellow who thinks he can be witty upon them may bring them again into notice there will sometimes start up a college joker  who does not consider that what is a joke in a college will not do in the world to such defenders of religion i would apply a stanza of a poem which i remember to have seen in some old collection henceforth be quiet and agree each kiss his empty brother religion scorns a foe like thee but dreads a friend like the other the point is well though the expression is not correct one and not thee should be opposed to the other i have inserted the stanza as johnson repeated it from memory but i have since found the poem itself in the foundling hospital for wit printed at london      it is as follows  epigram occasioned by a religious dispute at bath on reason faith and mystery high two wits harangue the table b  y believes he knows not why n  swears it is all a fable peace coxcombs peace and both agree n  kiss thy empty brother religion laughs at foes like thee and dreads a friend like the other    on the roman catholic religion he said if you join the papists externally they will not interrogate you strictly as to your belief in their tenets no reasoning papist believes every article of their faith there is one side on which a good man might be persuaded to embrace it a good man of a timorous disposition in great doubt of his acceptance with god and pretty credulous might be glad to be of a church where there are so many helps to get to heaven i would be a papist if i could i have fear enough but an obstinate rationality prevents me i shall never be a papist unless on the near approach of death of which i have a very great terror i wonder that women are not all papists boswell they are not more afraid of death than men are johnson because they are less wicked dr adams they are more pious johnson no hang em they are not more pious a wicked fellow is the most pious when he takes to it he will beat you all at piety  he argued in defense of some of the peculiar tenets of the church of rome as to the giving the bread only to the laity he said they may think that in what is merely ritual deviations from the primitive mode may be admitted on the ground of convenience and i think they are as well warranted to make this alteration as we are to substitute sprinkling in the room of the ancient baptism as to the invocation of saints he said though i do not think it authorized it appears to me that the communion of saints in the creed means the communion with the saints in heaven as connected with the holy catholic church waller in his divine poesy canto first has the same thought finely expressed the church triumphant and the church below in songs of praise their present union show their joys are full our expectation long in life we differ but we join in song angels and we assisted by this art may sing together though we dwell apart   he admitted the influence of evil spirits upon our minds and said nobody who believes the new testament can deny it i brought a volume of dr hurd the bishop of worcesters sermons and read to the company some passages from one of them upon this text resist the devil and he will fly from you james iv    i was happy to produce so judicious and elegant a supporter the sermon thus opens  that there are angels and spirits good and bad that at the head of these last there is one more considerable and malignant than the rest who in the form or under the name of a serpent was deeply concerned in the fall of man and whose head as the prophetic language is the son of man was one day to bruise that this evil spirit though that prophecy be in part completed has not yet received his deaths wound but is still permitted for ends unsearchable to us and in ways which we cannot particularly explain to have a certain degree of power in this world hostile to its virtue and happiness and sometimes exerted with too much success all this is so clear from scripture that no believer unless he be first of all spoiled by philosophy and vain deceit can possibly entertain a doubt of it  having treated of possessions his lordship says as i have no authority to affirm that there are now any such so neither may i presume to say with confidence that there are not any  but then with regard to the influence of evil spirits at this day upon the souls of men i shall take leave to be a great deal more peremptory  then having stated the various proofs all this i say is so manifest to every one who reads the scriptures that if we respect their authority the question concerning the reality of the demonick influence upon the minds of men is clearly determined  let it be remembered that these are not the words of an antiquated or obscure enthusiast but of a learned and polite prelate now alive and were spoken not to a vulgar congregation but to the honorable society of lincolns end his lordship in this sermon explains the words deliver us from evil in the lords prayer as signifying a request to be protected from the evil one that is the devil this is well illustrated in a short but excellent commentary by my late worthy friend the reverend dr lort of whom it may truly be said multis ille bonis flebilis occidit it is remarkable that waller in his reflections on the several petitions in that sacred form of devotion has understood this in the same sense guard us from all temptations of the foe    of a doctrine which i know not why should in this world of imperfect knowledge and therefore of wonder and mystery in a thousand instances be contested by some with an unthinking assurance and flippancy  after dinner when one of us talked of there being a great enmity between whig and tory johnson why not so much i think unless when they come into competition with each other there is none when they are only common acquaintance none when they are of different sexes a tory will marry into a whig family and a whig into a tory family without any reluctance but indeed in a matter of much more concern than political tenets and that is religion men and women do not concern themselves much about difference of opinion and ladies set no value on the moral character of men who pay their addresses to them the greatest profligate will be as well received as the man of the greatest virtue and this by a very good woman by a woman who says her prayers three times a day our ladies endeavored to defend their sex from this charge but he roared them down no no a lady will take jonathan wild as readily as st austin if he has threepence more and what is worse her parents will give her to him women have a perpetual envy of our vices they are less vicious than we not from choice but because we restrict them they are the slaves of order and fashion their virtue is of more consequence to us than our own so far as concerns this world  miss adams mentioned a gentleman of licentious character and said suppose i had a mind to marry that gentleman would my parents consent johnson yes they would consent and you would go you would go though they did not consent miss adams perhaps their opposing might make me go johnson o very well you would take one whom you think a bad man to have the pleasure of vexing your parents you put me in mind of dr barrowby the physician who was very fond of swines flesh one day when he was eating it he said i wish i was a jew  why so said somebody the jews are not allowed to eat your favorite meat  because said he i should then have the gust of eating it with the pleasure of sinning he then proceeded in his declamation  miss adams soon afterward made an observation that i do not recollect which pleased him much he said with a goodhumoured smile that there should be so much excellence united with so much depravity is strange  indeed this ladys good qualities merit and accomplishments and her constant attention to dr johnson were not lost upon him she happened to tell him that a little coffeepot in which she had made his coffee was the only thing she could call her own he turned to her with a complacent gallantry dont say so my dear i hope you dont reckon my heart as nothing  i asked him if it was true as reported that he had said lately i am for the king against fox but i am for fox against pit johnson yes sir the king is my master but i do not know pit and fox is my friend  fox added he is a most extraordinary man here is a man describing him in strong terms of objection in some respects according as he apprehended but which exalted his abilities the more who has divided the kingdom with caesar so that it was a doubt whether the nation should be ruled by the scepter of george the third or the tongue of fox  dr wall physician at oxford drank tea with us johnson had in general a peculiar pleasure in the company of physicians which was certainly not abated by the conversation of this learned ingenious and pleasing gentleman johnson said it is wonderful how little good radcliffes traveling fellowships have done i know nothing that has been imported by them yet many additions to our medical knowledge might be got in foreign countries inoculation for instance has saved more lives than war destroys and the cures performed by the peruvianbark are innumerable but it is in vain to send our traveling physicians to france and italy and germany for all that is known there is known here i would send them out of christendom i would send them among barbarous nations  on friday june    we talked at breakfast of forms of prayer johnson i know of no good prayers but those in the book of common prayer dr adams in a very earnest manner i wish sir you would compose some family prayers johnson i will not compose prayers for you sir because you can do it for yourself but i have thought of getting together all the books of prayers which i could selecting those which should appear to me the best putting out some inserting others adding some prayers of my own and prefixing a discourse on prayer we all now gathered about him and two or three of us at a time joined in pressing him to execute this plan he seemed to be a little displeased at the manner of our importunity and in great agitation called out do not talk thus of what is so aweful i know not what time god will allow me in this world there are many things which i wish to do some of us persisted and dr adams said i never was more serious about any thing in my life johnson let me alone let me alone i am overpowered and then he put his hands before his face and reclined for some time upon the table  i mentioned jeremy taylors using in his forms of prayer i am the chief of sinners and other such selfcondemning expressions now said i this cannot be said with truth by every man and therefore is improper for a general printed form i myself cannot say that i am the worst of men i will not say so johnson a man may know that physically that is in the real state of things he is not the worst man but that morally he may be so law observes that every man knows something worse of himself than he is sure of in others you may not have committed such crimes as some men have done but you do not know against what degree of light they have sinned besides sir the chief of sinners is a mode of expression for i am a great sinner so st paul speaking of our saviors having died to save sinners says of whom i am the chief yet he certainly did not think himself so bad as judas iscariot boswell but sir tailor means it literally for he founds a conceit upon it when praying for the conversion of sinners and of himself in particular he says lord thou will not leave thy chief work undone johnson i do not approve of figurative expressions in addressing the supreme being and i never use them tailor gives a very good advice never lie in your prayers never confess more than you really believe never promise more than you mean to perform i recollected this precept in his golden grove but his example for prayer contradicts his precept  dr johnson and i went in dr adamss coach to dine with dr nowell principal of st mary hall at his beautiful villa at iffley on the banks of the isis about two miles from oxford while we were upon the road i had the resolution to ask johnson whether he thought that the roughness of his manner had been an advantage or not and if he would not have done more good if he had been more gentle i proceeded to answer myself thus  perhaps it has been of advantage as it has given weight to what you said you could not perhaps have talked with such authority without it johnson no sir i have done more good as i am obscenity and impiety have always been repressed in my company boswell true sir and that is more than can be said of every bishop greater liberties have been taken in the presence of a bishop though a very good man from his being milder and therefore not commanding such awe yet sir many people who might have been benefited by your conversation have been frightened away a worthy friend of ours has told me that he has often been afraid to talk to you johnson sir he need not have been afraid if he had any thing rational to say if he had not it was better he did not talk  dr nowell is celebrated for having preached a sermon before the house of commons on the  0th of january      full of high tory sentiments for which he was thanked as usual and printed it at their request but in the midst of that turbulence and faction which disgraced a part of the present reign the thanks were afterward ordered to be expunged this strange conduct sufficiently exposes itself and dr nowell will ever have the honor which is due to a lofty friend of our monarchical constitution dr johnson said to me sir the court will be very much to blame if he is not promoted i told this to dr nowell and asserting my humbler though not less zealous exertions in the same cause i suggested that whatever return we might receive we should still have the consolation of being like butlers steady and generous royalist true as the dial to the sun although it be not shone upon   we were well entertained and very happy at dr nowells where was a very agreeable company and we drank church and king after dinner with true tory cordiality  we talked of a certain clergyman of extraordinary character who by exerting his talents in writing on temporary topics and displaying uncommon intrepidity had raised himself to affluence i maintained that we ought not to be indignant at his success for merit of every sort was entitled to reward johnson sir i will not allow this man to have merit no sir what he has is rather the contrary i will indeed allow him courage and on this account we so far give him credit we have more respect for a man who robs boldly on the highway than for a fellow who jumps out of a ditch and knocks you down behind your back courage is a quality so necessary for maintaining virtue that it is always respected even when it is associated with vice  i censured the coarse invective which was become fashionable in the house of commons and said that if members of parliament must attack each other personally in the heat of debate it should be done more genteelly johnson no sir that would be much worse abuse is not so dangerous when there is no vehicle of wit or delicacy no subtle conveyance the difference between coarse and refined abuse is as the difference between being bruised by a club and wounded by a poisoned arrow i have since observed his position elegantly expressed by dr young as the soft plume gives swiftness to the dart good breeding sends the satire to the heart   on saturday june    there drank tea with us at dr adamss mr john henderson student of pembrokecollege celebrated for his wonderful acquirements in alchymy judicial astrology and other abstruse and curious learning and the reverend herbert crossed who i am afraid was somewhat mortified by dr johnsons not being highly pleased with some family discourses which he had printed they were in too familiar a style to be approved of by so manly a mind i have no note of this evenings conversation except a single fragment when i mentioned thomas lord lytteltons vision the prediction of the time of his death and its exact fulfillment johnson it is the most extraordinary thing that has happened in my day i heard it with my own ears from his uncle lord westcote i am so glad to have every evidence of the spiritual world that i am willing to believe it dr adams you have evidence enough good evidence which needs not such support johnson i like to have more  mr henderson with whom i had sauntered in the venerable walks of mertoncollege and found him a very learned and pious man he supt with us dr johnson surprised him not a little by acknowledging with a look of horror that he was much oppressed by the fear of death the amiable dr adams suggested that god was infinitely good johnson that he is infinitely good as far as the perfection of his nature will allow i certainly believe but it is necessary for good upon the whole that individuals should be punished as to an individual therefore he is not infinitely good and as i cannot be sure that i have fulfilled the conditions on which salvation is granted i am afraid i may be one of those who shall be damned looking dismally dr adams what do you mean by damned johnson passionately and loudly sent to hell sir and punished everlastingly dr adams i dont believe that doctrine johnson hold sir do you believe that some will be punished at all dr adams being excluded from heaven will be a punishment yet there may be no great positive suffering johnson well sir but if you admit any degree of punishment there is an end of your argument for infinite goodness simply considered for infinite goodness would inflict no punishment whatever there is not infinite goodness physically considered morally there is boswell but may not a man attain to such a degree of hope as not to be uneasy from the fear o death johnson a man may have such a degree of hope as to kee him quiet you see i am not quiet from the vehemence with which i  but i do not despair mrs adams you seem sir to forget the m of our redeemer johnson madam i do not forget the merits of  redeemer but my redeemer has said that he will set some on his  hand and some on his left  he was in gloomy agitation and said  have no more on it if what has now been stated should be urged  he enemies of christianity as if its influence on the mind were not bant let it be remembered that johnsons temperament was melancholy  which such direful apprehensions of futurity are often a common effec we shall presently see that when he approached nearer to his aweful chan his mind became tranquil and he exhibited as much fortitude as becom  thinking man in that situation  from the subject of death we passed to discourse of life whether it was upon the whole more happy or miserable johnson was decidedly for the balance of misery in confirmation of which i maintained that no man would choose to lead over again the life which he had experienced johnson acceded to that opinion in the strongest terms this is an inquiry often made and its being a subject of disquisition is a proof that much misery presses upon human feelings for those who are conscious of a felicity of existence would never hesitate to accept of a repetition of it i have met with very few who would i have heard mr burke make use of a very ingenious and plausible argument on this subject every man said he would lead his life over again for every man is willing to go on and take an addition to his life which as he grows older he has no reason to think will be better or even so good as what has preceded i imagine however the truth is that there is a deceitful hope that the next part of life will be free from the pains and anxieties and sorrows which we have already felt we are for wise purposes condemned to hopes delusive mine as johnson finely says and i may also quote the celebrated lines of dryden equally philosophical and poetical  when i consider life it is all a cheat yet fooled with hope men favor the deceit trust on and think tomorrow will repay tomorrows falser than the former day lies worse and while it says we shall be blessed with some new joys cuts off what we possessed strange cozenage none would live past years again yet all hope pleasure in what yet remain and from the dregs of life think to receive what the first sprightly running could not give aurtngzfbe  it was observed to dr johnson that it seemed strange that he who has so often delighted his company by his lively and brilliant conversation should say he was miserable johnson alas it is all outside i may be cracking my joke and cursing the sun sun how i hate thy beams i knew not well what to think of this declaration whether to hold it as a genuine picture of his mind yet there is no doubt that a man may appear very gay in company who is sad at heart his merriment is like the sound of drums and trumpets in a battle to drown the groans of the wounded and dying  or as the effect of his persuading himself contrary to fact that the position which he had assumed as to human unhappiness was true we may apply to him a sentence in mr grevilles maxims characters and reflections page      a book which is entitled to much more praise than it has received aristarchus is charming how full of knowledge of sense of sentiment you get him with difficulty to your supper and after having delighted every body and himself for a few hours he is obliged to return home  he is finishing his treatise to prove that unhappiness is the portion of man  on sunday june    our philosopher was calm at breakfast there was something exceedingly pleasing in our leading a college life without restraint and with superior elegance in consequence of our living in the masters house and having the company of ladies mrs kennicot related in his presence a lively saying of dr johnson to miss hannah more who had expressed a wonder that the poet who had written paradise lost should write such poor sonnets  milton madam was a genius that could cut a colossus from a rock but could not carve heads upon cherrystones  we talked of the casuistical question whether it was allowable at any time to depart from truth johnson the general rule is that truth should never be violated because it is of the utmost importance to the comfort of life that we should have a full security by mutual faith and occasional inconveniences should be willingly suffered that we may preserve it there must however be some exceptions if for instance a murderer should ask you which way a man is gone you may tell him what is not true because you are under a previous obligation not to betray a man to a murderer boswell supposing the person who wrote junius were asked whether he was the author might he deny it johnson i dont know what to say to this if you were sure that he wrote junius would you if he denied it think as well of him afterward yet it may be urged that what a man has no right to ask you may refuse to communicate and there is no other effectual mode of preserving a secret and an important secret the discovery of which may be very hurtful to you but a flat denial for if you are silent or hesitate or evade it will be held equivalent to a confession but stay sir here is another case supposing the author had told me confidentially that he had written junius and i were asked if he had i should hold myself at liberty to deny it as being under a previous promise express or implied to conceal it now what i ought to do for the author may i not do for myself but i deny the lawfulness of telling a lie to a sick man for fear of alarming him you have no business with consequences you are to tell the truth besides you are not sure what effect your telling him that he is in danger may have it may bring his distemper to a crisis and that may cure him of all lying i have the greatest abhorrence at this because i believe it has been frequently practiced on myself  i cannot help thinking that there is much weight in the opinion of those who have held that truth as an eternal and immutable principle ought upon no account whatever to be violated from supposed previous or superior obligations of which every man being the judge for himself there is great danger that we may too often from partial motives persuade ourselves that they exist and probably whatever extraordinary instances may sometimes occur where some evil may be prevented by violating this noble principle it would be found that human happiness would upon the whole be more perfect were truth universally preserved  in the notes to the dunciad we find the following elegant and patheticl verses addressed to pope the annotater calls them amiable verses   while malice pope denies thy page its own celestial fire while critics and while bards in rage admiring will not admire while wayward pens thy worth assail and envious tongues decry these times though many a friend bewail these times bewail not i but when the worlds loud praise is thine and spleen no more shall blame when with thy homer thou shall shine in one established fame when none shall rail and every lay devote a wreath to thee that day for come it will that day shall i lament to see it is surely not a little remarkable that they should appear without a name miss seward knowing dr johnsons almost universal and minute literary information signified a desire that i should ask him who was the author he was prompt with his answer  why sir they were written by one lewis an undermaster or usher of westminster school who published a miscellany in which grongar hill first came out johnson praised them highly and repeated them with a noble animation in the twelfth line instead of one established fame he repeated one unclouded flame which he thought was the reading in former editions but i believe was a flash of his own genius it is much more poetical than the other  on monday    and tuesday june    dr johnson and i dined on one of them i forget which with mr mickle translator of the lusiad at wheatley a very pretty country place a few miles from oxford and on the other with dr wetherell master of universitycollege from dr wetherells he went to visit mr sackville parker the bookseller and when he returned to us gave the following account of his visit saying i have been to see my old friend sack parker i find he has married his maid he has done right she had lived with him many years in great confidence and they had mingled minds i do not think he could have found any wife that would have made him so happy the woman was very attentive and civil to me she pressed me to fix a day for dining with them and to say what i liked and she would be sure to get it for me poor sack he is very ill indeed we parted as never to meet again it has quite broke me down this pathetick narrative was strangely diversified with the grave and earnest defense of a mans having married his maid i could not but feel it as in some degree ludicrous  in the morning of tuesday june    while we sat at dr adamss we talked of a printed letter from the reverend herbert croft to a young gentleman who had been his pupil in which he advised him to read to the end of whatever books he should begin to read johnson this is surely a strange advice you may as well resolve that whatever men you happen to get acquainted with you are to keep to them for life a book may be good for nothing or there may be only one thing in it worth knowing are we to read it all through these voyages pointing to the three large volumes of voyages to the south sea which were just come out who will read them through a man had better work his way before the mast than read them through they will be eaten by rats and mice before they are read through there can be little entertainment in such books one set of savages is like another boswell i do not think the people of otaheite can be reckoned savages johnson dont cant in defense of savages boswell they have the art of navigation johnson a dog or a cat can swim boswell they carve very ingeniously johnson a cat can scratch and a child with a nail can scratch i perceived this was none of the mollia tempora fandi so desisted  upon his mentioning that when he came to college he wrote his first exercise twice over but never did so afterward miss adams i suppose sir you could not make them better johnson yes madam to be sure i could make them better thought is better than no thought miss adams do you think sir you could make your ramblers better johnson certainly i could boswell i will lay a bet sir you cannot johnson but i will sir if i choose i shall make the best of them you shall pick out better boswell but you may add to them i will not allow of that johnson nay sir there are three ways of making them better  putting out  adding  or correcting  during our visit at oxford the following conversation passed between him and me on the subject of my trying my fortune at the english bar having asked whether a very extensive acquaintance in london which was very valuable and of great advantage to a man at large might not be prejudicial to a lawyer by preventing him from giving sufficient attention to business johnson sir you will attend to business as business lays hold of you when not actually employed you may see your friends as much as you do now you may dine at a club every day and sup with one of the members every night and you may be as much at public places as one who has seen them all would wish to be but you must take care to attend constantly in westminster hall both to mind your business as it is almost all learnt there for nobody reads now and to show that you want to have business and you must not be too often seen at public places that competitors may not have it to say he is always at the playhouse or at ranelagh and never to be found at his chambers and sir there must be a kind of solemnity in the manner of a professional man i have nothing particular to say to you on the subject all this i should say to any one i should have said it to lord thurlow twenty years ago  the profession may probably think this representation of what is required in a barrister who would hope for success to be by much too indulgent but certain it is that as the wits of charles found easier ways to fame some of the lawyers of this age who have risen high have by no means thought it absolutely necessary to submit to that long and painful course of study which a plowden a coke a hale considered as requisite my respected friend mr langton has shown me in the handwriting of his grandfather a curious account of a conversation which he had with lord chief justice hale in which that great man tells him that for two years after he came to the inn of court he studied sixteen hours a day however his lordship added that by this intense application he almost brought himself to his grave though he were of a very strong constitution and after reduced himself to eight hours but that he would not advise any body to so much that he thought six hours a day with attention and constancy was sufficient that a man must use his body as he would his horse and his stomach not tire him at once but rise with an appetite  on wednesday june    dr johnson and i returned to london he was not well today and said very little employing himself chiefly in reading euripides he expressed some displeasure at me for not observing sufficiently the various objects upon the road if i had your eyes sir said he i should count the passengers it was wonderful how accurate his observations of visual objects was notwithstanding his imperfect eyesight owing to a habit of attention that he was much satisfied with the respect paid to him at dr adamss is thus attested by himself i returned last night from oxford after a fortnights abode with dr adams who treated me as well as i could expect or wish and he that contents a sick man a man whom it is impossible to please has surely done his part well letters to mr thrale vol ii page       after his return to london from this excursion i saw him frequently but have few memorandums i shall therefore here insert some particulars which i collected at various times having unexpectedly by the favor of mr stone of londonfield hackney seen the original in johnsons handwriting of the petition of the city of london to his majesty in favor of dr dodd i now present it to my readers with such passages as were omitted enclosed in crotchets and the additions or variations marked in italicks  that william dodd doctor of laws now lying under sentence of death in your majestys gaol of newgate for the crime of forgery has for a great part of his life set an useful and laudable example of diligence in his calling and as we have reason to believe has exercised his ministry with great fidelity and efficacy which in many instances has produced the most happy effect  that he has been the first institutor or and a very earnest and active promoter of several modes of useful charity and that therefore he may be considered as having been on many occasions a benefactor to the public  that when they consider his past life they are willing to suppose his late crime to have been not the consequence of habitual depravity but the suggestion of some sudden and violent temptation  that your petitioners therefore considering his ease as in some of its circumstances unprocedented and peculiar and encouraged by your majestys known clemency they most humbly recommend the said william dodd to his your majestys most gracious consideration in hope that he will be found not altogether unsit unworthy to stand an example of royal mercy     the reverend mr astle of ashbourne in derbyshire brother to the learned and ingenious thomas aftle esquire was from his early years known to dr johnson who obligingly advised him as to his studies and recommended to him the following books of which a list which he has been pleased to communicate lies before me in johnsons own handwriting  universal history ancient  rollins ancient history  puffendorfs introduction to history  vertots history of knights of malta  vertots revolution of portugal  vertots revolutions of sweden  cartes history of england  present state of england  geographical grammar  prideauxs connection  nelsons feasts and fasts  duty of man  gentlemans religion  clarendons history  wattss improvement of the mind  wattss logic  nature displayed  lowths english grammar  blackwal on the classicks  sherlocks sermons  burnets life of hale  dupins history of the church  shuckfords connections  laws serious call  waltons complete angler  sandyss travels  sprats history of the royal society  englands gazetteer  goldsmiths roman history  some commentaries on the bible  it having been mentioned to dr johnson that a gentleman who had a son whom he imagined to have an extreme degree of timidity resolved to send him to a public school that he might acquire confidence sir said johnson this is a preposterous expedient for removing his infirmity such a disposition should be cultivated in the shade placing him at a public school is forcing an owl upon day  speaking of a gentleman whose house was much frequented by low company rags sir said he will always make their appearance where they have a right to do it  of the same gentlemans mode of living he said sir the servants instead of doing what they are bid stand round the table in idle clusters gaping upon the guests and seem as unfit to attend a company as to steer a man of war  a dull country magistrate gave johnson a long tedious account of his exercising his criminal jurisdiction the result of which was his having sentenced four convicts to transportation johnson in an agony of impatience to get rid of such a companion exclaimed i heartily wish sir that i were a fifth  johnson was present when a tragedy was read in which there occurred this line who rules over freemen should himself be free the company having admired it much i cannot agree with you said johnson it might as well be said who drives fat oxen should himself be fat   he was pleased with the kindness of mr cator who was joined with him in mr thrales important trust and thus describes him letters to mrs thrale vol ii p      there is much good in his character and much usefulness in his knowledge he found a cordial solace at that gentlemans seat of beckenham in kent which is indeed one of the finest places at which i ever was a guest  johnson seldom encouraged general censure of any profession but he was willing to allow a due share of merit to the various departments necessary in civilized life in a splenetick sarcastical or jocular frame however he would sometimes utter a pointed saying of that nature one instance has been mentioned see vol i p      where he gave a sudden satirical stroke to the character of an attorney the too indiscriminate admission to that employment which requires both abilities and integrity has given rise to injurious reflections which are totally inapplicable to many very respectable men who exercise it with reputation and honor  johnson having argued for some time with a pertinacious gentleman his opponent who had talked in a very puzzling manner happened to say i dont understand you sir upon which johnson observed sir i have found you an argument but i am not obliged to find you an understanding  talking to me of horry walpole as the honorable horace walpole is often called johnson allowed that he got together a great many curious little things and told them in an elegant manner mr walpole thought johnson a more amiable character after reading his letters to mrs thrale but never was one of the true admirers of that great man we may suppose a prejudice conceived if he ever heard johnsons account to sir george staunton that when he made the speeches in parliament for the gentlemans magazine he always took care to put sir robert walpole in the wrong and to say every thing he could against the electorate of hanover the celebrated heroic epistle in which johnson is satyrically introduced has been ascribed both to mr walpole and mr mason one day at mr courtenays when a gentleman expressed his opinion that there was more energy in that poem than could be expected from mr walpole mr warton the late laureat observed it may have been written by walpole and buckramd by mason  he disapproved of lord hailes for having modernised the language of the evermemorable john hales of eton in an edition which his lordship published of that writers works an authors language sir said he is a characteristical part of his composition and is also characteristical of the age in which he writes besides sir when the language is changed we are not sure that the sense is the same no sir i am sorry lord hailes has done this  here it may be observed that his frequent use of the expression no sir was not always to intimate contradiction for he would say so when he was about to enforce an affirmative proposition which had not been denied as in the instance last mentioned i used to consider it as a kind of flag of defiance as if he had said any argument you may offer against this is not just no sir it is not it was like falstaffs i deny your major  sir joshua reynolds having said that he took the altitude of a mans taste by his stories and his wit and of his understanding by the remarks which he repeated being always sure that he must be a weak man who quotes common things with an emphasis as if they were oracles johnson agreed with him and sir joshua having also observed that the real character of a man was found out by his amusements  johnson yes sir no man is a hypocrite in his pleasures  had johnson treated at large de claris oratoribus he might have given us an admirable work when the duke of bedford attacked the ministry as vehemently as he could for having taken upon them to extend the time for the importation of corn lord chatham in his first speech in the house of lords boldly avowed himself to be an adviser of that measure my colleagues said he as i was confined by indisposition did me the signal honor of coming to the bedside of a sick man to ask his opinion but had they not thus condescended i should have taken up my bed and walked in order to have delivered that opinion at the council board mr langton who was present mentioned this to johnson who observed now sir we see that he took these words as he found them without considering that though the expression in scripture take up thy bed and walk strictly suited the instance of the sick man restored to health and strength who would of course be supposed to carry his bed with him it could not be proper in the case of a man who was lying in a state of feebleness and who certainly would not add to the difficulty of moving at all that of carrying his bed  when i pointed out to him in the newspaper one of mr grattans animated and glowing speeches in favor of the freedom of ireland in which this expression occurred i know not if accurately taken we will persevere till there is not one link of the english chain left to clank upon the rags of the meanest beggar in ireland  nay sir said johnson dont you perceive that one link cannot clank  mrs thrale has published anecdotes p     as johnsons a kind of parody or counterpart of a fine poetical passage in one of mr burkes speeches on american taxation it is vigorously but somewhat coarsely executed and i am inclined to suppose is not quite correctly exhibited i hope he did not use the words  vile agents for the americans in the house of parliament and if he did so in an extempore effusion i wish the lady had not committed it to writing  mr burke uniformly showed johnson the greatest respect and when mr townshend now lord sydney at a period when he was conspicuous in opposition threw out some reflection in parliament upon the grant of a pension to a man of such political principles as johnson mr burke though then of the same party with mr townshend stood warmly forth in defense of his friend to whom he justly observed the pension was granted solely on account of his eminent literary merit i am well assured that mr townshends attack upon johnson was the occasion of his hitching in a rhyme for that in the original copy of goldsmiths character of mr burke in his retaliation another persons name stood in the couplet where mr townshend is now introduced though fraught with all learning kept straining his throat to persuade tommy townshend to lend him a vote   it may be worth remarking among the minutiae of my collection that johnson was once drawn for the militia the trained bands of the city of london and that mr rackstrow of the museum in fleet street was his colonel it may be believed he did not serve in person but the idea with all its circumstances is certainly laughable he upon that occasion provided himself with a musket and with a sword and belt which i have seen hanging in his closet  he was very constant to those whom he once employed if they gave him no reason to be displeased when somebody talked of being imposed on in the purchase of tea and sugar and such articles that will not be the case said he if you go to a stately shop as i always do in such a shop it is not worth their while to take a petty advantage  an author of most anxious and restless vanity being mentioned sir said he there is not a young sapling upon parnassus more severely blown about by every wind of criticism than that poor fellow  the difference he observed between a wellbred and an illbred man is this one immediately attracts your liking the other your aversion you love the one till you find reason to hate him you hate the other till you find reason to love him  the wife of one of his acquaintance had fraudulently made a purse to herself out of her husbands fortune feeling a proper compunction in her last moments she confessed how much she had secreted but before she could tell where it was placed she was seized with a convulsive fit and expired her husband said he was more hurt by her want of confidence in him than by the loss of his money i told him said johnson that he should console himself for perhaps the money might be found and he was sure that his wife was gone  a foppish physician imagined that johnson had animadverted on his wearing a fine coat and mentioned it to him i did not notice you was his answer the physician still insisted sir said johnson had you been dipped in pactolus i should not have noticed you  he seemed to take a pleasure in speaking in his own style for when he had carelessly missed it he would repeat the thought translated into it talking of the comedy of the rehearsal he said it has not wit enough to keep it sweet this was easy  he therefore caught himself and pronounced a more rounded sentence it has not vitality enough to preserve it from putrefaction  he censured a writer of entertaining travels for assuming a feigned character saying in his sense of the word he carries out one lie we know not how many he brings back  though he had no taste for painting he admired much the manner in which sir joshua reynolds treated of his art in his discourses to the royal academy he observed of a passage one day i think i might as well have said this myself and once when mr langton was sitting by him he read one of them very eagerly and expressed himself thus very well master reynolds very well indeed but it will not be understood  no man was more ready to make an apology when he had censured unjustly than johnson when a proofsheet of one of his works was brought to him he found fault with the mode in which a part of it was arranged refused to read it and in a passion desired that the compositor compositor in the art of printing means the person who adjusts the types in the order in which they are to stand for printing one who arranges what is called the  from which an impression is taken might be sent to him the compositor was mr manning a decent sensible man who had composed about one half of his dictionary when in mr strahans printing house and a great part of his lives of the poets when in mr nicholss printing house and now in his seventyseventh year when in mr baldwins printing house has composed a part of this work concerning him by producing the manuscript he at once satisfied dr johnson that he was not to blame upon which johnson heartily and earnestly said to him mr compositor i ask your pardon mr compositor i ask your pardon again and again  his generous humanity to the miserable was almost beyond example the following instance is well attested coming home late one night he found a poor woman lying in the street so much exhausted that she could not walk he took her upon his back and carried her to his house where he discovered that she was one of those wretched females who had sallen into the lowest state of vice poverty and disease instead of harshly upbraiding her he had her taken care of with all tenderness for a long time at a considerable expense till she was restored to health and endeavored to put her into a virtuous way of living this circumstance therefore alluded to in mr courtenays poetical character of him is strictly true   he thought mr caleb whitefoord singularly happy in hitting on the signature of papyrius cursor to his ingenious and diverting crossreadings of the newspapers it being a real name of an ancient roman and clearly expressive of the thing done in this lively conceit  he once in his life was known to have uttered what is called a bull sir joshua reynolds when they were riding together in devonshire complained that he had a very bad horse for that even when going down hill he moved slowly step by step ay said johnson and when he goes up hill he stands still  he had a great aversion to gesticulating in company he called once to a gentleman who offended him in that point dont attitudenise and when another gentleman thought he was giving additional force to what he uttered by expressive movements of his hands johnson fairly seized them and held them down  an author of considerable eminence having engrossed a good share of the conversation in the company of johnson and having said nothing but what was very trifling and insignificant johnson when he was gone observed to us it is wonderful what a difference there sometimes is between a mans powers of writing and of talking  writes with great spirit but is a poor talker had he held his tongue we might have supposed him to have been restrained by modesty but he has spoken a great deal today and you have heard what stuff it was  a gentleman having said that a conge delire has not perhaps the force of a command but may be considered only as a strong recommendation sir replied johnson who overheard him it is such a recommendation as if i should throw you out of a twopairofstairs window and recommend to you to fall soft this has been printed in other publications fall to the ground but johnson himself gave me the true expression which he had used as above meaning that the recommendation left as little choice in the one case as the other   mr steevens who passed many a social hour with him during their long acquaintance which commenced when they both lived in the temple has preserved a good number of particulars concerning him most of which are to be found in the department of apothegms etc in the collection of johnsons works but he has been pleased to favor me with the following which are original  one evening previous to the trial of baretti a consultation of his friends was held at the house of mr cox the solicitor in southamptonbuildings chancery lane among others present were mr burke and dr johnson who differed in sentiments concerning the tendency of some part of the defense the prisoner was to make when the meeting was over mr steevens observed that the question between him and his friend had been agitated with rather too much warmth it may be so sir replied the doctor for burke and i should have been of one opinion if we had had no audience  dr johnson once assumed a character in which perhaps even mr boswell never saw him his curiosity having been excited by the praises bestowed on the celebrated torres fireworks at marybonegardens he desired mr steevens to accompany him thither the evening had proved showery and soon after the few people present were assembled public notice was given that the conductors to the wheels suns stars etc were so thoroughly watersoaked that it was impossible any part of the exhibition should be made this is a mere excuse says the doctor to save their crackers for a more profitable company let us but hold up our sticks and threaten to break those colored lamps that surround the orchestra and we shall soon have our wishes gratified the core of the fireworks cannot be injured let the different pieces be touched in their respective centers and they will do their offices as well as ever  some young men who overheard him immediately began the violence he had recommended and an attempt was speedily made to fire some of the wheels which appeared to have received the smallest damage but to little purpose were they lighted for most of them completely failed  the author of the rambler however may be considered on this occasion as the ringleader of a successful riot though not as a skilful pyrotechnist  it has been supposed that dr johnson so far as fashion was concerned was careless of his appearance in public but this is not altogether true as the following slight instance may show  goldsmiths last comedy was to be represented during some courtmourning and mr steevens appointed to call on dr johnson and carry him to the tavern where he was to dine with others of the poets friends the doctor was ready dressed but in colored clothes yet being told that he would find every one else in black received the intelligence with a profusion of thanks hastened to change his attire all the while repeating his gratitude for the information that had saved him from an appearance so improper in the front row of a front box i would not added he for ten pounds have seemed so retrograde to any general observance  he would sometimes found his dislikes on very slender circumstances happening one day to mention mr flexman a dissenting minister with some compliment to his exact memory in chronological matters the doctor replied let me hear no more of him sir that is the fellow who made the index to my ramblers and set down the name of milton thus  milton mr john  mr steevens adds this testimony it is unfortunate however for johnson that his particularities and frailties can be more distinctly traced than his good and amiable exertions could the many bounties he studiously concealed the many acts of humanity he performed in private be displayed with equal circumstantiality his defects would be so far lost in the blaze of his virtues that the latter only would be regarded  though from my very great admiration of johnson i have wondered that he was not courted by all the great and all the eminent persons of his time it ought fairly to be considered that no man of humble birth who lived entirely by literature in short no author by profession ever rose in this country into that personal notice which he did in the course of this work a numerous variety of names have been mentioned to which many might be added i cannot omit lord and lady lucan at whose house he often enjoyed all that an elegant table and the best company can contribute to happiness he found hospitality united with extraordinary accomplishments and embellished with charms of which no man could be insensible  on tuesday june    i dined with him at the literary club the last time of his being in that respectable society the other members present were the bishop of st asaph lord eliot lord palmerston dr fordyce and mr malone he looked ill but had such a manly fortitude that he did not trouble the company with melancholy complaints they all showed evident marks of kind concern about him with which he was much pleased and he exerted himself to be as entertaining as his indisposition allowed him  the anxiety of his friends to preserve so estimable a life as long as human means might be supposed to have influence made them plan for him a retreat from the severity of a british winter to the mild climate of italy this scheme was at last brought to a serious resolution at general paolis where i had often talked of it one essential matter however i understood was necessary to be previously settled which was obtaining such an addition to his income as would be sufficient to enable him to defray the expense in a manner becoming the first literary character of a great nation and independent of all his other merits the author of the dictionary of the english language the person to whom i above all others thought i should apply to negotiate this business was the lord chancellor edward lord thurlow  because i knew that he highly valued johnson and that johnson highly valued his lordship so that it was no degradation of my illustrious friend to solicit for him the favor of such a man i have mentioned what johnson said of him to me when he was at the bar page     of this volume  and after his lordship was advanced to the seals he said of him i would prepare myself for no man in england but lord thurlow when i am to meet with him i should wish to know a day before how he would have prepared himself i cannot conjecture would he have selected certain topics and considered them in every view so as to be in readiness to argue them at all points and what may we suppose those ropicks to have been i once started the curious enquiry to the great man who was the subject of this compliment he smiled but did not pursue it  i first consulted with sir joshua reynolds who perfectly coincided in opinion with me and i therefore though personally very little known to his lordship wrote to him it is strange that sir john hawkins should have related that the application was made by sir joshua reynolds when he could so easily have been informed of the truth by inquiring of sir joshua sir johns carelessness to ascertain facts is very remarkable  stating the case and requesting his good offices for dr johnson i mentioned that i was obliged to set out for scotland early in the week after so that if his lordship should have any commands for me as to this pious negotiation he would be pleased to send them before that time otherwise sir joshua reynolds would give all attention to it  this application was made not only without any suggestion on the part of johnson himself but was utterly unknown to him nor had he the smallest suspicion of it any insinuations therefore which since his death have been thrown out as if he had stooped to ask what was superfluous are without any foundation but had he asked it it would not have been superfluous for though the money he had saved proved to be more than his friends imagined or than i believe he himself in his carelessness concerning worldly matters knew it to be had he traveled upon the continent an augmentation of his income would by no means have been unnecessary  on wednesday june    i visited him in the forenoon after having been present at the shocking sight of fifteen men executed before newgate i said to him i was sure that human life was not machinery that is to say a chain of fatality planned and directed by the supreme being as it had in it so much wickedness and misery so many instances of both as that by which my mind was now clouded were it machinery it would be better than it is in these respects though less noble as not being a system of moral government he agreed with me now as he always did upon the great question of the liberty of the human will which has been in all ages perplexed with so much sophistry but sir as to the doctrine of necessity no man believes it if a man should give me arguments that i do not see though i could not answer them should i believe that i do not see it will be observed that johnson at all times made the just distinction between doctrines contrary to reason and doctrines above reason  talking of the religious discipline proper for unhappy convicts he said sir one of our regular clergy will probably not impress their minds sufficiently they should be attended by a methodist preacher or a popish priest let me however observe in justice to the reverend mr vilette who has been ordinary of newgate for no less than seventeen years in the course of which he has attended many hundreds of wretched criminals that his earnest and humane exhortations have been very effectual his extraordinary diligence is highly praiseworthy and merits a distinguished reward  on thursday june    i dined with him at mr dillys where were the reverend mr knox master of tunbridgeschool mr smith vicar of southill dr beattie mr pinkerton author of various literary performances and the reverend dr mayo at my desire old mr sheridan was invited as i was earnest to have johnson and him brought together again by chance that a reconciliation might be effected mr sheridan happened to come early and having learnt that dr johnson was to be there went away so i found with sincere regret that my friendly intentions were hopeless i recollect nothing that passed this day except johnsons quickness who when dr beattie observed as something remarkable which had happened to him that he had chanced to see both no   and no  000 of the hackneycoaches the first and the last why sir said he there is an equal chance for ones seeing those two numbers as any other two he was clearly right yet the seeing of the two extremes each of which is in some degree more conspicuous than the rest could not but strike one in a stronger manner than the sight of any other two numbers  though i have neglected to preserve his conversation it was perhaps at this interview that mr knox formed the notion of it which he has exhibited in his winter evenings  on friday june    i dined with him at general paolis where he says in one of his letters to mrs thrale i love to dine there were a variety of dishes much to his taste of all which he seemed to me to eat so much that i was afraid he might be hurt by it and i whispered to the general my fear and begged he might not press him alas said the general see how very ill he looks he can live but a very short time would you refuse any slight gratifications to a man under sentence of death there is a humane custom in italy by which persons in that melancholy situation are indulged with having whatever they like best to eat and drink even with expensive delicacies  i showed him some verses on lichfield by miss seward which i had that day received from her and had the pleasure to hear him approve of them he confirmed to me the truth of a high compliment which i had been told he had paid to that lady when she mentioned to him the colombiade an epick poem by madame du boccage  madam there is not in it any thing equal to your description of the sea round the north pole in your ode on the death of captain cook  on sunday june    i found him rather better i mentioned to him a young man who was going to jamaica with his wife and children in expectation of being provided for by two of her brothers settled in that island one a clergyman and the other a physician johnson it is a wild scheme sir unless he has a positive and deliberate invitation there was a poor girl who used to come about me who had a cousin in barbados that in a letter to her expressed a wish she would come out to that island and expatiated on the comforts and happiness of her situation the poor girl went out her cousin was much surprised and asked her how she could think of coming because said she you invited me  not in answered the cousin the letter then was produced i see it is true said she that i did invite you but i did not think you would come they lodged her in an outhouse where she passed her time miserably and as soon as she had an opportunity she returned to england always tell this when you hear of people going abroad to relations upon a notion of being well received in the case which you mention it is probable the clergyman spends all he gets and the physician does not know how much he is to get  we this day dined at sir joshua reynoldss with general paoli lord eliot formerly mr eliot of port eliot dr beattie and some more company talking of lord chesterfield  johnson his manner was exquisitely elegant and he had more knowledge than i expected boswell did you find sir his conversation to be of a superior style johnson sir in the conversation which i had with him i had the best right to superiority for it was upon philology and literature lord eliot who had traveled at the same time with mr stanhope lord chesterfields natural son justly observed that it was strange that a man who showed he had so much affection for his son as lord chesterfield did by writing so many long and anxious letters to him almost all of them when he was secretary of state which certainly was a proof of great goodness of disposition should endeavor to make his son a rascal his lordship told us that foot had intended to bring on the stage a father who had thus tutored his son and to show the son an honest man to every thing else but practicing his fathers maxims upon him and cheating him johnson i am much pleased with this design but i think there was no occasion to make the son honest at all no he should be a consummate rogue the contrast between honesty and knavery would be the stronger it should be contrived so that the father should be the only sufferer by the sons villainy and thus there would be poetical justice  he put lord eliot in mind of dr walter heart i know said he heart was your lordships tutor and he was also tutor to the peterborough family pray my lord do you recollect any particulars that he told you of lord peterborough he is a favorite of mine and is not enough known his character has been only ventilated in party pamphlets lord eliot said if dr johnson would be so good as to ask him any questions he would tell what he could recollect accordingly some things were mentioned but said his lordship the best account of lord peterborough that i have happened to meet with is captain carletons memoirs carleton was descended of an ancestor who had distinguished himself at the siege of derry he was an officer and what was rare at that time had some knowledge of engineering johnson said he had never heard of the book lord eliot had it at port eliot but after a good deal of enquiry procured a copy in london and sent it to johnson who told sir joshua reynolds that he was going to bed when it came but was so much pleased with it that he sat up till he had read it through and found in it such an air of truth that he could not doubt of its authenticity adding with a smile in allusion to lord eliots having recently been raised to the peerage i did not think a young lord could have mentioned to me a book in the english history that was not known to me  an addition to our company came after we went up to the drawing room dr johnson seemed to rise in spirits as his audience increased he said he wished that lord orfords pictures and sir ashton levers museum might be purchased by the public because both the money and the pictures and the curiosities would remain in the country whereas if they were sold into another kingdom the nation would indeed get some money but would lose the pictures and curiosities which it would be desirable we should have for improvement in taste and natural history the only question was that as the nation was much in want of money whether it would not be better to take a large price from a foreign state  he entered upon a curious discussion of the difference between intuition and sagacity one being immediate in its effect the other requiring a circuitous process one he observed was the eye of the mind the other the nose of the mind  a gentleman present took up the argument against him and maintained that no man ever thinks of the nose of the mind not adverting that though that figurative phrase seems strange to us as very unusual it is truly not more forced than hamlets in my minds eye horatio he persisted much too long and appeared to johnson as putting himself forward as his antagonist with too much presumption upon which he called to him in a loud tone what is it you are contending for if you be contending  and afterward imagining that the gentleman retorted upon him with a kind of smart drollery he said mr  it does not become you to talk so to me besides ridicule is not your talent you have there neither intuition nor sagacity  the gentleman protested that he had intended no improper freedom but had the greatest respect for dr johnson after a short pause during which we were somewhat uneasy  johnson give me your hand sir you were too tedious and i was too short mr  sir i am honored by your attention in any way johnson come sir let us have no more of it we offended one another by our contention let us not offend the company by our compliments  he now said he wished much to go to italy and that he dreaded passing the winter in england i said nothing but enjoyed a secret satisfaction in thinking that i had taken the most effectual measures to make such a scheme practicable  on monday june    i had the honor to receive from the lord chancellor the following letter to james boswell esquire sir i should have answered your letter immediately if being much engaged when i received it i had not put it in my pocket and forgot to open it till this morning  i am much obliged to you for the suggestion and i will adopt and press it as far as i can the best argument i am sure and i hope it is not likely to fail is dr johnsons merit  but it will be necessary if i should be so unfortunate as to miss seeing you to converse with sir joshua on the sum it will be proper to ask  in short upon the means of setting him out it would be a reflection on us all if such a man should perish for want of the means to take care of his health  yours etc thurlow     this letter gave me a very high satisfaction i next day went and showed it to sir joshua reynolds who was exceedingly pleased with it he thought that i should now communicate the negotiation to dr johnson who might afterward complain if the attention with which it had been honored should be too long concealed from him i intended to set out for scotland next morning but sir joshua cordially insisted that i should stay another day that johnson and i might dine with him that we three might talk of his italian tour and as sir joshua expressed himself have it all out i hastened to johnson and was told by him that he was rather better today boswell i am very anxious about you sir and particularly that you should go to italy for the winter which i believe is your own wish johnson it is sir boswell you have no objection i presume but the money it would require johnson why no sir upon which i gave him a particular account of what had been done and read to him the lord chancellors letter  he listened with much attention then warmly said this is taking prodigious pains about a man  o sir said i with most sincere affection your friends would do every thing for you he paused  grew more and more agitated  till tears started into his eyes and he exclaimed with fervent emotion god bless you all i was so affected that i also shed tears  after a short silence he renewed and extended his grateful benediction god bless you all for jesus christs sake we both remained for some time unable to speak  he rose suddenly and quitted the room quite melted in tenderness he staid but a short time till he had recovered his firmness soon after he returned i left him having first engaged him to dine at sir joshua reynoldss next day  i never was again under that roof which i had so long reverenced  on wednesday june  0 the friendly confidential dinner with sir joshua reynolds took place no other company being present had i known that this was the last time that i should enjoy in this world the conversation of a friend whom i so much respected and from whom i derived so much instruction and entertainment i should have been deeply affected when i now look back to it i am vexed that a single word should have been forgotten  both sir joshua and i were so sanguine in our expectations that we expatiated with confidence on the large provision which we were sure would be made for him conjecturing whether munificence would be displayed in one large donation or in an ample increase of his pension he himself catched so much of our enthusiasm as to allow himself to suppose it not impossible that our hopes might in one way or other be realised he said that he would rather have his pension doubled than a grant of a thousand pounds for said he though probably i may not live to receive as much as a thousand pounds a man would have the consciousness that he should pass the remainder of his life in splendor how long soever it might be considering what a moderate proportion an income of six hundred pounds a year bears to innumerable fortunes in this country it is worthy of remark that a man so truly great should think it splendor  as an instance of extraordinary liberality of friendship he told us that dr brocklesby had upon this occasion offered him a hundred a year for his life a grateful tear started into his eye as he spoke this in a faultering tone  sir joshua and i endeavored to flatter his imagination with agreeable prospects of happiness in italy nay said he i must not expect much of that when a man goes to italy merely to feel how he breathes the air he can enjoy very little  our conversation turned upon living in the country which johnson whose melancholy mind required the dissipation of quick successive variety had habituated himself to consider as a kind of mental imprisonment yet sir said i there are many people who are content to live in the country johnson sir it is in the intellectual world as in the physical world we are told by natural philosophers that a body is at rest in the place that is fit for it they who are content to live in the country are fit for the country  talking of various enjoyments i argued that a refinement of taste was a disadvantage as they who have attained to it must be seldomer pleased than those who have no nice discrimination and are therefore satisfied with every thing that comes in their way johnson nay sir that is a paltry notion endeavor to be as perfect as you can in every respect  i accompanied him in sir joshua reynoldss coach to the entry of boltcourt he asked me whether i would not go with him to his house i declined it from an apprehension that my spirits would sink we bade adieu to each other affectionately in the carriage when he had got down upon the footpavement he called out fare you well and without looking back sprung away with a kind of pathetick briskness if i may use that expression which seemed to indicate a struggle to conceal uneasiness and impressed me with a foreboding of our long long separation  i remained one day more in town to have the chance of talking over my negotiation with the lord chancellor but the multiplicity of his lordships important engagements did not allow of it so i left the management of the business in the hands of sir joshua reynolds  soon after this time dr johnson had the mortification of being informed by mrs thrale that what she supposed he never believed letters to mrs thrale vol ii page      was true namely that she was actually going to marry signor piozzi an italian musickmaster he endeavored to prevent it but in vain if she would publish the whole of the correspondence that passed between dr johnson and her on the subject we should have a full view of his real sentiments as it is our judgment must be biassed by that characteristick specimen which sir john hawkins has given us poor thrale i thought that either her virtue or her vice would have restrained her from such a marriage she is now become a subject for her enemies to exult over and for her friends if she has any left to forget or pity dr johnsons letter to sir john hawkins life p   0   it must be admitted that johnson derived a considerable portion of happiness from the comforts and elegancies which he enjoyed in mr thrales family but mrs thrale assures us he was indebted for these to her husband alone who certainly respected him sincerely her words are  veneration for his virtue reverence for his talents delight in his conversation and habitual endurance of a yoke my husband first put upon me and of which he contentedly bore his share for sixteen or seventeen years made me go on so long with anecdotes p     mr johnson but the perpetual confinement i will own to have been terrifying in the first years of our friendship and irksome in the last nor could i pretend to support it without help when my coadjutor was no more alas how different is this from the declarations which i have heard mrs thrale make in his lifetime without a single murmur against any peculiarities or against any one circumstance which attended their intimacy  as a sincere friend of the great man whose life i am writing i think it necessary to guard my readers against the mistaken notion of dr johnsons character which this ladys anecdotes of him suggest for from the very nature and form of her book it lends deception lighter wings to fly  let it be remembered says an eminent critic who has been pleased to furnish me with his remarks  that she has comprised in a small volume all that she could recollect of dr johnson in twenty years during which period doubtless some severe things were said by him and they who read the book in two hours naturally enough suppose that his whole conversation was of this complexion but the fact is i have been often in his company and never once heard him say a severe thing to any one and many others can attest the same when he did say a severe thing it was generally extorted by ignorance pretending to knowledge or by extreme vanity or affectation  two instances of inaccuracy adds he are peculiarly worthy of notice  it is said anecdotes p      that natural roughness of his manner so often mentioned would notwithstanding the regularity of his notions burst through them all from time to time and he once bade a very celebrated lady who praised him with too much zeal perhaps or perhaps too strong an emphasis which always offended him consider what her flattery was worth before she chocked him with it  now let the genuine anecdote be contrasted with this  the person thus represented as being harshly treated though a very celebrated lady was then just come to london from an obscure situation in the country at sir joshua reynoldss one evening she met dr johnson she very soon began to pay her court to him in the most fulsome strain spare me i beseech you dear madam was his reply she still laid it on pray madam let us have no more of this he rejoined not paying any attention to these warnings she continued still her eulogy at length provoked by this indelicate and vain obtrusion of compliment he exclaimed dearest lady consider with yourself what your flattery is worth before you bestow it so freely  how different does this story appear when accompanied with all these circumstances which really belong to it but which mrs thrale either did not know or has suppressed  she says anecdotes p  0   one gentleman however who dined at a noblemans house in his company and that of mr thrale to whom i was obliged for the anecdote was willing to enter the lists in defense of king williams character and having opposed and contradicted johnson two or three times petulantly enough the master of the house began to feel uneasy and expect disagreeable consequences to avoid which he said loud enough for the doctor to hear  our friend here has no meaning now in all this except just to relate at club tomorrow how he teized johnson at dinner today this is all to do himself honor  no upon my word replied the other i see no honor in it whatever you may do  well sir returned mr johnson sternly if you do not see the honor i am sure i feel the disgrace  this is all sophisticated mr thrale was not in the company though he might have related the story to mrs thrale a friend from whom i had the story was present and it was not at the house of a nobleman on the observation being made by the master of the house on a gentlemans contradicting johnson that he had talked for the honor etc the gentleman muttered in a low voice i see no honor in it and dr johnson said nothing so all the rest though bien trouvee is mere garnish  i have had occasion several times in the course of this work to point out the inccorrectness of mrs thrale as to particulars which consisted with my own knowledge but indeed she has in flippant terms enough expressed her disapprobation of that anxious desire of authenticity which prompts a person who is to record conversations to write them down at the moment ibid p     unquestionably if they are to be recorded at all the sooner it is done the better this lady herself says ibid p     to recollect however and to repeat the sayings of dr johnson is almost all that can be done by the writers of his life as his life at least since my acquaintance with him consisted in little else than talking when he was not employed in some serious piece of work she boasts of her having kept a commonplace book and we find she noted at one time or other in a very lively manner specimens of the conversation of dr johnson and of those who talked with him but had she done it recently they probably would have been less erroneous and we should have been relieved from those disagreeable doubts of their authenticity with which we must now peruse them  she says of him anecdotes p     he was the most charitable of mortals without being what we call an active friend admirable at giving counsel no man saw his way so clearly but he would not stir a finger for the assistance of those to whom he was willing enough to give advice and again on the same page if you wanted a slight favor you must apply to people of other dispositions for not a step would johnson move to obtain a man a vote in a society to repay a compliment which might be useful or pleasing to write a letter of request etc or to obtain a hundred pounds a year more for a friend who perhaps had already two or three no force could urge him to diligence no importunity could conquer his resolution to stand still  it is amazing that one who had such opportunities of knowing dr johnson should appear so little acquainted with his real character i am sorry this lady does not advert that she herself contradicts the assertion of his being obstinately defective in the petite morale in the little endearing charities of social life in conferring smaller favors for she says ibid p      dr johnson was liberal enough in granting literary assistance to others i think and innumerable are the prefaces sermons lectures and dedications which he used to make for people who begged of him i am certain that a more active friend has rarely been found in any age this work which i fondly hope will rescue his memory from obloquy contains a thousand instances of his benevolent exertions in almost every way that can be conceived and particularly in employing his pen with a generous readiness for those to whom its aid could be useful indeed his obliging activity in doing little offices of kindness both by letters and personal application was one of the most remarkable features in his character and for the truth of this i can appeal to a number of his respectable friends sir joshua reynolds mr langton mr hamilton mr burke mr windham mr malone the bishop of dromore sir william scott sir robert chambers  and can mrs thrale forget the advertisements which he wrote for her husband at the time of his election contest the epitaphs on him and her mother the playful and even trifling verses for the amusement of her and her daughters his corresponding with her children and entering into their minute concerns which shows him in the most amiable light  she relates anecdotes p      that mr ch  lm  ley unexpectedly rode up to mr thrales carriage in which mr thrale and she and dr johnson were traveling that he paid them all his proper compliments but observing that dr johnson who was reading did not see him tapt him gently on the shoulder it is mr ch  lm  ley says my husband well sir  and what if it is mr ch  lm  ley says the other sternly just lifting his eyes a moment from his book and returning to it again with renewed avidity this surely conveys a notion of johnson as if he had been grossly rude to mr cholmondeley a gentleman whom he always loved and esteemed if therefore there was an absolute necessity for mentioning the story at all it might have been thought that her tenderness for dr johnsons character would have disposed her to state any thing that could soften it why then is there a total silence as to what mr cholmondeley told her  that johnson who had known him from his earliest years having been made sensible of what had doubtless a strange appearance took occasion when he afterward met him to make a very courteous and kind apology there is another little circumstance which i cannot but remark her book was published in      she had then in her possession a letter from dr johnson dated in      letters to mrs thrale vol ii p     which begins thus cholmondeleys story shocks me if it be true which i can hardly think for i am utterly unconscious of it i am very sorry and very much ashamed why then publish the anecdote or if she did why not add the circumstances with which she was well acquainted  in his social intercourse she thus describes him anecdotes p     ever musing till he was called out to converse and conversing till the fatigue of his friends or the promptitude of his own temper to take offense consigned him back again to silent meditation yet in the same book ibid p  0  she tells us he was however seldom inclined to be silent when any moral or literary question was started and it was on such occasions that like the sage in rasselas he spoke and attention watched his lips he reasoned and conviction closed his periods his conversation indeed was so far from ever fatiguing his friends that they regretted when it was interrupted or ceased and could exclaim in miltons language with thee conversing i forget all time   i certainly then do not claim too much in behalf of my illustrious friend in saying that however smart and entertaining mrs thrales anecdotes are they must not be held as good evidence against him for wherever an instance of harshness and severity is told i beg leave to doubt its perfect authenticity for though there may have been some foundation for it yet like that of his reproof to the very celebrated lady it may be so exhibited in the narration as to be very unlike the real fact  the evident tendency of the following anecdote anecdotes p    is to represent dr johnson very deficient in affection tenderness or even common civility when i one day lamented the loss of a first cousin killed in america  prythee my dear said he have done with canting how would the world be the worse for it i may ask if all your relations were at once spitted like larks and roasted for prestos supper  presto was the dog that lay under the table while we talked i suspect this too of exaggeration and distortion i allow that he made her an angry speech but let the circumstances fairly appear as told by mr baretti who was present  mrs thrale while supping very heartily upon larks laid down her knife and fork and abruptly exclaimed o my dear mr johnson do you know what has happened the last letters from abroad have brought us an account that our poor cousins head was taken off by a cannonball johnson who was shocked both at the fact and her light unfeeling manner of mentioning it replied madam it would give you very little concern if all your relations were spitted like those larks and dressed for prestos supper upon mentioning this to my friend mr wilkes he with his usual readiness pleasantly matched it with the following sentimental anecdote he was invited by a young man of fashion at paris to sup with him and a lady who had been for some time his mistress but with whom he was going to part he said to mr wilkes that he really felt very much for her she was in such distress and that he meant to make her a present of two hundred louisdors mr wilkes observed the behavior of mademoiselle who sighed indeed very piteously and assumed every pathetick air of grief but eat no less than three french pigeons which are as large as english partridges besides other things mr wilkes whispered the gentleman we often say in england excessive sorrow is exceeding dry but i never heard excessive sorrow is exceeding hungry perhaps one hundred will do the gentleman took the hint   it is with concern that i find myself obliged to animadvert on the inaccuracies of mrs piozzis anecdotes and perhaps i may be thought to have dwelt too long upon her little collection but as from johnsons long residence under mr thrales roof and his intimacy with her the account which she has given of him may have made an unfavourable and unjust impression my duty as a faithful biographer has obliged me reluctantly to perform this unpleasing task  having left the pious negotiation as i called it in the best hands i shall here insert what relates to it johnson wrote to sir joshua reynolds on july   as follows i am going i hope in a few days to try the air of derbyshire but hope to see you before i go let me however mention to you what i have much at heart  if the chancellor should continue his attention to mr boswells request and confer with you on the means of relieving my languid state i am very desirous to avoid the appearance of asking money upon false pretenses i desire you to represent to his lordship what as soon as it is suggested he will perceive to be reasonable  that if i grow much worse i shall be afraid to leave my physicians to suffer the inconveniences of travel and pine in the solitude of a foreign country  that if i grow much better of which indeed there is now little appearance i shall not wish to leave my friends and my domestic comforts for i do not travel for pleasure or curiosity yet if i should recover curiosity would revive  in my present state i am desirous to make a struggle for a little longer life and hope to obtain some help from a softer climate do for me what you can he wrote to me july    i wish your affairs could have permitted a longer and continued exertion of your zeal and kindness they that have your kindness may want your ardour in the mean time i am very feeble and very dejected  by a letter from sir joshua reynolds i was informed that the lord chancellor had called on him and acquainted him that the application had not been successful but that his lordship after speaking highly in praise of johnson as a man who was an honor to his country desired sir joshua to let him know that on granting a mortgage of his pension he should draw on his lordship to the amount of five or six hundred pounds and that his lordship explained the meaning of the mortgage to be that he wished the business to be conducted in such a manner as that dr johnson should appear to be under the least possible obligation sir joshua mentioned that he had by the same post communicated all this to dr johnson  how johnson was affected upon the occasion will appear from what he wrote to sir joshua reynolds  ashbourne sept   many words i hope are not necessary between you and me to convince you what gratitude is excited in my heart by the chancellors liberality and your kind offices        i have enclosed a letter to the chancellor which when you have read it you will be pleased to seal with a head or any other general seal and convey it to him had i sent it directly to him i should have seemed to overlook the favor of your intervention  to the lord high chancellor sir joshua reynolds on account of the excellence both of the sentiment and expression of this letter took a copy of it which he showed to some of his friends one of whom who admired it being allowed to peruse it leisurely at home a copy was made and found its way into the newspapers and magazines it was transcribed with some inaccuracies i print it from the original draft in johnsons own handwriting  my lord after a long and not inattentive observation of mankind the generosity of your lordships offer raises in me not less wonder than gratitude bounty so liberally bestowed i should gladly receive if my condition made it necessary for to such a mind who would not be proud to own his obligations but it has pleased god to restore me to so great a measure of health that if i should now appropriate so much of a fortune destined to do good i could not escape from myself the charge of advancing a false claim my journey to the continent though i once thought it necessary was never much encouraged by my physicians and i was very desirous that your lordship should be told of it by sir joshua reynolds as an event very uncertain for if i grew much better i should not be willing if much worse not able to migrate  your lordship was first solicited without my knowledge but when i was told that you were pleased to honor me with your patronage i did not expect to hear of a refusal yet as i have had no long time to brood hope and have not rioted in imaginary opulence this cold reception has been scarce a disappointment and from your lordships kindness i have received a benefit which only men like you are able to bestow i shall now live mihi carior with a higher opinion of my own merit  i am my lord your lordships most obliged most grateful and most humble servant sam johnson sept       upon this unexpected failure i abstain from presuming to make any remarks or offer any conjectures  having after repeated reasonings brought dr johnson to agree to my removing to london and even to furnish me with arguments in favor of what he had opposed i wrote to him requesting he would write them for me he was so good as to comply and i shall extract that part of his letter to me of june    as a proof how well he could exhibit a cautious yet encouraging view of it  i remember and entreat you to remember that virtus est vitium fugere the first approach to riches is security from poverty the condition upon which you have my consent to settle in london is that your expense never exceeds your annual income fixing this basis of security you cannot be hurt and you may be very much advanced the loss of your scottish business which is all that you can lose is not to be reckoned as any equivalent to the hopes and possibilities that open here upon you if you succeed the question of prudence is at an end every body will think that done right which ends happily and though your expectations of which i would not advise you to talk too much should not be totally answered you can hardly fail to get friends who will do for you all that your present situation allows you to hope and if after a few years you should return to scotland you will return with a mind supplied by various conversation and many opportunities of enquiry with much knowledge and materials for reflection and instruction  let us now contemplate johnson thirty years after the death of his wife still retaining for her all the tenderness of affection  to the reverend mr bagshaw at bromley sir perhaps you may remember that in the year      you committed to the ground my dear wife i now entreat your permission to lay a stone upon her and have sent the inscription that if you find it proper you may signify your allowance  you will do me a great favor by showing the place where she lies that the stone may protect her remains  mr ryland will wait on you for the inscription printed in his works  and procure it to be engraved you will easily believe that i shrink from this mournful office when it is done if i have strength remaining i will visit bromley once again and pay you part of the respect to which you have a right from reverend sir  your most humble servant sam johnson july          on the same day he wrote to mr langton i cannot but think that in my languid and anxious state i have some reason to complain that i receive from you neither enquiry nor consolation you know how much i value your friendship and with what confidence i expect your kindness if i wanted any act of tenderness that you could perform at least if you do not know it i think your ignorance is your own fault yet how long is it that i have lived almost in your neighborhood without the least notice  i do not however consider this neglect as particularly shown to me i hear two of your most valuable friends make the same complaint but why are all thus overlooked you are not oppressed by sickness you are not distracted by business if you are sick you are sick of leisure  and allow yourself to be told that no disease is more to be dreaded or avoided rather to do nothing than to do good is the lowest state of a degraded mind boileau says to his pupil que les verse ne soient pas votre eternel emploi cultivez vos amiss  that voluntary debility which modern language is content to term indolence will if it is not counteracted by resolution render in time the strongest faculties lifeless and turn the flame to the smoke of virtue  i do not expect nor desire to see you because i am much pleased to find that your mother stays so long with you and i should think you neither elegant nor grateful if you did not study her gratification you will pay my respects to both the ladies and to all the young people  i am going northward for a while to try what help the country can give me but if you will write the letter will come after me  next day he set out on a jaunt to staffordshire and derbyshire flattering himself that he might be in some degree relieved  during his absence from london he kept up a correspondence with several of his friends from which i shall select what appears to me proper for publication without attending nicely to chronological order  to dr brocklesby he writes ashbourne july  0 the kind attention which you have so long shown to my health and happiness makes it as much a debt of gratitude as a call of interest to give you an account of what befalls me when accident recovers me from your immediate care  the journey of the first day was performed with very little sense of fatigue the second day brought me to lichfield without much lassitude but i am afraid that i could not have borne such violent agitation for many days together tell dr heberden that in the coach i read ciceronianus which i concluded as i entered lichfield my affection and understanding went along with erasmus except that once or twice he somewhat unskilfully entangles ciceros civil or moral with his rhetorical character  i staid five days at lichfield but being unable to walk had no great pleasure and yesterday   th i came hither where i am to try what air and attention can perform  of any improvement in my health i cannot yet please myself with the perception        the asthma has no abatement opiates stop the fit so as that i can sit and sometimes lie easy but they do not now procure me the power of motion and i am afraid that my general strength of body does not increase the weather indeed is not benign but how low is he sunk whose strength depends upon the weather  i am now looking into floyer who lived with his asthma to almost his ninetieth year his book by want of order is obscure and his asthma i think not of the same kind with mine something however i may perhaps learn  my appetite still continues keen enough and what i consider as a symptom of radical health i have a voracious delight in raw summer fruit of which i was less eager a few years ago  you will be pleased to communicate this account to dr heberden and if any thing is to be done let me have your joint opinion  now  abite curae  let me enquire after the club at the essex head essexstreet   july    not recollecting that dr heberden might be at windsor i thought your letter long in coming but you know nocitura petuntur the letter which i so much desired tells me that i have lost one of my best and tenderest friends mr allen the printer  my comfort is that he appeared to live like a man that had always before his eyes the fragility of our present existence and was therefore i hope not unprepared to meet his judge  your attention dear sir and that of dr heberden to my health is extremely kind i am loath to think that i grow worse and cannot fairly prove even to my own partiality that i grow much better  august   i return you thanks dear sir for your unwearied attention both medicinal and friendly and hope to prove the effect of your care by living to acknowledge it  august    pray be so kind as to have me in your thoughts and mention my case to others as you have opportunity i seem to myself neither to gain nor lose strength i have lately tried milk but have yet found no advantage and am afraid of it merely as a liquid my appetite is still good which i know is dear dr heberdens criterion of the vis vitae  as we cannot now see each other do not omit to write for you cannot think with what warmth of expectation i reckon the hours of a postday  august    i have hitherto sent you only melancholy letters you will be glad to hear some better account yesterday the asthma remitted perceptibly remitted and i moved with more ease than i have enjoyed for many weeks may god continue his mercy  this account i would not delay because i am not a lover of complaints or complainers and yet i have since we parted uttered nothing till now but terror and sorrow write to me dear sir  august    better i hope and better my respiration gets more and more ease and liberty i went to church yesterday after a very liberal dinner without any inconvenience it is indeed no long walk but i never walked it without difficulty since i came before  the intention was only to overpower the seeming vis inertiae of the pectoral and pulmonary muscles  i am favored with a degree of ease that very much delights me and do not despair of another race upon the stairs of the academy  if i were however of a humor to see or to show the state of my body on the dark side i might say quid te exempta juvat spinis de pluribus una the nights are still sleepless and the water rises though it does not rise very fast let us however rejoice in all the good that we have the remission of one disease will enable nature to combat the rest  the squills i have not neglected for i have taken more than a hundred drops a day and one day took two hundred and fifty which according to the popular equivalence of a drop to a grain is more than half an ounce  i thank you dear sir for your attention in ordering the medicines your attention to me has never failed if the virtue of medicines could be enforced by the benevolence of the prescriber how soon should i be well  august    the relaxation of the asthma still continues yet i do not trust it wholly to itself but soothe it now and then with an opiate i not only perform the perpetual act of respiration with less labor but i can walk with fewer intervals of rest and with greater freedom of motion  i never thought well of dr jamess compounded medicines his ingredients appeared to me sometimes inefficacious and trifling and sometimes heterogeneous and destructive of each other this prescription exhibits a composition of about three hundred and thirty grains in which there are four grains of emetick tartar and six drops thebaick tincture he that writes thus surely writes for show the basis of his medicine is the gum ammoniacum which dear dr lawrence used to give but of which i never saw any effect we will if you please let this medicine alone the squills have every suffrage and in the squills we will rest for the present  august    the kindness which you show by having me in your thoughts upon all occasions will i hope always fill my heart with gratitude be pleased to return my thanks to sir george baker for the consideration which he has bestowed upon me  is this the balloon that has been so long expected this balloon to which i subscribed but without payment it is pity that philosophers have been disappointed and shame that they have been cheated but i know not well how to prevent either of this experiment i have read nothing where was it exhibited and who was the man that ran away with so much money  continue dear sir to write often and more at a time for none of your prescriptions operate to their proper uses more certainly than your letters operate as cordials  august    i suffered you to escape last post without a letter but you are not to expect such indulgence very often for i write not so much because i have any thing to say as because i hope for an answer and the vacancy of my life here makes a letter of great value  i have here little company and little amusement and thus abandoned to the contemplation of my own miseries i am sometimes gloomy and depressed this too i resist as i can and find opium i think useful but i seldom take more than one grain  is not this strange weather winter absorbed the spring and now autumn is come before we have had summer but let not our kindness for each other imitate the inconstancy of the seasons  sept   mr windham has been here to see me he came i think forty miles out of his way and staid about a day and a half perhaps i make the time shorter than it was such conversation i shall not have again till i come back to the regions of literature and there windham is inter stellas it is remarkable that so good a latin scholar as johnson should have been so inattentive to the meter as by mistake to have written stellas instead of ignes luna minores he then mentions the effects of certain medicines as taken that nature is recovering its original powers and the functions returning to their proper state god continue his mercies and grant me to use them rightly  sept   do you know the duke and duchess of devonshire and have you ever seen chatsworth i was at chatsworth on monday i had indeed seen it before but never when its owners were at home i was very kindly received and honestly pressed to stay but i told them that a sick man is not a fit inmate of a great house but i hope to go again some time  sept    i think nothing grows worse but all rather better except sleep and that of late has been at its old pranks last evening i felt what i had not known for a long time an inclination to walk for amusement i took a short walk and came back again neither breathless nor fatigued  this has been a gloomy frigid ungenial summer but of late it seems to mend i hear the heat sometimes mentioned but i do not feel it praeterea minimus gelido jam in corpore sanguis febre calet sola  i hope however with good help to find means of supporting a winter at home and to hear and tell at the club what is doing and what ought to be doing in the world i have no company here and shall naturally come home hungry for conversation  to wish you dear sir more leisure would not be kind but what leisure you have you must bestow upon me  sept    i have now let you alone for a long time having indeed little to say you charge me somewhat unjustly with luxury at chatsworth you should remember that i have eaten but once and the doctor with whom i live follows a milk diet i grow no fatter though my stomach if it be not disturbed by physic never fails me  i now grow weary of solitude and think of removing next week to lichfield a place of more society but otherwise of less convenience when i am settled i shall write again  of the hot weather that you mention we have had in derbyshire very much and for myself i seldom feel heat and suppose that my frigidity is the effect of my distemper a supposition which naturally leads me to hope that a hotter climate may be useful but i hope to stand another english winter  lichfield sept    on one day i had three letters about the airballoon yours was far the best and has enabled me to impart to my friends in the country an idea of this species of amusement in amusement mere amusement i am afraid it must end for i do not find that its course can be directed so as that it should serve any purposes of communication and it can give no new intelligence of the state of the air at different heights till they have ascended above the height of mountains which they seem never likely to do  i came hither on the   th how long i shall stay i have not determined my dropsy is gone and my asthma much remitted but i have felt myself a little declining these two days or at least today but such vicissitudes must be expected one day may be worse than another but this last month is far better than the former if the next should be as much better than this i shall run about the town on my own legs  october   the fate of the balloon i do not much lament to make new balloons is to repeat the jest again we now know a method of mounting into the air and i think are not likely to know more the vehicles can serve no use till we can guide them and they can gratify no curiosity till we mount with them to greater heights than we can reach without till we rise above the tops of the highest mountains which we have yet not done we know the state of the air in all its regions to the top of teneriffe and therefore learn nothing from those who navigate a balloon below the clouds the first experiment however was bold and deserved applause and reward but since it has been performed and its event is known i had rather now find a medicine that can ease an asthma  october    you write to me with a zeal that animates and a tenderness that melts me i am not afraid either of a journey to london or a residence in it i came down with little fatigue and am now not weaker in the smoky atmosphere i was delivered from the dropsy which i consider as the original and radical disease the town is my element his love of london continually appears once upon reading that line in the curious epitaph quoted in the spectator born in new england did in london die he laughed and said i do not wonder at this it would have been strange if born in london he had died in new england  there are my friends there are my books to which i have not yet bidden farewell and there are my amusements sir joshua told me long ago that my vocation was to public life and i hope still to keep my station till god shall bid me go in peace  to mr hoole ashbourne aug   since i was here i have two little letters from you and have not had the gratitude to write but every man is most free with his best friends because he does not suppose that they can suspect him of intentional incivility  one reason for my omission is that being in a place to which you are wholly a stranger i have no topics of correspondence if you had any knowledge of ashbourne i could tell you of two ashbourne men who being last week condemned at derby to be hanged for a robbery went and hanged themselves in their cell but this however it may supply us with talk is nothing to you  your kindness i know would make you glad to hear some good of me but i have not much good to tell if i grow not worse it is all that i can say  i hope mrs hoole receives more help from her migration make her my compliments and write again to dear sir your affectionate servant  aug    i thank you for your affectionate letter i hope we shall both be the better for each others friendship and i hope we shall not very quickly be parted  tell mr nichols that i shall be glad of his correspondence when his business allows him a little remission though to wish him less business that i may have more pleasure would be too selfish  to pay for seats at the balloon is not very necessary because in less than a minute they who gaze at a miles distance will see all that can be seen about the wings i am of your mind they cannot at all assist it nor i think regulate its motion  i am now grown somewhat easier in my body but my mind is sometimes depressed  about the club i am in no great pain the forfeitures go on and the house i hear is improved for our future meetings i hope we shall meet often and sit long  sept   your letter was indeed long in coming but it was very welcome our acquaintance has now subsisted long and our recollection of each other involves a great space and many little occurrences which melt the thoughts to tenderness write to me therefore as frequently as you can  i hear from dr brocklesby and mr ryland that the club is not crowded i hope we shall enliven it when winter brings us together  to dr burney august   the weather you know has not been balmy i am now reduced to think and am at last content to talk of the weather pride must have a fall there was no information for which dr johnson was less grateful than for that which concerned the weather it was in allusion to his impatience with those who were reduced to keep conversation alive by observations on the weather that he applied the old proverb to himself if any one of his intimate acquaintance told him it was hot or cold wet or dry windy or calm he would stop them by saying poh poh you are telling us that of which none but men in a mine or a dungeon can be ignorant let us bear with patience or enjoy in quiet elementary changes whether for the better or the worse as they are never secrets burney   i have lost dear mr allen and wherever i turn the dead or the dying meet my notice and force my attention upon misery and mortality mrs burneys escape from so much danger and her ease after so much pain throws however some radiance of hope upon the gloomy prospect may her recovery be perfect and her continuance long  i struggle hard for life i take physic and take air my friends chariot is always ready we have run this morning twentyfour miles and could run fortyeight more but who can run the race with death  sept   concerning a private transaction in which his opinion was asked and after giving it he makes the following reflections which are applicable on other occasions nothing deserves more compassion than wrong conduct with good meaning than loss or obloquy suffered by one who as he is conscious only of good intentions wonders why he loses that kindness which he wishes to preserve and not knowing his own fault if as may sometimes happen nobody will tell him goes on to offend by his endeavors to please  i am delighted by finding that our opinions are the same  you will do me a real kindness by continuing to write a postday has now been long a day of recreation  nov   our correspondence paused for want of topics i had said what i had to say on the matter proposed to my consideration and nothing remained but to tell you that i waked or slept that i was more or less sick i drew my thoughts in upon myself and supposed yours employed upon your book  that your book has been delayed i am glad since you have gained an opportunity of being more exact  of the caution necessary in adjusting narratives there is no end some tell what they do not know that they may not seem ignorant and others from mere indifference about truth all truth is not indeed of equal importance but if little violations are allowed every violation will in time be thought little and a writer should keep himself vigilantly on his guard against the first temptations to negligence or supineness  i had ceased to write because respecting you i had no more to say and respecting myself could say little good i cannot boast of advancement and in cases of convalescence it may be said with few exceptions non progredi est regredi i hope i may be excepted  my great difficulty was with my sweet fanny who by her artifice of inserting her letter in yours had given me a precept of frugality which i was not at liberty to neglect and i know not who were in town under whose cover i could send my letter i rejoice to hear that you are all so well and have a delight particularly sympathetick in the recovery of mrs burney  to mr langton aug    the kindness of your last letter and my omission to answer it begins to give you even in my opinion a right to recriminate and to charge me with forgetfulness of the absent i will therefore delay no longer to give an account of myself and wish i could relate what would please either myself or my friend  on july    i left london partly in hope of help from new air and change of place and partly excited by the sick mans impatience of the present i got to lichfield in a stage vehicle with very little fatigue in two days and had the consolation to find that since my last visit my three old acquaintance are all dead  july  0 i went to ashbourne where i have been till now the house in which we live is repairing i live in too much solitude and am often deeply dejected i wish we were nearer and rejoice in your removal to london a friend at once cheerful and serious is a great acquisition let us not neglect one another for the little time which providence allows us to hope  of my health i cannot tell you what my wishes persuaded me to expect that it is much improved by the season or by remedies i am sleepless my legs grow weary with a very few steps and the water breaks its boundaries in some degree the asthma however has remitted my breath is still much obstructed but is more free than it was nights of watchfulness produce torpid days i read very little though i am alone for i am tempted to supply in the day what i lost in bed  this is my history like all other histories a narrative of misery yet am i so much better than in the beginning of the year that i ought to be ashamed of complaining i now sit and write with very little sensibility of pain or weakness but when i rise i shall find my legs betraying me  of the money which you mentioned i have no immediate need keep it however for me unless some exigence requires it your papers i will show you certainly when you would see them but i am a little angry at you for not keeping minutes of your own acceptum et expensum and think a little time might be spared from aristophanes for the res familiares forgive me for i mean well  i hope dear sir that you and lady rothes and all the young people too many to enumerate are well and happy god bless you all  to mr windham august the tenderness with which you have been pleased to treat me through my long illness neither health nor sickness can i hope make me forget and you are not to suppose that after we parted you were no longer in my mind but what can a sick man say but that he is sick his thoughts are necessarily concentred in himself he neither receives nor can give delight his enquiries are after alleviations of pain and his efforts are to catch some momentary comfort  though i am now in the neighborhood of the peak you must expect no account of its wonders of its hills its waters its caverns or its mines but i will tell you dear sir what i hope you will not hear with less satisfaction that for about a week past my asthma has been less afflictive  october   i believe you have been long enough acquainted with the phenomenon of sickness not to be surprised that a sick man wishes to be where he is not and where it appears to every body but himself that he might easily be without having the resolution to remove i thought ashbourne a solitary place but did not come hither till last monday  i have here more company but my health has for this last week not advanced and in the languor of disease how little can be done whither or when i shall make my next remove i cannot tell but i entreat you dear sir to let me know from time to time where you may be found for your residence is a very powerful attractive to sir your most humble servant  to the right honorable william gerard hamilton dear sir considering what reason you gave me in the spring to conclude that you took part in whatever good or evil might befall me i ought not to have omitted so long the account which i am now about to give you  my diseases are an asthma and a dropsy and what is less curable seventyfive of the dropsy in the beginning of the summer or in the spring i recovered to a degree which struck with wonder both me and my physicians the asthma now is likewise for a time very much relieved i went to oxford where the asthma was very tyrannical and the dropsy began again to threaten me but seasonable physic stopped the inundation i then returned to london and in july took a resolution to visit staffordshire and derbyshire where i am yet struggling with my diseases the dropsy made another attack and was not easily ejected but at last gave way the asthma suddenly remitted in bed on the   th of august and though now very oppressive is i think still something gentler than it was before the remission my limbs are miserably debilitated and my nights are sleepless and tedious  when you read this dear sir you are not sorry that i wrote no sooner i will not prolong my complaints i hope still to see you in a happier hour to talk over what we have often talked and perhaps to find new topics of merriment or new incitements to curiosity  i am dear sir etc sam johnson lichfield oct  0       to john paradise esquire dear sir though in all my summers excursion i have given you no account of myself i hope you think better of me than to imagine it possible for me to forget you whose kindness to me has been too great and too constant not to have made its impression on a harder breast than mine  silence is not very culpable when nothing pleasing is suppressed it would have alleviated none of your complaints to have read my vicissitudes of evil i have struggled hard with very formidable and obstinate maladies and though i cannot talk of health think all praise due to my creator and preserver for the continuance of my life the dropsy has made two attacks and has given way to medicine the asthma is very oppressive but that has likewise once remitted i am very weak and very sleepless but it is time to conclude the tale of misery  i hope dear sir that you grow better for you have likewise your share of human evil and that your lady and the young charmers are well  i am dear sir etc sam johnson lichfield oct  0       to mr george nicoll bookseller to his majesty  dear sir since we parted i have been much oppressed by my asthma but it has lately been less laborious when i sit i am almost at ease and i can walk though yet very little with less difficulty for this week past than before i hope i shall again enjoy my friends and that you and i shall have a little more literary conversation  where i now am every thing is very liberally provided for me but conversation my friend is sick himself and the reciprocation of complaints and groans affords not much of either pleasure or instruction what we have not at home this town does not supply and i shall be glad of a little imported intelligence and hope that you will bestow now and then a little time on the relief and entertainment of sir yours etc  sam johnson ashbourne august          to mr cruikshank dear sir do not suppose that i forget you i hope i shall never be accused of forgetting my benefactors i had till lately nothing to write but complaints upon complaints of miseries upon miseries but within this fortnight i have received great relief  have your lectures any vacation if you are released from the necessity of daily study you may find time for a letter to me  in this letter he states the particulars of his case  in return for this account of my health let me have a good account of yours and of your prosperity in all your undertakings  i am dear sir your etc sam johnson ashbourne sept         to mr thomas davies august    the tenderness with which you always treat me makes me culpable in my own eyes for having omitted to write in so long a separation i had indeed nothing to say that you could wish to hear all has been hitherto misery accumulated upon misery disease corroborating disease till yesterday my asthma was perceptibly and unexpectedly mitigated i am much comforted with this short relief and am willing to flatter myself that it may continue and improve i have at present such a degree of ease as not only may admit the comforts but the duties of life make my compliments to mrs davies  poor dear allen he was a good man  to sir joshua reynolds august    having had since our separation little to say that could please you or myself by saying i have not been lavish of useless letters but i flatter myself that you will partake of the pleasure with which i can now tell you that about a week ago i felt suddenly a sensible remission of my asthma and consequently a greater lightness of action and motion  of this grateful alleviation i know not the cause nor dare depend upon its continuance but while it lasts i endeavor to enjoy it and am desirous of communicating while it lasts my pleasure to my friends  hitherto dear sir i had written before the post which stays in this town but a little while brought me your letter mr davies seems to have represented my little tendency to recovery in terms too splendid i am still restless still weak still watery but the asthma is less oppressive  poor ramsay allan ramsay esquire painter to his majesty who died about this time much regretted by his friends  on which side soever i turn mortality presents its formidable frown i left three old friends at lichfield when i was last there and now found them all dead i no sooner lose sight of dear allen than i am told that i shall see him no more that we must all die we always knew i wish i had sooner remembered it do not think me intrusive or importunate if i now call dear sir on you to remember it  sept   i still continue by gods mercy to mend my breath is easier my nights are quieter and my legs are less in bulk and stronger in use i have however yet a great deal to overcome before i can yet attain even an old mans health  write do write to me now and then we are now old acquaintance and perhaps few people have lived so much and so long together with less cause of complaint on either side the retrospection of this is very pleasant and i hope we shall never think on each other with less kindness  sept    i flattered myself that this week would have given me a letter from you but none has come write to me now and then but direct your next to lichfield  i think and i hope am sure that i still grow better i have sometimes good nights but am still in my legs weak but so much mended that i go to lichfield in hope of being able to pay my visits on foot for there are no coaches  i have three letters this day all about the balloon i could have been content with one do not write about the balloon whatever else you may think proper to say  to mr john nichols lichfield oct  0 when you were here you were pleased as i am told to think my absence an inconvenience i should certainly have been very glad to give so skilful a lover of antiquities any information about my native place of which however i know not much and have reason to believe that not much is known  though i have not given you any amusement i have received amusement from you at ashbourne where i had very little company i had the luck to borrow mr bowyers life a book so full of contemporary history that a literary man must find some of his old friends i thought that i could now and then have told you some hints worth your notice and perhaps we may talk a life over i hope we shall be much together you must now be to me what you were before and what dear mr allen was besides he was taken unexpectedly away but i think he was a very good man  i have made little progress in recovery i am very weak and very sleepless but i live on and hope  this various mass of correspondence which i have thus brought together is valuable both as an addition to the store which the public already has of johnsons writings and as exhibiting a genuine and noble specimen of vigor and vivacity of mind which neither age nor sickness could impair or diminish  it may be observed that his writing in every way whether for the public or privately to his friends was by fits and starts for we see frequently that a number of letters are written on the same day when he had once overcome his aversion to begin he was i suppose desirous to go on in order to relieve his mind from the uneasy reflection of delaying what he ought to do  while in the country notwithstanding the accumulation of illness which he endured his mind did not lose its powers he translated an ode of horace which is printed in his works and composed several prayers i shall insert one of them which is so wise and energetick so philosophical and so pious that i doubt not of its affording consolation to many a sincere christian when in a state of mind to which i believe the best are sometimes liable against inquisitive and perplexing thoughts o lord my maker and protector who have graciously sent me into this world to work out my salvation enable me to drive from me all such unquiet and perplexing thoughts as may mislead or hinder me in the practice of those duties which thou have required when i behold the works of thy hands and consider the course of thy providence give me grace always to remember that thy thoughts are not my thoughts nor thy ways my ways and while it shall please thee to continue me in this world where much is to be done and little to be known teach me by thy holy spirit to withdraw my mind from unprofitable and dangerous enquiries from difficulties vainly curious and doubts impossible to be solved let me rejoice in the light which thou have imparted let me serve thee with active zeal and humble confidence and wait with patient expectation for the time in which the soul which thou receivest shall be satisfied with knowledge grant this o lord for jesus christs sake amen   and here i am enabled fully to refute a very unjust reflection both against dr johnson and his faithful servant mr francis barber by sir john hawkins as if both of them had been guilty of culpable neglect toward a person of the name of heely whom sir john chooses to call a relation of dr johnsons the fact is that mr heely was not his relation he had indeed been married to one of his cousins but she had died without having children and he had married another woman so that even the slight connection which there once had been by alliance was dissolved dr johnson who had shown very great liberality to this man while his first wife was alive as has appeared in a former part of this work vol i p      was humane and charitable enough to continue his bounty to him occasionally but surely there was no strong call of duty upon him or upon his legatee to do more the following letter obligingly communicated to me by mr andrew strahan will confirm what i have stated to mr heely no   in pyestreet westminster sir as necessity obliges you to call so soon again upon me you should at least have told the smallest sum that will supply your present want you cannot suppose that i have much to spare two guineas is as much as you ought to be behind with your creditor  if you wait on mr strahan in newstreet fetterlane or in his absence on mr andrew strahan show this by which they are entreated to advance you two guineas and to keep this as a voucher  i am sir your humble servant sam johnson ashbourne august            indeed it is very necessary to keep in mind that sir john hawkins has unaccountably viewed johnsons character and conduct in almost every particular with an unhappy prejudice i shall add one instance only to those on which i have thought it incumbent on me to observe talking of mr garricks having signified his willingness to let johnson have the loan of any of his books to assist him in his edition of shakspeare sir john says page     mr garrick knew not what risque he ran by this offer johnson had so strange a forgetfulness of obligations of this sort that few who lent him books ever saw them again this surely conveys a most unfavourable insinuation and has been so understood sir john mentions the single case of a curious edition of politian which he tells us appeared to belong to pembrokecollege and which probably had been considered by johnson as his own for upwards of fifty years would it not be fairer to consider this as an inadvertence and draw no general inference the truth is that johnson was so attentive that in one of his manuscripts in my possession he has marked in two columns books borrowed and books lent  in sir john hawkinss compilation there are however some passages concerning johnson which have unquestionable merit one of them i shall transcribe in justice to a writer whom i have had too much occasion to censure and to show my fairness as the biographer of my illustrious friend there was wanting in his conduct and behavior that dignity which results from a regular and orderly course of action and by an irresistible power commands esteem he could not be said to be a stayed man nor so to have adjusted in his mind the balance of reason and passion as to give occasion to say what may be observed of some men that all they do is just fit and right     we now behold johnson for the last time in his native city for which he ever retained a warm affection and which by a sudden apostrophe under the word lich he introduces with reverence into his immortal work the english dictionary  salve magna parens the following circumstance mutually to the honor of johnson and the corporation of his native city has been communicated to me by the reverend dr vyse from the town clerk mr simpson has now before him a record of the respect and veneration which the corporation of lichfield in the year      had for the merits and learning of dr johnson his father built the cornerhouse in the marketplace the two fronts of which toward market and broadmarketstreet stood upon waste land of the corporation under a forty years lease which was then expired on the   th of august      at a common hall of the bailiffs and citizens it was ordered and that without any solicitation that a lease should be granted to samuel johnson doctor of laws of the encroachments at his house for the term of ninetynine years at the old rent which was five shillings of which as town clerk mr simpson had the honor and pleasure of informing him and that he was desired to accept it without paying any fine on the occasion which lease was afterward granted and the doctor died possessed of this property  while here he felt a revival of all the tenderness of filial affection an instance of which appeared in his ordering the gravestone and inscription over elizabeth blaney see vol i p    to be substantially and carefully renewed  to mr henry white a young clergyman with whom he now formed an intimacy so as to talk to him with great freedom he mentioned that he could not in general accuse himself of having been an undutiful son once indeed said he i was disobedient i refused to attend my father to uttoxetermarket pride was the source of that refusal and the remembrance of it was painful a few years ago i desired to atone for this fault i went to uttoxeter in very bad weather and stood for a considerable time bareheaded in the rain on the spot where my fathers stall used to stand in contrition i stood and i hope the penance was expiatory  i told him says miss seward in one of my latest visits to him of a wonderful learned pig which i had seen at nottingham and which did all that we have observed exhibited by dogs and horses the subject amused him then said he the pigs are a race unjustly calumniated pig has it seems not been wanting to man but man to pig we do not allow time for his education we kill him at a year old mr henry white who was present observed that if this instance had happened in or before popes time he would not have been justified in instancing the swine as the lowest degree of grovelling instinct doctor johnson seemed pleased with the observation while the person who made it proceeded to remark that great torture must have been employed ere the indocility of the animal could have been subdued  certainly said the doctor but turning to me how old is your pig i told him three years old then said he the pig has no cause to complain he would have been killed the first year if he had not been educated and protracted existence is a good recompense for very considerable degrees of torture  as johnson had now very faint hopes of recovery and as mrs thrale was no longer devoted to him it might have been supposed that he would naturally have chosen to remain in the comfortable house of his beloved wifes daughter and end his life where he began it but there was in him an animated and lofty spirit mr burke suggested to me as applicable to johnson what cicero in his cato major says of appius intentum enim animum tanquam arcum habebat nec languescens succumbebat senectuti repeating at the same time the following noble words in the same passage ita enim senectus honesta est si se ipsa defendit si jus suum retinet si uemini emancipata est si usque ad extremum vitae spiritum vindicet jus suum  and however complicated diseases might depress ordinary mortals all who saw him beheld and acknowledged the invictum animum catonis such was his intellectual ardour even at this time that he said to one friend sir i look upon every day to be lost in which i do not make a new acquaintance and to another when talking of his illness i will be conquered i will not capitulate and such was his love of london so high a relish had he of its magnificent extent and variety of intellectual entertainment that he languished when absent from it his mind having become quite luxurious from the long habit of enjoying the metropolis and therefore although at lichfield surrounded with friends who loved and revered him and for whom he had a very sincere affection he still found that such conversation as london affords could be found no where else these feelings joined probably to some flattering hopes of aid from the eminent physicians and surgeons in london who kindly and generously attended him without accepting of fees made him resolve to return to the capital  from lichfield he came to birmingham where he passed a few days with his worthy old schoolfellow mr hector who thus writes to me he was very solicitous with me to recollect some of our most early transactions and transmit them to him for i perceived nothing gave him greater pleasure than calling to mind those days of our innocence i complied with his request and he only received them a few days before his death i have transcribed for your inspection exactly the minutes i wrote to him this paper having been found in his repositories after his death sir john hawkins has inserted it entire and i have made occasional use of it and other communications from mr hector in the course of this work i have both visited and corresponded with him since dr johnsons death and by asking a great variety of particulars have obtained additional information i followed the same mode with the reverend dr tailor in whose presence i wrote down a good deal of what he could tell and he at my request signed his name to give it authenticity it is very rare to find any person who is able to give a distinct account of the life even of one whom he has known intimately without questions being put to them my friend dr kippis has told me that on this account it is a practice with him to draw out a biographical catechism  johnson then proceeded to oxford where he was again kindly received by dr adams who was pleased to give me the following account in one of his letters   th feb      his last visit was i believe to my house which he left after a stay of four or five days we had much serious talk together for which i ought to be the better as long as i live you will remember some discourse which we had in the summer upon the subject of prayer and the difficulty of this sort of composition he reminded me of this and of my having wished him to try his hand and to give us a specimen of the style and manner that he approved he added that he was now in a right frame of mind and as he could not possibly employ his time better he would in earnest set about it but i find upon enquiry that no papers of this sort were left behind him except a few short ejaculatory forms suitable to his present situation  dr adams had not then received accurate information on this subject for it has since appeared that various prayers had been composed by him at different periods which intermingled with pious resolutions and some short notes of his life were entitled by him prayers and meditations and have in pursuance of his earnest requisition in the hopes of doing good been published with a judicious wellwritten preface by the reverend mr strahan to whom he delivered them this admirable collection to which i have frequently referred in the course of this work evinces beyond all his compositions for the public and all the eulogies of his friends and admirers the sincere virtue and piety of johnson it proves with unquestionable authenticity that amidst all his constitutional infirmities his earnestness to conform his practice to the precepts of christianity was unceasing and that he habitually endeavored to refer every transaction of his life to the will of the supreme being  he arrived in london on the   th of november and next day sent to dr burney the following note which i insert as the last token of his remembrance of this ingenious and amiable man and as another of the many proofs of the tenderness and benignity of his heart  mr johnson who came home last night sends his respects to dear dr burney and all the dear burneys little and great  to mr hector in birmingham dear sir i did not reach oxford until friday morning and then i sent francis to see the balloon fly but could not go myself i staid at oxford till tuesday and then came in the common vehicle easily to london i am as i was and having seen dr brocklesby am to ply the squills but whatever be their efficacy this world must soon pass away let us think seriously on our duty  i send my kindest respects to dear mrs careless let me have the prayers of both we have all lived long and must soon part god have mercy on us for the sake of our lord jesus christ amen  i am etc sam johnson london nov          his correspondence with me after his letter on the subject of my settling in london shall now so far as is proper be produced in one series  july    he wrote to me from ashbourne on the   th i came to lichfield and found every body glad enough to see me on the  0th i came hither and found a house half built of very uncomfortable appearance but my own room has not been altered that a man worn with diseases in his seventysecond or third year should condemn part of his remaining life to pass among ruins and rubbish and that no inconsiderable part appears to me very strange  i know that your kindness makes you impatient to know the state of my health in which i cannot boast of much improvement i came through the journey without much inconvenience but when i attempt selfmotion i find my legs weak and my breath very short this day i have been much disordered i have no company the doctor is busy in his fields and goes to bed at nine and his whole system is so different from mine that we seem formed for different elements i have therefore all my amusement to seek within myself  having written to him in bad spirits a letter filled with dejection and fretfulness and at the same time expressing anxious apprehensions concerning him on account of a dream which had disturbed me his answer was chiefly in terms of reproach for a supposed charge of affecting discontent and indulging the vanity of complaint it however proceeded write to me often and write like a man i consider your fidelity and tenderness as a great part of the comforts which are yet left me and sincerely wish we could be nearer to each other           my dear friend life is very short and very uncertain let us spend it as well as we can  my worthy neighbor allen is dead love me as well as you can pay my respects to dear mrs boswell  nothing ailed me at that time let your superstition at last have an end  feeling very soon that the manner in which he had written might hurt me he in two days after july    wrote to me again giving me an account of his sufferings after which follows before this letter you will have had one which i hope you will not take amiss for it contains only truth and that truth kindly intended        spartam quam nactus es orna make the most and best of your lot and compare yourself not with the few that are above you but with the multitudes which are below you       go steadily forward with lawful business or honest diversions be as temple says of the dutchmen well when you are not ill and pleased when you are not angry       this may seem but an ill return for your tenderness but i mean it well for i love you with great ardour and sincerity pay my respects to dear mrs boswell and teach the young ones to love me  i unfortunately was so much indisposed during a considerable part of the year that it was not or at least i thought it was not in my power to write to my illustrious friend as formerly or without expressing such complaints as offended him having conjured him not to do me the injustice of charging me with affectation i was with much regret long silent his last letter to me then came and affected me very tenderly to james boswell esquire dear sir i have this summer sometimes amended and sometimes relapsed but upon the whole have lost ground very much my legs are extremely weak and my breath very short and the water is now increasing upon me in this uncomfortable state your letters used to relieve what is the reason that i have them no longer are you sick or are you sullen whatever be the reason if it be less than necessity drive it away and of the short life that we have make the best use for yourself and for your friends       i am sometimes afraid that your omission to write has some real cause and shall be glad to know that you are not sick and that nothing ill has befallen dear mrs boswell or any of your family  i am sir your etc sam johnson lichfield nov           yet it was not a little painful to me to find that in a paragraph of this letter which i have omitted he still persevered in arraigning me as before which was strange in him who had so much experience of what i suffered i however wrote to him two as kind letters as i could the last of which came too late to be read by him for his illness increased more rapidly upon him than i had apprehended but i had the consolation of being informed that he spoke of me on his deathbed with affection and i look forward with humble hope of renewing our friendship in a better world  i now relieve the readers of this work from any farther personal notice of its author who if he should be thought to have obtruded himself too much upon their attention requests them to consider the peculiar plan of his biographical undertaking  soon after johnsons return to the metropolis both the asthma and dropsy became more violent and distressful he had for some time kept a journal in latin of the state of his illness and the remedies which he used under the title of aegri ephemeris which he began on the  th of july but continued it no longer than the  th of november finding i suppose that it was a mournful and unavailing register it is in my possession and is written with great care and accuracy  still his love of literature it is truly wonderful to consider the extent and constancy of johnsons literary ardour notwithstanding the melancholy which clouded and embittered his existence besides the numerous and various works which he executed he had at different times formed schemes of a great many more of which the following catalogue was given by him to mr langton and by that gentleman presented to his majesty  divinity a small book of precepts and directions for

facility of composition when he shook off his constitutional indolence and resolutely sat down to write is admirably described by mr courtenay in his poetical review which i have several times quoted  while through lifes maze he sent a piercing view his mind expansive to the object grew with various stores of erudition fraught the lively image the deepsearching thought slept in repose  but when the moment pressed the bright ideas stood at once confessed instant his genius sped its vigorous rays and over the lettered world diffused a blaze as wombd with fire the cloud electrick flies and calmly over the horizon seems to rise touched by the pointed steel the lightning flows and all the expanse with rich effulgence glows we shall in vain endeavor to know with exact precision every production of johnsons pen he owned to me that he had written about forty sermons but as i understood that he had given or sold them to different persons who were to preach them as their own he did not consider himself at liberty to acknowledge them would those who were thus aided by him who are still alive and the friends of those who are dead fairly inform the world it would be obligingly gratifying a reasonable curiosity to which there should i think now be no objection  i have lying before me in his handwriting a fragment of twenty quarto leaves of a translation into english of sallust de bello catalinario when it was done i have no notion but it seems to have no very superior merit to mark it as his besides those publications which with all my chronological care i have ascertained in the course of this work i am satisfied from internal evidence to admit also as genuine the following  considerations on the case of dr trapps sermons published in      in the gentlemans magazine it is a very ingenious defense of the right of abridging an authors work without being held as infringing his property this is one of the nicest questions in the law of literature and i cannot help thinking that the indulgence of abridging is often exceedingly injurious to authors and booksellers and should in very few cases be permitted  dedication for mrs lennox to the earl of middlesex of her female quixote in       preface to the catalogue of the artists exhibition in       preface to barettis easy lessons in italian and english in       but though it has been confidently ascribed to him i cannot allow that he wrote a dedication to both houses of parliament of a book entitled the evangelical history harmonized he was no croaker no declaimer against the times he would not have written that we are fallen upon an age in which corruption is not barely universal is universally confessed nor rapine preys on the public without opposition and perjury betrays it without inquiry nor would he to excite a speedy reformation have conjured up such phantoms of terror as these a few years longer and perhaps all endeavors will be in vain we may be swallowed by an earthquake we may be delivered to our enemies this is not johnsonian  there are indeed in this dedication several sentences constructed upon the model of those of johnson but the imitation of the form without the spirit of his style has been so general that this of itself is not sufficient evidence even our newspaper writers aspire to it in an account of the funeral of edwin the comedian in the diary of nov      0 that son of drollery is thus described a man who had so often cheered the sullenness of vacancy and suspended the approaches of sorrow  i have not thought it necessary to specify every copy of verses written by johnson it being my intention to publish an authentic edition of all his poetry with notes   did not fail he drew out and gave to his friend mr john nichols what perhaps he alone could have done a list of the authors of the universal history mentioning their several shares in that work it has according to his direction been deposited in the british museum and is printed in the gentlemans magazine for december       during his sleepless nights he amused himself by translating into latin verse from the greek many of the epigrams in the anthologia these translations with some other poems by him in latin he gave to his friend mr langton who having added a few notes sold them to the booksellers for a small sum to be given to some of johnsons relations which was accordingly done and they are printed in the collection of his works  a very erroneous notion has circulated as to johnsons deficiency in the knowledge of the greek language partly owing to the modesty with which from knowing how much there was to be learnt he used to mention his own comparative acquisitions when mr cumberland mr cumberland assures me that he was always treated with great courtesy by dr johnson who in his letters to mrs thrale vol ii p    thus speaks of that learned ingenious and accomplished gentleman the want of company is an inconvenience but mr cumberland is a million talked to him of the greek fragments which are so well illustrated in the observer and of the greek dramatists in general he heartily acknowledged his insufficiency in that particular branch of greek literature yet it may be said that though not a great he was a good greek scholar mr burney who is universally acknowledged by the best judges to be one of the few men of this age who are very eminent for their skill in that noble language has assured me that johnson could give a greek word for almost every english one and that although not sufficiently conversant in the niceties of the language he upon some occasions discovered even in these a considerable degree of critical acumen mr dalzell professor of greek at edinburgh whose skill in it is unquestionable mentioned to me in very liberal terms the impression which was made upon him by johnson in a conversation which they had in london concerning that language as johnson therefore was undoubtedly one of the first latin scholars in modern times let us not deny to his fame some additional splendor from greek  i shall now fulfill my promise of exhibiting specimens of various sorts of imitation of johnsons style  in the transactions of the royal irish academy      there is an essay on the style of dr samuel johnson by the rev robert burrowes whose respect for the great object of his criticism we must smile at a little inaccuracy of metaphor in the preface to the transactions which is written by mr burrowes the critic of the style of johnson having with a just zeal for literature observed that the whole nation are called on to exert themselves afterward says i hey are called on by every tie which can have a laudable influence on the heart of man is thus evinced in the concluding paragraph i have singled him out from the whole body of english writers because his universally acknowledged beauties would be most apt to induce imitation and i have treated rather on his faults than his perfections because an essay might comprize all the observations i could make upon his faults while volumes would not be sufficient for a treatise on his perfections  mr burrowes has analyzed the composition of johnson and pointed out its peculiarities with much acuteness and i would recommend a careful perusal of his essay to those who being captivated by the union of perspicuity and splendor which the writings of johnson contain without having a sufficient portion of his vigor of mind may be in danger of becoming bad copyists of his manner i however cannot but observe and i observe it to his credit that this learned gentleman has himself caught no mean degree of the expansion and harmony which independent of all other circumstances characterise the sentences of johnson thus in the preface to the volume in which his essay appears we find if it be said that in societies of this sort too much attention is frequently bestowed on subjects barren and speculative it may be answered that no one science is so little connected with the rest as not to afford many principles whose use may extend considerably beyond the science to which they primarily belong and that no proposition is so purely theoretical as to be totally incapable of being applied to practical purposes there is no apparent connection between duration and the cycloidal arch the properties of which duly attended to have furnished us with our best regulated methods of measuring time and he who has made himself master of the nature and affections of the logarithmick curve is not aware that he has advanced considerably toward ascertaining the proportionable density of the air at its various distances from the surface of the earth  the ludicrous imitators of johnsons style are innumerable their general method is to accumulate hard words without considering that although he was fond of introducing them occasionally there is not a single sentence in all his writings where they are crowded together as in the first verse of the following imaginary ode by him to mrs thrale johnsons wishing to unite himself with this rich widow was much talked of but i believe without foundation the report however gave occasion for a poem not without characteristical merit entitled ode to mrs thrale by samuel johnson ll d on their supposed approaching nuptials printed for mr faulder in bondstreet  which appeared in the newspapers  cervisial coctors viduate dame opinst thou this gigantick frame procumbing at thy shrine shall catenated by thy charms a captive in thy ambient arms perennially be thine this and a thousand other such attempts are totally unlike the original which the writers imagined they were turning into ridicule there is not similarity enough for burlesque or even for caricature  mr colman in his prose on several occasions has a letter from lexiphanes containing proposals for a glossary or vocabulary of the vulgar tongue intended as a supplement to a larger dictionary it is evidently meant as a sportive sally of ridicule on johnson whose style is thus imitated without being grossly overcharged it is easy to foresee that the idle and illiterate will complain that i have increased their labors by endeavoring to diminish them and that i have explained what is more easy by what is more difficult  ignotum per ignotius i expect on the other hand the liberal acknowledgements of the learned he who is buried in scholastic retirement secluded from the assemblies of the gay and remote from the circles of the polite will at once comprehend the definitions and be grateful for such a seasonable and necessary

occasion to observe so many that i might introduce quotations from a great proportion of the writers in our language since he appeared i shall point out only the following  william robertson d d in

the whole analogy of the english language so far as relates to pronunciation accent and quantity london      i beg leave to offer my particular acknowledgements to the author of a work of uncommon merit and great utility i know no book which contains in the same compass more learning polite literature sound sense accuracy of arrangement and perspicuity of expression  in an enlightened and improving age much perhaps is not to be apprehended from the inroads of mere caprice at such a period it will generally be perceived that needless irregularity is the worst of all deformities and that nothing is so truly elegant in language as the simplicity of unviolated analogy  rules will therefore be observed so far as they are known and acknowledged but at the same time the desire of improvement having been once excited will not remain inactive and its efforts unless assisted by knowledge as much as they are prompted by zeal will not unfrequently be found pernicious so that the very persons whose intention it is to perfect the instrument of reason will deprave and disorder it unknowingly at such a time then it becomes peculiarly necessary that the analogy of language should be fully examined and understood that its rules should be carefully laid down and that it should be clearly known how much it contains which being already right should be defended from change and violation how much it has that demands amendment and how much that for fear of greater inconveniences must perhaps be left unaltered though irregular  a distinguished author in the mirror that collection was presented to dr johnson i believe by its authors and i heard him speak very well of it  a periodical paper published at edinburgh has imitated johnson very closely thus in no     the effects of the return of spring have been frequently remarked as well in relation to the human mind as to the animal and vegetable world the reviving power of this season has been traced from the fields to the herds that inhabit them and from the lower classes of beings up to man gladness and joy are described as prevailing through universal nature animating the low of the cattle the carol of the birds and the pipe of the shepherd  the reverend mr knox master of tunbridge school appears to have the imitare aveo of johnsons style perpetually in his mind and to his assiduous study of it we may partly ascribe the extensive popularity of his writings it were to be wished that he had imitated that great man in every respect and had not followed the example of dr adam smith in ungraciously attacking his venerable alma matter oxford   in his essays moral and literary no   we find the following passage  the polish of external grace may indeed be deferred till the approach of manhood when solidity is obtained by pursuing the modes prescribed by our forefathers then may the file be used the firm substance will bear attrition and the luster then acquired will be durable  there is however one in no    which is blown up into such tumidity as to be truly ludicrous the writer means to tell us that members of parliament who have run in debt by extravagance will sell their votes to avoid an arrest mr knox in his moral and literary abstraction may be excused for not knowing the political regulations of his country no senator can be in the hands of a bailiff  which he thus expresses  they who build houses and collect costly pictures and furniture with the money of an honest artisan or mechanic will be very glad of emancipation from the hands of a bailiff by a sale of their senatorial suffrage  but i think the most perfect imitation of johnson is a professed one entitled a criticism on grays elegy in a country churchyard said to be written by mr young professor of greek at glasgow and of which let him have the credit unless a better title can be shown it has not only the peculiarities of johnsons style but that very species of literary discussion and illustration for which he was eminent having already quoted so much from others i shall refer the curious to this performance with an assurance of much entertainment  yet whatever merit there may be in any imitations of johnsons style every good judge must see that they are obviously different from the original for all of them are either deficient in its force or overloaded with its peculiarities and the powerful sentiment to which it is suited is not to be found  johnsons affection for his departed relations seemed to grow warmer as he approached nearer to the time when he might hope to see them again it probably appeared to him that he should upbraid himself with unkind inattention were he to leave the world without having paid a tribute of respect to their memory  to mr green apothecary at lichfield dear sir i have enclosed the epitaph no man understood that species of composition better than johnson i should have mentioned in      his epitaph on mrs bell wife of his friend john bell esquire it is printed in his works as well as the above for my father mother and brother to be all engraved on the large size and laid in the middle aisle in st michaels church which i request the clergyman and churchwardens to permit  the first care must be to find the exact place of interment that the stone may protect the bodies then let the stone be deep massy and hard and do not let the difference of ten pounds or more defeat our purpose  i have enclosed ten pounds and mrs porter will pay you ten more which i gave her for the same purpose what more is wanted shall be sent and i beg that all possible haste may be made for i wish to have it done while i am yet alive let me know dear sir that you receive this  i am sir your most humble servant sam johnson dec         to mrs lucy porter in lichfield dear madam i am very ill and desire your prayers i have sent mr green the epitaph and a power to call on you for ten pounds  i laid this summer a stone over tetty in the chapel of bromley in kent the inscription is in latin of which this is the english here a translation  that this is done i thought it fit that you should know what care will be taken of us who can tell may god pardon and bless us for jesus christs sake  i am etc sam johnson dec         my readers are now at last to behold samuel johnson preparing himself for that doom from which the most exalted powers afford no exemption to man death had always been to him an object of terror so that though by no means happy he still clung to life with an eagerness at which many have wondered at any time when he was ill he was very much pleased to be told that he looked better an ingenious member of the eumelian club a club in london founded by the learned and ingenious physician dr ash in honor of whose name it was called eumelian from the greek  though it was warmly contended and even put to a vote that it should have the more obvious appellation of fraxinean from the latin informs me that upon one occasion when he said to him that he saw health returning to his cheek johnson seized him by the hand and exclaimed sir you are one of the kindest friends i ever had  his own state of his views of futurity will appear truly rational and may perhaps impress the unthinking with seriousness  you know says he letters to mrs thrale vol ii p   0  i never thought confidence with respect to futurity any part of the character of a brave a wife or a good man bravery has no place where it can avail nothing wisdom impresses strongly the consciousness of those faults of which it is perhaps itself an aggravation and goodness always wishing to be better and imputing every deficience to criminal negligence and every fault to voluntary corruption never dares to suppose the condition of forgiveness fulfilled nor what is wanting in the crime supplied by penitence  this is the state of the best but what must be the condition of him whose heart will not suffer him to rank himself among the best or among the good such must be his dread of the approaching trial as will leave him little attention to the opinion of those whom he is leaving for ever and the serenity that is not felt it can be no virtue to feign  his great fear of death and the strange dark manner in which sir john hawkins imparts the uneasiness which he expressed on account of offenses with which he charged himself may give occasion to injurious suspicions as if there had been something of more than ordinary criminality weighing upon his conscience on that account therefore as well as from the regard to truth which he inculcated see what he said to mr malone p     of this volume  i am to mention with all possible respect and delicacy however that his conduct after he came to london and had associated with savage and others was not so strictly virtuous in one respect as when he was a younger man it was well known that his amorous inclinations were uncommonly strong and impetuous he owned to many of his friends that he used to take women of the town to taverns and hear them relate their history in short it must not be concealed that like many other good and pious men amongst whom we may place the apostle paul upon his own authority johnson was not free from propensities which were ever warring against the law of his mind  and that in his combats with them he was sometimes overcome  here let the profane and licentious pause  let them not thoughtlessly say that johnson was an hypocrite or that his principles were not firm because his practice was not uniformly conformable to what he professed  let the question be considered independent of moral and religious association and no man will deny that thousands in many instances act against conviction is a prodigal for example an hypocrite when he owns he is satisfied that his extravagance will bring him to ruin and misery we are sure he believes it but immediate inclination strengthened by indulgence prevails over that belief in influencing his conduct why then shall credit be refused to the sincerity of those who acknowledge their persuasion of moral and religious duty yet sometimes fail of living as it requires i heard dr johnson once observe there is something noble in publishing truth though it condemns ones self journal of a tour to the hebrides  d edit p  0   and one who said in his presence he had no notion of people being in earnest in their good professions whose practice was not suitable to them was thus reprimanded by him  sir are you so grossly ignorant of human nature as not to know that a man may be very sincere in good principles without having good practice ibid p       but let no man encourage or soothe himself in presumptuous sin from knowing that johnson was sometimes hurried into indulgences which he thought criminal i have exhibited this circumstance as a shade in so great a character both from my sacred love of truth and to show that he was not so weakly scrupulous as he has been represented by those who imagine that the sins of which a deep sense was upon his mind were merely such little venial trifles as pouring milk into his tea on good friday his understanding will be defended by my statement if his consistency of conduct be in some degree impaired but what wise man would for momentary gratifications deliberately subject himself to suffer such uneasiness as we find was experienced by johnson in reviewing his conduct as compared with his notion of the ethics of the gospel let the following passages be kept in remembrance  o god giver and preserver of all life by whose power i was created and by whose providence i am sustained look down upon me with tenderness and mercy grant that i may not have been created to be finally destroyed that i may not be preserved to add wickedness to wickedness prayers and meditations p      o lord let me not sink into total depravity look down upon me and rescue me at last from the captivity of sin ibid p      almighty and most merciful father who have continued my life from year to year grant that by longer life i may become less desirous of sinful pleasures and more careful of eternal happiness ibid      let not my years be multiplied to increase my guilt but as my age advances let me become more pure in my thoughts more regular in my desires and more obedient to thy laws ibid   0   forgive o merciful lord whatever i have done contrary to thy laws give me such a sense of my wickedness as may produce true contrition and effectual repentance so that when i shall be called into another state i may be received among the sinners to whom sorrow and reformation have obtained pardon for jesus christs sake amen ibid p   0   such was the distress of mind such the penitence of johnson in his hours of privacy and in his devout approaches to his maker his sincerity therefore must appear to every candid mind unquestionable  it is of essential consequence to keep in view that there was in this excellent mans conduct no false principle of commutation no deliberate indulgence in sin in consideration of a counterbalance of duty his offending and his repenting were distinct and separate dr johnson related with an earnestness of approbation a story of a gentleman who in an impulse of passion overcame the virtue of a young woman when she said to him i am afraid we have done wrong he answered yes we have done wrong  for i would not debauch her mind  and when we consider his almost unexampled attention to truth his inflexible integrity his constant piety who will dare to cast a stone at him besides let it never be forgotten that he cannot be charged with any offense indicating badness of heart any thing dishonest base or malignant but that on the contrary he was charitable in an extraordinary degree so that even in one of his own rigid judgments of himself eastereve      while he says i have corrected no external habits he is obliged to own i hope that since my last communion i have advanced by pious reflections in my submission to god and my benevolence to man prayers and meditations p       i am conscious that this is the most difficult and dangerous part of my biographical work and i cannot but be very anxious concerning it i trust that i have got through it preserving at once my regard to truth  to my friend  and to the interests of virtue and religion nor can i apprehend that more harm can ensue from the knowledge of the irregularity of johnson guarded as i have stated it than from knowing that addison and parnell were intemperate in the use of wine which johnson himself in his lives of those celebrated writers and pious men has not forborne to record  it is not my intention to give a very minute detail of the particulars of johnsons remaining days of whom it it was now evident that the crisis was fast approaching when he must die like men and fall like one of the princes yet it will be instructive as well as gratifying to the curiosity of my readers to record a few circumstances on the authenticity of which they may perfectly rely as i have been at the utmost pains to obtain them from the best authority  dr heberden dr brocklesby dr warren and dr butter physicians generously attended him without accepting of any fees as did mr cruikshank surgeon and all that could be done from professional skill and ability was tried to prolong a life so truly valuable he himself indeed having on account of his very bad constitution been perpetually applying himself to medical inquiries united his own efforts with those of the gentlemen who attended him and imagining that the dropsical collection of water which oppressed him might be drawn off by making incisions in his body he with his usual resolute defiance of pain cut deep when he thought that his surgeon had done it too tenderly this bold experiment sir john hawkins has related in such a manner as to suggest a charge against johnson of intentionally hastening his end a charge so very inconsistent with his character in every respect that it is injurious even to refute it as sir john has thought it necessary to do it is evident that what johnson did in hopes of relief indicated an extraordinary eagerness to retard his dissolution   about eight or ten days before his death when dr brocklesby paid him his morning visit he seemed very low and desponding and said i have been as a dying man all night he then emphatically broke out in the words of shakspeare  can thou not minister to a mind diseased pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow raze out the written troubles of the brain and with some sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the full bosom of that perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart to which dr brocklesby readily answered from the same great poet   therein the patient must minister unto himself johnson expressed himself much satisfied with the application  on another day after this when talking on the subject of prayer dr brocklesby repeated from juvenal orandum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano and so on to the end of the tenth satire but in running it quickly over he happened in the line qui spatium vitae extremum inter munera ponat to pronounce supremum for extremum at which johnsons critical ear instantly took offense and discoursing vehemently on the unmetrical effect of such a lapse he showed himself as full as ever of the spirit of the grammarian  having no near relations it had been for some time johnsons intention to make a liberal provision for his faithful servant mr francis barber whom he looked upon as particularly under his protection and whom he had all along treated truly as an humble friend having asked dr brocklesby what would be a proper annuity to bequeath to a favorite servant and being answered that it must depend on the circumstances of the master and that in the cafe of a nobleman fifty pounds a year was considered as an adequate reward for many years faithful service then said johnson shall i be nobilissimus for i mean to leave frank seventy pounds a year and i desire you to tell him so it is strange however to think that johnson was not free from that general weakness of being averse to execute a will so that he delayed it from time to time and had it not been for sir john hawkinss repeatedly urging it i think it is probable that his kind resolution would not have been fulfilled after making one which as sir john hawkins informs us extended no further than the promised annuity johnsons final disposition of his property was established by a will and codicil of which copies are subjoined in the name of god amen i samuel johnson being in full possession of my faculties but fearing this night may put an end to my life do ordain this my last will and testament

my executors to deduct and retain all expenses that shall or may be occurred in the execution of my said will or of this codicil thereto out of such estate and effects as i shall die possessed of all the rest residue and remainder of my estate and effects i give and bequeath to my said executors in trust for the said francis barber his executors and administrators witness my hand and seal this ninth day of december       sam johnson l s signed sealed published declared and delivered by the said samuel johnson as and for a codicil to his last will and testament in the presence of us who in his presence and at his request and also in the presence of each other have hereto subscribed our names as witnesses john copley william gibson henry cole   upon these testamentary deeds it is proper to make a few observations  his express declaration with his dying breath of his faith as a christian as it had been often practiced in such solemn writings was of real consequence from this great man as the conviction of a mind equally acute and strong might well overbalance the doubts of others who were his contemporaries the expression polluted may to some convey an impression of more than ordinary contamination but that is not warranted by its genuine meaning as appears from the rambler no    the same word is used in the will of dr sanderson bishop of lincoln who was piety itself  his legacy of two hundred pounds to the representatives of mr innys bookseller in st pauls churchyard was the effect of a very worthy motive he told sir john hawkins that his father having become bankrupt mr innys had assisted him with money or credit to continue his business this said he i consider as an obligation on me to be grateful to his descendants  the amount of his property proved to be considerably more than he had supposed it to be sir john hawkins estimates the bequest to francis barber at a sum little short of fifteen hundred pounds including an annuity of seventy pounds to be paid to him by mr langton in consideration of seven hundred and fifty pounds which johnson had lent to that gentleman sir john seems not a little angry at this bequest and mutters a caveat against ostentatious bounty and favor to negroes but surely when a man has money entirely of his own acquisition especially when he has no near relations he may without blame dispose of it as he pleases and with great propriety to a faithful servant mr barber by the recommendation of his master retired to lichfield where he might pass the rest of his days in comfort  it has been objected that johnson has omitted many of his best friends when leaving books to several as tokens of his last remembrance the names of dr adams dr tailor dr burney mr hector mr murphy the author of this work and others who were intimate with him are not to be found in his will this may be accounted for by considering that as he was very near his dissolution at the time he probably mentioned such as happened to occur to him and that he may have recollected that he had formerly shown others such proofs of his regard that it was not necessary to crowd his will with their names mrs lucy porter was much displeased that nothing was left to her but besides what i have now stated she should have considered that she had left nothing to johnson by her will which was made during his lifetime as appeared at her decease  his enumerating several persons in one group and leaving them each a book at their election might possibly have given occasion to a curious question as to the order of choice had they not luckily fixed on different books his library though by no means handsome in its appearance was sold by mr christie for two hundred and fortyseven pounds nine shillings many people being desirous to have a book which had belonged to dr johnson in many of them he had written little notes sometimes tender memorials of his departed wife as this was dear tettys book sometimes occasional remarks of different sorts mr lysons of cliffords inn has favored me with the two following  in holy rules and helps to devotion by bryan duppa lord bishop of winton preces quidam videtur diligenter tractasse spero non inauditus  in the resicrucian infallible axiomata by john heydon gent prefixed to which are some verses addressed to the author signed ambr waters a m coll ex oxon these latin verses were written to hobbes by bathurst upon his treatise on human nature and have no relation to the book  an odd fraud     the consideration of the numerous papers of which he was possessed seems to have to have struck johnsons mind with a sudden anxiety and as they were in great confusion it is much to be lamented that he had not entrusted some faithful and discreet person with the care and selection of them instead of which he in a precipitate manner burnt masses of them as i should apprehend with little regard to discrimination not that i suppose we have thus been deprived of any compositions which he had ever intended for the public eye but from what escaped the flames i judge that many curious circumstances relating both to himself and other literary characters have perished  two very valuable articles i am sure we have lost which were two quarto volumes containing a full fair and most particular account of his own life from his earliest recollection i owned to him that having accidentally seen them i had read a great deal in them and apologizing for the liberty i had taken asked him if i could help it he placidly answered why sir i do not think you could have helped it i said that i had for once in my life felt half an inclination to commit theft it had come into my mind to carry off those two volumes and never see him more upon my inquiring how this would have affected him sir said h i believe i should have gone mad one of those volumes sir john hawkins informs us he put into his pocket for which the excuse he states is that he meant to preserve it from falling into the hands of a person whom he describes so as to make it sufficiently clear who is meant having strong reasons says he to suspect that this man might find and make an ill use of the book why sir john should suppose that the gentleman alluded to would act in this manner he has not thought fit to explain but what he did was not approved of by johnson who upon being acquainted of it without delay by a friend expressed great indignation and warmly insisted on the book being delivered up and in the supposition of his afterward missing it without knowing by whom it had been taken he said sir i should have gone out of the world distrusting half mankind sir john next day wrote a letter to johnson assigning the reasons for his conduct upon which johnson observed to mr langton bishop sanderson could not have dictated a better letter i could almost say melius est sic penituisse quam non crrasse the agitation into which johnson was thrown by this incident probably made him hastily burn those precious records which must ever be regretted   during his last illness johnson experienced the steady and kind attachment of his numerous friends mr hoole has drawn up a narrative of what passed in the visits which he paid to him during that time from the  0th of november to the   th of december the day of his death inclusive and has favored me with a perusal of it nobody was more attentive to him than mr langton to whom he tenderly said to teneam moriens deficiente manu and i think it highly to the honor of mr windham that his important occupations as an active statesman did not prevent him from paying assiduous respect to the dying sage whom he revered mr langton informs me that one day he found mr burke and four or five more friends sitting with johnson mr burke said to him i am afraid sir such a number of us may be oppressive to you  no sir said johnson it is not so and i must be in a wretched state indeed when your company would not be a delight to me mr burke in a tremulous voice expressive of being very tenderly affected replied my dear sir you have always been too good to me immediately afterward he went away this was the last circumstance in the acquaintance of these two eminent men  it is to the mutual credit of johnson and divines of different communions that although he was a steady churchofengland man there was nevertheless much agreeable intercourse between him and them let me particularly name the late mr la trobe and mr hutton of the moravian profession his intimacy with the english benedictines at paris has been mentioned and as an additional proof of the charity in which he lived with good men of the romish church i am happy in this opportunity of recording his friendship with the reverend thomas hussy d d his catholic majestys chaplain of embassy at the court of london that very respectable man eminent not only for his powerful eloquence as a preacher but for his various abilities and acquisitions  nay though johnson loved a presbyterian the least this did not prevent his having a long and uninterrupted social connection with the reverend dr james fordyce who since his death has gratefully celebrated him in a warm strain of devotional composition  amidst the melancholy clouds which hung over the dying johnson his characteristical manner showed itself on different occasions  when dr warren in the usual style hoped that he was better his answer was no sir you cannot conceive with what acceleration i advance toward death  a man whom he had never seen before was employed one night to t up with him being asked next morning how he liked his attendant his answer was not at all sir the fellows an idiot he is as awkward as a turnspit when first put into the wheel and as sleepy as a dormouse  mr windham having placed a pillow conveniently to support him he thanked him for his kindness and said that will do  all that a pillow can do  he repeated with great spirit a poem consisting of about fifteen stanzas in four lines in alternate rhymes which he said he had composed some years before on occasion of a young gentlemans coming of age saying he had never repeated it but once since he composed it and had given but one copy of it from the specimen of it which mrs piozzi has given of it in her anecdotes p     it is much to be wished that we could see the whole  as he opened a note which his servant brought to him he said an odd thought strikes me  we shall receive no letters in the grave  he requested three things of sir joshua reynolds  to forgive him thirty pounds which he had borrowed of him  to read the bible  and never to use his pencil on a sunday sir joshua readily acquiesced  indeed he showed the greatest anxiety for the religious improvement of his friends to whom he discoursed of its infinite consequence he begged of mr hoole to think of what he had said and to commit it to writing and upon being afterward assured that this was done pressed his hands and in an earnest tone thanked him dr brocklesby having attended him with the utmost assiduity and kindness as his physician and friend he was peculiarly desirous that this gentleman should not entertain any loose speculative notions but be confirmed in the truths of christianity and insisted on his writing down in his presence as nearly as he could collect it the import of what passed on the subject and dr brocklesby having complied with the request he made him sign the paper and urged him to keep it in his own custody as long as he lived  johnson with that native fortitude which amidst all his bodily distress and mental sufferings never forsook him asked dr brocklesby as a man in whom he had confidence to tell him plainly whether he could recover give me said he a direct answer the doctor having first asked him if he could bear the whole truth which way soever it might lead and being answered that he could declared that in his opinion he could not recover without a miracle then said johnson i will take no more physic not even my opiates for i have prayed that i may render up my soul to god unclouded in this resolution he persevered and at the same time used only the weakest kinds of sustenance  the reverend mr strahan who was the son of his friend and had been always one of his great favorites had during johnsons last illness the satisfaction of contributing to soothe and comfort him that gentlemans house at islington of which he is vicar afforded occasionally and easily an agreeable change of place and fresh air and he attended also upon johnson in town in the discharge of the sacred offices of his profession  mr strahan has given me the agreeable assurance that after being in much agitation johnson became quite composed and continued so till his death  dr brocklesby who will not be suspected of fanaticism obliged me with the following accounts  for some time before his death all his fears were calmed and absorbed by the prevalence of his faith and his trust in the merits and propitiation of jesus christ  he talked often to me about the necessity of faith in the sacrifice of jesus as necessary beyond all good works whatever for the salvation of mankind  he pressed me to study dr clarke and to read his sermons i asked him why he pressed dr clark an arian the change of his sentiments with regard to dr clarke is thus mentioned to me in a letter from the late dr adams master of pembroke college oxford  the doctors prejudices were the strongest and certainly in another sense the weakest that ever possessed a sensible man you know his extreme zeal for orthodoxy but did you ever hear what he told me himself that he had made it a rule not to admit dr clarkes name in his dictionary this however wore off at some distance of time he advised with me what books he should read in defense of the christian religion i recommended clarkes evidences of natural and revealed religion as the best of the kind and i find in what is called his prayers and meditations that he was frequently employed in the latter part of his time in reading clarkes sermons  because said he he is fullest on the propitiatory sacrifice  johnson having thus in his mind the true christian scheme at once rational and consolatory uniting justice and mercy in the divinity with the improvement of human nature while the holy sacrament was celebrating in his apartment fervently uttered this prayer the reverend mr strahan took care to have it preserved and has inserted it in prayers and meditations p       almighty and most merciful father i am now as to human eyes it seems about to commemorate for the last time the death of thy son jesus christ our savior and redeemer grant o lord that my whole hope and confidence may be in his merits and thy mercy enforce and accept my imperfect repentance make this commemoration available to the confirmation of my faith the establishment of my hope and the enlargement of my charity and make the death of thy son jesus christ effectual to my redemption have mercy upon me and pardon the multitude of my offenses bless my friends have mercy upon all men support me by thy holy spirit in the days of weakness and at the hour of death and receive me at my death to everlasting happiness for the sake of jesus christ amen  from my brother thomas david i have these particulars  the doctor from the time that he was certain his death was near appeared to be perfectly resigned was seldom or never fretful or out of temper and often said to his faithful servant who gave me this account attend francis to the salvation of your soul which is the object of greatest importance he also explained to him passages in the scripture and seemed to have pleasure in talking upon religious subjects  on monday the   th of december the day on which he died a miss morris daughter to a particular friend of his called and said to francis that she begged to be permitted to see the doctor that she might earnestly request him to give her his blessing francis went into the room followed by the young lady and delivered the message the doctor turned himself in the bed and said god bless you my dear these were the last words he spoke  his difficulty of breathing increased till about seven oclock in the evening when mr barber and mrs desmoulins who were sitting in the room observing that the noise he made in breathing had ceased went to the bed and found he was dead  about two days after his death the following very agreeable account was communicated to mr malone in a letter by the honorable john byng to whom i am much obliged for granting me permission to introduce it in my work  dear sir since i saw you i have had a long conversation with cawston servant to the right honorable william windham  who sat up with dr johnson from nine oclock on sunday evening till ten oclock on monday morning and from what i can gather from him it should seem that dr johnson was perfectly composed steady in hope and resigned to death at the interval of each hour they assisted him to sit up in his bed and move his legs which were in much pain when he regularly addressed himself to servent prayer and though sometimes his voice failed him his senses never did during that time the only sustenance he received was cider and water he said his mind was prepared and the time to his dissolution seemed long at six in the morning he enquired the hour and on being informed said that all went on regularly and he felt he had but a few hours to live  at ten oclock in the morning he parted from cawston saying you should not detain mr windhams servant  i thank you  bear my remembrance to your master cawston says that no man could appear more collected more devout or less terrified at the thoughts of the approaching minute  this account which is so much more agreeable than and somewhat different from yours has given us the satisfaction of thinking that that great man died as he lived full of resignation strengthened in faith and joyful in hope   a few days before his death he had asked sir john hawkins as one of his executors where he should be buried and on being answered doubtless in westminster abbey seemed to feel a satisfaction very natural to a poet and indeed in my opinion very natural to every man of any imagination who has no family sepulcher in which he can be laid with his fathers accordingly upon monday december  0 his remains were deposited in that noble and renowned edifice and over his grave was placed a large blue flagstone with this inscription  samuel johnson ll d obiit xiii die decembris aetatis suae lxxv his funeral was attended by a respectable number of his friends particularly by many of the members of the literary club who were then in town and was also honored by the presence of several of the reverend chapter of westminster his schoolfellow dr tailor performed the mournful office of reading the service  i trust i shall not be accused of affectation when i declare that i find myself unable to express all that i felt upon the loss of such a guide philosopher and friend i shall therefore not say one word of my own but adopt those of an eminent friend which he uttered with an abrupt excellence superior to all studied composition  he has made a chasm which not only nothing can fill up but which nothing has a tendency to fill up  johnson is dead  let us go to the next best  there is nobody  no man can be said to put you in mind of johnson  as johnson had abundant homage paid to him during his life besides the dedications to him by dr goldsmith the reverend dr franklin and the reverend mr wilson which i have mentioned according to their dates there was one by a lady of a versification of aningait and ajut and one by the ingenious mr walker of his rhetorical grammar i have introduced into this work several compliments paid to him in the writings of his contemporaries but the number of them is so great that we may fairly say that there was almost a general tribute  let me not be forgetful of the honor done to him by colonel myddelton of gwaynynog near denbigh who on the banks of a rivulet in his park where johnson delighted to stand and repeat verses erected an urn with the following inscription  this spot was often dignified by the presence of as no inconsiderable circumstance of his same we must reckon the extraordinary zeal of the artists to extend and perpetuate his image i can enumerate a bust by mr nollckens and the many casts which are made from it several pictures by sir joshua reynolds one by mr zoffani and one by mr opie and the following engravings of his portrait   one by cook from sir joshua for the proprietors edition of his folio dictionary    one from ditto by ditto for their quarto edition    one from opie by heath for harrisons edition of his dictionary    one from nollckenss bust of him by bartolozzi for fieldings quarto edition of his dictionary    one small from harding by trotter for his beauties    one small from sir joshua by trotter for his lives of the poets    one small one from sir joshua by hall for the rambler    one small from an original drawing in the possession of mr john simco etched by trotter for another edition of his lives of the poets    one small no painters name etched by tailor for his johnsoniana   0 one folio whole length with his oak stick as described in boswells tour drawn and etched by trotter     one large mezzotinto from sir joshua by doughty     one large roman head from sir joshua by marchi     one octavo holding a book to his eye from sir joshua by hall for his works     one small from a drawing from the life and engraved by trotter for his life published by kearsley     one large from opie by mr townley an ingenious engraver now at berlin this is one of the finest mezzotintos that ever was executed and what renders it of extraordinary value the plate was destroyed after four or five impressions only were taken of one of them is in the possession of sir william scott     one large from sir joshuas first picture of him by heath for this work     and one for lavaters essay on physiognomy in which johnsons countenance is analyzed upon the principles of that fanciful writer    so no writer in this nation ever had such an accumulation of literary honors after his death a sermon upon that event was preached in st marys church oxford before the university by the reverend mr agutter of magdalen college the lives the memoirs the essays both in prose and verse which have been published concerning him would make many volumes the numerous attacks too upon him i consider as making part of his consequence upon the principle which he himself so well knew and asserted many who trembled at his presence were forward in assault when they no longer apprehended danger when one of his little pragmatical foes was invidiously snarling at his fame the reverend dr parr exclaimed with his usual bold animation aye now that the old lion is dead every ass thinks he may kick at him  a monument for him in westminsterabbey was resolved upon soon after his death and has been supported by a most respectable contribution and in the cathedral of his native city of lichfield a smaller one is to be erected to compose his epitaph has excited the warmest competition of genius if laudari a laudato viro be praise which is highly estimable i should not forgive myself were i to omit the following sepulchral verses on the author of the english dictionary written by the right honorable henry flood  no need of latin or of greek to grace our johnsons memory and inscribe his grave his native language claims this mournful space to pay the immortality he gave the character of samuel johnson has i trust been so developed in the course of this work that they who have honored it with a perusal may be considered as well acquainted with him as however it may be expected that i should collect into one view the capital and distinguishing features of this extraordinary man i shall endeavor to acquit myself of that part of my biographical undertaking as i certainly do not see any reason to give a different character of my illustrious friend now from what i formerly gave the greatest part of the sketch of him in my journal of a tour to the hebrides is here adopted  however difficult it may be to do that which many of my readers will do better for themselves  his figure was large and well formed and his countenance of the cast of an ancient statue yet his appearance was rendered strange and somewhat uncouth by convulsive cramps by the scars of that distemper which it was once imagined the royal touch could cure and by a slovenly mode of dress he had the use only of one eye yet so much does mind govern and even supply the deficiency of organs that his visual perceptions as far as they extended were uncommonly quick and accurate so morbid was his temperament that he never knew the natural joy of a free and vigorous use of his limbs when he walked it was like the struggling gait of one in fetters when he rode he had no command or direction of his horse but was carried as if in a balloon that with his constitution and habits of life he should have lived seventyfive years is a proof that an inherent vivida vis is a powerful preservative of the human frame  man is in general made up of contradictory qualities and these will ever show themselves in strange succession where a consistency in appearance at least if not in reality has not been attained by long habits of philosophical discipline in proportion to the native vigor of the mind the contradictory qualities will be the more prominent and more difficult to be adjusted and therefore we are not to wonder that johnson exhibited an eminent example of this remark which i have made upon human nature at different times he seemed a different man in some respects not however in any great or essential article upon which he had fully employed his mind and settled certain principles of duty but only in his manners and in displays of argument and fancy in his talk he was prone to superstition but not to credulity though his imagination might incline him to a belief of the mavelous and the mysterious his vigorous reason examined the evidence with jealousy he was a sincere and zealous christian of high churchofengland and monarchical principles which he would not tamely suffer to be questioned and had perhaps at an early period narrowed his mind somewhat too much both as to religion and politics his being impressed with the danger of extreme latitude in either though he was of a very independent spirit occasioned his appearing somewhat unfavourable to the prevalence of that noble freedom of sentiment which is the best possession of man nor can it be denied that he had many prejudices which however frequently suggested many of his pointed sayings that rather show a playfulness of fancy than any settled malignity he was steady and inflexible in maintaining the obligations of religion and morality both from a regard for the order of society and from a veneration for the great source of all order correct nay stern in his taste hard to please and easily offended impetuous and irritable in his temper but of a most humane and benevolent heart in the olla podrida a collection of essays published at oxford there is an excellent paper upon the character of johnson said to be written by the reverend dr horn now bishop of norwich the following passage is eminently happy  to reject wisdom because the person of him who communicates it is uncouth and his manners are inelegant  what is it but to throw away a pineapple and assign for a reason the roughness of its coat  which showed itself not only in a most liberal charity as far as his circumstances would allow but in a thousand instances of active benevolence he was afflicted with a bodily disease which made him restless and fretful and with a constitutional melancholy the clouds of which darkened the brightness of his fancy and gave a gloomy cast to his whole course of thinking we therefore ought not to wonder at his sallies of impatience and passion at any time especially when provoked by obtrusive ignorance or presuming petulance and allowance must be made for his uttering hasty and satirical sallies even against his best friends and surely when it is considered that amidst sickness and sorrow he exerted his faculties in so many works for the benefit of mankind and particularly that he achieved the great and admirable dictionary of our language we must be astonished at his resolution the solemn text of him to whom much is given much will be required seems to have been ever present to his mind in a igorous sense and to have made him dissatisfied with his labors and acts of goodness however comparatively great so that the unavoidable consciousness of his superiority was in that respect a cause of disquiet he suffered so much from this and from the gloom which perpetually haunted him and made solitude frightful that it may be said of him if in this life only he had hope he was of all men most miserable he loved praise when it was brought to him but was too proud to seek for it he was somewhat susceptible of flattery as he was general and unconfined in his studies he cannot be considered as master of any one particular science but he had accumulated a vast and various collection of learning and knowledge which was so arranged in his mind as to be ever in readiness to be brought forth but his superiority over other learned men consisted chiefly in what may be called the art of thinking the art of using his mind a certain continual power of seizing the useful substance of all that he knew and exhibiting it in a clear and sorcible manner so that knowledge which we often see to be no better than lumber in men of dull understanding was in him true evident and actual wisdom his moral precepts are practical for they are drawn from an intimate acquaintance with human nature his maxims carry conviction for they are founded on the basis of common sense his mind was so full of imagery that he might have been perpetually a poet yet it is remarkable that however rich his prose is in that respect the poetical pieces which he wrote were in general not so but rather strong sentiment and acute observation conveyed in good verse particularly in heroic couplets though usually grave and even aweful in his deportment he possessed uncommon and peculiar powers of wit and humor he frequently indulged himself in colloquial pleasantry and the heartiest merriment was often enjoyed in his company with this great advantage that as it was entirely free from any poisonous tincture of vice or impiety it was salutary to those who shared in it he had accustomed himself to such accuracy in his common conversation though a perfect resemblance of johnson is not to be found in any age parts of his character are admirably expressed by clarendon in drawing that of lord falkland whom the noble and masterly historian describes at his seat near oxford  such an immenseness of wit such a solidity of judgment so infinite a fancy bound in by a most logical ratiocination  his acquaintance was cultivated by the most polite and accurate men so that his house was a university in less volume whither they came not so much for repose as study and to examine and refine those grosser propositions which laziness and consent made current in conversation  bayles account of menage may also be quoted as exceedingly applicable to the great subject of this work  his illustrious friends erected a very glorious monument to him in the collection entitled menagiana those who judge of things aright will confess that this collection is very proper to show the extent of genius and learning which was the character of menage and i may be bold to say that the excellent works he published will not distinguish him from other learned men so advantageously as this to publish books of great learning to make greek and latin verses exceedingly well turned is not a common talent i own neither is it extremely rare it is incomparably more difficult to find men who can furnish discourse about an infinite number of things and who can diversify them an hundred ways how many authors are there who are admired for their works on account of the vast learning that is displayed in them who are not able to sustain a conversation those who know menage only by his books might think he resembled those learned men but if you show the menagiana you distinguish him from them and make him known by a talent which is given to very few learned men there it appears that he was a man who spoke off hand a thousand good things his memory extended to what was ancient and modern to the court and to the city to the dead and to the living languages to things serious and things jocose in a word to a thousand sorts of subjects that which appeared a trifle to some readers of the menagiana who did not consider circumstances caused admiration in other readers who minded the difference between what a man speaks without preparation and that which he prepares for the press and therefore we cannot sufficiently commend the care which his illustrious friends took to erect to him a monument so capable of giving him immortal glory they were not obliged to rectify what they had heard him say for in so doing they had not been faithful historians of his conversations    that he at all times delivered himself with a force and elegant choice of expression the effect of which was aided by his having a loud voice and a slow deliberate utterance he united a most logical head with a most fertile imagination which gave him an extraordinary advantage in arguing for he could reason close or wide as he saw best for the moment exulting in his intellectual strength and dexterity he could when he pleased be the greatest sophist that ever contended in the lists of declamation and from a spirit of contradiction and a delight in showing his powers he would often maintain the wrong side with equal warmth and ingenuity so that when there was an audience his real opinions could seldom be gathered from his talk though when he was in company with a single friend he would discuss a subject with genuine fairness but he was too conscientious to make error permanent and pernicious by deliberately writing it and in all his numerous works he earnestly inculcated what appeared to him to be the truth his piety was constant and was the ruling principle of all his conduct and the more we consider his character we shall be the more disposed to regard him with admiration and reverence  the end to face the last page vol ii  fac
