a school for fathers a comic opera as it is performed at the theater royal in drury lane a new edition  london printed for w griffin at garricks head in catharinestreet strand mdcclxxiii price  s  d  to the right honorable philip earl of chesterfield this opera is inscribed by his most obedient most obliged and most grateful humble servant the author  advertisement having for some years met with very great success in my productions of the musical kind when i wrote the following opera it was with unusual care and attention and it was the general opinion of my friends some of whom rank among the best judges that of all my trifles lionel and clarissa was the most pardonable a decision in its favor which i was the prouder of because to the best of my knowledge through the whole i had not borrowed an expression a sentiment or a character from any dramatic writer extant  when mr garrick thought of performing this piece at drury lane theater he had a new singer to bring out and every thing possible for her advantage was to be done this necessarily occasioned some new songs and airs to be introduced and other singers with voices of a different compass from those who originally acted the parts occasioned still more by which means the greatest part of the music unavoidably became new this is the chief and indeed the only alteration made in the opera and even to that i should in many places have been forced much against my will had it not given a fresh opportunity to mr dibdin to display his admirable talents as a musical composer and i will be bold to say that his airs serious and comic in this opera will appear to no disadvantage by being heard with those of some of the greatest masters  a table of the songs with the names of the several composers n b those marked

much money do you think a duke would expect with such a wench   jen why colonel with submission i think there is no occasion to go out of our own county here we have never a duke in it i believe but we have many an honest gentleman who in my opinion might deserve the young lady   col so you would have me marry die to a country squire eh how say you to this die would not you rather be married to a duke   dian so my husbands a rake papa i dont care what he is   col a rake you damned confounded little baggage why you would not wish to marry a rake would you  so her husband is a rake she does not care what he is ha ha ha ha   dian well but listen to me papa  when you go out with your gun do you take any pleasure in shooting the poor tame ducks and chickens in your yard no the partridge the pheasant the woodcock are the game there is some sport in bringing them down because they are wild and it is just the same with an husband or a lover i would not waste powder and shot to wound one of your sober pretty behaved gentlemen but to hit a libertine extravagant madcap fellow to take him upon the wing    col do you hear her mr jenkins ha ha ha   jen well but good colonel what do you say to my worthy and honorable patron here sir john flowerdale he has an estate of eight thousand pounds a year as well paid rents as any in the kingdom and but one only daughter to enjoy it and yet he is

one i ever was acquainted with that did not make love to me   col ay mr jenkins who is this lionel they say he is a damned witty knowing fellow and egad i think him well enough for one brought up in a college   jen his father was a general officer a particular friend of sir johns who like many more brave men that live and die in defending their country left little else than honor behind him sir john sent this young man at his own expense to oxford where while his son lived they were upon the same footing and since our young gentlemans death which you know unfortunately happened about two years ago he has continued him there during the vacation he is come to pay us a visit and sir john intends that he shall shortly take orders for a very considerable benefice in the gift of the family

brain for mathematics indeed we shall have women wanting to head our regiments tomorrow or next day   dian well papa and suppose we did i believe in a battle of the sexes you men would hardly get the better of us  to rob them of strength when wise nature thought fit by women to still do her duty instead of a sword she endud them with wit and gave them a shield in their beauty sound sound then the trumpet both sexes to arms our tyrants at once and protectors we quickly shall see whether courage or charms decide for the helens or hectors  scene ii colonel oldboy jenkins col well mr jenkins dont you think now that a nobleman a duke an earl or a marquis might be content to share his title  i say you understand me  with a sweetener of thirty or forty thousand pounds to pay off mortgages besides there is a prospect of my whole estate for i dare swear her brother will never have any children   jen i should be concerned at that colonel when there are two such fortunes to descend to his heirs as yours and sir john flowerdales   col why look you mr jenkins sir john flowerdale is an honest gentleman our families are nearly related we have been neighbors time out of mind and if he and i have an odd dispute now and then it is not for want of a cordial esteem at bottom he is going to marry his daughter to my son she is a beautiful girl an elegant girl a sensible girl a worthy girl and  a word in your ear  damn me if i ant very sorry for her   jen sorry colonel   col ay  between ourselves mr jenkins my son will not do   jen how do you mean   col i tell you mr jenkins he will not do  he is

with water   jen oh if that be his only fault colonel he will never make the worse husband i will answer for it   col you know my wife is a woman of quality  i was prevailed upon to send him to be brought up by her brother lord jessamy who had no children of his own and promised to leave him an estate  he has got the estate indeed but the fellow has taken his lordships name for it now mr jenkins i would be glad to know how the name of jessamy is better than that of oldboy   jen well but colonel it is allowed on all hands that his lordship has given your son an excellent education   col pshaw he sent him to the university and to travel forsooth but what of that i was abroad and at the university myself and never a rush the better for either i quarrelled with his lordship about six years before his death and so had not an opportunity of seeing how the youth went on if i had mr jenkins i would no more have suffered him to be made such a monkey of  he has been in my house but three days and it is all turned topsyturvy by him and his rascally servants  then his chamber is like a perfumers shop with washballs pastes and pomatum  and do you know he had the impudence to tell me yesterday at my own table that i did not know how to behave myself   jen pray colonel how does my lady mary   col what my wife in the old way mr jenkins always complaining ever something the matter with her head or her back or her legs  but we have had the devil to pay lately  she and i did not speak to one another for three weeks   jen how so sir   col a little affair of jealousy  you must know my gamekeepers daughter has had a child and the plaguey baggage takes it into her head to lay it to me  upon my soul it is a fine fat chubby infant as ever i set my eyes on i have sent it to nurse and between you and me i believe i shall leave it a fortune   jen ah colonel you will never give over   col you know my lady has a pretty vein of poetry she writ me an heroic epistle upon it where she calls me her dear false damon so i let her cry a little promised to do so no more and now we are as good friends as ever   jen well colonel i must take my leave i have delivered my message and sir john may expect the pleasure of your company to dinner   col ay ay well come  pox of ceremony among friends but will not you stay to see my son i have sent to him and suppose he will be here as soon as his valetdechambre will give him leave   jen there is no occasion good sir present my humble respects that is all   col well but zounds jenkins you must not go till you drink something  let you and i have a bottle of hock    jen not for the world colonel i never touch any thing strong in the morning   col never touch anything strong why one bottle will not hurt you man this is old and as mild as milk   jen well but colonel pray excuse me  to tell you the truth in the days of my youth as mirth and nature bid i liked a glass and i loved a lass and i did as younkers did but now i am old with grief be it told i must these freaks forbear at sixtythree twixt you and me a man grows worse for wear  scene iii mr jessamy lady mary oldboy and then colonel oldboy lady m shut the door why dont you

steward who has lived in the family these forty years   mr jess and pray sir might not sir john flowerdale have come himself if he had been acquainted with the rules of good breeding he would have known that i ought to have been visited   lady m upon my word colonel this is a solecism   col sblood my lady it is none sir john flowetdale came but last night from his sisters seat in the west and is a little out of order but i suppose he thinks he ought to appear before him with his daughter in one hand and his rentroll in the other and cry sir pray do me the favor to accept them   lady m nay but mr oldboy permit me to say    col he need not give himself so many affected airs i think it is very well if he gets such a girl for going for she is one of the handsomest and richest in this country and more than he deserves   mr jess that is an exceeding fine china jar your ladyship has got in the next room i saw the fellow of it the other day at williams and will send to my agent to purchase it it is the true matchless old blue and white lady betty barebones has a couple that she gave an hundred guineas for on board an indiaman but she reckons them at a hundred and twentyfive on account of half a dozen of plates four nankeen beakers and a couple of shaking mandarins that the customhouse officers took from under her petticoats   col did you ever hear the like of this he is

down colonel what do you mean i must tell you sir this is a language to which i have not been accustomed and if you think proper to continue or repeat it i shall be under a necessity of quitting your house   col quitting my house   mr jess yes sir incontinently   col why sir am not i your father sir and have not i a right to talk to you as i like i will sirrah but perhaps i may not be your father

my late dear brother lord jessamy they never could agree that good natured friendly soul knowing the delicacy of my constitution has often said sister mary i pity you not but your papa has good qualities and i assure you i remember him a very fine gentleman himself in the year of the hard frost one thousand seven hundred and thirtynine when he first paid his addresses to me he was called agreeable jack oldboy though i married him without the consent of your noble grandfather   mr jess i think he ought to be proud of me i believe there is many a duke nay prince who would esteem themselves happy in having such a son    lady m yes my dear but your sister was always your papas favorite he intends to give her a prodigious fortune and sets his heart upon seeing her a woman of quality   mr jess he should wish to see her look a little like a gentlewoman first when she was in london last winter i am told she was taken notice of by a few men but she wants air manner    lady m and has not a bit of the genius of our family and i never knew a woman of it but herself without i have tried her about three years ago i set her to translate a little french song i found she had not even an idea of versification and she put down love and joy for rhyme  so i gave her over   mr jess why indeed she appears to have more of the thalestris than the sappho about her   lady m well my dear i must go and dress myself though i protest i am fitter for my bed than my coach and condescend to the colonel a little  do my dear if it be only to oblige your mamma   scene v mr jessamy hold a little i am going to see a provincial baronet here who would fain prevail upon me to marry his daughter the old gentleman has heard of my parts and understanding miss of my figure and address but suppose i should not like her on an interview why positively then i will not have her the treatys at an end and sans compliment we break up the congress  antoine appretez la toilet i am going to spend a cursed day that i perceive already i heartily wish my visit was over  when a man of fashion condescends to herd among his country friends they watch his looks his motions one boeby gapes another stares and all be says does ates drinks wears must suit their rustic notions but as for this brutish old clown here gods death why did i ever come down here the savage will now never quit me then a

enters followed by jenny jen my dear lady what ails you   clar nothing jenny nothing   jen pardon me madam there is something ails you indeed lord what signifies all the grandeur and riches in this world if they cannot procure one content i am sure it vexes me to the heart so it does to see such a dear sweet worthy young lady as you are pining yourself to death   clar jenny you are a good girl and i am very much obliged to you for feeling so much on my account but in a little time i hope i shall be easier   jen why now here to day madam for sartain you ought to be merry today when there is a fine gentleman coming to court you but if you like any one else better i am sure i wish you had him with all my soul   clar suppose jenny i was so unfortunate as to like a man without my fathers approbation would you wish me married to him   jen i wish you married to any one madam that could make you happy   clar heigho   jen madam madam yonder is sir john and mr lionel on the terras i believe they are coming up here poor dear mr lionel he does not seem to be in over great spirits either to be sure madam it is no business of mind but i believe if the truth was known there are those in the house who would give more than ever i shall be worth or any the likes of me to prevent the marriage of a sartain person that shall be nameless   clar what do you mean i dont understand you   jen i hope you are not angry madam   clar ah jenny    jen lauk madam do you think when mr lionels a clergyman he will be obliged to cut off his hair i am sure it will be a thousand pities for it is the sweetest color and looks the nicest put up in a cue   clar i am going into my dressing room  it seems then mr lionel is a great favorite of yours but pray jenny have a care how you talk in this manner to any one else   jen me talk madam i thought you knew me better and my dear lady keep up your spirits i am sure i have dressed you today as nice as hands and pins can make you  i am but a poor servant it is true maam but was i a lady like you maam in grief would i sit the dickens a bit no faith i would search the world through maam to find what my liking could hit set in case a young man in my fancy there ran it might anger my friends and relations but if i had regard it should go very hard or i would follow my own inclinations  scene vii sir john flowerdale lionel sir john indeed lionel i will not hear of it what to run from us all of a sudden this way and at such a time too the eve of my daughters wedding as i may call it when your company must be doubly agreeable as well as necessary to us i am sure you have no studies at present that require your attendance at oxford i must therefore insist on your putting such thoughts out of your head   lion upon my word sir i have been so long from the university that it is time for me to think of returning it is true i have no absolute studies but really sir i shall be obliged to you if you will give me leave to go   sir john come come my dear lionel i have for some time observed a more than ordinary gravity growing upon you and i am not to learn the reason of it i know to minds serious and well inclined like yours the sacred function you are about to embrace    lion dear sir your goodness to me of every kind is so great so unmerited your condescension your friendly attentions  in short sir i want words to express my sense of obligations    sir john fie fie no more of them by my last letters i find that my old friend the rector still continues in good health considering his advanced years you may imagine i am far from desiring the death of so worthy and pious a man yet i must own at this time i could wish you were in orders as you might then perform the ceremony of my daughters marriage which would give me a secret satisfaction   lion no doubt sir any office in my power that could be instrumental to the happiness of any of your family i should perform with pleasure   sir john why really lionel from the character of her intended husband i have no room to doubt but this match will make clarissa perfectly happy to be sure the alliance is the most eligible for both families   lion if the gentleman is sensible of his happiness in the alliance sir    sir john the fondness of a father is always suspected of partiality yet i believe i may venture to say that few young women will be found more unexceptionable than my daughter her person is agreeable her temper sweet her understanding good and with the obligations she has to your instruction    lion you do my endeavors too much honor sir i have been able to add nothing to miss flowerdales accomplishments but a little knowledge in matters of small importance to a mind already so well improved   sir john i dont think so a little knowledge even in those matters is necessary for a woman in whom i am far from considering ignorance as a desirable characteristic when intelligence is not attended with impertinent affectation it teaches them to judge with precision and gives them a degree of solidity necessary for the companion of a sensible man   lion yonder is mr jenkins i fancy he is looking for you sir   sir john i see him he is come back from colonel oldboys here is my daughter coming to you too i have a few words to say to jenkins and will return to you again in a minute   scene viii lionel clarissa lion perhaps madam you are not at leisure now otherwise if you thought proper we would resume the subject we were upon yesterday   clar i am sure sir i give you a great deal of trouble   lion madam you give me no trouble i should think every hour of my life happily employed in your service and as this is probably the last time i shall have the satisfaction of attending you upon the same occasion    clar upon my word mr lionel i think myself extremely obliged to you and shall ever consider the enjoyment of your friendship    lion my friendship madam can be of little moment to you but if the most perfect adoration if the warmest wishes for your felicity though i should never be witness of it if these madam can have any merit to continue in your remembrance a man once honored with a share of your esteem    clar hold sir  i think i hear somebody   lion if you please madam we will turn over this celestial globe once more  have you looked at the book i left you yesterday   clar really sir i have been so much disturbed in my thoughts for these two or three days past that i have not been able to look at any thing   lion i am sorry to hear that madam i hope there was nothing particular to disturb you the care sir john takes to dispose of your hand in a manner suitable to your birth and fortune    clar i dont know sir  i own i am disturbed i own i am uneasy there is something weighs upon my heart which i would fain disclose   lion upon your heart madam did you say your heart   clar i did sir  i   enter jenny jen madam madam here is a coach and six driving up the avenue it is colonel oldboys family and i believe the gentleman is in it that is coming to court you  lord i must run and have a peep at him out of the window   lion madam i will take my leave   clar why so sir  bless me mr lionel what is the matter  you turn pale   lion madam   clar pray speak to me sir  you tremble  tell me the cause of this sudden change  how are you  where is your disorder   lion oh fortune fortune  you ask me in vain of what ills i complain where barbours the torment i find in my head in my heart it invades every part and subdues both my body and mind each effort i try every medicine apply the pangs of my soul to appease but doomed to endure what i mean for a cure turns poison and feeds the disease  scene ix clarissa diana dian my dear clarissa  i am glad i have found you alone  for heavens sake dont let any one break in upon us  and give me leave to sit down with you a little  i am in such a tremor    clar mercy on us what has happened   dian you may remember i told you that when we were last winter in london i was followed by an odious fellow one harman i cannot say but the wretch pleased me though he is but a younger brother and not worth sixpence and  in short when i was leaving town i promised to correspond with him   clar do you think that was prudent   dian madness but this is not the worst for what do you think the creature had the assurance to write to me about three weeks ago desiring permission to come down and spend the summer at my fathers   clar at your fathers   dian ay who never saw him knows nothing of him and would as soon consent to my marrying a horsejockey he told me a long story of some tale he intended to invent to make my father receive him as an indifferent person and some gentleman in london he said would procure him a letter that should give it a face and he longed to see me so he said he could not live without it and if he could be permitted but to spend a week with me    clar well and what answer did you make   dian oh abused him and refused to listen to any such thing  but  i vow i tremble while i tell it you  just before we left our house the impudent monster arrived there attended by a couple of servants and is now actually coming here with my father   clar upon my word this is a dreadful thing   dian dreadful my dear  i happened to be at the window as he came into the court and i declare i had like to have fainted away   clar is not my lady below   dian yes and i must run down to her you will have my brother here presently too he would fain have come in the coach with my mother and me but my father insisted on his walking with him over the fields   clar well diana with regard to your affair  i think you must find some method of immediately informing this gentleman that you consider the outrage he has committed against you in the most heinous light and insist upon his going away directly   dian why i believe that will be the best way  but then he will be begging my pardon and asking to stay   clar why then you must tell him positively you will not consent to it and if he persists in so extravagant a design tell him you will never see him again as long as you live   dian must i tell him so  ah prythee spare me dearest creature how can you prompt me to so much ill nature kneeling before me should i hear himimplore me could i accuse him could i refuse him the boon he should ask set not a lover the cruel task no believe me my dear was he now standing here in spite of my frights and alarms i might rate him might scold him  but should still strive to hold him  and sink at last into his arms  scene x clarissa how easy to direct the conduct of others how hard to regulate our own i can give my friend advice while i am conscious of the same indiscretions in myself yet is it criminal to know the most worthy most amiable man in the world and not to be insensible to his merit but my father the kindest best of fathers will he approve the choice i have made nay has he not made another choice for me and after all how can i be sure that the man i love loves me again he never told me so but his looks his actions his present anxiety sufficiently declare what his dclicacy his generofity will not suffer him to utter   ye gloomy thoughts ye fears perverse like sullen vapors all disperse and scatter in toe wind delusive phantoms brood of night no more my sickly fancy fright no more my reason blind it is done i feel my soul released the visions fly the mists are chased nor leave a cloud behind  scene xi changes to a view of sir john flowerdales house with gates and a prospect of the garden harman enters

cursedly plagued by his wifes relations   har sir richard was always a man of spirit colonel   col but as to this business of yours which he tells me of in his letter  i dont see much in it  an affair with a citizens daughter  pinked her brother in a duel  is the fellow likely to die   har why sir we hope not but as the matter is dubious and will probably make some noise i thought it was better to be for a little time out of the way when hearing my case sir richard rantum mentioned you he said he was sure you would permit me to remain at your house for a few days and offered me a recommendation   col and there is likely to be a brat in the case  and the girls friends are in business  i will tell you what will be the consequence then  they will be for going to law with you for a maintenance  but no matter i will take the affair in hand for you  make me your solicitor and if you are obliged to pay for a single spoonful of pap i will be content to father all the children in the foundling hospital   har i am sure sir you are very kind   col but hold  hark you  you say there is money to be had  suppose you were to marry the wench   har do you think sir that would be so right after what

more discourse with you about this girl perhaps she is a neighbor of mine and i may be of service to you   har do you think you could   col i dare to say   har but perhaps you might not choose   col
