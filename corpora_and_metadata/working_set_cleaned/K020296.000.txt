henry the second or the fall of rosamond  price one shilling and sixpence  henry the second or the fall of rosamond a tragedy as it is performed at the theater royal covent garden  written by thomas hull  poor artless maid to stain thy spotless name expense and art and toil united strove to lure a breast that felt the purest flame sustained by virtue but betrayed by love shenstones elegies london printed for john bell near exeterexchange strand  mdcclxxiv  preface i hold it an indispensible duty to mention some circumstances which gave birth to the following scenes wherein i shall not only indulge my pride but perhaps in some degree palliate the boldness and as it may be thought by many presumption of my understanding  the fable and conduct of this tragedy were projected as long ago as the year      by the late mr shenstone at his sweet retirement the leasowes in warwickshire herein consists my pride that i enjoyed a happy but too short intimacy with that amiable and accomplished man  in the summer of that same year see mr shenstones letter no  0  to mr graves sept         mr shenstone had been present at the performance of a hasty alteration of mr hawkinss tragedy of henry and rosamond which i produced at the theater at birmingham for the temporary use of a particular friend undigested and imperfect as it was that excellent judge said there was a pathos in the story which notwithstanding the defects of the drama made the representation very pleasing and he signified his wonder that such an affecting and popular tale should not have found its way to the stage hence arose many conversations on the subject all which terminated in his advising me to make the story my own the known kindness of his heart perhaps gave me credit for greater abilities than i really possessed he continued to encourage me with a warmth which flatters me in the pecollection and after i had left warwickshire obliged me with several letters to the same purpose which i still preserve as valuable relicts  in one of those letters he suggested the character of the abbot in order as he said to add a little more business to a story which otherwise might be too barren to furnish matter for five acts it may easily be supposed i forthwith adopted his idea and carefully treasured in my mind every sentiment he let fall on this as well as other subjects and i can say with great truth that among the many conversations i enjoyed with that excellent man i never knew one from which i did not derive considerable instruction as well as delight  the unexpected loss of this most estimable friend he died feb         which will ever be lamented by all who knew him dispirited me from the undertaking and i laid aside my plan together with all his letters till the beginning of last year the scheme itself it is true had often in the interval occurred to my remembrance but a doubt of my ability to execute it even in a passable manner deterred me from the attempt  mrs hartleys arrival at covent garden theater and the warm solicitations of a friend induced me once more to resume the design the happy suitability if i may be allowed the phrase of her figure to the description of rosamond as may be found in dr percys amusing and instructive collection of old ballads vol ii page     viz her crisped locks like threads of gold appeared to each mans sight her sparkling eyes etc etc assisted by the softness and gentleness of her demeanor encouraged me at length to make the attempt and the unniverfal aprobation given by the public to her appearance manner and performance on the first representation of this play happily convinced me i was not singular in my opinion  in the general execution of the piece i have paid a particular attention to the old ballad and endeavored at a simplicity of style both which mr shenstone earnestly recommended i am not conscious of any further helps except having adopted the idea not the matter of an interview between the king and clifford in the monastery from mr hawkins  i had originally made clifford die of a broken heart under the sction of the death of king lear as originally drawn by that great master of human nature shakespeare but the general opinion of the public and the persuasions of my friends induced me to vary my design in the representation  i have little further to add but my entreaties that the reader will be pleased to judge with lenity what was undertaken with diffidence  advised assisted and encouraged as i was originally to this undertaking by the possessor of such eminent abilities and such benignity of disposition i seek no living patron but pride myself in having this opportunity to dedicate my humble production  with the warmest affection and gratitude  to the memory of william shenstone esquire  westminster january          advertisement the author would justly incur the charge of ingratitude were he not to return his warmest acknowledgments to the public for their very indulgent reception of this play to mr colman for his spirited and deservedly admired epilogue and to the performers for their zeal and assiduity in the study and support of their respective characters  prologue written and spoken by the author long time oppressed with painful doubts and fears at length the dread decisive hour appears the awful trial comes and here i stand to abide the verdict of my native land will not the judge himself for favor plead when the poor trembling culprit owns the de when in false arts he scorns to seck support but throws him on the mercy of the court such is my state whom will ambition draws to stand the judgment of dramatic laws bold the attempt and much i fear in vain that i the humblest in the muses train should dare produce in this nicejudging age my own weak efforts on the dangerous stage had i the slightest touch of plaintive row whose numbers often have bade your sorrows flow your plaudit undismayed i might implore and rosamond might plead like hapless shore but as it is your kindness be my friend for that alone i sue  to that i bend if by an artless tale in artless strain a mild and patient hearing i obtain and my poor labors over behold ye part with unpaind ear and undisgusted heart twere triumph and delight but if the lays deserve your censure which aspired to praise even to your kindness will i not presume nor strive to deprecate my proper doom this sole indulgence let my fault procure mildly inflict submissive i endure characters henry ii king of england mr smith henry prince of wales mr wroughton

power of vengeance to stain my native land with civil slaughter no heaven forefend nor should a danger reach my sovereigns sacred life were there a wretch accursed enough to raise his traitorous arm

dear semblance of her mothers sweetness and promised an unsullied length of days she is lost and the bright glories of our line are stained in her disgrace  salisbury thy pious heart alive to all the dangers and mishaps that wait on tempting beauty does not need my interposing voice to wake soft pity for the lost rosamond the love of goodness not wholly leaves the breast that error stains but often abides a wholesome monitor to call the miserable culprit back to its forsaken laws so may it fare with her it is true the king when in her sight engrosses all her thoughts but in her secret and solitary hours sad she regrets her ruined innocence and mourns that love which led her to destroy a fathers peace and stain the honors of a spotless line  clifford to save her from a deeper plunge in

spirit will not brook it what avails the empty name and title of a king without imperial power why with his son divide his throne unless he meant to grant a share of that supreme authority which only lends stability to greatness and gives its highest luster  to be caught with the gay tinselld garb of royalty befits an idiot only let him know that henrys son inherits henrys pride and may in time with daring hand assume what now he is debarred  leicester your wrongs are great but be not too precipitate and rash lest you therein defeat the means by which you wish to gain beware the watchful eye of curiosity besets our paths speak not so loud  prince what danger should the king himself oerhear confront me face to face i would not shrink mine eye should not abate its angry fire nor my sunk

i try to win her to our cause the frequent wrongs which fire her haughty mind joined to affection for her young henry may engage her help in any scheme that promises revenge but soft  the present is

mischief broods within his mind perhaps towered me for he of late has shown me marks of respect and courtesy wherein he was not wont to deal time only will explain the object of his present aims for

holy house in deep atonement for the barbarous fall of that dear murdered saint  queen and what attones for eleanors loud wrongs her murdered peace will all the penances ever yet devised by dronish priests relieve my tortured heart will they recall my henrys truant love or blast the charms of that deluding witch who lures him from me this is the redress which eleanor demands  this the revenge

of bitter recollection and repelled encroaching agony  my henry gave thee a servant to my use but thy mild nature so ill adapted to the lowly state wherein thy lot was cast taught me to change that servile title for the name of friend  ethelinda give me that office now and let me speak thy meanings there  rosamond i know not what i mean in vain alas she strives to please herself who has offended virtue on that paper i wished to pour my duty to my father implore his dear forgiveness beg one blessing ere yet he sleep in peace  oh rosamond well have thou spoke for in the grave alone can clifferd rest  peace and repose on earth thine impious offenses have denied him ere this perhaps he is laid low in dust and his last hours were charged with grief and shame  ethelinda hope better my fair mistress raise thy thoughts from the dark musings of despondent woe to these bright scenes of happiness and joy  rosamond i have no title to them these bright scenes may give delight to unpolluted breasts but not to mine the charmer happiness has long deserted me with her loved mate seraphic innocence she winged her flight i fear for ever  this retired abode graced with each ornament inventive fancy can furnish to allure the admiring eye serves but to sting me deeper with remorse upon my cheek imprint a stronger glow of conscious shame reflecting on the cause the wretched cause that brought me to their view  ethelinda these are the dictates of deforming spleen that to the low dejected mind presents false and disgustful objects henrys absence is the sad source that casts this mournful gloom on all around three days have now elapsed unmarked by him and love when he arrives the bower the groves will wear a fairer aspect and all be dressed in beauty and delight  rosamond it is true i try to wear the smile of joy in my dear conquerors sight nay i do wear it my heart acknowledges the soft delight his presence gives had i not loved too well i had not been this wretch  my soul doats on him i live but in his looks why was he not by fate ordained some rustic villager and i the mistress of a neighbor cot that we had met as happy equals do and lived in pleasures unallayd by guilt  ethelinda yet to engage the dear the tender hours which royal henry spares from public toils to call that heart your own which all agree to love and honor feast upon those smiles which millions sigh for   rosamond cease my ethelinda thou know not how thy words afflict my breast think not though fallen from innocence my mind is callous to the feelings of humanity of truth or justice i reflect full often even in my happiest moments there lives one who has a right to henrys every hour each tender vow and each attractive smile i know it and condemn my feeble heart for yielding to desires all moral laws forbid and inborn reason disapproves  ethelinda you school yourself too harshly  rosamond oh not so i have much more to bear i have not yet learned the great duty expiation claims to part my ethelinda  ethelinda part from whom  rosamond from henry  from the monarch of my heart my wishes lord my all of earthly bliss thou marvelst at my words  but it must be it is the sole atonement i can make to a fond fathers woes his injured fame the tarnishd glories of a noble line the royal eleanors insulted rights and my own conscious selfarraigning heart  ethelinda oh do not flatter that fond heart with hope of such exertive power beneath the trial your strength would fail your resolution droop you could not yield him up  rosamond by my warm hopes of mild remission to my great offenses i feel my bosom equal to the task hard as it is so henry left me not in anger or unkindness but resigned me with the dear care of a protecting friend to the soft paths of penitence and peace i would embrace the torment it entailed and bless him for each pang  ethelinda behold he comes exit enter the king king my rosamond my ever new delight receive me to thy arms enfold me there where everblooming sweets perpetual rise and lull my cares to rest  rosamond it was not thus my henry used to visit this retreat bright cheerfulness was wont to dance around him complacent sweetness sat upon his brow and soft content beamed lovely from his eye  king well thou reprovst me i will strive to chase the gloomy cloud that overhangs my spirit the effect of public business public cares my telltale looks i fear will speak the pain my heart still suffers from that strangers converse aside often do i mourn the duties of my station that call my thoughts to them and claim the hours which i would dedicate to love and thee  rosamond i meant not to reproach thee twas my zeal for the dear quiet of thy mind that spoke i cannot see the slightest shade of grief dim the bright luster of thy chearing eye but apprehension pains me lest for me thy glory be diminished to the world  king i seek not empty popular acclaims thy tender accents falling on mine ear like rural warblings on the panting breeze convey more rapture more supreme delight than iopaeans of a shouting world  rosamond to see bright satisfaction glow within thy manly cheek behold the rising smile and hear thee speak the gladness of thy heart is my best joy my triumph and my pride and yet my henry ought it to be so still should i listen to the siren pleasure while awful virtue lifts her sober voice and warns my heart of her neglected precepts  king forbear forbear these soft complaints and speak of rapture speak of my improving ardour and thy unceasing love  rosamond oh thou divinst not how many heavy hours and sleepless nights thy rose endures how much my faulty state blessed as i am in thee arraigns my mind often in the bitter hours when thou art absent my fathers image rises to my view arrayed in gloomy grief and stern reproof nay do not eye me with that melting fondness have thou not often bade me cast my cares on thee and told me thou would bear them for me hear then oh hear me for to whom but thee can i unload my heart  king oh speak not thus should these sad accents stain the precious moments when henry flies from a tumultuous world to tranquil joys to happiness and thee what busy fiend invidious to our loves torments thy gentle breast  rosamond trust me my henry this is no sudden gust of wayward temper it is reasons impulse often has my heart endured afflictive pangs when my unclouded face has worn a forced and temporary smile because i would not hurt thy noble mind advancing time but multiplies my torments and gives them double strength they will have vent oh my protector make one glorious effort worthy thyself  remove me from thy arms yield me to solitudes repentant shade  king renounce thee did thou say my rosamond were those the words of her and love  rosamond they were it is my love entreats that love which owns thee for its first its last its only lord allow me to indulge it undisturbed by the sore miseries which now surround me without the sense of guilt that fiend who waits on all my actions on my every thought  king by heaven i never knew distress till now thy accents cleave my soul thou do not know what complicated agonies and pangs thy cruelty prepares for henrys heart he must endure a throe like that which rends the seated earth ere he can summon strength to banish thee for ever from his arms  rosamond think conscience honor plead  king down busy fiend aside that strangers tale and cliffords crying wrongs distract my tortured mind  in pity cease  to ros i cannot part with thee  rosamond a thousand motives urge thy compliance  will not public claims soon call thee from thy realm when thou art gone who shall protect me who shall then provide a safe asylum for thy rosamord to guard her weakness from assailing fears and threatening dangers  king what can here alarm thee  rosamond perpetual apprehensions rise perchance the poignant sense how much my crimes deserve adds to the phantoms consciencestung i dread i know not what of ill remove me hence my dearest lord thus on my knees i sue and my last breath shall bless thee give me misery but rescue me from guilt  king what lead thee forth from these once happy walls yield thee abandoned to an unpitying unprotecting world then turn and roam uncomfortably round the changed abode explore in vain the bliss it once afforded like a restless sprite that hourly haunts the desolated spot where all his treasure lay bid me tear out this seated heart and rend each vital string i sooner could obey thee going rosamond turn my henry leave me not thus in sorrow can thou part in anger from me  king anger  oh thou sweet one witness these pangs  i cannot will not lose thee   rosamond confirm my pardon then pitying reflect it is the first hour i ever beheld thy frown forgive me  oh forgive me  king spare me  spare a moments thought to my distracted soul to ease the throbs and hush the swelling tumults which my fond love would fain conceal from thee thou exquisite tormentor exit rosamond heaven sooth thy suffering mind restore thy peace and win thy yielding spirit to my prayer for it must be  the blow must be endured though nature tremble at it  heaven requires it i hear the sacred voice that claims aloud atonement for its violated laws when i am sunderd from him never again to feast my eyes on his loved form or share his converse more it will be then no sin nor heaven nor man can be offended then if sometimes i devote a pensive hour to dwell upon his virtues or at night when sleep like a false friend denies his comforts i bathe my solitary couch with tears and weary heaven for blessings on his head enter the abbot abbot health to the fair whose radiant charms diffuse bright beams around and shame meridian day with rival luster and superior beauty  rosamond alas good father my dejected heart illsuited now to flatterys soothing breath is wrapped in other thoughts  abbot an old mans praise is of small worth nor should thou term it flattery the approbation which the ready tongue spontaneous utters at thy beauties sight but thy sad eyes are swollen with tears i trust they flow from holy motives  rosamond thou have often preached in persuasive accents the great duty of combating temptation teaching virtue to gain dominion over assailing passions and with her pious firmness guard the breast  abbot i have fair daughter  rosamond these thy holy precepts my melancholy heart i hope has learned the selfconvicted mourner has resolved to turn from guilts delusive dangerous way and seek the penitential paths of peace  abbot explain thyself my pupil lay thy meanings clear to my view  rosamond i have resolved to leave this culpritstate of unchaste lawless love and in some solitudes protecting shade atone by future purity of life my errors past  abbot it is nobly purposed daughter worthy the precepts i have given thy youth and the great efforts of exalted virtue but why retire to moaping solitude the heart is weak that finds itself unable in any situation to repent its past misdeeds it is the principle and not the place attones we may be good and yet abide in active cheerful life there are a thousand pleasures and delights not inconsistent with the strictest truth and sanctity of mind  rosamond it may be so and such may be indulged by those whose lives have never been branded with a flagrant crime but wretches like myself whom conscience taxes with violated chastity and justice have forfeited those rights  abbot i like not this  she dares debate  she judges for herself  i must restrain this freedom  it is presumption aside rosamond yes all shall be renounced all that conspired to make my guilty situation wear the face of bliss splendour and affluence all shall be given up and well exchanged if they obtain remission for my crimes  abbot some farther meaning lurks beneath these words which my foreboding fears dislike aside rosamond my heny i have solicited to this great purpose of my newopend new enkindled mind  abbot as i divined  destruction to my views aside rosamond why turnst thou from me breathe thy pious comforts to nourish my resolves  abbot think thou fond pupil thy paramour will yield to thy request oh no his passion is too much his master think thou can he who doats upon thy beauties doats even to folly   rosamond spare me holy father  wound not my ear with one contemptuous word against his dignity i cannot bear it  abbot my recollection zealous for thy ease recalls the casual word i grieve to see thee misled by phantoms but there is a way a clear and certain way to happiness which thou have not descried  rosamond inform me father how i may compass the religious ends my state demands and my whole soul aspires to without disquieting my henrys peace and i will bless thee for it  abbot love alone confers true honor on the marriagestate without this sanction of united hearts the sacred bond of wedlock is defiled and all its holy purposes overthrown  rosamond be plain good father  abbot happiness should crown the altars rites  and henry sure deserves to be supremely happy  thou alone can make him so need i say more  rosamond speak on clear unambiguous phrases best befit my simple sense  abbot his union with the queen cannot be termed a marriage heaven disdains the prostituted bond where hourly jars pervert the blessed intent thy vain retirement what boots it eleanor who now retains the name alone of queen or what avails the title of a wife thou art the espoused of his affections let the church then shed her holy sanction on your plighted loves a pious duty calls assert thy claim let thy fond lord divorce her from her state and rosamond shall mount the vacant throne  rosamond thy specious arguments delude me not my soul revolts against them hence i scorn thy further speech  have i not crimes enough have i not amply injured henrys wife but i must further swell the guilty sum fly with thy wicked thy pernicious schemes to breasts whence every trace of good is banished i am not yet so vile twas henrys self i loved not englands king not for the wealth of worlds for all that grandeur can afford the pride of dignity the pomp of power nor even to fix my henry mine alone will i advance one added step in sin or plant another torment in her breast whom too severely i have wronged already exit abbot bane to this coward heart that shrunk beneath the peevish outrage of a frantic girl the vain presumer sorely shall repent her bold licentious pride that dared oppose her upstart insolence against my control whose bidding should direct her every thought had she obeyed the doting king perchance had raised the painted moppet to his throne and by that deed had lost his peoples love a ready victim to the daring bands that threaten him around that hope is lost  new schemes must be devised  all arts employed for nothing shall appease my fierce resentment till the foul wounds given to our mitred saint be deep avenged in henrys impious heart exit end of the third act act iv scene the palace the abbot alone abbot it shall be so  the queen herself shall be my instrument of vengeance both on henry and that audacious minion who presumed to disobey my dictates this new project cannot deceive my hopes the haughty eleanor fired by those demons jealousy and anger will set no bounds to her outrageous will and she has suffered wrongs that might inflame a colder breast but why recoils my heart at thought of harm to this presumptuous wanton why feel reluctant strugglings as if virtue checked and condemned my purpose it is not harm it is piety it is mercy  will she not be taken from a life of sin and shame and placed where she at leisure may repent her great offenses this is giving her her souls desire  but eleanor not i shall be the means night gathers round apace ascend thick gloom and with thy sable wings veil henrys peace for ever from his eyes enter queen hail honored queen  queen art thou a comforter thine order calls thee such but thou approachest unlike the messenger of gladsome tidings delay is in thy step and disappointment sits on thy brow  abbot oh skilful in the lines which the mind pictures on the obedient visage to speak her inward workings  queen thy designs have failed  abbot to thee i yield the palm of wisdom effective policy and deep contrivance to thee resign it all  queen lose not the moments in vain lamentings over mischances past one project foiled another should be tried and former disappointments brace the mind for future efforts and sublimer darings  abbot thy noble spirit may perchance succeed where all my arts have failed i boast no power over this perverse this selfdirected wanton she seems newframd  her gentle disposition which erst was passive to instructions breath as vernal buds to zephyrs soothing gale is banished from her breast imperious tones exalt her voice and passion warms her cheek  queen whence can it spring this new presumptuous change can she assume the port of arrogance she whose soft looks and hypocritie meekness have won admiring eyes and pitying tongues while i am taxed with warm and wayward temper for that i have not meanness to conceal a just resentment for atrocious wrongs but bid them glow within my crimson cheek and flash indignant from my threatening eye  abbot the lures of greatness and ambitions baits are eagerly pursued by soaring minds when first their splendour is displayed before them anticipating hope exalts their brightness and fires the wretched gazer even to frenzy  queen what hope  what greatness  what ambition speak explain thy meaning ease the gathering tumult that struggles here and choaks me with its fullness  abbot i fear to speak  queen why fear look on me well i am a woman with a heros heart be quick  be plain  thou have no tale tunfold can make me shudder  though it make me feel  abbot her wild imagination hurries her beyond belief or even conceptions limit safely protected by the royal favor of her great master may i say his love  queen on with thy speech  dispatch  abbot she threats defiance to every other power and all control bids me with haughty phrase no more assume the right to check her deeds exalts herself above the peers and worthies of the realm nay frantic in her fancied excellence becomes thy rival in imperial rule and plumes herself on future majesty  queen the traitress but thou errst it cannot be thou have mistaen her words her coward heart could not conceive such insolence of speech such arrogant presuming  abbot in effect all was expressed though not in open terms hearts so determined rarely speak their meaning lest just prevention intercept their purpose but thus much in the fullness of her passion fell from her lips let her a while enjoy these were her words her transitory greatness anon the beam may take a different poise the mistress may become the exalted wife the haughty wife become the abandoned mistress  queen breathed she those daring those audacious accents and does the wretch survive it be it so she only lives to gratify my vengeance ere the vain dreamer mount her airy throne she shall be taught the power of royalty over her own littleness her pigmy pride  abbot you do not mean to see her  queen yes  i do  she thirsts for honor i will show it her will deign to set before her shrinking view majestic eleanor the exalted wife and with a glance destroy her  abbot all you seek may be obtained by this great condescension within your power beneath your eye abashed whelmed with her crimes and shrinking in her fears she will crouch to any terms bind her by oath no more to see your lord or if you doubt the efficacy of that tie remove her from the gay bower her infamy has stained perform a holy work force her to quit the wanton course of her abandoned life and in some dim secure retreat where you alone command conceal the sorceress for ever from the godlike henrys eyes  queen oh precious doctrine learned comforter continue thus to counsel leave my heart my dauntless heart to execute thy schemes  abbot when mean you   queen now this night  my eager fury brooks no delay  thou must advise the hour  abbot about the season when imperial henry speeds to his midnight penance at the convent i will with nicest caution watch the moments   queen and be my guide  abbot devoted to your bidding  queen but soft  the means of our access  did not this grand apostate to his nuptial bond contrive some childish toy some subtle clue without whose aid enquirys foot in vain attempts to find the wantons close retreat  abbot he did but that device is only practiced when public duties call him from his realm then is the minion deep immured within the very heart of the obscure recess but now that he with frequent eye oerlooks and watches his cagd turtle she enjoys free range of the whole bower by few attended and none but who submissive yield obedience to our grave habit and religious order  queen enough use wary watch  and hye with speed to my impatient soul exit abbot conceal her yes in that deep cavern that eternal gloom where all her shames may be concealed  in death atonement less than this were insufficient to gratify my boundless thirst of vengeance long have they revelld in the mighty pangs that rent my heart  it is now my turn to triumph when i behold the traitor sunk in grief plaining to her whose bosom will be cold to his distress superior will i rise proudly exult in his severest pangs point at her lifeless corse for whom he scorned me and loud exclaim in his afflicted ear behold the victim of despair and love exit scene an apartment in the bower enter rosamond with a letter and ethelinda rosamond no ethelinda  never from that hour that fatal hour when first i saw my hero saw him returning from the field of war in manly beauty flushed with glorious conquest till our last grievous interview did henry show word or look ungentle  nay even now here in the full distraction of his soul over his strong woes soft tenderness prevails and all the fondness of unbounded love  ethelinda but what does he resolve  rosamond there ethelinda he gives me fresh disquiet frenzy seems to guide his wayward pen he talks of life as of a load he wishes to lay down if i persist in my unnatural purpose for such he terms it can thou think my henry i suffer not affliction great as thine yes let the present tumults in my breast be witness how i struggle with affection stand up and war with natures strongest power in duty and religions righteous cause  ethelinda and must your gentleness abide such trials such hard extremity of wretchedness is there no middle course to steer  rosamond forbear seek not to tempt me from that proper sense of my deep faults which only can sustain me in this sore trial to remit my fervor were to be lost again  ethelinda he will never consent to yield you up resign you to your woe unfriended unsustaind to heave alone the bitter sigh and pour the unpitied tear  rosamond he says he will return to me and soon then paints the anguish of his bleeding heart in unconnected phrase and broken periods adjures me by our loves no more to urge the hard request on which his life depends oh did i ever think i could refuse what henry asked  but this  it must not be  lend me thy arm my friend a sudden faintness comes over me and instinctive boadings whisper i shall not long survive my henrys loss  ethelinda oh chide them from you at the sad idea my sorrows stream afresh  rosamond weep not for that it is my best comfort in the grave alone can i find true repose that quiet haven whereto the wretched voyager in life whose little helpless bark long time has strove against the rude beatings of tumultuous guilt often casts an ardent look an eager wish to gain a shelter there from future storms  ethelinda let me conduct thee to the cheering breeze thy looks are pale  rosamond oh thou that art all mercy kneels look down indulgent on the child of frailty with pity view her errors and instruct her how to obtain returning peace and pardon enter clifford in his disguise clifford stay thee fair mourner wherefore do thou shun the messenger of comfort  rosamond ethelinda what voice was that my startled fancy wakes new terrors yet it cannot be   clifford my daughter   rosamond all gracious heaven it is he  faints clifford oh let me clasp her to a fond fathers aged breast and call her sinking spirit from the shades of death  ethelinda oh reverend stranger if thou best her father with gentle voice allure

painful apprehension  rosamond where is fled that reverend form even now it hovered over me sent by kind heaven the sacred delegate of comfort and protection  clifford rosamond oh turn not from me  do not shun my sight in pity shrink not from a fathers eye who comes to chase thy sorrows comes to shed some pious drops over thy afflicted heart ere he is mingled with the dust  rosamond thus lowly bent to the earth with abject eye that dares not look up to that much injured reverend face let me implore thy pardon  clifford rise my child oh rise and let me gaze on that loved form which once was all my comfort  rosamond but which now you look upon with anger and disgust my crimes deserve it all  clifford nay meet my eye  survey me well do thou behold therein a rigid judge oh no the father melts in these faststreaming tears  rosamond has pitying heaven heard the sad prayer of such a guilty wretch and granted in the moment of affliction a parents presence and returning blessing to his repentant child  clifford do thou repent  and did thou wish once more to see thy father dry up thy tears and answer me with firmness do thou repent  have thou the fortitude to break the fatal tie that linked thy soul to lawless love and all its false allurements can thou look up with steady resolution to that great power who loves repentant hearts and say thou will no more transgress  rosamond i can i can my father that allseeing power to whom thou have appealed can witness for me i have renounced the paths of sin and shame and mean to spend my sad remains of life in deep contrition for my past offenses  clifford to find thee thus is rapture to my soul enter my breast and take again possession of all the fondness that i ever bore thee by my best hopes when in thy smiling youth aline eye has hung enamored on thy charms thou shewdst not then so lovelily as now dressed in those graceful penitential tears  rosamond oh my father and may i still look up to thee with hope that the dear love and tenderness thy breast once cherished for thy darling rosamond is not extinguished quite  clifford alas my child i am not lost to nature and her ties we are all frail preach stoics how they will it

grave ere this great business of my souls accomplished  rosamond command my heart can i thus lost to goodness assuage thy cares and soften the decline of weary nature say my dearest father and by the zeal of my obedience prove the truth of my contrition  clifford hear me then thou darling of my bosom  westward hence on the slow rising of a fertile hill a virtuous dame of honorable race has sounded and endowed a hallowed mansion to pure devotions purposes assigned no sound disturbs the quiet of the place save of the bleating flocks and lowing herds and the meek murmurs of the trilling stream that flows sweetwinding through the vale beneath no objects intercept the gazers eye but the neat cots of neighboring villagers whose lowly roofs afford a pleasing scene of modest resignation and content there piety enamored of the spot resides there she inspires her holy fervor mild not austere such piety as looks with soft compassion upon human frailty and sooths the pilgrimsinner to embrace repentant peace beneath her holy roof  say will thou quit for such serene delights this gay abode of shame  rosamond i will my father my wish invites to such a soft retreat oh lead me forth  clifford

hapless creature misled by fatal love immersed in guilt and blinded to the evils that ensued  queen and pleadst thou that in thy defense fond wretch which loudest cries against thee knewst thou not who henry was what were his noble ties how did thy passion dare aspire so high thou should have sought within thine own degree mates for thy wanton hours then had thou not debased a monarch in his peoples eyes nor waked the vengeance of an injured queen  rosamond alas thou look on me as on a wretch familiar with pollution reconciled to hardened guilt and all its shameless arts i am not such nights holy lamps can witness what painful sighs my sad afflicted heart has heaved what streaming tears my eyes have poured to be released from the pernicious snare wherein i was involved  queen those sighs and tears had true contrition been their holy source should have inspired thy heart to break the snare and set itself at freedom  rosamond o it is true they should but in my rebel breast they

desired to forward their address as soon as possible to the publishers  london printed for john bell near exeter change in the strand and c etherington at york  mr bell i have purchased your edition of shakespeares acting plays with which i am abundantly pleased your promises were large but your execution has been greater and i heartily hope that fuccess will not be slow in rewarding so spirited a performance works of elegance though eagerly sought after in foreign countries are rarely to be met with in our own the causes have been differently assigned but the present work plainly proves that they proced not so much from a dearth of abilities as from a want of spirit to encourage them  you have opened the road to excellence and i doubt not but your fellow traders though they have not spirit to project will have meanness enough to follow your steps  should this be the case as i have some private reasons to believe it will with this very publication you may rest assured that the public will always advert to the primary cause and support your improvements in spite of every undue influence which their extensive connections may be supposed to effect  i have sent a copy of the following criticisms which are not my own sentiments alone but those of all whom i have conversed with on the subject to the st jamess chronicle which with this letter you are at liberty to make what use of you think proper without offending  your friend and wellwisher w r january          j bells respectful acknowledgements to the writer of the above and as it together with the following contains such flattering testimonies of candid approbation he hopes he shall stand excused by the writer and justified by the public for communicating both in this manner without trespassing on the confidence of either  critique on part of the plates in bells edition of shakespeare excellent engraving is a beauty of itself and will always to the generality of people appear an ornament independent of the design or other qualities of a good print the french seem to have understood this better than any other nation  in imitation of the magnificent editions of the louvre they have bedecked their ordinary books with cuts signets medalions head and tail pieces in the execution of which lies all their merit neatness and propriety strike at once a superficial eye and therefore aiding their language with the bagatelles i have mentioned the parifians are thought to have sold more books than any three cities in europe  an edition of shakespeares acting plays being lately advertised i had the curiosity to glance at the proposals but coming to that part of the advertisement where five volumes with elegant plates are offered for fifteen shillings i pitied shakespeare and thought no more of the work they are now published and afford a happy instance of what the public are to expect from a bookseller who has spirit to share his profits with artists of merit i had often thought of writing something upon the present subject and cannot without injustice pass this new edition in silence  with exception of one or two at most these plates are highly finished finished with freedom and force united to the admired neatness of the french burin i am sorry the designs are not upon the whole equal to the execution though many of them merit the highest applause and since i have criticized the plates of former editions i shall make equally free with the present and praise or blame where in my opinion either is deserved  othello gives no idea of the noble moor the expression of jealousy is too ambiguous and strong to be marked with success in miniature he looks not like an injured soldier but an old enraged eunuch of the seraglio iago is an excellent figure his action steady the attitude speaks design and the eye watches the effect of his villainy upon the unhappy husband  brutus and the evil genius would not make the ghost of a roman between them it is a bad print and no part of it better than another  rosalind and her companion in the comedy of as you like it is one of the sweetest cuts i remember to have seen the action is well chosen the expression just and the execution delicate as the subject the softness of the sex shines through the masculine dress and finely conveys the idea of the poet had the trees in the back ground been executed with a little more care and the keeping better preserved this print would have been a masterpiece  every person must be pleased with pistol in harry the fifth the design is good the action natural  the expression strong and the execution superior to any poetical cut i ever saw in an english publication  iachimo and imogen deserve great approbation the seen is dumb show therefore capable of being perfectly represented accordingly the sangfroid of the italian taking an inventory of the ladys beauty is nicely hit  she sleeps well her posture is natural and the execution fleshy and delicate  the delivery of the letter in henry the eighth must also give universal satisfaction there is a great deal of character in the king and wolsey and what is further commendable they are portraits of these personages wolsey receives the letter with a courtly smile in place of that stupefaction visible in the cardinal of gravelot before its contents were known  falstaff assuming the conquest of percy is a pleasant highfinished cut sir john recalls rather too much the idea of mr shuter in that part but the youth and gallant figure of the prince is happily struck and the fallen percy judiciously foreshortened i think he should have retained something of the terrible in death  doctor caius mrs quickly and simple in the merry wives of windsor are truly comic well conceived and convey the very spirit of the scene the execution is equal to the design and make together a very perfect print  mr grignion has been very happy in the frontispiece for much ado about nothing  his etching gives a peculiar spirit to a print where he is pleased to bestow pains and the arch smile in the face of the prince and leonato in pretended conference demands the attention of an actor  the feelings of old lear are finely marked the figure though small is dignified and poor tom almost shivers upon the paper  i could with pleasure review the others but have already exceeded the short sketch intended the subject of prints is fertile and entertaining i could wish to see it treated by those who have more leisure and abilities than i am master of their merits might thence become more generally understood and the art rendered of solid use and ornament to the works of the learned  the present publication i consider as a considerable advance to this improvement and the public will likely view it in the same

dare say to the contrary mr oliviers book is a very good book and may help to teach as much as books can teach the noble science of defense or as our author terms it swordplay and it is made more
