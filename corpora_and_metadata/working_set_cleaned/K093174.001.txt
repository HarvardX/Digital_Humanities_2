of england and wales with maps of all the counties  s bound    introduction the mansion house of the pleasant village of beachgrove was inhabited by the family of fairborne consisting of the master and mistress and a numerous progeny of children of both sexes of these part were educated at home under their parents care and part were sent out to school the house was seldom unprovided with visitors the intimate friends or relations of the owners who were entertained with cheerfulness and hospitality free from ceremony and parade they formed during their stay part of the family and were ready to concur with mr and mrs fairborne in any little domestic plan for varying their amusements and particularly for promoting the instruction and entertainment of the younger part of the household as some of them were accustomed to writing they would frequently produce a fable a story or dialogue adapted to the age and understanding of the young people it was always considered as a high favor when they would so employ themselves and after the pieces were once read over they were carefully deposited by mrs fairborne in a box of which she kept the key none of these were allowed to be taken out again till all the children were assembled in the holidays it was then made one of the evening amusements of the family to rummage the budget as their phrase was one of the least children was sent to the box who putting in its little hand drew out the paper that came next and brought it into the parlour this was then read distinctly by one of the older ones and after it had undergone sufficient consideration another little messenger was dispatched for a fresh supply and so on till as much time had been spent in this manner as the parents thought proper other children were admitted to these readings and as the budget of beachgrove hall became somewhat celebrated in the neighborhood its proprietors were at length urged to lay it open to the public they were induced to comply and have presented its contents in the promiscuous order in which they came to hand which they think will prove more agreeable than a methodical arrangement thus therefore without further preface begins the  first evening on the oak a dialogue tutor  george  harry tut come my boys let us sit down awhile under yon shady tree i dont know how your young legs feel but mine are almost tired   geo i am not tired but i am very hot   har and i am hot and very dry too   tut when you have cooled yourself you may drink out of that clear brook in the mean time we will read a little out of a book i have in my pocket  they go and sit down at the foot of the tree har what an amazing large tree how wide its branches spread pray what tree is it   geo i can tell you that it is an oak dont you see the acorns   tut yes it is an oak  the noblest tree this country produces  not only grand and beautiful to the sight but of the greatest importance from its uses   har i should like to know something about it   tut very well then instead of reading we will sit and talk about oaks george you knew the oak by its acorns  should you have known it if there had been none   geo i dont know  i believe not   tut observe then in the first place that its bark is very rugged then see in what manner it grows its great arms run out almost horizontally from its trunk giving the whole tree a sort of round form and making it spread far on every side its branches are also subject to be crooked or kneed by these marks you might guess at an oak even in winter when quite bare of leaves but its leaves afford a surer mark of distinction since they differ a good deal from those of other trees being neither whole and even at the edges not yet cut like the teeth of a saw but rather deeply scolloped and formed into several rounded divisions their color is a fine deep green  then the fruit    har fruit   tut yes  all kinds of plants have what may properly be called fruit though we are apt to give that name only to such as are food for man the fruit of a plant is the seed with what contains it this in the oak is called an acorn whch is a kind of nut partly enclosed in a cup   geo acorncups are very pretty things i have made boats of them and set them a swimming in a basin   tut and if you were no bigger than a fairy you might use them for drinking cups as those imaginary little beings are said to do  pearly drops of dew we drink in acorncups filled to the brink  har are acorns good to eat   geo no that they are not i have tried and did not like them at all   tut in the early ages of man before he cultivated the earth but lived upon such wild products as nature afforded we are told that acorns made a considerable part of his food and at this day i believe they are eaten in some countries but this is in warmer climates where they probably become sweeter and betterflavoured than with us the chief use we make of them is to feed hogs in those parts of england where oak woods are common great herds of swine are kept which are driven into the woods in autumn when the acorns fall and provide for themselves plentifully for two or three months this however is a small part of the praise of the oak you will be surprised when i tell you that to this tree our country owes its chief glory and security   har aye how can that be   tut i dont know whether in your reading you have ever met with the story that athens a famous city in greece consulting the oracle how it might best defend itself against its enemies was advised to trust to wooden walls   har wooden walls  that is odd  i should think stone walls better for wooden ones might be set on fire   tut true but the meaning was that as athens was a place of great trade and its people were skilled in maritime affairs they ought to trust to their ships well this is the case with great britain as it is an island it has no need of walls and fortifications while it possesses ships to keep all enemies at a distance now we have the greatest and finest navy in the world by which we both defend ourselves and attack other nations when they insult us and this is all built of oak   geo would no other wood do to build ships   tut none nearly so well especially for men of war for it is the stoutest and strongest wood we have and therefore best fitted both to keep sound under water and to bear the blows and shocks of the waves and the terrible strokes of cannon balls it is a peculiar excellence for this last purpose that oak is not so liable to splinter or shiver as other woods so that a ball can pass through it without making a large hole did you never hear the old song heart of oak are our ships hearts of oak are our men etc   geo no   tut it was made at a time when england was more successful in war than had ever before been known and our success was properly attributed chiefly to our fleet the great support of which is the british oak so i hope you will henceforth look upon oaks with due respect   har yes  it shall always be my favorite tree   tut had not pope reason when said in his windsor forest let india boast her plants nor envy we the weeping amber or the balmy tree while by our oaks the precious loads are borne and realms commanded which those trees adorn   these lines refer to its use as well for merchant ships as for men of war and in fact all our ships are built either of native or foreign oak   geo are the masts of ships made of oak   tut no  it would be too heavy besides it would not be easy to find trunks of oak long and straight enough for that purpose they are made of various kinds of fir or pine which grow very tall and taper   geo is oak wood used for any thing besides shipbuilding   tut o yes  it is one of the principal woods of the carpenter being employed wherever great strength and durability are required it is used for door and window frames and the beams that are laid in walls to strengthen them floors and staircases are sometimes made with it and in old houses in the country which were built when oak was more plentiful than at present almost all the timber about them is oak it is also occasionally used for furniture as tables chairs drawers and bedsteads though mahogany has now much taken its place for the better sort of goods and the lighter and softer woods for the cheaper for the hardness of oak renders it difficult and expensive to work it is still however the chief material used in millwork in bridge and waterworks for wagon and cart bodies for large casks and tubs and for the last piece of furniture a man has occasion for what is that do you think george   geo i dont know   har a coffin   tut so it is   har but why should that be made of such strong wood   tut there can be no other reason than that weak attachment we are apt to have for our bodies when we have done with them which has made men in various countries desirous of keeping them as long as possible from decay but i have not yet done with the uses of the oak were either of you ever in a tanners yard   geo we often go by one at the end of the town but we durst not go in for fear of the great dog   tut but he is always chained in the daytime   har yes  but he barks so loud and looks so fierce that we were afraid he would break his chain   tut i doubt you are a couple of cowards however i suppose you came near enough to observe great stacks of bark in the yard   geo o yes  there are several   tut those are oak bark and it is used in tanning the hides   har what does it do to them   tut i will tell you every part of the oak abounds in a quality called astringency or a binding power the effect of this is to make more close and compact or to shrivel up all soft things and thereby make them firmer and less liable to decay the hide then when taken from the animal after being steeped in lime and water to get off the hair and grease is put to soak in a liquor made by boiling oak bark in water this liquor is strongly astringent and by stiffening the soft hide turns it into what we call leather other things are also tanned for the purpose of preserving them as fishing nets and boatsails this use of the bark of the oak makes it a very valuable commodity and you may see people in the woods carefully stripping the oaks when cut down and piling up the bark in heaps   geo i have seen such heaps of bark but i thought they were only to burn   tut no  they are much too valuable for that well but i have another use of the oak to mention and that is in dying   har dying i wonder what color it can dye   tut oak sawdust is a principal ingredient in dying sustians by various mixtures and managements it is made to give them all the different shades of drab and brown then all the parts of the oak like all other astringent vegetables produce a dark blue or black by the addition of any preparation of iron the bark is sometimes used in this way for dying black and did you ever see what boys call an oakapple   geo yes  i have gathered them myself   tut do you know what they are   geo i thought they were the fruit of the oak   tut no  i have told you that the acorns are the fruit these are excrescences formed by an insect   geo an insect  how can they make such a thing   tut it is a sort of fly that has a power of pie cing the outer skin of the oak boughs under which it lays its eggs the part then swells into a kind of ball and the young insects when hatched eat their way out well this ball or apple is a pretty strong astringent and is sometimes used in dying black but in the warm countries there is a species of oak which bears round excrescences of the same kind called galls which become hard and are the strongest astringents known they are the principal ingredients in the black dies and common ink is made with them together with a substance called green vitriol or copperas which contains iron  i have now told you the chief uses that i can recollect of the oak and these are so important that whoever drops an acorn into the ground and takes proper care of it when it comes up may be said to be a benefactor to his country besides no sight can be more beautiful and majestic than a fine oak wood it is an ornament fit for the habitation of the first nobleman in the land   har i wonder then that all rich gentlemen who have ground enough do not cover it with oaks   tut many of them especially of late years have made great plantations of these trees but all soils do not suit them and then there is another circumstance which prevents many from being at this trouble and expense which is the long time an oak takes in growing so that no person can reasonably expect to profit by those of his own planting an oak of fifty years is greatly short of its full growth and they are scarcely arrived at perfection under a century however it is our duty to think of posterity as well as ourselves and they who receive oaks from their ancestors ought certainly to furnish others to their successors   har then i think that every one who cuts down an oak should be obliged to plant another   tut very right  but he should plant two or three for one for fear of accicidents in their growing  i will now repeat to you some verses describing the oak in its state of full growth or rather of beginning decay with the various animals living upon it  and then we will walk  see where you oak its awful structure rears the massy growth of twice a hundred years survey his rugged trunk with moss oergrown his lusty arms in rude disorder thrown his forking branches wide at distance spread and darkning half the sky his lofty head a mighty castle built by natures hands peopled by various living tribes he stands his airy top the clamorous rooks invest and crowd the waving boughs with many a nest midway the nimble squirrel builds his bower and sharpbilld pies the insect tribes devour that gnaw beneath the bark their secret ways while unperceived the stately pile decays  the young mouse a fable a young mouse lived in a cupboard where sweetmeats were kept she dined every day upon biscuit marmalade or fine sugar never any little mouse had lived so well she had often ventured to peep at the family while they sat at supper nay she had sometimes stole down on the carpet and picked up the crumbs and nobody had ever hurt her she would have been quite happy but that she was sometimes frightened by the cat and then she ran trembling to her hole behind the wainscot one day she came running to her mother in great joy mother said she the good people of this family have built me a house to live in it is in the cupboard i am sure it is for me for it is just big enough the bottom is of wood and it is covered all over with wires and i dare say they have made it on purpose to screen me from that terrible cat which ran after me so often there is an entrance just big enough for me but puss cannot follow and they have been so good as to put in some toasted cheese which smells so deliciously that i should have run in directly and taken possession of my new house but i thought i would tell you first that we might go in together and both lodge there tonight for it will hold us both  my dear child said the old mouse it is most happy that you did not go in for this house is called a trap and you would never have come out again except to have been devoured or put to death in some way or other though man has not so fierce a look as a cat he is as much our enemy and has still more cunning  the wasp and be a fable a wasp met a be and said to him pray can you tell me what is the reason that men are so illnatured to me while they are so fond of you we are both very much alike only that the broad golden rings about my body make me much handsomer than you are we are both winged insects we both love honey and we both sting people when we are angry yet men always hate me and try to kill me though i am much more familiar with them than you are and pay them visits in their houses and at their teatable and at all their meals while you are very shy and hardly ever come near them yet they build you curious houses thatched with straw and take care of and feed you in the winter very often  i wonder what is the reason  the be said because you never do them any good but on the contrary are very troublesome and mischievous therefore they do not like to see you but they know that i am busy all day long in making them honey you had better pay them fewer visits and try to be useful  travellers wonders one winters evening as captain compass was sitting by the fireside with his children all round him little jack said to him papa pray tell us some stories about what you have seen in your voyages i have been vastly entertained whilst you were abroad with gullivers travels and the adventures of sinbad the sailor and i think as you have gone round and round the world you must have met with things as wonderful as they did  no my dear said the captain i never met with lilliputians or brobdingnagians i assure you nor ever saw the black loadstone mountain or the valley of diamonds but to be sure i have seen a great variety of people and their different manners and ways of living and if it will be any entertainment to you i will tell you some curious particulars of what i observed  pray do papa cried jack and all his brothers and sisters so they drew close round him and he began as follows  well then  i was once about this time of the year in a country where it was very cold and the poor inhabitants had much ado to keep themselves from starving they were clad partly in the skins of beasts made soft and smooth by a particular art but chiefly in garments made from the outer covering of a middlesized quadruped which they were so cruel as to strip off his back while he was alive they dwelt in habitations part of which was sunk under ground the materials were either stones or earth hardened by fire and so violent in that country were the storms of wind and rain that many of them covered their roofs all over with stones the walls of their houses had holes to let in the light but to prevent the cold air and wet from coming in they were covered with a sort of transparent stone made artificially of melted sand or flints as wood was rather scarce i know not what they would have done for firing had they not discovered in the bowels of the earth a very extraordinary kind of stone which when put among burning wood caught fire and flamed like a torch  dear me said jack what a wonderful stone i suppose it was somewhat like what we call firestones that shine so when we rub them together  i dont think they would burn replied the captain besides these are of a darker color  well  but their diet too was remarkable some of them eat fish that had been hung up in the smoke till they were quite dry and hard and along with it they eat either the roots of plants or a sort of coarse black cake made of powdered seeds these were the poorer class the richer had a whiter kind of cake which they were fond of daubing over with a greasy matter that was the product of a large animal among them this grease they used too in almost all their dishes and when fresh it really was not unpalatable they likewise devoured the flesh of many birds and beasts when they could get it and eat the leaves and other parts of a variety of vegetables growing in the country some absolutely raw others variously prepared by the aid of fire another great article of food was the curd of milk pressed into a hard mass and salted this had so rank a smell that persons of weak stomachs often could not bear to come near it for drink they made great use of the water in which certain dry leaves had been steeped these leaves i was told came from a great distance they had likewise a method of preparing a liquor of the seeds of a grasslike plant steeped in water with the addition of a bitter herb and then set to work or ferment i was prevailed upon to taste it and thought it at first nauseous enough but in time i liked it pretty well when a large quantity of the ingredints is used it becomes perfectly intoxicating but what astonished me most was their use of a liquor so excessively hot and pungent that it seems like liquid fire i once got a mouthful of it by mistake taking it for water which it resembles in appearance but i thought it would instantly have taken away my breath indeed people are not unfrequently killed by it and yet many of them will swallow it greedily whenever they can get it this too is said to be prepared from the seeds abovementioned which are innocent and even salutary in their natural state though made to yield such a pernicious juice the strangest custom that i believe prevails in any nation i found here which was that some take a mighty pleasure in filling their mouths full of stinking smoke and others in thrusting a nasty powder up their nostrils  i should think it would choke them said jack it almost did me answered his father only to stand by while they did it  but use it is truly said is second nature  i was glad enough to leave this cold climate and about half a year after i fell in with a people enjoying a delicious temperature of air and a country full of beauty and verdure the trees and shrubs were furnished with a great variety of fruits which with other vegetable products constituted a large part of the food of the inhabitants i particularly relished certain berries growing in bunches some white and some red of a very pleasant sourish taste and so transparent that one might see the seeds at their very center here were whole fields full of extremely odoriferous flowers which they told me were succeeded by pods bearing seeds that afforded good nourishment to man and beast a great variety of birds enlivened the groves and woods among which i was entertained with one that without any teaching spoke almost as articulately as a parrot though indeed it was all the repetition of a single word the people were tolerably gentle and civilized and possessed many of the arts of life their dress was very various many were clad only in a thin cloth made of the long fibers of the stalk of a plant cultivated for the purpose which they prepared by soaking in water and then beating with large mallets others wore cloth wove from a sort of vegetable wool growing in pods upon bushes but the most singular material was a fine glossy stuff used chiefly by the richer classes which as i was credibly informed is manufactured out of the webs of caterpillars  a most wonderful circumstance if we consider the immense number of caterpillars necessary to the production of so large a quantity of the stuff as i saw used this people are very fantastic in their dress especially the women whose apparel consists of a great number of articles impossible to be described and strangely disguising the natural form of the body in some instances they seem very cleanly but in others the hottentots can scarce go beyond them particularly in the management of their hair which is all matted and stiffened with the fat of swine and other animals mixed up with powders of various colors and ingredients like most indian nations they use feathers in the headdress one thing surprised me much which was that they bring up in their houses an animal of the tiger kind with formidable teeth and claws which notwithstanding its natural ferocity is played with and caressed by the most timid and delicate of their women  i am sure i would not play with it said jack why you might chance to get an ugly scratch if you did said the captain  the language of this nation seems very harsh and unintelligible to a foreigner yet they converse among one another with great ease and quickness one of the oddest customs is that which men use on saluting each other let the weather be what it will they uncover their heads and remain uncovered for some time if they mean to be extraordinarily respectful  why that is like pulling off our hats said jack ah ha papa cried betsey i have found you out you have been telling us of our own country and what is done at home all this while but said jack we dont burn stones nor eat grease and powdered seeds nor wear skins and caterpillars webs nor play with tigers no said the captain  pray what are coals but stones and is not butter grease and corn seeds and leather skins and silk the web of a kind of caterpillar and may we not as well call a cat an animal of the tygerkind as a tiger an animal of the catkind so if you recollect what i have been describing you will find with betseys help that all the other wonderful things i have told you of are matters familiar among ourselves but i meant to show you that a foreigner might easily represent every thing as equally strange and wonderful among us as we could do with respect to his country and also to make you sensible that we daily call a great many things by their names without ever enquiring into their nature and properties so that in reality it is only the names and not the things themselves with which we are acquainted  second evening alfred a drama persons of the drama alfred king of england gubba a farmer gandelin his wife ella an officer of alfred scene  the isle of athelney alfred how retired and quiet is every thing in this little spot the river winds its silent waters round this retreat and the tangled bushes of the thicket sense it in from the attack of an

faithful ella to arms to arms my bosom burns to face once more the haughty dane and here i vow to heaven that i will never sheath the sword against these robbers till either i lose my life in this just cause or till dovelike peace return to englands shore and war and slaughter vex the land no more    the discontented squirrel in a pleasant wood on the western side of a ridge of mountains there lived a squirrel who had passed two or three years of his life very happily at length he began to grow discontented and one day fell into the following soliloquy  what must i spend all my time in this spot running up and down the same trees gathering nuts and acorns and dozing away months together in a hole i see a great many of the birds who inhabit this wood ramble about to a distance wherever their fancy leads them and at the approach of winter set out for some remote country where they enjoy summer weather all the year round my neighbor cuckoo tells me he is just going and even little nightingale will soon follow to be sure i have not wings like them but i have legs nimble enough and if one does not use them one might as well be a mole or a dormouse i dare say i could easily reach to that blue ridge which i see from the tops of the trees which no doubt must be a fine place for the sun comes directly from it every morning and it often appears all covered with red and yellow and the finest colors imaginable there can be no harm at least in trying for i can soon get back again if i dont like it i am resolved to go and i will set out tomorrow morning  when squirrel had taken this resotion he could not sleep all night for thinking of it and at peep of day prudently taking with him as much provision as he could conveniently carry he began his journey in high spirits he presently got to the outside of the wood and entered upon the open moors that reached to the foot of the hills these he crossed before the sun was gotten high and then having eaten his breakfast with an excellent appetite he began to ascend it was heavy toilsome work scrambling up the steep sides of the mountains but squirrel was used to climbing so for a while he proceeded expeditiously often however was he obliged to stop and take breath so that it was a good deal past noon before he had arrived at the summit of the first cliff here he sat down to eat his dinner and looking back was wonderfully pleased with the fine prospect the wood in which he lived lay far beneath his feet and he viewed with scorn the humble habitation in which he had been born and bred  when he looked forwards however he was somewhat discouraged to observe that another eminence rose above him full as distant as that to which he had already reached and he now began to feel stiff and fatigued however after a little rest he set out again though not so briskly as before the ground was rugged brown and bare and to his great surprise instead of finding it warmer as he got nearer the sun he felt it grow colder and colder he had not traveled two hours before his strength and spirits were almost spent and he seriously thought of giving up the point and returning before night should come on while he was thus deliberating with himself clouds began to gather round the mountain and to take away all view of distant objects presently a storm of mingled snow and hail came down driven by a violent wind which pelted poor squirrel most pityfully and made him quite unable to move forwards or backwards besides he had completely lost his road and did not know which way to turn toward that despised home which it was now his only desire again to reach the storm lasted till the approach of night and it was as much as he could do benumbed and weary as he was to crawl to the hollow of a rock at some distance which was the best lodging he could find for the night his provisions were spent so that hungry and shivering he crept into the furthest corner of the cavern and rolling himself up with his bushy tail over his back he got a little sleep though disturbed by the cold and the shrill whistling of the wind among the stones  the morning broke over the distant tops of the mountains when squirrel half frozen and famished came out of his lodging and advanced as well as he could toward the brow of the hill that he might discover which way to take as he was slowly creeping along a hungry kite soaring in the air above descried him and making a stoop carried him off in her talons poor squirrel losing his senses with the fright was borne away with vast rapidity and seemed inevitably doomed to become food for the kites young ones when an eagle who had seen the kite seize her prey pursued her in order to take it from her and overtaking her gave her such a buffet as caused her to drop the squirrel in order to defend herself the poor animal kept falling through the air a long time till at last he alighted in the midst of a thick tree the leaves and tender boughs of which so broke his fall that though stunned and breathless he escaped without material injury and after lying awhile came to himself again but what was his pleasure and surprise to find himself in the very tree which contained his nest ah said he my dear native place and peaceful home if ever i am again tempted to leave you may i undergo a second time all the miseries and dangers from which i am now so wonderfully escaped  a dialogue on different stations in life little sally meanwell had one day been to pay an afternoons visit to miss harriet the daughter of sir thomas pemberton the evening proving rainy she was sent home in sir thomass coach and on her return the following conversation passed between her and her mother  mrs meanwell well my dear i hope you have had a pleasant visit   sally o yes mamma very pleasant you cannot think what a great many fine things i have seen and then it is so charming to ride in a coach   mrs m i suppose miss harriet showed you all her playthings   sally o yes such fine large dolls so smartly dressed as i never saw in my life before then she has a babyhouse and all sorts of furniture in it and a grotto all made of shells and shining stones and then she showed me all her fine clothes for the next ball there is a white slip all full of spangles and pink ribbons you cannot think how beautiful it looks   mrs m and what did you admire most of all these fine things   sally i dont know  i admired them all and i think i liked riding in the coach better than all the rest why dont we keep a coach mamma and why have not i such fine clothes and playthings as miss harriet   mrs m because we cannot afford it my dear your papa is not so rich by a great deal as sir thomas and if we were to lay out our money upon such things we should not be able to procure food and raiment and other necessaries for you all   sally but why is not papa as rich as sir thomas   mrs m sir thomas had a large estate left him by his father but your papa has little but what he gains by his own industry   sally but why should not papa be as rich as any body else i am sure he deserves it as well   mrs m do you not think that there are a great many people poorer than he that are also very deserving   sally are there   mrs m yes to be sure dont you know what a number of poor people there are all around us who have very few of the comforts we enjoy what do you think of plowman the labourer i believe you never saw him idle in your life   sally no he is gone to work long before i am up and he does not return till almost bedtime unless it be for his dinner   mrs m well how do you think his wife and children live should you like that we should change places with them   sally o no they are so dirty and ragged   mrs m they are indeed poor creatures but i am afraid they suffer worse evils than that   sally what mamma   mrs m why i am afraid they often do not get as much victuals as they could eat and then in winter they must be half starved for want of fire and warm clothing how do you think you could bear all this   sally indeed i dont know but i have seen plowmans wife carry great brown loaves into the house and i remember once eating some brown bread and milk and i thought it very good   mrs m i believe you would not much like it constantly besides they can hardly get enough of that but you seem to know almost as little of the poor as the young french princess did   sally what was that mamma   mrs m why there had been one year so bad a harvest in france that numbers of the poor were famished to death this calamity was so much talked of that it reached the court and was mentioned before the young princesses dear me said one of them how silly that was why rather than be famished i would eat bread and cheese her governess was then obliged to acquaint her that the greatest part of her fathers subjects scarcely ever eat any thing better than black bread all their lives and that vast numbers would now think themselves very happy to get only half their usual pittance of that such wretchedness as this was what the princess had not the least idea of and the account shocked her so much that she was glad to sacrifice all her sinery to afford some relief to the sufferings of the poor   sally but i hope there is nobody famished in our country   mrs m i hope not for we have laws by which every person is entitled to relief from the parish if he is unable to gain a subsistence and were there no laws about it i am sure it would be our duty to part with every superfluity rather than let a fellow creature perish for want of necessaries   sally then do you think it was wrong for miss pemberton to have all those fine things   mrs m no my dear if they are suitable to her fortune and do not consume the money which ought to be employed in more useful things for herself and others   sally but why might not she be contented with such things as i have and give the money that the rest cost to the poor   mrs m because she can afford both to be charitable to the poor and also to indulge herself in these pleasures but do you recollect that the children of mr white the baker and mr shape the tailor might ask just the same questions about you   sally how so   mrs m are not you as much better dressed and as much more plentifully supplied with playthings than they are as miss pemberton is than you   sally why i believe i may for i remember polly white was very glad of one of my old dolls and nancy shape cried for such a sash as mine but her mother would not let her have one   mrs m then you see my dear that there are many who have fewer things to be thankful for than you have and you may also learn what ought to be the true measure of the expectations of children and the indulgencies of parents   sally i dont quite understand you mamma   mrs m every thing ought to be suited to the station in which we live or are likely to live and the wants and duties of it your papa and i do not grudge laying out part of our money to promote the innocent pleasure of our children but it would be very wrong in us to lay out so much on this account as would oblige us to spare in more necessary articles as in their education and the common household expenses required in our way of living besides it would be so far from making you happier that it would be doing you the greatest injury   sally how could that be mamma   mrs m if you were now to be dressed like miss pemberton dont you think you should be greatly mortified at being worse dressed when you came to be a young woman   sally i believe i should mamma for then perhaps i might go to assemblies and to be sure i should like to be as smart then as at any time   mrs m well but it would be still more improper for us to dress you then beyond our circumstances because your necessary clothes will then cost more you know then if we were now to hire a coach or chair for you to go a visiting in should you like to leave it off ever afterward but you have no reason to expect that you will be able to have those indulgencies when you are a woman and so it is in every thing else the more fine things and the more gratifications you have now the more you will require hereafter for custom makes things so familiar to us that while we enjoy them less we want them more   sally how is that mamma   mrs m why dont you think you have enjoyed your ride in the coach this evening more than miss harriet would have done   sally i suppose i have because if miss harriet liked it so well she would be always riding for i know she might have the coach whenever she pleased   mrs m but if you were both told that you were never to ride in a coach again which would think it the greater hardship you could walk you know as you have always done before but she would rather stay at home i believe than expose herself to the cold wind and trudge through the wet and dirt in pattens   sally i believe so too and now mamma i see that all you have told me is very right   mrs m well my dear let it dwell upon your mind so as to make you cheerful and contented in your station which you see is so much happier than that of many and many other children so now we will talk no more on this subject   the goldfinch and linnet a gaudy goldfinch pert and gay hopping blithe from spray to spray full of frolic full of spring with head well plumed and burnished wing spied a sober linnet hen sitting all alone and bowed and chirpd and bowed again and with familiar tone he thus the dame addressed as to her side he closely pressed i hope my dear i dont intrude by breaking on your solitude but it has always been my passion to forward pleasant conversation and i should be a stupid bird to pass the fair without a word i who have been for ever noted to be the sexs most devoted besides a damsel unattended left unnoticed and unfriended appears excuse me so forlorn that i can scarce suppose by any she that ever was born t would be the thing she chose how happy then i am now at leisure to wait upon a ladys pleasure and all this morn have naught to do but pay my duty love to you what silent  ah those looks demure and eyes of languor make me sure that in my random idle chatter i quite mistook the matter it is not spleen or contemplation that draws you to the cover but it is some tender assignation well  who is the favored lover i met hard by in quaker suit a youth sedately grave and mute and from the maxim like to like perhaps the sober youth might strike yes yes it is he i will lay my life who hopes to get you for a wife but come my dear i know youre wise compare and judge and use your eyes no female yet could ever behold the luster of my red and gold my ivory bill and jetty crest but all was done and i was blessed come brighten up and act with spirit and take the fortune that you merit he ceased  linnetta thus replied with cool contempt and decent pride it is pity sir a youth so sweet in form and manners so complete should do an humble maid the honor to waste his precious time upon her a poor forsaken she you know can do no credit to a beau and worse would be the case if meeting one whose faith was plighted he should incur the said disgrace of being slighted now sir the sobersuited youth whom you were pleased to mention to those small merits sense and truth and generous love has some pretension and then to give him all his due he sings sir full as well as you and sometimes can be silent too in short my taste is so perverse and such my wayward fate that it would be my greatest curse to have a coxcomb to my mate this said away she scuds and leaves beau goldfinch in the suds third evening on the pine and fir tribe a dialogue tutor  george  harry tut let us sit down a while on this bench and look about us what a charming prospect   har i admire those pleasure grounds what beautiful clumps of trees there are in that lawn   geo but what a dark gloomy wood that is at the back of the house   tut it is a firplantation and those trees always look dismal in the summer when there are so many finer greens to compare them with but the winter is their time for show when other trees are stripped of their verdure   geo then they are evergreens   tut yes most of the firtribe are evergreens and as they are generally natives of cold mountainous countries they contribute greatly to cheer the wintry landscape   geo you were so good when we walked out last to tell us a good deal about oaks i thought it one of the prettiest lessons i ever heard i should be very glad if you would give us such another about firs   har so should i too i am sure   tut with all my heart and i am pleased that you ask me nothing is so great an encouragement to a tutor as to find his pupils of their own accord seeking after useful knowledge   geo and i think it is very useful to know such things as these   tut certainly it is well then  you may know the pine or firtribe in general at first sight as most of them are of a bluishgreen color and all have leaves consisting of a strong narrow pointed blade which gives them somewhat of a stiff appearance then all of them bear a hard scaly fruit of a longish or conical form   har are they what we call firapples   tut yes that is one of the names boys give them   har we often pick them up under trees and throw them at one another   geo i have sometimes brought home my pocket full to burn they make a fine clear flame   tut well  do you know where the seeds lie in them   geo no  have they any   tut yes  at the bottom of every scale lie two winged seeds but when the scales open the seeds fall out so that you can seldom find any in those you pick up   har are the seeds good for any thing   tut there is a kind of pine in the south of europe called the stone pine the kernels of which are eaten and said to be as sweet as an almond and birds pick out the seeds of other sorts though they are so well defended by the woody scales   har they must have good strong bills then   tut of this tribe of trees a variety of species are found in different countries and are cultivated in this but the only kind native here is the wild pine or scotch fir of this there are large natural forests in the highlands of scotland and the principal plantations consist of it it is a hardy sort fit for barren and mountainous soils but grows slowly   geo pray what are those very tall trees that grow in two rows before the old hall in our village   tut they are the common or spruce fir a native of norway and other northern countries and one of the loftiest of the tribe but observe those trees that grow singly in the grounds opposite to us with widespread branches pointing downwards and trailing on the ground thence gradually lessening till the top of the tree ends almost in a point   har what beautiful trees   tut they are the pines called larches natives of the alps and apennines and now frequently planted to decorate our gardens these are not properly evergreens as they shed their leaves in winter but quickly recover them again then we have besides the weymouth pine which is the tallest species in america  the silver fir so called from the silvery hue of its foliage  the pinaster  and a tree of ancient fame the cedar of lebanon   geo i suppose that is a very great tree   tut it grows to a large size but is very slow in coming to its full growth   geo are pines and firs very useful trees   tut perhaps the most so of any by much the greatest part of the wood used among us comes from them   har what  more than from the oak   tut yes much more almost all the timber used in building houses for floors beams rafters and roofs is fir   geo does it all grow in this country   tut scarcely any of it norway sweden and russia are the countries from which we draw our timber and a vast trade there is in it you have seen timber yards   geo oh yes  several   tut in them you would observe some very long thick beams called balks those are whole trees only stripped of the bark and squared you would also see great piles of planks and boards of different lengths and thickness those are called deal and are brought over ready sawn from the countries where they grow they are of different colors the white are chiefly from the fir tree the yellow and red from the pine   har i suppose there must be great forests of them in those countries or else they could not send us so much   tut yes the mountains of norway are overrun with them enough for the supply of all europe but on account of their ruggedness and want of roads it is found impossible to get the trees when felled down to the seacoast unless they grow near some river   geo how do they manage them   tut they take the opportunity when the rivers are swelled with rains or melted snow and tumble the trees into them when they are carried down to the mouths of the rivers where they are stopped by a kind of pens   har i should like to see them swimming down the stream   tut yes  it would be curious enough for in some places these torrents roll over rocks making steep water falls down which the trees are carried headlong and often do not rise again till they are got to a considerable distance and many of them are broken and torn to pieces in the passage   geo are these woods used for any thing besides building   tut for a variety of purposes such as boxes trunks packingcases pales wainscots and the like deal is a very soft wood easily worked light and cheap which makes it preferred for so many uses though it is not very durable and is very liable to split   har yes  i know my box is made of deal and the lid is split all to pieces with driving nails into it   geo are ships ever built with fir   tut it was one of the first woods made use of for naval purposes and in the poets you will find the words pine and fir frequently employed to signify ship but as navigation has improved the stronger and more durable woods have generally taken its place however in the countries where fir is very plentiful large ships are still built with it for though they last but a short time they cost so little in proportion that the profit of a few voyages is sufficient then from the great lightness of the wood they swim higher in the water and consequently will bear more loading most of the large ships that bring timber from archangel in russia are built of fir as for the masts of ships those i have already told you are all made of fir or pine on account of their straightness and lightness   geo are there not some lines in miltons paradise lost about that   tut yes the spear of satan is magnified by a comparison with a lofty pine  his spear to equal which the tallest pine hewn on norwegian hills to be the mast of some great ammiral were but a wand  har i remember too that the walking staff of the giant polypheme was a pine   tut ay  so virgil and ovid tell us and he must have been a giant indeed to use such a stick well so much for the wood of these trees but i have more to say about their uses   har i am glad of it   tut all of the tribe contain a juice of a bitterish taste and strong fragrant smell this in some is so abundant as to flow out from incisions when it is called turpentine the larch in particular yields a large quantity turpentine is one of the substances called resinous it is sticky transparent very inflammable and will not mix with water but will dissolve in spirits of wine   geo what is it used for   tut it is used medicinally particularly in the composition of plasters and ointments it also is an ingredient in varnishes cements and the like an oil distilled from turpentine is employed in medicine and is much used by painters for mixing up their colors what remains after getting this oil is common rosin all these substances take fire very easily and burn with a great flame and the wood of the pine has so much of this quality when dry that it has been used in many countries for torches   har i know deal shavings burn very briskly   geo yes and matches are made of bits of deal dipped in brimstone   tut true  and when it was the custom to burn the bodies of the dead as you read in homer and other old authors the pines and pitchtrees composed great part of the funeral pile   har but what are pitchtrees does pitch grow upon trees   tut i was going on to tell you about that tar is a product of the trees of this kind especially of one species called the pitchpine the wood is burned in a sort of oven made in the earth and the resinous juice sweats out and acquires a peculiar taste and a black color from the fire this is tar tar when boiled down to dryness becomes pitch   geo tar and pitch are chiefly used about ships are they not   tut they resist moisture and therefore are of great service in preventing things from decaying that are exposed to wet for this reason the cables and other ropes of ships are well soaked with tar and the sides of ships are covered with pitch mixed with other ingredients their seams too or the places where the planks join are filled with tow dipped in a composition of rosin tallow and pitch to keep out the water wood for paling for piles coverings of roofs and other purposes of the like nature are often tarred over cisterns and casks are pitched to prevent leaking   har but what are sheep tarred for after they are sheared   tut to cure wounds and sores in their skin for the like purposes an ointment made with tar is often rubbed upon childrens heads several parts of the pine are medicinal the tops and green cones of the spruce fir are brewed with malt and the liquor called sprucebeer is much drunk in america particularly for the scurvy   geo is it pleasant   tut not to those who are unaccustomed to it well  i have now finished my lesson so let us walk   har shall we go through the grounds   tut yes and then we will view some of the different kinds of fir and pine more closely and i will show you the difference of their leaves and cones by which they are distinguished   the rookery there the hoarse voicd hungry rook near her stickbuilt nest does croak waving on the topmost bough  these lines mr stangrove repeated pointing up to a rookery as he was walking in an avenue of tall trees with his son francis  francis is that a rookery papa   mr st it is do you hear what a cawing the birds make   fr yes  and i see them hopping about among the boughs pray are not rooks the same with crows   mr st they are a species of crow but they differ from the carrion crow and raven in not living upon dead flesh but upon corn and other seeds and grass they indeed pick up beetles and other insects and worms see what a number of them have lighted on yonder ploughed field almost blackening it over   fr what are they doing   mr st searching for grubs and worms you see the men in the field do not molest them for they do a great deal of service by destroying grubs which if they were suffered to grow to winged insects would do much mischief to the trees and plants   fr but do they not hurt the corn   mr st yes  they tear up a good deal of green corn if they are not driven away but upon the whole rooks are reckoned the farmers friends and they do not choose to have them destroyed   fr do all rooks live in rookeries   mr st it is the general nature of them to associate together and build in numbers on the same or adjoining trees but this is often in the midst of woods or natural groves however they have no objection to the neighborhood of man but readily take to a plantation of tall trees though it be close to a house and this is commonly called a rookery they will even fix their habitations on trees in the midst of towns and i have seen a rookery in a churchyard in one of the closest parts of london   fr i think a rookery is a sort of town itself   mr st it is  a village in the air peopled with numerous inhabitants and nothing can be more amusing than to view them all in motion flying to and fro and busied in their several occupations the spring is their busiest time early in the year they begin to repair their nests or build new ones   fr do they all work together or every one for itself   mr st each pair after they have coupled builds its own nest and instead of helping they are very apt to steal the materials from one another if both birds go out at once in search of sticks they often find at their return the work all destroyed and the materials carried off so that one of them generally stays at home to keep watch however i have met with a story which shows that they are not without some sense of the criminality of thieving there was in a rookery a lazy pair of rooks who never went out to get sticks for themselves but made a practice of watching when their neighbors were abroad and helped themselves from their nests they had served most of the community in this manner and by these means had just finished their own nest when all the other rooks in a rage fell upon them at once pulled their nest in pieces beat them soundly and drove them from their society   fr that was very right  i should have liked to have seen it but why do they live together if they do not help one another   mr st they probably receive pleasure from the company of their own kind as men and various other creatures do then though they do not assist one another in building they are mutually serviceable in many ways if a large bird of prey hovers about a rookery for the purpose of carrying off any of the young ones they all unite to drive him away when they are feeding in a flock several are placed as sentinels upon the trees all round who give the alarm if any danger approaches they often go a long way from home to feed but every evening the whole flock returns making a loud cawing as they fly as if to direct and call in the stragglers the older rooks take the lead you may distinguish them by the whiteness of their bills occasioned by their frequent digging in the ground by which the black feathers at the root of the bill are worn off   fr do rooks always keep to the same trees   mr st yes  they are much attached to them and when the trees happen to be cut down they seem greatly distressed and keep hovering about them as they are falling and will scarcely desert them when they lie on the ground   fr poor things i suppose they feel as we should if our town was burned down or overthrown by an earthquake   mr st no doubt the societies of animals greatly resemble those of man and that of rooks is like those of men in a savage state such as the communities of the north american indians it is a sort of league for mutual aid and defense but in which every one is left to do as he pleases without any obligation to employ himself for the whole body others unite in a manner resembling more civilized societies of men this is the case with the beavers they perform great public works by the united efforts of the whole community such as damming up streams and constructing mounds for their habitations as these are works of great art and labor some of them must probably act under the direction of others and be compelled to work whether they will or not many curious stories are told to this purpose by those who have observed them in their remotest haunts where they exercise their full sagacity   fr but are they all true   mr st that is more than i can answer for yet what we certainly know of the economy of bees may justify us in believing extraordinary things of the sagacity of animals the society of bees goes further than that of beavers and in some respects beyond most among men themselves they not only inhabit a common dwelling and perform great works in common but they lay up a store of provision which is the property of the whole community and is not used except at certain seasons and under certain regulations a beehive is a true image of a commonwealth where no member acts for himself alone but for the whole body   fr but there are drones among them who do not work at all   mr st yes  and at the approach of winter they are driven out of the hive and left to perish with cold and hunger but i have not leisure at present to tell you more about bees you shall one day see them at work in a glass hive in the mean time remember one thing which applies to all the societies of animals and i wish it did as well to all those of men likewise   fr what is that   mr st the principle upon which they all associate is to obtain some benefit for the whole body not to give particular advantages to a few   dialogue on things to be learned between mamma and kitty kitty pray mamma may i leave off working i am tired   mamma you have done very little my dear you know you were to finish all that hem   k but i had rather write now mamma or read or get my french grammar   m i know very well what that means kitty you had rather do any thing but what i set you about   k no mamma but you know i can work very well already and i have a great many other things to learn there is miss rich that cannot sew half so well as i and she is learning music and drawing already besides dancing and i dont know how many other things she tells me that they hardly work at all in their school   m your tongue runs at a great rate my dear but in the first place you cannot sew very well for if you could you would not have been so long in doing this little piece then i hope you will allow that mammas know better what is proper for their little girls to learn than they do themselves   k to be sure mamma but as i suppose i must learn all these things some time or other i thought you would like to have me begin them soon for i have often heard you say that children cannot be set too early about what is necessary for them to do   m that is very true but all things are not equally necessary to every one but some that are very fit for one are scarcely proper at all for others   k why mamma   m because my dear it is the purpose of all education to fit persons for the station in which they are hereafter to live and you know there are very great differences in that respect both among men and women   k are there i thought all ladies lived alike   m it is usual to call all welleducated women who have no occasion to work for their livelihood ladies but if you will think a little you must see that they live very differently from each other for their fathers and husbands are in very different ranks and situations in the world you know   k yes i know that some are lords and some are squires and some are clergymen and some are merchants and some are doctors and some are shopkeepers   m well and do you think the wives and daughters of all these persons can have just the same things to do and the same duties to perform you know how i spend my time i have to go to market and provide for the family to look after the servants to help in taking care of you children and in teaching you to see that your clothes are in proper condition and assist in making and mending for myself and you and your papa all this is my necessary duty and besides this i must go out a visiting to keep up our acquaintance this i call partly business and partly amusement then when i am tired and have done all that i think necessary i may amuse myself with reading or in any other proper way now a great many of these employments do not belong to lady wealthy or mrs rich who keep housekeepers and governesses and servants of all kinds to do every thing for them it is very proper therefore for them to pay more attention to music drawing ornamental work and any other elegant manner of passing their time and making themselves agreeable   k and shall i have all the same things to do mamma that you have   m it is impossible my dear to foresee what your future station will be but you have no reason to expect that if you have a family you will have fewer duties to perform than i have this is the way of life for which your education should prepare you and every thing will be useful and important for you to learn in proportion as it will make you fit for this   k but when i am grown a young lady shall not i have to visit and go to assemblies and plays as miss wilsons and miss johnsons do   m it is very likely you may enter into some amusements of this sort but even then you will have several more serious employments which will take up a much greater part of your time and if you do not do them properly you will have no right to partake of the others   k what will they be mamma   m why dont you think it proper that you should assist me in my household affairs a little as soon as you are able   k o yes mamma i should be very glad to do that   m well consider what talents will be necessary for that purpose will not a good hand at your needle be one of the very first qualities   k i believe it will   m yes and not only in assisting me but in making things for yourself you know how we admired miss smarts ingenuity when she was with us in contriving and making so many articles of her dress for which she must otherwise have gone to the milliners which would have cost a great deal of money   k yes she made my pretty bonnet and she made you a very handsome cap   m very true she was so clever as not only to furnish herself with these things but to oblige her friends with some of her work and i dare say she does a great deal of plain work also for herself and her mother well then you are convinced of the importance of this business i hope   k yes mamma   m reading and writing are such necessary parts of education that i need not say much to you about them   k o no for i love reading dearly   m i know you do if you can get entertaining stories to read but there are many things also to be read for instruction which perhaps may not be so pleasant at first   k but what need is there of so many books of this sort   m some are to teach you your duty to your maker and your fellow creatures of which i hope you are sensible you ought not to be ignorant then it is very right to be acquainted with geography for you remember how poor miss blunder was laughed at for saying that if she ever went to france it should be by land   k that was because england is an island and all surrounded with water was not it   m yes great britain which contains both england and scotland is an island well it is very useful to know something of the nature of plants and animals and minerals because we are always using some or other of them something too of the heavenly bodies is very proper to be known both that we may admire the power and wisdom of god in creating them and that we may not make foolish mistakes when their motions and properties are the subject of conversation the knowledge of history too is very important especially that of our own country and in short every thing that makes part of the discourse of rational and welleducated people ought in some degree to be studied by every one who has proper opportunities   k yes i like some of those things very well but pray mamma what do i learn french for  am i ever to live in france   m probably not my dear but there are a great many books written in french that are very well worth reading and it may every now and then happen that you may be in company with foreigners who cannot speak english and as they almost all talk french you may be able to converse with them in that language   k yes i remember there was a gentleman here that came from germany i think and he could hardly talk a word of english but papa and you could talk with him in french and i wished very much to be able to understand what you were saying for i believe part of it was about me   m it was well then you see the use of french but i cannot say this is a necessary part of knowledge to young women in general only it is well worth acquiring if a person has leisure and opportunity i will tell you however what is quite necessary for one in your station and that is to write a good hand and to cast accounts well   k i should like to write well because then i could send letters to my friends when i pleased and it would not be such a scrawl as our maid betty writes that i dare say her friends can hardly make out   m she had not the advantage of learning when young for you know she taught herself since she came to us which was a very sensible thing of her and i suppose she will improve well but accounts are almost as necessary as writing for how could i cast up all the market bills and tradesmens accounts and keep my house books without it   k and what is the use of that mamma   m it is of use to prevent our being overcharged in any thing and to know exactly how much we spend and whether or no we are exceeding our income and in what articles we ought to be more saving without keeping accounts the richest man might soon come to be ruined before he knew his affairs were going wrong   k but do women always keep accounts i thought that was generally the business of the men   m it is their business to keep the accounts belonging to their trade or profession or estate but it is the business of their wives to keep all the household accounts and a woman almost in any rank unless perhaps some of the highest of all is to blame if she does not take upon her this necessary office i remember a remarkable instance of the benefit which a young lady derived from an attention to this point an eminent merchant in london failed for a great sum   k what does that mean mamma   m that he owed a great deal more than he could pay his creditors that is those to whom he was indebted on examining his accounts found great deficiencies which they could not make out for he had kept his books very irregularly and had omitted to put down many things which he had bought and sold they suspected therefore that great waste had been made in the family expenses and they were the more suspicious of this as a daughter who was a very genteel young lady was his housekeeper his wife being dead she was told of this upon which when the creditors were all met she sent them her housebooks for their examination they were all written in a very fair hand and every single article was entered with the greatest regularity and the sums were all cast up with perfect exactness the gentlemen were so highly pleased with this proof of the young ladys ability that they all agreed to make her a handsome present out of the effects and one of the richest of them who was in want of a clever wife soon after paid his addresses to her and married her   k that was very lucky for i suppose she took care of her poor father when she was rich but i shall have nothing of that sort to do a great while   m no but young women should keep their own accounts of clothes and pocketmoney and other expenses as i intend you shall do when you grow up   k am not i to learn dancing and music and drawing too mamma   m dancing you shall certainly learn pretty soon because it is not only an agreeable accomplishment in itself but is useful in forming the body to ease and elegance in all its motions as to the other two they are merely ornamental accomplishments which though a woman of middling station may be admired for possessing yet she will never be censured for being without the propriety of attempting to acquire them must depend on natural genius for them and upon leisure and other accidental circumstances for some they are too expensive and many are unable to make such progress in them as will repay the pains of beginning it is soon enough however for us to think about these things and at any rate they are not to come in till you have made a very good proficiency in what is useful and necessary but i see you have now finished what i set you about so you shall take a walk with me into the marketplace where i have two or three things to buy   k shall not we call at the booksellers to enquire for those new books that miss reader was talking about   m perhaps we may now lay up your work neatly and get on your hat and tippet   mouse lapdog and monkey a fable a poor little mouse being half starved ventured one day to steal from behind the wainscot while the family were at dinner and trembling all the while picked up a few crumbs which were scattered on the ground she was soon observed however every body was immediately alarmed some called for the cat others took up whatever was at hand and endeavored to crush her to pieces and the poor terrified animal was driven round the room in an agony of terror at length however she was fortunate enough to gain her hole where she sat panting with fatigue when the family were again seated a lapdog and a monkey came into the room the former jumped into the lap of his mistress fawned upon every one of the children and made his court so effectually that he was rewarded with some of the best morsels of the entertainment the monkey on the other hand forced himself into notice by his grimaces he played a thousand little mischievous tricks and was regaled at the appearance of the desert with plenty of nuts and apples the unfortunate little mouse who saw from her hiding place every thing that passed sighed in anguish of heart and said to herself alas how ignorant was i to imagine that poverty and distress were sufficient recommendations to the charity of the opulent i now find that whoever is not master of fawning and buffoonery is but ill qualified for a dependant and will not be suffered even to pick up the crumbs that fall from the table  animals and their countries over africs sand the tawny lion

cat of mrs petlove her disorder was a shortness of breath proceeding partly from old age and partly from fat as she felt her end approaching she called her children to her and with a good deal of difficulty spoke as follows  before i depart from this world my children i mean if my breath will give me leave to relate to you the principal events of my life as the variety of scenes i have gone through may afford you some useful instruction for avoiding those dangers to which our species are particularly exposed  without further preface then i was born at a farmhouse in a village some miles from hence and almost as soon as i came into the world i was very near leaving it again my mother brought five of us at a litter and as the frugal people of the house only kept cats to be useful and were already sufficiently stocked we were immediately doomed to be drowned and accordingly a boy was ordered to take us all and throw us into the horsepond this commission he performed with the pleasure boys seem naturally to take in acts of cruelty and we were presently set a swimming while we were struggling for life a little girl daughter to the farmer came running to the pond side and begged very hard that she might save one of us and bring it up for her own after some dispute her request was granted and the boy reaching out his arm took hold of me who was luckily nearest him and brought me out when i was just spent i was laid on the grass and it was some time before i recovered the girl then restored me to my mother who was overjoyed to get again one of her little ones and for fear of another mischance she took me in her mouth to a dark hole where she kept me till i could see and was able to run by her side as soon as i came to light again my little mistress took possession of me and tended me very carefully her fondness indeed was sometimes troublesome as she pinched my sides with carrying me and once or twice hurt me a good deal by letting me fall soon however i became strong and active and played and gamboled all day long to the great delight of my mistress and her companions  at this time i had another narrow escape a man brought into the house a strange dog who had been taught to worry all the cats that came in his way my mother slunk away at his entrance but i thinking like a little fool as i was that i was able to protect myself staid on the floor growling and setting up my back by way of defiance the dog instantly ran at me and before i could get my claws ready seized me with his mouth and began to gripe and shake me most terribly i screamed out and by good luck my mistress was within hearing she ran to us but was not able to disengage me however a servant seeing her distress took a great stick and gave the dog such a bang on the back that he was forced to let me go he had used me so roughly that i was not able to stand for some time but by care and a good constitution i recovered  i was now running after every bodys heels by which means i got one day locked up in the dairy i was not sorry for this accident thinking to feast upon the cream and other good things but having climbed upon a shelf to get at a bowl of cream i unluckily fell backwards into a large vessel of buttermilk where i should probably have been drowned had not the maid heard the noise and come to see what was the matter she took me out scolding bitterly at me and after making me undergo a severe discipline at the pump to clean me she dismissed me with a good whipping i took care never to follow her into the dairy again  after a while i began to get into the yard and my mother took me into the barn upon a mousing expedition i shall never forget the pleasure this gave me we sat by a hole and presently out came a mouse with a brood of young ones my mother darted among them and first demolished the old one and then pursued the little ones who ran about squeaking in dreadful perplexity i now thought it was time for me to do something and accordingly ran after a straggler and soon overtook it oh how proud was i as i stood over my trembling captive and patted him with my paws my pride however soon met with a check for seeing one day a large rat i courageously flew at him but instead of turning tail he gave me such a bite on the nose that i ran away to my mother mewing piteously with my face all bloody and swelled for some time i did not meddle with rats again but at length growing stronger and more skilful i feared neither rats nor any other vermin and acquired the reputation of an excellent hunter  i had some other escapes about this time once i happened to meet with some poisoned food laid for the rats and eating it i was thrown into a disorder that was very near killing me at another time i chanced to set my foot in a rattrap and received so many deep wounds from its teeth that though i was loosened as gently as possible by the people who heard me cry i was rendered lame for some weeks after  time went on and i arrived at my full growth and forming an acquaintance with a hecat about my age after a decent resistance by scolding biting and scratching we made a match of it i became a mother in due time and had the mortification of seeing several broods of my kittens disposed of in the same manner as my brothers and sisters had been i shall mention two or three other adventures in the order i remember them i was once prowling for birds along a hedge at some distance from home when the squires greyhounds came that way a coursing as soon as they spied me they set off full speed and running much faster than i could do were just at my tail when i reached a tree and saved myself by climbing up it but a greater danger befell me on meeting with a parcel of boys returning from school they surrounded me before i was aware and obliged me to take refuge in a tree but i soon found that a poor defense against such enemies for they assembled about it and threw stones on all sides so that i could not avoid receiving many hard blows one of which brought me senseless to the ground the biggest boy now seized me and proposed to the rest making what he called rare sport with me this sport was to tie me on a board and launching me on a pond to set some waterdogs at me who were to duck and half drown me while i was to defend myself by biting their noses and scratching their eyes already was i bound and just ready to be set a sailing when the schoolmaster taking a walk that way and seeing the bustle came up and obliged the boys to set me at liberty severely reprimanding them for their cruel intentions  the next remarkable incident of my life was the occasion of my removal from the country my mistresss brother had a tame linnet of which he was very fond for it would come and light on his shoulder when he called it and feed out of his hand and it sung well besides this bird was usually either in his cage or upon a high perch but one unlucky day when he and i were alone in the room together he came down on the table to pick up crumbs i spied him and not being able to resist the temptation sprung at him and catching him in my claws soon began to devour him i had almost finished when his master came into the room and seeing me with the remains of poor linnet in my mouth he ran to me in the greatest fury and after chasing me several times round the room at length caught me he was proceeding instantly to hang me when his sister by many entreaties and tears persuaded him after a good whipping to forgive me upon the promise that i should be sent away accordingly the next marketday i was dispatched in the cart to a relations of theirs in this town who wanted a good cat as the house was overrun with mice  in the service of this family i continued a good while performing my duty as a mouser extremely well so that i was in high esteem i soon became acquainted with all the particulars of a town life and distinguished my activity in climbing up walls and houses and jumping from roof to roof either in pursuit of prey or upon gossipping parties with my companions once however i had like to have suffered for my venturing for having made a great jump from one house to another i lit upon a loose tile which giving way with me i fell from a vast height into the street and should certainly have been killed had i not had the luck to light in a dungcart whence i escaped with no other injury but being half stifled with filth  notwithstanding the danger i had run from killing the linnet i am sorry to confess that i was again guilty of a similar offense i contrived one night to leap down from a roof upon the board of some pigeonholes which led to a garret inhabited by those birds i entered and finding them asleep made sad havoc among all that were within my reach killing and sucking the blood of near a dozen i was near paying dearly for this too for on attempting to return i found it was impossible for me to leap up again to the place from whence i had descended so that after several dangerous trials i was obliged to wait trembling in the place where i had committed all these murders till the owner came up in the morning to feed his pigeons i rushed out between his legs as soon as the door was opened and had the good fortune to get safe down stairs and make my escape through a window unknown but never shall i forget the horrors i felt that night let my double danger be a warning to you my children to control your savage appetites and on no account to do harm to those creatures which like ourselves are under the protection of man we cats all lie under a bad name for treacherous dispositions in this respect and with shame i must acknowledge it is but too well merited  well  but my breath begins to fail me and i must hasten to a conclusion i still lived in the same family when our present kind mistress mrs petlove having lost a favorite tabby advertised a very handsome price for another that should as nearly as possible resemble her dead darling my owners tempted by the offer took me for the good ladys inspection and i had the honor of being preferred to a multitude of rivals i was immediately settled in the comfortable mansion we now inhabit and had many favors and indulgencies bestowed upon me such as i had never before experienced among these i reckon one of the principal that of being allowed to rear all my children and to see them grow up in peace and plenty my adventures here have been few for after the monkey had spitefully bit off the last joint of my tail for which i had the satisfaction to see him soundly corrected i kept beyond the length of his chain and neither the parrot nor lapdogs ever dared to molest me one of the gest afflictions i have felt here was the ing or a whole litter of my kittens by a fat old lady a friend of my mistresss who fat down on the chair where they lay and never perceived the mischief she was doing till she rose though i pulled her clothes and used all the means in my power to show my uneasiness this misfortune my mistress took to heart almost as much as myself and the lady has never since entered our doors indeed both i and mine have ever been treated here with the utmost kindness  perhaps with too much for to the pampering me with delicacies together with mrs abigails frequent washings i attribute this asthma which is now putting an end to my life rather sooner than its natural period but i know all was meant well and with my last breath i charge you all to show your gratitude to our worthy mistress by every return in your power  and now my dear children farewell we shall perhaps meet again in a land where there are no dogs to worry us or boys to torment us  adieu  having thus said grimalkin became speechless and presently departed this life to the great grief of all the family  the little dog a fable what shall i do said a very little dog one day to his mother to show my gratitude to our good master and make myself of some value to him i cannot draw or carry burdens like the horse nor give him milk like the cow nor lend him my covering for his clothing like the sheep nor produce him eggs like the poultry nor catch mice and rats so well as the cat i cannot divert him with singing like the canaries and linnets nor can i defend him against robbers like our relation towzer i should not be of use to him even if i were dead as the hogs are i am a poor insignificant creature not worth the cost of keeping and i dont see that i can do a single thing to entitle me to his regard so saying the poor little dog hung down his head in silent despondency  my dear child replied his mother though your abilities are but small yet a hearty good will is sufficient to supply all defects do but love him dearly and prove your love by all the means in your power and you will not fail to please him  the little dog was comforted with this assurance and on his masters approach ran to him licked his feet gamboled before him and every now and then stopped wagging his tail and looking up to his master with expressions of the most humble and affectionate attachment the master observed him ha little fido said he you are an honest goodnatured little fellow  and stooped down to pat his head poor fido was ready to go out of his wits with joy  fido was now his masters constant companion in his walks playing and skipping round him and amusing him by a thousand sportive tricks he took care however not to be troublesome by leaping on him with dirty paws nor would he follow him into the parlour unless invited he also attempted to make himself useful by a number of little services he would drive away the sparrows as they were stealing the chickens meat and would run and bark with the utmost fury at any strange pigs or other animals that offered to come into the yard he kept the poultry geese and pigs from straying beyond their bounds and particularly from doing mischief in the garden he was always ready to alarm towzer if there was any suspicious noise about the house day or night if his master pulled off his coat in the field to help his workmen as he would sometimes do fido always sat by it and would not suffer either man or beast to touch it by this means he came to be considered as a very trusty protector of his masters property  his master was once confined to his bed with a dangerous illness fido planted himself at the chamber door and could not be persuaded to leave it even to take food and as soon as his master was so far recovered as to sit up fido being admitted into the room ran up to him with such marks of excessive joy and affection as would have melted any heart to behold this circumstance wonderfully endeared him to his master and some time after he had an opportunity of doing him a very important service one hot day after dinner his master was sleeping in a summer house with fido by his side the building was old and crazy and the dog who was faithfully watching his master perceived the walls shake and pieces of mortar fall from the ceiling he comprehended the danger and began barking to awake his master and this not sufficing he jumped up and gently bit his finger the master upon this started up and had just time to get out of the door before the whole building fell down fido who was behind got hurt by some rubbish which fell upon him on which his master had him taken care of with the utmost tenderness and ever after acknowledged his obligation to this little animal as the preserver of his life thus his love and fidelity had their full reward  moral the poorest man may repay his obligations to the richest and greatest by faithful and affectionate service  the meanest creature may obtain the favor and regard of the creator himself by humble gratitude and steadfast obedience  the masque of nature who is this beautiful virgin that approaches clothed in a robe of light green she has a garland of flowers on her head and flowers spring up wherever she sets her foot the snow which covered the fields and the ice which was in the rivers melt away when she breathes upon them the young lambs frisk about her and the birds warble in their little throats to welcome her coming and when they see her they begin to choose their mates and to build their nests youths and maidens have ye seen this beautiful virgin if ye have tell me who is she and what is her name  who is this that comes from the south thinly clad in a light transparent garment her breath is hot and sultry she seeks the refreshment of the cool shade she seeks the clear streams the crystal brooks to bathe her languid limbs the brooks and rivulets fly from her and are dried up at her approach she cools her parched lips with berries and the grateful acid of all fruits the seedy melon the sharp apple and the red pulp of the juicy cherry which are poured out plentifully around her the tanned haymakers welcome her coming and the sheepshearer who clips the fleeces of his flock with his sounding shears when she comes let me lie under the thick shade of a spreading beech tree  let me walk with her in the early morning when the dew is yet upon the grass  let me wander with her in the soft twilight when the shepherd shuts his fold and the star of evening appears who is she that comes from the south youths and maidens tell me if you know who is she and what is her name  who is he that comes with sober pace stealing upon us unawares his garments are red with the blood of the grape and his temples are bound with a sheaf of ripe wheat his hair is thin and begins to fall and the auburn is mixed with mournful gray he shakes the brown nuts from the tree he winds the horn and calls the hunters to their sport the gun sounds the trembling partridge and the beautiful pheasant flutter bleeding in the air and fall dead at the sportsmans feet who is he that is crowned with the wheatsheaf youths and maidens tell me if ye know who is he and what is his name  who is he that comes from the north clothed in furs and warm wool he wraps his cloak close about him his head is bald his beard is made of sharp icicles he loves the blazing fire high piled upon the hearth and the wine sparkling in the glass he binds skates to his feet and skims over the frozen lakes his breath is piercing and cold and no little flower dares to peep above the surface of the ground when he is by whatever he touches turns to ice if he were to stroke you with his cold hand you would be quite stiff and dead like a piece of marble youths and maidens do you see him he is coming fast upon us and soon he will be here tell me if you know who is he and what is his name  fifth evening on the martin lock up my dear said his papa to little william at those birdnests above the chamberwindows beneath the eaves of the house some you see are but just begun  nothing but a little clay stuck against the wall others are half finished and others are quite built  close and tight  leaving nothing but a small hole for the birds to come in and go out at  what nests are they said william  thy are martins nests replied his father and there you see the owners how busily they fly backwards and forwards bringing clay and dirt in their bills and laying it upon their work forming it into shape with their bills and feet the nests are built very strong and thick like a mud wall and are lined with feathers to make a soft bed for the young martins are a kind of swallows they feed on flies gnats and other insects and always build in towns and villages about the houses people do not molest them for they do good rather than harm and it is very amusing to view their manners and actions see how swiftly they skim through the air in pursuit of their prey in the morning they are up by daybreak and twitter about your window while you are asleep in bed and all day long they are upon the wing getting food for themselves and their young as soon as they have caught a few flies they hasten to their nests pop into the hole and feed their little ones i will tell you a story about the great care they take of their young a pair of martins once built their nest in a porch and when they had young ones it happened that one of them climbing up to the hole before he was fledged fell out and lighting upon the stones was killed the old birds perceiving this accident went and got short bits of strong straw and stuck them with mud like palisades all round the hole of the nest in order to keep the other little ones from tumbling after their poor brother  how cunning that was cried william  yes said his father and i can tell you another story of their sagacity and also of their disposition to help one another a saucy cocksparrow you know what impudent rogues they are had got into a martins nest whilst the owner was abroad and when he returned the sparrow put his head into the hole and pecked at the martin with open bill as he attempted to enter his own house the poor martin was sadly provoked at this injustice but was unable by his own strength to right himself so he flew away and gathered a number of his companions who all came with a bit of clay in their bills with which they plastered up the hole of the nest and kept the sparrow in prison who died miserably for want of food and air  he was rightly served said william  so he was rejoined papa well i have more to say about the sagacity of these birds in autumn when it begins to be cold weather the martins and other swallows assemble in great numbers upon the roofs of high buildings and prepare for their departure to a warmer country for as all the insects here die in the winter they would have nothing to live on if they were to stay they take several short flights in flocks round and round in order to try their strength and then on some fine calm day they set out together for a long journey southwards over sea and land to a very distant country  but how do they find the way said william  we say answered his father that they are taught by instinct that is god has implanted in their minds a desire of traveling at the season which he knows to be proper and has also given them an impulse to take the right road they steer their course through the wide air directly to the proper spot sometimes however storms and contrary winds meet them and drive the poor birds about till they are quite spent and fall into the sea unless they happen to meet with a ship on which they can light and rest themselves the swallows from this country are supposed to go as far as the middle of africa to spend the winter where the weather is always warm and insects are to be met with all the year in spring they take another long journey back again to these northern countries sometimes when we have fine weather very early a few of them come too soon for when it changes to frost and snow again the poor creatures are starved for want of food or perished with the cold hence arises the proverb one swallow does not make a summer but when a great many of them are come we may be sure that winter is over so that we are always very glad to see them again the martins find their way back over such a vast length of sea and land to the very same villages and houses where they were bred this has been discovered by catching some of them and marking them they repair their old nests or build new ones and then set about laying eggs and hatching their young pretty things i hope you will never knock down their nests or take their eggs or young ones for as they come such a long way to visit us and lodge in our houses without fear we ought to use them kindly  the ship charles osborn when at home in the holidays had a visit from a schoolfellow who was just entered as a midshipman on board a man of war tom hardy that was his name was a freehearted spirited lad and a favorite among his companions but he never liked his book and had left school ignorant of almost every thing he came there to learn what was worse he had got a contempt for learning of all kinds and was fond of showing it what does your father mean says he to charles to keep you moping and studying over things of no use in the world but to plague folks  why cannot you go into his majestys service like me and be made a gentleman of you are old enough and i know you are a lad of spirit this kind of talk made some impression upon young osborn he became less attentive to the lessons his father set him and less willing to enter into instructive conversation this change gave his father much concern but as he knew the cause he thought it best instead of employing direct authority to attempt to give a new impression to his sons mind which might counteract the effects of his companions suggestions  being acquainted with an east india captain who was on the point of sailing he went with his son to pay him a farewell visit on board his ship they were shown all about the vessel and viewed all the preparations for so long a voyage they saw her weigh anchor and unfurl her sails and they took leave of their friend amid the shouts of the seamen and all the bustle of departure  charles was highly delighted with this scene and as they were returning could think and talk of nothing else it was easy therefore for his father to lead him into the following train of discourse  after charles had been warmly expressing his admiration of the grand sight of a large ship completely fitted out and getting under sail  i do not wonder said his father that you are so much struck with it  it is in reality one of the finest spectacles created by human skill and the noblest triumph of art over untaught nature near two thousand years ago when julius caesar came over to this island he found the natives in possession of no other kind of vessel than a sort of canoe formed of wicker work covered with hides and no bigger than a man or two could carry but the largest ship in caesars fleet was not more superior to these than the indiadiaman you have been seeing is to what that was our savage ancestors ventured only to paddle along the rivers and coasts or cross small arms of the sea in calm weather and caesar himself would have been alarmed to be a few days out of sight of land but the ship we have just left is going by itself to the opposite side of the globe prepared to encounter the tempestuous winds and mountanous waves of the vast southern ocean and to find its way to its destined port though many weeks must pass with nothing in view but sea and sky now what do you think can be the cause of this prodigious difference in the powers of man at one period and another  charles was silent  it is not said his father that there is a great deal more knowledge in one than in the other  to be sure it is said charles  father would it not think you be as impossible for any number of men untaught by their utmost efforts to build and navigate such a ship as we have seen as to fly through the air   charles i suppose it would   fa that we may be the more sensible of this let us consider how many arts and professions are necessary for this purpose come  you shall begin to name them and if you forget any i will put you in mind what is the first   chapter the shipcarpenter i think   fa true  what does he do   chapter he builds the ship   fa how is that done   chapter by fastening the planks and beams together   fa but do you suppose he can do this as a common carpenter makes a box or a set of shelves   chapter i do not know   fa do you not think that such a vast bulk requires a good deal of contrivance to bring it into shape and fit it for all its purposes   chapter yes   fa some ships you have heard sail quicker than others  some bear storms better  some carry more lading  some draw less water  and so on you do not suppose all these things are left to chance   chapter no   fa in order with certainty to produce these effects it is necessary to study proportions very exactly and to lay down an accurate scale by mathematical lines and figures after which to build the ship much has been written upon this subject and nice calculations have been made of the resistance a ship meets with in making way through the water and the best means of overcoming it also of the action of the wind on the sails and their action in pushing on the ship by means of the masts all these must be understood by a perfect master of shipbuilding   chapter but i think i know shipbuilders who have never had an education to fit them for understanding these things   fa very likely but they have followed by rote the rules laid down by others and as they work merely by imitation they cannot alter and improve as occasion may require then though common merchant ships are trusted to such builders yet in constructing men of war and indiamen persons of science are always employed the french however attend to this matter more than we do and in consequence their ships generally fail better than ours   chapter but need a captain of a ship know all these things   fa it may not be absolutely necessary yet occasions may frequently arise in which it would be of great advantage for him to be able to judge and give directions in these matters but suppose the ship built  what comes next   chapter i think she must be rigged   fa well  who are employed for this purpose   chapter mastmakers ropemakers sailmakers and i know not how many other people   fa these are all mechanical trades and though in carrying them on much ingenuity has been applied in the invention of machines and tools yet we will not stop to consider them suppose her then rigged  what next   chapter she must take in her guns and powder   fa stop there and reflect how many arts you have now set to work gunpowder is one of the greatest inventions of modern times and what has given such a superiority to civilized nations over the barbarous an english frigate surrounded by the canoes of all the savages in the world would easily beat them off by means of her guns and if caesar were to come again to england with his fleet a battery of cannon would sink all his ships and set his legions a swimming in the sea but the making of gunpowder and the casting of cannon are arts that require an exact knowledge of the science of chemistry   chapter what is that   fa it comprehends the knowledge of all the properties of metals and minerals salts sulphur oils and gums and of the action of fire and water and air upon all substances and the effects of mixing different things together gunpowder is a mixture of three things only saltpetre or nitre sulphur of brimstone and charcoal but who could have thought such a wonderful effect would have been produced by it   chapter was it not first discovered by accident   fa yes  but it was by one who was making chemical experiments and many more experiments have been employed to bring it to perfection   chapter but need a captain know how to make gunpowder and cannon   fa it is not necessary though it may often be useful to him however it is quite necessary that he should know how to employ them now the sciences of gunnery and fortification depend entirely upon mathematical principles for by these are calculated the direction of a ball through the air the distance it will reach to and the force with which it will strike any thing all engineers therefore must be good mathematicians   chapter but i think i have heard of gunners being little better than the common men   fa true  there is a way of doing that business as well as many others by mere practice and an uneducated man may acquire skill in pointing a cannon as well as in shooting with a common gun but this is only in ordinary cases and an abler head is required to direct well  now suppose your ship completely fitted out for sea and the wind blowing fair how will you navigate her   chapter i would spread the sails and steer by the rudder   fa very well  but how would you find your way to the port you were bound for   chapter that i cannot tell   fa nor perhaps can i make you exactly comprehend it but i can show you enough to convince you that it is an affair that requires much knowledge and early study in former times when a vessel left the sight of land it was steered by observation of the sun by day and the moon and stars by night the sun you know rises in the east and sets in the west and at noon in these parts of the world it is exactly south of us these points therefore may be found out when the sun shines the moon and stars vary however their place in the sky may be known by exact observation then there is one star that always points to the north pole and is therefore called the pole star this was of great use in navigation and the word pole star is often used by the poets to signify a sure guide do you recollect the description in homers odyssey when ulysses fails away by himself from the island of calypso  how he steers by the stars   chapter i think i remember the lines in popes translation   fa repeat them then   chapter placed at the helm he fat and marked the skies nor closed in sleep his ever watchful eyes there viewed the pleiads and the northern team and great orions more refulgent beam to which around the axle of the sky the bear revolving points his golden eye who shines exalted on the etherial plain nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main  fa very well  they are fine lines indeed you see then how long ago sailors thought it necessary to study astronomy but as it frequently happens especially in stormy weather that the stars are not to be seen this method was subject to great uncertainty which rendered it dangerous to undertake distant voyages at length near  00 years since a property was discovered in a mineral called the magnet or loadstone which removed the difficulty this was its polarity or quality of always pointing to the poles of the earth that is due north and south this it can communicate to any piece of iron so that a needle well rubbed in a particular manner by a loadstone and then balanced upon its center so as to turn round freely will always point to the north with an instrument called a mariners compass made of one of these needles and a card marked with all the points north south east and west and the divisions between these a ship may be steered to any part of the globe   chapter it is a very easy matter then   fa not quite so easy neither in a long voyage cross or contrary winds blow a ship out of her direct course so that without nice calculations both of the straight tract she has gone and all the deviations from it the sailors would not know where they were nor to what point to steer it is also frequently necessary to take observations as they call it that is to observe with an instrument where the suns place in the sky is at noon by which they can determine the latitude they are in other observations are necessary to determine their longitude what these mean i can show you upon the globe it is enough now to say that by means of both together they can tell the exact spot they are on at any time and then by consulting their map and setting their compass they can steer right to the place they want but all this requires a very exact knowledge of astronomy the use of the globes mathematics and arithmetic which you may suppose is not to be acquired without much study a great number of curious instruments have been invented to assist in these operations so that there is scarcely any matter in which so much art and science have been employed as in navigation and none but a very learned and civilized nation can excel in it   chapter but how is tom hardy to do for i am pretty sure he does not understand any of these things   fa he must learn them if he means to come to any thing in his profession he may indeed head a pressgang or command a boats crew without them but he will never be fit to take charge of a man of war or even a merchant ship   chapter however he need not learn latin and greek   fa i cannot say indeed that a sailor has occasion for those languages but a knowledge of latin makes it much easier to acquire all modern languages and i hope you do not think them unnecessary to him   chapter i did not know they were of much importance   fa no do you think that one who may probably visit most countries in europe and their foreign settlements should be able to converse in no other language than his own if the knowledge of languages is not useful to him i know not to whom it is so he can hardly do at all without knowing some and the more the better   chapter poor tom then i doubt he has not chosen so well as he thinks   fa i doubt so too  here ended the conversation they soon after reached home and charles did not forget to desire his father to show him on the globe what longitude and latitude meant   things by their right names charles papa you grow very lazy last winter you used to tell us stories and now you never tell us any and we are all got round the fire quite ready to hear you pray dear papa let us have a very pretty one   father with all my heart  what shall it be   c a bloody murder papa   f a bloody murder well then  once upon a time some men dressed all alike   c with black crapes over their faces   f no they had steel caps on  having crossed a dark heath wound cautiously along the skirts of a deep forest   c they were illlooking fellows i dare say   f i cannot say so on the contrary they were tall personable men as most one shall see  leaving on their right hand an old ruined tower on the hill   c at midnight just as the clock struck twelve was it not papa   f no really it was on a fine balmy summers morning  and moved forwards one behind another   c as still as death creeping along under the hedges   f on the contrary  they walked remarkably upright and so far from endeavoring to be hushed and still they made a loud noise as they came along with several sorts of instruments   c but papa they would be found out immediately   f they did not seem to wish to conceal themselves on the contrary they gloried in what they were about  they moved forwards i say to a large plain where stood a neat pretty village which they set on fire   c set a village on fire wicked wretches   f and while it was burning they murdered  twenty thousand men   c o fie papa you do not intend i should believe this i thought all along you were making up a tale as you often do but you shall not catch me this time what they lay still i suppose and let these fellows cut their throats   f no truly  they resisted as long as they could   c how should these men kill twenty thousand people pray   f why not the murderers were thirty thousand   c o now i have found you out you mean a battle   f indeed i do i do not know of any murders half so bloody   end of the first volume
