a collection of original papers and material transactions concerning the late great affair of the union between england and scotland also an exact journal of the proceedings of the treaty as well at london as in edinburgh wherein the privileges of the presbyterian kirk and the case of toleration of episcopal dissenters there are very clearly stated  in five parts  faithfully collected from the records and registers by a person concerned in the said treaty and present in both kingdoms at the time of its transacting  london printed for j knapton at the crown in st pauls churchyard n cliff at the bible and three crowns near mercers chapel and j baker at the blackboy in paternoster row mdccxii  the preface in writing a history of the union it could not be reasonably expected that i should go any farther than the finishing ratifying and exchanging the treaty in the respective parliaments of the two nations to be united  and this i think i have finished in the following sheets  however since the work has lain longer in the press than i at first expected and some remarkable things have in consequence of and very much depending upon the union happened since i could not satisfy my self without giving a short abridgement of the state of things between the time of finishing the treaty and the publication of this work which tho it be rather a kind of summary recapitulation of things than a historical narration may yet be equally profitable to him that shall enquire into the affairs of the united kingdoms at that time  the union took place as has been noted the  st of may   0  the management of the revenue the trials in the exchequer and admirality were all settled on a new foot commissioners of the customs excise and equivalent were appointed judges of the court of exchequer a new admirality and their respective offices were all fixed the coin was reformed and entirely reduced to the english standard the small copper money only excepted weights and measures were regulated in part and the respective alterations and models whether in government or commerce enacted by the union began every where to be put in practice  the british parliament had been assembled at westminster according to the treaty and had been concluded with a general satisfaction and her majesty began to see the complete end of her wishes in the union being actually consummated the northern peers and commons sitting and that too with a general satisfaction and applause in that first parliament of great britain  in this parliament several things were done for the better improving and as it was called then rendering more effectual the union particularly that of dissolving the privy council reestablishing the sessions of the peace by justices etc settling the militia and making lord lieutenants deputy lieutenants etc in every county as in england of all which particular mention is made in the following sheets  several regulations also in trade were made here for the ease of north britain particularly the removing the difficulties of bringing foreign imported goods from scotland to england and the great debate about the wine brandy etc brought into scotland in the interval between the finishing and effectual taking place of the union was put to an end entirely in the favor of scotland every thing being cleared at once and all interruptions of commerce thereby removed  but in the middle of all this harmony an accident interveend which if it had not been mercifully prevented by the immediate interposition of a divine power had at once unravelled all this happily finished constitution and that in a manner that the most violent opposer of the union could not in his warmest thoughts have honestly wished to have seen  this was the french invasion which endangered not the union only but bid fair for overturning the whole frame of the present establishment in church and state tearing up the very foundation of our constitution i mean the revolution and restoring not only tyranny and arbitrary government but even popery it self that had so many years since and at such expense of blood and treasure been dethroned in scotland  i shall need to bring very few arguments to prove this to have been the immediate consequence of the success of this expedition after i have given a summary account of the matter of fact which is briefly as follows  about january   0  frequent advices from holland and flanders gave the government notice that the french were making great preparations at dunkirk for some secret expedition upon farther search into the matter of fact it appeared that several men of war were fitting out there with the utmost expedition and unusual quantities of arms and ammunition providing with a large train of artillery which were all to be shipped forthwith on board the ships fitting up as above  these advices were still seconded with others till at last the french themselves making it no longer a secret and some of the men of war being ready they ordered the stores arms and ammunition to be actually shipped on board drew their troops down to the shore and openly declared that this expedition was designed for scotland to reinstate the king of great britain so they styled the pretender in the possession of his lawful dominions as they called them and this they said was done at the earnest request of his subjects in that kingdom  it is true and most people thought it reasonable to judge that it was not probable the king of france would embark in a design of so great consequence had he not received invitations from scotland however the design not succeeding those correspondences never came to be effectually discovered and therefore the house of lords in their address to her majesty take notice that the king of france making an attempt to invade her majestys dominions with such a contemptible force was a sufficient evidence that he must have encouragment from some person in scotland disaffected to her majestys government  however the strictest inquisition after these correspondencies could never make any considerable discovery tho many persons were taken up which seemed to be owing rather to the miscarriage of the design the french never coming on shore with any forces and their friends on shore being too politic to show themselves till they saw their troops on shore and in some posture and condition to protect them  there were several gentlemen taken up upon general suspicions which however it gave some offense to the people yet was thought necessary at that time of which by and by  about the end of february these preparations of the french were come to such a height and the design of invading scotland so out of doubt that the government here thought it high time to prepare for the defense of scotland and to that purpose her majesty wrote a letter to the privy council in scotland which tho determined to expire by an act of parliament yet was in being and had power to act till the first day of may following in this letter her majesty gave them notice that she had received information of an intended invasion backed with a french and popish power designed against scotland in favor of the pretender  and therefore recommended to them the security of the kingdom the preservation of the public peace and that they would use all possible means to that effect  in the mean time vigorous preparations were made in england for preventing the designs of the french as well by equipping a fleet to intercept them at sea and so prevent their landing as by providing forces to give them a warm reception in case they should land in scotland  i know there were complaints made and endeavors used to expose the conduct of the government in their preparations suggesting that due care was not taken to put scotland in a posture of defense in case the french had landed and a certain noble person caused the letters of the e of leven the general in scotland which were written in the midst of that hurry and in which his lordship wrote in pressing terms for assistance to be printed  but when these things came to be examined in parliament it appeared otherwise than those gentlemen represented and the parliament received full satisfaction that all the diligence was used which the nature of the thing would admit  but be that as it will by the event we found that providence blessed the measures taken so as that they not only prevented the execution of the design at edinburgh but dispirited the party in such a manner that they durst not make the attempt any where else which they might have done with too much effect and might but too well have made themselves amends for the disappointment by ruining the country and keeping the affairs of britain in longer suspense  i shall however without meddling with these disputes which are dead with the thing show by the mere relation of fact that england was in no condition to have made any preparation that could have been effectual to prevent the landing of the french  and thus all they had done as to stores magazines or arms as the thing then stood had been only leaving the greater booty to the enemy and furnishing them with weapons to use against our selves  since the number of troops or the condition of the fortifications of scotland were such as could make no tolerable resistance nor so much as protect the magazines if any had been erected  but to return to the preparations made in england  first with incredible celerity all the men of war that could be found in any condition were fitted out manned and victualled in order to put to sea and wait for the enemies fleet  and the expedition in this case was so surprising that the french who had been informed that the english navy was in no condition to offer them any disturbance in their design and upon which presumption they owned afterward they made their design public found to their disappointment sixteen english men of war cruising before dunkirk before they the french were in any condition to put to sea  this however did not put a stop to their design  but they went on with their equipment and their fleet being ready they embarked their troops about the fifth of march their whole force consisting of twenty eight sail of ships whereof sixteen were men of war and twelve were large friggots or privateers  their landforces consisted of    french battalions and about  00 volunteers the most part irish being to serve as officers for the raising new regiments in scotland  these forces being on board with the pretender and some few scots gentlemen particularly the two sons of the earl of middletoun with the old lord griffin etc they came out of dunkirk about the sixth of march commanded by the french admiral monsieur fourbin  in this time the diligence of our admiralty was such tho england was at that time very bare of ships that the english squadron before dunkirk was made up to    sail including some dutch men of war that had also joined them and as the french fleet lay in newport pits watching an opportunity to sail so the english lay off of graveline ready to start with them and resolved if possible to engage them in their passage  however the french trusting to their canvas the cleanness of their bottoms and their nimble sailing resolved to put to sea tho as it were in view of a superior force and accordingly the wind blowing fresh at northwest they weighed and set sail  the various course of the fleets and the success as to the sailing part was the subject of much discourse i shall therefore be the exacter in it since it was wondered very much how the french who lay in view of the english fleet could so get the start of them as to be at the firth of edinburgh about two days before them by which had they not overshot their port they might have fairly put their design in execution notwithstanding all the power of the english and dutch fleet at their heels  the wind as i noted before blew at northwest a fresh gale and the french weighing upon the top of high water went away with the tide of ebb to the north ward keeping the dutch coast on board which was then the weathershore  the english lying in gravlingpits had the following disadvantages in the pursuit first that it was about eight hours after the french were sailed before they could get notice of it and be under sail  it was indeed wondered at by some why the english fleet knowing very well that the french were designed for scotland which was north and that they lay in newport road should themselves ly in graveling which was at least    miles to the south  by which means when ever the french should sail they would necessarily bebehind them a considerable way  but this is answered by the sailers and which i shall not undertake to confute viz that it blew very hard the wind at north and northwest and there was no other place where the english fleet could ride with safety  i shall leave this dispute as i find it and content my self with only naming it as i shall others that came after it   be it as it will the matter of fact was so  the french fleet being sailed about eight hours before  advice was brought to sir george bing who weighed with all expedition and followed with all the sail he could make  sir george had also another disadvantage viz that the french sailing with the first of the ebb he lost a tide of them  so that in their first starting the french had the advantage of the english fleet as follows  eight hours in time twenty five miles in space and the ebb of the tide   with these helps and having first left out the lower tire of their guns to make them light for sailing their ships being clean and new fitted the french ships also being really better sailers generally speaking than ours with these helps i say they got a very great start of the english in their first setting out  when they came to sea another thing happened which gave them ae yet farther advantage of the english  the french fleet kept a large offing as they call it keeping to windward all the way rather nearer the german coast than the british  the english fleet bore away for their own coast and were seen off of loestof and yarmouth and from the shore of norfolk  the reasons for this different shaping their course seem these  the french were by all means possible to avoid the english shore lest they should be taken short by the wind and might be embayd and consequently overtaken having a superior force behind them also it was not fit for them to be seen before they came to the firth that they might not give the alarm to the english to be ready for them  on the other hand the english made their own coast lest the french should fallin there with their merchants and sweep the coast of their ships which had they done they might indeed have made great havoc  however it was these disadvantages gave the french such a start of the english that they were on the coast of scotland two days before the english fleet and had not heaven blinded their pilots so as to miss their port they might have put their design in execution in spite of all our forces  on friday march the    th they made the coast of scotland but found themselves the hight of montross about fifteen leagues to the north of the mouth of the firth of edinburgh  here they made signals and some boats going off to them they were informed where they were  then they stood away southward and spent all that day before they got to the mouth of the firth  now they sent one ship viz the salisbury up the firth whether it was to make any signal to their party to give notice of their coming or to get any intelligence remains yet undetermined  they made the firth just as the tide was spent and were therefore obliged to spend six hours more at anchor under the isle of maii in the mouth of the firth and here on the fourteenth early in the morning they find themselves overtaken their scouts discovering the english fleet standing in for the mouth of the firth  here then they find their enterprise at an end their moments are gone in which they might have put their errand in execution  and now they have no more to do but to make the best of their way to sea  upon this therefore they weigh and stand away for the north with all the sail they can make and the english fleet after them  the foremost of the english ships came often within gunshot of them but not so many as could stop their fleet or bring them to engage  but they maintained a kind of a running fight with those of the english that pursued in which little harm was done on either side save that in the night one of their ships being the salisbury formerly taken from the english fell in among the english fleet and being surrounded was taken  with this booty and the french outsailing the english sir george bing having pursued them to the northeast point of scotland called buchanness seen them several leagues to the north of that and at last lost sight of them he returned to the firth of edinburgh and keeping his fleet in a sailing posture with his scouts continually abroad to gain intelligence of the enemy he continued in the firth till the beginning of april when the government having intelligence that the french were returned into dunkirk with their fleet sir george bing was also ordered southward with the english fleet and so the whole war on that side ended  i come now to speak a little of the preparations made by the english by land in order to meet this new eruption supposing the french had landed  which indeed was not without hazard  in order to this such troops as were at hand were immediately ordered to march northward particularly they sent away two troops of the queens horse guards the duke of northumberlands regiment of horse with the three regiments of dragoons of essex raby and carpenter besides which two regiments of dragoons and one regiment of horse were ordered to march to the north of ireland to ly ready there to be embarked on the first orders  of foot there were thirteen battalions then in england sent forwards including the queens guards and some new raised not quite complete and ten battalions from holland  it is to be noted that as soon as ever the certainty of the designed invasion came to the knowledge of the states they ordered transports immediately to carry ten battalions of british troops to england to assist the queens troops there and when sir george bing pursued the french fleet as above he sent admiral baker with twelve men of war into holland to bring those troops away to new castle upon tyne that so being landed there they might be ready to join the land army and the ships to join the fleet  the forces being thus appointed marched all northward but the rendezvous was appointed at york for the generals knowing the troops in scotland to be weak and not assured how the people there would behave themselves in general had resolved not to march any troops into scotland till the whole army was assembled that they might march in a body  and to this purpose the earl of leven with these few forces he had in scotland was ordered if he could not prevent their landing to make his retreat to berwick  the forces when all together would have amounted by computation as follows in england horse   troops of guards and horse grenadiers  00 northumberlands horse   0 dragoons three regiments about  00    0 foot    battalions in england about   000  0 battalions from holland in ireland horse and dragoons about  000 in scotland   regiments of dragoons very thin  00   troop of horse guards and grenadiers   0 foot   battalions of guards  000   grant   maitland   strathnaver  so that the whole army when brought to a body was supposed to amount together as follows horse and dragoons england    0 ireland  000 scotland   0   00 foot england  000 holland  000 scotland  000   000 in all    00  beside which the dutch had prepared a second convoy to send over twelve battalions more if there had been any occasion  a train of artillery was preparing at the tower of london and was in a good forwardness so as it might probably have been at the rendezvous as soon as the troops could have well been drawn together  i have been the more particular in this because i am drawing every thing to the readers view that he may judge of some conjectures i shall make concerning the probabilities of the success of this enterprise and what might reasonably be supposed to have been the issue of it since some people have been so weak as to say it had been better for us to have let them come on shore and that we should immediately have crushed and defeated them  it remains now to enquire how the people of scotland behaved themselves in this critical juncture and what condition they were in there to have received the french  as to the condition of scotland at that time it is to be confessed the french had all the encouragement imaginable to make such an attempt from the circumstances of the place and the temper of the people as to the circumstances of the place it is evident that the country was entirely naked and in a manner defenseless  the standing forces were few the militia just in the middle between dissolving the old model and erecting a new so as they were absolutely disbanded without commissions without officers and without any form the fortifications out of repair the magazins empty the new government unformed the people divided it must be confessed never was nation in such a condition to be invaded and there is no doubt but had the french landed their forces and got their stores of arms and ammunition on shore as they might easily have done if they had not overshot their port  they would with very little opposition have been masters of the whole country  it may be thought by some remote to my purpose to demonstrate this but when i consider what differing notions the people in england have of the attempt of the french and of their success in it i can not think it an useless labor to give you a brief essay at what the event of that enterprise might probably have been  that so we may see what we have to be thankful for  i am now to suppose the french safe on shore their magazine and train of artillery landed and the earl of leven the general for her majesty retreating toward berwick as he must undoubtedly have done  and as his orders directed him to do  without which his retreat being cut off he must have been surrounded and taken or have been cut in pieces having no place of strength to retreat to  had they been thus on shore there is no doubt but in two hours they had been masters of edinburgh an open city and without defense the castle indeed might have held out some time but the city could have made no resistance  but that which was worse the circumstances of the time was such and the people were so divided that the city must have sent down to leith to have sought protection from the french against their own rabbles and they must have desired the french to have come and taken them into their protection to have preserved them from plunder and confusion  i think whatever the reasons of this were which i desire to bury in silence the fact will be readily granted and indeed all men owned at that time that if the french landed their forces they must be master of the city of edinburgh without any opposition  it is true that i am now but upon suggestion and mere supposition and i do not affirm positively but i leave it to any man to judge of probabilities and whether what i suggest is rational or no  when the french were thus possessed of edinburgh it is very reasonable to imagine that the first thing they would have done was to proclaim their king if the magistrates of the city would not have agreed to have performed the ceremony the tolbooth was near at hand and the citizens being assembled could soon have chosen new magistrates who would cheerfully have done it   their king being proclaimed it seems rational to suppose they should next summon the inhabitants to take an oath of fidelity to him such as refused would have their estates confiscated and perhaps be imprisoned and if they got room to flee would have their houses plundered  being thus masters of the capital and the queens troops having fled or retreated toward berwick the country exposed to their power i think i make no trespass on good manners or justice if i say the northern highlanders would have been soon raised by the influence of their superiors who are for the most part jacobites  these being in arms the lowlands are at their mercy and they had soon possessed themselves of the whole country the militia being entirely without a head and without order unlockt from the former settlement and unfixt in a new  being thus possessed of the lowlands they soon would have been master of the whole country and indeed there was very few that durst show their faces against them the forwardness of one party and the divisions and disorders of the other making way for it  when they had thus reduced the lowlands they had no more to do than to call a convention of estates as at the revolution and finding these fast to their interest the first laws should be to rescind the revolution declare the limited succession a visible rebellion and an invasion of the right of another  and thus a complete national turn should have passed upon us  and the revolution should suffer a rerevolution in a few weeks for these things would require but little time neither is it presumption to suppose they should have gotten a representative returned that would have come into such measures since they having the absolute possession of the country the influencing them under such circumstances to the choosing such persons as they should think fit to put upon them was easy enough  instances of which have been but too common in this island under a less tyrannical power than a french army  while they were thus settling their civil government  their military affairs could not have failed the inclination of the common people about edinburgh and the influence of the chiefs and heads of clans in the highlands would have soon furnished men for new revolutions  the sixteen regiments which they brought with them so it seems they had determined should have had two hundred men added to every regiment by way of filling up  five regiments of dragoons and forty battalions of foot was to have been raised immediately  the command of these troops was to be given to irish officers and of such they brought great numbers with them save only that the colonels and some captains were to be chosen of the superiors or chiefs where they were raised to encourage the raising them  thus in less than six weeks they should have had  0000 men added to the troops they brought with them  the money they would have given the highland gentlemen would effectually have brought these gentlemen to forsake their party and join with them and then the design would have gone on beyond expectation  we are next to enquire what was to become of the english preparation all this while you have heard what strength they were of when come together but it could not be possible that they could be all brought together their magazines furnished for the french would have taken care they should have subsisted ill enough in scotland their train of artillery have been come up and they in condition to have marched into scotland in battalia as they must have done under six weeks or two months  the difficulties of the roads the country being at that time very deep and the carriages heavy would have made it very bad marching an army  and the want of forage would have made it impracticable to have done it sooner  all this time the french and jacobites in scotland would have had to have strengthened their new settlement formed their army fortified leith and other places and have prepared for war  i shall readily grant as any body can desire that when the english army came to be ready and to enter scotland they should beat these new invaders out of all and that they should in time pay dear for the attempt but it must be granted this would have these consequences withal   that it would have ruined scotland   brought the seat of war home to our own doors   cause a diversion of our forces and be an occasion of withdrawing our troops from flanders where the enemy felt the greatest weight of the war  and   have exceedingly protracted the war those gentlemen that were for having them land may consult these probable consequences and they will see whether they have not very good reason to be sensible of the happiness of the disappointment  i can not but take notice here of the temper of the people of scotland at this time none will doubt but the minds of men were variously agitated as their several tempers interest and party guided them  hope on one side and fear on the other discovered it self in a manner which both sides would fain have concealed nor was there wanting a party who openly and avowedly professed their desires to have the french land and their resolution to join with them and this in so open so rude and so threatening a manner as gave just cause of terror to the honest loyal party on the other hand who saw themselves inevitably ruined if the french landed by their own rabbles  the other party having openly threatened and marked out the houses of such families as were most eminent for their zeal to the established government  it was expected and indeed apprehended very much in england that those of the presbyterians who had before vigorously appeared against the union and professed their dislike of it upon all occasions would have appeared against the government at this juncture and either have joined with the invaders or have formed a third party and so have made a division which had in its kind been equally fatal  but in this also they were disappointed for the people who were most warm against the union nay even the western men who do not own or join with the church yet all as one man declared against joining with french invaders papists and a returning tyranny which they easily foresaw must be the consequence of an invasion and therefore laying aside all their old animosities private grudges and cavils at the union etc they unanimously declared their resolution to stand together and with their lives and estates to defend the government and their country against all the powers of france and the pretender and to this end they began to form associations the burghers of edinburgh listed men and subscribed for their maintenance some  0 some  0 some more and in other places they were apreparing to do the like  the western men sent them word they would come and join with them if there was occasion and in the mean time some of the people called cameronians made their open protestation against it  this was a very great encouragment to the government at that time when the vaunts of the other party run high and their hopes were great but god in his providence prevented the evil consequences of this affair as you have heard and the good people who had made great appearances of unanimity found themselves delivered another and an easier way  it happened very well at this time that the commission of the general assembly was just set down and the ministers seeing the storm coming both on the ecclesiastic as well as civil liberties of the nation religion and property being visibly struck at together in the flood of foreign destruction plainly threatening to swallow up both  appointed a solemn fast to be kept over the whole country  i shall make no comments on the subject matter of this fast the act of the commission does sufficiently show the sense of the ministers and in what manner the invasion was like to relish among them and therefore i have inserted it in this place to record the temper that appeared at that time and what hope the pretender or his party had ground to raise upon the supposed divisions of the presbyterians about the union  an abstract of the said act of the general assembly is as follows  at edinburgh the fifth of march one thousand seven hundred and eight years the commission of the general assembly being sensible of the great wickedness and crying sins of all sorts abounding amongst us in this church and being in the just judgment of god threatened with an invasion by an enemy that has employed his power for the ruin of that holy religion which we profess and the enslaving of europe and who designs to set a popish pretender upon the throne of these nations to the utter overthrow of the true reformed religion all our interests sacred and civil and all that god has graciously wrought for us by the late happy revolution and hitherto preserved to us and being sensible of what we owe in gratitude to our only rightful and lawful sovereign queen anne do look upon it as our duty with a regard to the honor of god the preservation of our religion the quiet of her majestys government and the good of our country to humble our selves before the lord and to call all persons in this national church to humiliation fasting and prayer to turn to god in christ our only propitiation and to cry mightily to him that for the blood of his son he would forgive our grievous sins give us a sound and understanding heart remove our spiritual plagues and to unite us to god and to one another in him that he would avert the deserved wrath from these sinful lands in disappointing the designs of our bloody and cruel enemies defeat the threatened invasion maintain peace and truth amongst us bless the gospel with success by the effusion of his spirit preserve her majestys person direct her councils prosper her arms by sea and land and bring these wars to so happy an issue as may be for the relief of our oppressed brethren abroad and the security of the protestant churches  and the said commission hereby appoints the first thursday of april next to be religiously observed in all the congregations of this national church as a day of solemn fasting humiliation and prayer for the causes abovementioned and appoints the ministers of this church to make intimation of the premises publicly from their pulpits upon the lords day immediately preceding the foresaid day of humiliation and to be more particular in specifying the sins of these lands as they shall see cause  this fast was approved of by the privy council and their civil sanction given thereto  and the queen in her letter to the general assembly   0  did show her satisfaction with the zeal and affection the ministers of this church had shown at that juncture  the greatest part of all the presbyteries of scotland and synods addressed the queen also on the subject of the invasion and the general assembly declared their sentiments thereof   st in their answer to the queens letter   ly in their address to her majesty and   ly in their national thanksgiving inserted in their printed acts pages      0        besides all this many parishes drew up addresses to the privy council showing their resolution to venture their lives and fortunes in defense of her majestys person and government and craving leave to put themselves in a posture of defense and in many places the presbyterians did subscribe for considerable sums to be paid when called for in order to buy arms and to maintain men for the ends foresaid some burgers in edinburgh subscribed to maintain  0 men some  0 some  0 some  0 and some who were poorer subscribed for fewer and all this was done by the advice and with the allowance of persons entrusted in the government by her majesty  but this is not all the seasonableness of this solemn fast was such and so serviceable to the government being brought out at the very juncture of time when the eyes both of friends and enemies were upon them that it must be acknowledged it showed not only the zeal of the presbyterian ministers for the queen the government and their established interest but it showed their wisdom and prudence in so happily timing an action of that determining consequence and taking the very moment of its being most effectual as well to convince the enemy that they had nothing to expect that way but the whole united force of the presbyterians against them  to satisfy the government and the english nation among whom jealousies of the contrary had been industriously spread  that the presbyterains one and all would declare against the invaders  as also to settle and determine such among themselves if any such were who might be otherwise unfixd in their resolutions and doubtful what course to take  nor was this all but the ministers in scotland in their respective parishes upon the occasion of the said fast applied themselves to the informing their people what the real views and probable consequences of this attempt were what was threatened to their church to their established religion to their liberties to their protestant succession and to the revolution how whatever the specious pretenses of preserving the established church might be popery in principle and tyranny in practice were certainly incompatible with the protestant establishment of scotland which was founded in liberty depended upon law and could not subsist humanely speaking but upon the supported basis of law and liberty together that the invasion was a visible appearance of french and popish tyranny the same that for twenty eight years bad influenced the councils and governments of scotland while they trampled on the church of scotland silenced their preaching ministry persecuted and barbarously murdered their innocent brethren and bid defiance to the laws of god and the liberties of scotland that these days would inevitably return upon them and that all the miseries they had formerly felt were effectually contained in the womb of an invasion  by this method the ministers openedthe eyes of the whole nation and the people roused by this happy vigor in their clergy began to her every where immediately a new face appeared upon the public affairs the general dejection and hesitation which seemed before to make the people look dark and unresolved was quite removed and nothing was to be seen among the presbyterian party of the people  but associations addresses preparations for fighting fitting up their arms and a cheerful resolved temper of fighting the french wherever they were to be found  some of the ministers themselves were so vigorous in this that they caused their whole parishes to associate and bind themselves one to another and all together to the government to stand as one man against the invaders  the service this did the government the encouragement it gave in england and the discouragement it gave to the jacobite party at that juncture was such as the last especially will not easily forget  and i thought it very useful to transmit the memory of it thus to posterity that they may know how their ancestors acted in this great affair and how they ought to act on the like occasions  in this posture the affairs of this island stood when the french baffled by the immediate hand of gods providence in missing their port were pursued by the english fleet and made their escape by the goodness of their sails to dunkirk where their troops were put on shore and so the expedition ended  the ten battalions which came from holland to new castle were not at all landed but went immediately back and were in the field again time enough to show themselves in the first of the campaign  the english troops marched back without entering into scotland the prisoners taken on board the salisbury were brought to hull and treated as prisoners of war in order to be sent over to holland for exchange  the lord griffin with the two sons of the earl of middletoun and    irish reformed officers were carried to london the three first were committed to the tower and the irish to newgate being to be tried as traitors against the queen whose natural born subjects they appeared to be  the lord griffin having been formerly attainted and outlawed it needed not that he should be brought to any trial but being carried up to the queens bench bar he received sentence of death on the foot of the said outlawry without any trial  however the dauphin of france having wrote a particular letter in his behalf to the duke of marlborcugh to entreat the queens mercy to him and that he the dauphin made it his request to the queen the lord griffin being his servant  the said lord griffin was reprived from time to time and is yet living in the tower at the publishing these sheets  the irish officers also and the lord middletouns sons remain yet prisoners  on the other hand great heats and disputes happened about the gentlemen who were taken up upon suspicion   the parliament in the heat of the alarm had passed a bill suspending the habeas corpus act for a time so far as should concern the persons apprehended on this account and empowering the queen to take up and keep in prison such persons as there should be ground to suspect were guilty of confederating with or encouraging the invaders  had the gentlemen concerned been apprehended in anyother juncture they would perhaps have had no other trouble than to have lain still and when the thing had been over have been released again as was done at that time in ireland  but the fury of our divisions on either hand run so high that this could not be some thought the persons taken up had more hand in the invasion than appeared and that they ought not too lightly to be let go left it might encourage both them and others to make the like attempt again  and these were very warm for prosecutions and for proposing rewards to encourage persons to come in to charge the prisoners  and would have all manner of methods tried to fasten something upon them  others again inveighed against the ministry in scotland as having partial and partyregards in the picking out such or such persons to put in prison on pretense of this suspicion as might gratify the private designs of particular persons either as to private picks and personal revenge or to prejudice their interests in elections there being a new parliament then to be chosen  these contentions however grounded on either side had certainly this effect that they gave a great deal of trouble to the prisoners which otherwise might have been avoided for the ministry seeing such pointing at probable guilt on one hand and such complaints of injustice on the other found it necessary to make the proceedings more formal and to have all the gentlemen up to london  that they might either be prosecuted or let out upon bail as the council should direct  upon their coming up to london they were all admitted to bail except four who were committed to prison and were after sent to scotland to be tried but these however were acquitted the lords of the justiciary and her majestys advocate differing upon some forms particularly the lords refusing to admit the lord advocate to produce more witnesses  after the first day of trial  it is not my business to enter into this dispute otherwise i could be more large on this head  but the government was so sensible of the inconveniences of the old method of prosecuting upon treason from this nicety that presently upon this the parliament resolved to bring in a bill to make the laws for trials in cases of treason the same in scotland as in england  from this period is also to be dated the distractions which followed in the affair of religion and of which i think it is very material to speak because they have made a great noise in the world and every one is not rightly apprised of the thing  particularly many have entertained prejudices against the good people in scotland as if they had been acted by a spirit of passion and persecution when indeed upon a full and clear examination of the matter of fact the contrary will evidently appear and therefore i could not satisfy my self without doing this piece of justice to the church and people of scotland  as to give an impartial relation of the fact as it is attested out of the public registers by the proper officers and being myself an eye and earwitness to every part of the proceeding  about the end of february   0   her majesty by her letter to the privy council in scotland gave notice of the intended invasion backed with a french power designed against scotland recommending to them the security of the kingdom the preservation of the public peace and that they would use all possible means to that effect  the privy council taking this affair into their consideration it naturally occurred that to discourage the enemies of the government at home was among others one of the best steps to prevent the mischievous consequences of an invasion from abroad and in order to this that it was reasonable to suppress the public meetings of those who under pretense of divine worship admitted such ministers to officiate as the law in that case had prohibited having not qualifyed themselves by taking the oaths praying for the qveen etc by which the public disaffection was upheld and encouraged  it was then agreed to nemine contradicente in the privy council and for the truth of which we refer our reader to the minutes of the council for proof that orders should be issued out to all inferior magistrates to put this resolve in execution and orders were accordingly issued out to the magistrates of edinburgh for that purpose who thereupon legally called before them several ministers or preachers who were known to keep public meeting houses within their bounds  asking them plainly in terms of law if they prayed for her majesty nominatim in their public meeting houses and if they had qualifyed themselves by taking the oath of allegiance and subscribing the same with the assurance as the law required  some of them answered directly but others avoiding the question required a legal trial by way of libel and proof which was accordingly appointed and whereof the precise points were their not taking the oath of allegiance and subscribing the same with the assurance their not praying for her hajesty nominatim as the law requires and their not observing public fasts and thanksgivings all which were notour and being negatives proved themselves  to this libel the foresaid preachers made answers and also took a protest that they were not legally cited not being called either on fifteen days as the old law requires or on ten days as the late act of parliament against intruders prescribes  to which it was answered that as to the fifteen days the known and perpetual custom within burgh had overruled it to twenty four hours and as to the ten days they were only appointed in the trial of intruders but the preachers called being conveend for notour disaffection by not praying and by not taking the oath of allegiance nor keeping fasts and thanksgivings the citations were good and the procedure unquestionable and yet the magistrates thought fit to give them a farther indulgence and to allow them to give in all their defenses  the sum of which defenses as contained in a representation exhibit by the said preachers being first the foresaid dilators to this they added that by the act of parliament      requiring all ministers and preachers to take the oath of allegiance it is provided that the contraveener shall be punished by banishment or otherways as the privy council should think fit and therefore the libel was improperly tabled before the magistrates  it was answered to the first dilators that the former answers were repeated and to the second that the privy council having referred the execution to the magistrates there could be no more debate about their competency on that head  but then they went on to object against the relevancy and as to the act of the convenion ordaining all ministers to pray for the king and queen nominatim they answered that that act did die and expire with king william and queen mary and as to the act      ordaining all preachers to take the oath of allegiance and sign the same with the assurance they answered first that that act did only concern ministers provided to benefices and stipends and could not be extended to such preachers as enjoy no benefice under the government and secondly the act recognizing her majesty queen anne enjoins the taking of the oath of allegiance etc to such as are in public trust and preachers not beneficed cannot be said to be in any public trust and thirdly the act of parliament      limited to the persons of king william and queen mary is out of doors with them  to which it was replied that the act of convention ordaining all ministers and preachers to pray for the king and queen nominatim is certainly to be understood likeways of all their royal successors specially since it is so plainly founded upon the command of the apostle and the duties of all subjects secondly the act      expressly relates to all preachers whether beneficed or not and withal defines all preachers to be persons in public trust so that the act recognizing her majesty did exactly fall within it and affords no relief to the defenders and thirdly the act      though it mention king william and queen mary yet is not limited to them but being a perpetual law extends to all their royal successors likeas by the said act recognizing her majesty it is de facto so extended  which defenses and replies being read and considered by the magistrates they repelled the dilators as also all the other defenses proponed for the defenders and found that since they had not prayed for her majesty queen anne nominatim and taken the oath of allegiance etc they had incurred the pains of law and therefore ordained them and every one of them to desist from keeping of any meeting houses within the city of edinburgh and liberties thereof and from preaching or exercising any part of the ministerial function within the same in time coming under the pain of imprisonment and to find caution for that effect betwixt and the  0 th day of march then instant and in the mean time that their meeting houses be forthwith shut up but though this sentence was then past yet nothing followed upon it until that the privy council of scotland being determined by an act of parliament after the  st of may these disaffected people judging that the councils orders were also expired with the council that gave them did about the  0 th of june fall again to their preaching and entered their meeting houses and further they resolved among themselves that they would continue to preach and not desist which moved the magistrates to renew the former prohibition about the said  0 th of june last which they still neglecting and despising they were again called before the magistrates about the    th of july and required to find caution or bail to desist as being the known legal execution upon such prohibitory sentences or otherways to go to prison but they still refusing to obey the magistrates thought fit on the    th to send five only to prison which five were also at length relieved so indulgent were the magistrates in this matter  this whole trial and all the steps thereof being transmitted to her majesty it pleased her majesty by her royal letters under her hand and seal of the    th of september last to approve what was done by the magistrates of edinburgh in the said matter as acceptable service and further to judge it necessary for the safety of her royal person and government that all such meeting houses in every other place should be shut up  thus far the matter of fact  it is most true that in this first prosecution there was no other or further design than the giving a check to the invasion and to the insolence of some of the non jurant party who at that time began to be more formidable in scotland than in england and this is apparent in the lenity and forbearance of the magistrates and justices of the peace in scotland who as soon as the invasion was over and the danger from abroad seemed at an end were very easy with them again the ministers who had been confined were silently let go and their former liberty connived at again so that their meetings became as frequent as they were before notwithstanding they still refused to take the oaths or pray for the queen  but here it began to appear that there were some among those people who had other aims in these things than merely the liberty of their consciences and the worshipping god  and that something ought to be attempted to make the people uneasy and to bring them by force to prosecute and attack them  and to this end since refusing the oaths since refusing to pray for the queen nay actually praying for the pretender would not provoke the government and magistrates in scotland to persecute  they find out another expedient which they are assured will not fail being what they know the scots will not bear what ever it cost them and this was erecting the common prayer or english liturgy in scotland  the people that made this attempt behoved to get some body to do it that however jacobite he might be in principle was yet latitudinarian enough in conscience that he could swallow all the oaths which should be offered to him  indeed some of the jacobite clergy were so honest that as they would not take the oaths so they did not approve of this attempt but openly disavowed it  nor had the episcopal people in scotland ever set up the english liturgy although they had reigned in scotland for twenty eight years together before the revolution  but the design being concerted they found a tool a poor curate of    lib a year in ireland but born in scotland comes over to edinburgh to mend his commons and having taken the oaths he falls in with this party who finding him a person of prostituted morals a large stock in the face and ready if well paid to do their work they promise him fourscore pound a year and accordingly begin a subscription for it  some english gentlemen had it seems promised him some encouragement toward that sum to be raised  and this they make a handle of presently and reported that this was set up to accommodate the english strangers who could not conform to the presbyterian church  but the english gentlemen seeing into the design and that they were to be made a property to embroil the government and foment a division between the two lately united nations they soon abandoned him and his design  however he resolved to put his project in execution and accordingly takes a house just at the cross in edinburgh fits it put for a chapel and begins to read the english service  the people as every body knew they would immediately took fire at the thing  but not doing him the honor to rabble him which seemed to be what his party expected they complain to the magistrates  the person that had let him the house finding what use he was putting it to began with him and on pretense of his having made some spoil in pulling down partitions etc not authorized by his contract  gets him turned out of the house and so he betakes himself to a place less public but still goes on with his service book worship however it gave less offense here the other seeming to be a defyance of the laws it happened at this time or in a few days after that the commission of the general assembly was to meet  as soon as they sat down a representation or address is made to them by the inhabitants of edinburgh and other places against this thing the paper mentions other complaints indeed but this was the main thing aimed at  the address is as follows  unto the very reverend and honorable the commission of the late general assembly of the church of scotland we the neighborhood of the town of edinburgh and suburbs undersubscribers do most humbly represent  that notwithstanding the many good laws and acts of parliament and particularly the act   and   par   0  made for the settlement and security of this national church and against all encroachments upon her rights and privileges or innovations in her doctrine worship discipline or government and of her majestys repeated assurances in her royal proclamations letters to her privy council and the general assemblies of this church to maintain and defend the same in its present establishment against all such unlawful intrusions encroachments and innovations particularly her majestys proclamations against unlawful intruders into churches and manses in scotland dated sept  0th   0   yet to our very great surprise several of the episcopal clergy prompted and instigate thereunto by the jacobite party who are equally disaffected to the civil as to the ecclesiastical constitution have of late not only erected meeting houses in this city after the scots episcopal way but also in several places here have set up the english service which as it is contrair to our establishment and very grievous and offensive to us and all others who are well affected to her majesty and the present establishment so it will prove of fatal and dangerous consequence to the church if not speedily remeeded  it would be considered in the first place that several of such as preach in these meeting houses are known not only to be unsound in their judgments but also scandalous and immoral in their lives and practices and however they may pretend to be qualified according to law yet if they were not secret and heart enemies to her majesty and the present government they would never yield themselves tools to a jacobite party for carrying on their wicked and pernicious designs    ly they cannot pretend it to be a matter of conscience in setting up of the english service here for abstracting from presbyterians even the body and bulk of the episcopal persuasion in scotland have never been fond of the english way of worship but upon many occasions have testified their dislike of the same and none of them scruple to join in communion with this church but such as are either openly profane and will not subject to church discipline or avowed jacobites and therefore    ly we conceive that by these illegal and unwarrantable encroachments intrusions and innovations they design no less than the ruin of both church and state for as the setting up of the english service here did in former times breed much trouble and confusion in this church and nation so at present it does raise and foment jealousies and heartburnings in the minds of people otherwise zealously affected to her majestys person and government and exceedingly widens the breach betwixt us and the separating parties on both hands and the instigators to and abbettors of these practices are in big hopes and not without too good and evident grounds that this will prove an effectual mean of alienating the hearts and affections of many of our queens best and most loyal subjects from her majestys person and the present establishment and that by this means they shall effectually wound and weaken the church on both sides and also ruin the civil government  we must also humbly represent that albeit we have many good and laudable laws and acts of parliament against popery and papists their trafficking and preaching in scotland particularly against their teaching of any science art and exercise within the same and against all irreligion and blasphemies yet papists do openly and avowedly teach and practice even within the city of edinburgh and suburbs and now also a profane and deluded crew of enthusiasts are set up in this place who under pretense to the spirit of prophecy do utter most horrid blasphemies against the ever glorious trinity such as ought not to be suffered in any christian church or nation seeing this strikes at the very root and vitals of all religion and is set on foot of satan to confound if possible all solid thoughts of a deity amongst us  we have for brevities sake represented but few of the many inconveniences that will certainly follow the suffering of such practices and do judge it our duty in all humility to lay them before the reverend commission seeing you are set by the church of scotland upon the watch tower to advert that the interest of jesus christ and the present establishment of this church do not suffer or sustain any prejudice which you can prevent particularly to take special care to keep and maintain unity in the church upon all emergents and to see the due execution of the acts of assembly which are very plain and express against such innovations in the worship of god particularly the act    general assembly   0  and therefore humbly and earnestly beg and entreat that as you tender the glory of god the peace and unity of this church and the quiet and safety of her majestys government you would use your outmost endeavors for suppressing and crushing such intolerable and pernicious practices and designs in the bud  and your supplicants shall ever pray etc  this address was signed in less than three hours by between two and three hundred people the like address came from haddingtoun and the like were preparing almost all over the kingdom  but this having an immediate answer in the application of the commission of the assembly to the remedy the other addresses were laid by  for the commission of the assembly immediately fell upon the work and past an act in which among other things they asserted the legal establishment of their church by the revolution by subsequent laws and those laws receiving the general sanction of the union  against all manner of innovation in just execution of which laws they referred it to the respective judicatories of the church such as kirk sessions or presbyteries to proceed forthwith against such innovations or innovators as should be found in their respective bounds  in the consequence of this act the kirk session of the northeast parish of edinburgh called commonly the college kirk presented this new come innovator to the presbytery of edinburgh who accordingly cited him before them  i shall only give a summary of their proceedings against him for it is not their form of proceeding but the nature of the thing that seems to call for this prefatory narration it is to be observed that the presbytery did not proceed against him upon the subject of innovation or his having set up the common prayer  at all nor was it once mentioned to him or in the sentence of the presbytery  but they first demanded who he was whence he came and what authority he had to execute the office of a minister and not being able to produce any legal ordination or ministerial induction except from the exauctorate deposed bishops to whom neither by the church of scotlands constitution or by the episcopal church of englands constitution any such power or office remained  they proceeded to their sentence against him declaring him incapable to exercise any part of the ministerial function in their bounds  he declined their authority treated them with contempt refused to appear at their subsequent citation  they took no farther notice of him but sent a copy of their sentence to the magistrates of edinburgh in order to the civil power putting it in execution  in pursuance of this sentence the magistrates send for him and giving him intimation of the sentence of the presbytery they give notice that he do not presume to preach any more within the bounds of the city on pain of imprisonment and gave him time to show his obedience to their order he carries himself with the same haughtiness to the magistrates tells them positively that he would not obey them and accordingly the next sabbath he preaches openly in the city nor yet would the magistrates have committed him had he not insolently triumphed in his contempt of their authority appeared openly at the cross to let them see that contempt and by all the methods possible to him insulted them in the affair of their sentence  this brought the magistrates to an absolute necessity to commit him in vindication of their authority and that they might not give their own consent to be trampled on by the whole party accordingly they sent for him again and still offering him his liberty upon obedience to their former order and the sentence of the presbytery which he insultingly refused they committed him to the tolbooth of edinburgh  it were very little worth while to fill this preface with the story of this person were it not the occasion of bringing upon the stage debates of several kinds which it seems necessary to set in a clear light to the world in the misrepresenting which the church as well as people of scotland really receive much wrong to whom i think it is the duty of an honest man as well as of a faithful historian to do justice  the cases are such as these whether the scots in these prosecutions are not persecutors for conscience whether the episcopal deposed clergy have yet a right to ordain ministers whether the episcopal church of scotland and the established church of england are at all of kin or no whether toleration of episcopacy and the english liturgy can be established in scotland or no   i shall say something to all these so far as matter of fact and a historical narration requires and something by observation as far as the civil rights of scotland are concerned and thus far i think they are proper to be spoken to by way of preface as to the theological part of the dispute i shall have occasion to handle it elsewhere neither can it be reasonable to expect it here  in taking notice of the first of these queries whether the scots in these prosecutions are not persecutors for conscience  it may be alleged that all prosecutions of law where the offender pleads conscience against his obedience are persecutions for conscience  and if this be brought by way of argument in this case then my answer is very brief the scots and with them all the christian nations in the world but especially the church of england are persecutors and without question ought to be so  but if you will restrict the term persecution to the generally received sense of it viz disturbing prosecuting and pursuing the peaceable exercise of religious orship performed merely in obedience to the dictates and commands of conscience  then i may safely challenge all the world in behalf of the people of scotland to show the least vestige or appearance of persecution among them  i think while i am in this argument addressing my self principally to the people of england and among them to the church of england  i can do nothing better than bring their own practice to a parallel with the church of scotland as a strong and convincing way of arguing to them especially in the case i am upon and first i take the authority of the parliament of england against persecution in the great act for settlement of the toleration where it is said whereas it is reasonable that all just tenderness should be shown to tender consciences etc then in the preamble of the late famous occasional bill are these words  whereas persecution for conscience sake is contrary to the principles of the christian religion and the doctrine of the church of englandtake these two and compare them with the act   william and mary cap  by which all those ecclesiastics who would not take the oaths are deposed and deprived ab officio and beneficio and it will necessarily follow at least in my opinion that either the church of england in deposing the non jurant clergy in england acts contrary to her own doctrine and the principles of the christian religion ut supra or that deposing and depriving the non jurant bishops etc is not persecution for conscience  i humbly refer this to the determination of all that shall read impartially if it be not clear and fairly stated  if then deposing and depriving the clergy of the church of england in england who refufe to take the oaths to the government be not persecution it remains for the other party to prove that the same thing in scotland can be called persecution and in england no persecution  the deposing episcopacy it self in scotland seems to come in question here and would require a long discourse  but as i am speaking chiefly to the church of england in this case i am very willing to make her a judge  and i presume it will be arguing ad hominem to say though i do not lay the stress here neither  that deposing episcopacy in scotland and deposing popery in england stand in many cases upon the same foot  and the church of scotland has offered little or no violence to the episcopal church in scotland but what the church of england has offered to the roman catholics in england  now though in general this would be no argument yet it is a reason in this case why the church of england above all other ought not to charge the church of scotland with persecution in that particular  but to go further the church of scotland did not immediately pull down episcopacy  i mean the church abstractly considered in her ecclesiastical circumstances  but it was done by the government of scotland the body of the people i mean the parliament before the presbyterian church was established  and it is evident by the claim of right that episcopacy was turned out of scotland not as a thing established but as an intruder upon the established religion which scotland had from the very reformation embraced which they had sworn in their national covenant to maintain and which by law it was their right to restore in short episcopacy was turned out as a man who has had his estate taken from him by oppression recovers his right by law and then dispossesses the wrongful incroacher or invader and enters upon his own  universal history will allow that the scots reformed first into the geneva model by the agency of the famous john knox and others and that they had no episcopacy in their first establishment at all nor can all the labor that has been spent to make the superintendents who were sent into the several parts of the kingdom to settle ecclesiastic affairs look like bishops  for this will for ever supercede that suggestion viz that these superintendents though vested with power over the ministers they went to visit  yet received that power from and exercised it in subordination to the general assembly of the presbyterian church  and were often called to an account censured and removed by the synods nay and some say even by private presbyteries see calderwoods history of the church of scotland fol  episcopacy in scotland being thus supposed an invader and spoiler the revolution did no more than take from them their usurped authority cause them to disgorge what they had most unjustly devoured and the invader having thus been turned out the right owners of the house came again and took possession of their own and this can by no means be called persecution  my second enquiry is upon a new dispute and i think admits of no difficulties in matters of law whatever it may in matters of conscience  viz whether the deposed exauctorate bishops have power left to ordain ministers  indeed the question seems rather to ly here whether such preachers as shall be licensed or ordained by the exauctorate bishops ought to be esteemed as ministers especially in that church which has so deposed them  this being the present debate it rather respects the civil than ecclesiastic part of the question  it seems to me highly absurd that the church of england should receive as a minister among them a man ordained by him whom they will not own or receive as a minister of their church for if the bishop after deprivation shall ordain ministers how then is that bishop deprived ab officio  nor indeed do i know that the church of england has at all admitted this absurdity among them  the thing is only started in scotland to beget new broils on that head and it seems still more absurd that the non jurant bishops in scotland should have power to ordain a minister of the church of england  but to support this absurdity a worse is started among us viz that the episcopal church of scotland is incorporated into the church of england by the union and this is the reason of my third enquiry   whether the episcopal church of scotland and the present established church of england are at all of kin or no   this enquiry if it be directly traced will lead to a new question viz what is to be meant by the church of england i mean in this question only  and therefore i shall answer it both ways very briefly  if by the church of england we mean the church as now established or rather recognized by the revolution  and now received and acknowledged by the queen and parliament then indeed this pretended incorporation is an absurdity  and there is no more any such thing than there is an incorporation between god and baal for the church of england so understood has spued the other out as illegal has rejected her as jacobite and has joined in and consented to by the union the establishment of the presbyterian church in her stead and upon her ruins as the true protestant religion and established national church of scotland vide the act of union and from this stipulation she the church of england her self can not go back  but if on the other hand by the church of england is to be understood the dodwellianjacobitefaction of the church who refuse to own either the religous or civil establishment now reigning in britain esteeming the queen an usurper the revolution a rebellion and the church of england schismatical  if thus they understand the church of england then they and the episcopal church of scotland may for ought i know be incorporated into each other and may be esteemed one body  and they are welcome to be so accounted but how this is done by the union remains for those gentlemen who pretend to it to make out  i think i need not descend to many arguments in this case the case is evident the episcopal church in scotland being entirely jacobite at this time can not be said to incorporate with the church of england who acknowledge queen anne because they reject her as schismatical and apostate  and that they can reject her and be incorporated into her at the same time seems impracticable and absurd  it remains to enquire whether episcopacy and the english liturgy may not be tolerated in scotland  and here i shall wave the various arguments about the necessity and obligation which lies on all christians to pay reverence to conscience and in order to give all possible liberty to religious opinions  but i shall lay the stress of my present arguing another way  first speaking of scotland we are to distinguish between tolerating of episcopacy and tolerating of jacobitism  and if this be distinguished right here we shall have little need of the question at all  and in the name of the scots i may very well say to the church of england  gentlemen when you please to tolerate jacobitism by law in england we will consider of tolerating episcpacy in scotland  and this way of arguing seems very just because if you please to abstract jacobitism from episcopacy in scotland you will leave no episcopacy there but what is already tolerated by law  viz by the act the first perliament william and mary which ordained that all those episcopal ministers who would take the oaths should continue in their churches  and there they remain to this day a kind of toleration much superior to that in england for these enjoy the presbyterian stipends and manses  and in some of their parishes the established church ministers preach by them in meeting houses to this hour as mr ponton in kinghorn and others if the church of england will not call this toleration they will find it hard to tell us what is toleration  the champions of this toleration project finding this argument turned too hard upon them  have set up a new one  and which therefore i have added in the question and this is about tolerating the common prayer book in scotland  and this brings a new dispute upon the stage  a dispute that seems to have more policy than religion in it and i doubt not but it will soon be detected  that this is not a case of conscience but a party trick to embroil will appear if we consider two or three things   that for twenty eight years preceding the revolution when the episcopal church was humanely speaking triumphant in scotland they never admitted of the english liturgy among them nor was it ever attempted for  00 years before but once by archbishop laud and his party which attempt was the overthrow of all the contrivers and it is more than probable may be so again if they go on with it this proves it is not any part of the profession of the episcopal church of scotland  and therefore can not be said to be demanded in behalf of conscience   from the revolution to the time of the union during which time the episcopal nonjurant clergy in scotland have erected several meetings or conventicles of their party for religious worship  they have had very little thought of the english liturgy  but what of it is come among them is a mere innovation thrust in upon them by the artifice of a party in part to claim kindred of the church of england and partly to inflame and enrage the people of scotland who they know are averse to it   at this time while the leaders of the party are imposing this upon the church and people of scotland  they have some difficulty to make their own people agree to and espouse it  the thing is so far from being desired by the people in scotland that even these who frequent their meetings that are episcopal in religious principles and jacobite in politic principles yet shun the liturgy dislike it  and are with difficulty and reluctance brought to bear it nay in most parts they will not comply with it but abandon those that read it and throng after those episcopal ministers that decline it   these are sufficient to make it appear that the attempt of erecting the common prayer book in scotland is not founded in the consciences of the people  that it is a politck design to carry on a party interest among us in england and embroil if possible the people of scotland with the government is evident from the last head that they are at pains to bring their own people to espouse it which if it were not to serve their civil interest it will be hard to suggest on what foundation they make the attempt  but i come next to enquire into the civil rights of scotland as they stand either supported or invaded by this attempt  if then the church of scotland has a civil right to the ecclesiastic immunity she enjoys and that the union had confirmed these rights then nothing can be imposed upon her against her present settlement without breach of the union and this i presume to say no humane authority now established in britain can so much as attempt without dissolving the very constitution  by the union then and the several acts of parliament for the security of the presbyterian church which are confirmed by and made part of that union  the purity and uniformity of the worship discipline and government of the church of scotland is to be preserved to the people of scotland without ant alteration mark these words i repeat them again without ant alteration to all succeeding generations  if any man will say that tolerating the common prayer can consist with preserving the uniformity of the worship  or the tolerating episcopacy can consist with the preserving the government of the church or either of them with preserving the discipline then i may be ready to enquire further  on the other hand if they are not then they cannot be offered to the church of scotland nor can even the parliament of britain erect such a toleration without invading the union which i humbly conceive they have not power to do  nor can the church or people of scotland legally give their consent to any such act of toleration because this purity and uniformity is to be preserved to all succeeding generations and the present generation has no more power to give up what by the union is thus entailed on their posterity than the parliament can give up what is conceded to the said present generation  by this it seems the church of scotland is so established that neither can her enemies impose toleration upon her neither can her treacherous or negligent friends too many of whom she may have in power give up her claim to her establishment neither can she her self abandon her right to or her possession of her establishment exclusive of all manner of innovations or invasious on the purity and uniformity of her worship discipline or government  this i think is the present state of the question about toleration in scotland what gloss the artifice of enemies and the craft of parties may put upon the attempts now making of invading the privileges of the church of scotland i have nothing to do with in this treatise i am sure if the representatives of scotland are faithful and vigilant she is in no danger  nor can her church privileges be invaded by a toleration without destroying the civil as well as ecclesiastic constitution upon which whole britain is at this time established by the union  two things i find fall naturally in our way as objections in england especially when we argue against tolerating the english liturgy in scotland first that this is falling upon the common prayer book and insulting the church of england  and secondly that this will be injurious to the toleration which the dissenters enjoy in england  it is most certain in strict justice that though both these were true it makes nothing to the argument the question is not of civility to the church of england or of prudentials to the dissenters in england but of right and justice to the church of scotland  we are here in a right of property capitulated for by the union stipulated for and agreed to by the church of england that no alteration shall be made that the purity and uniformity shall be preserved either it is preserved or it is not  if the common prayer be imposed on them if episcopacy be tolerated their worship and government is altered or it is not  if it be then the union is invaded or it is not the questions are short and need no cavilling  though speaking of the church of england and of the dissenters in england the scots may be civil to one and careful of the other yet they must not give up their established rights on that score this were to complement them at too great an expense  would the conscientious episcopal people in scotland be easy no body molested them they enjoyed their liberty unmolested enough and in a manner which the dissenters in england for many years would have rejoiced at  but when nothing will satisfy but encroaching upon declared and established rights the church of scotland is then bound to assert her own property and neither the church of england or the dissenters ought to take it ill from them  but after all the church of england have no reason to take it ill that the scots do not make use of the common prayer any more than the scots have to take it ill that the church of england do not make use of the presbyterian discipline they are two national churches either of them have their respective kingdom to which they belong constitution on which they are built and laws by which they are established they are perfectly independent one of another and have no superiority over or subjection to one another  they are confederated by the union and the butts and bounds of their respective influence are stated and irreversibly determined i say they are but confederated for it is no more the kingdoms are incorporated but the churches are but confederated but the links of this chain are so nicely twisted together that the confederacy can not be broken withouthout destroying the incorporation and the one is the bond of the other  it can then be no affront to the church of england to have the scots say we will have nothing to do with your common prayer  nor to the church of scotland to have the church of england say we will have nothing to do with your presbyterian discipline  it was the great preliminary of the treaty that the churches of either kingdom should have nothing to do with one another  and therefore the treaters on both hands were expressly forbid to meddle with the affair of the church  whose establishments it was found absolutely necessary should not in the least interfere with one another  nor their respective jurisdiction be suffered to incroach upon or invade one the other if any have reason therefore to take ill any thing from the other the church of scotland has the first offense given her by this attempt of invading her uniformity only this is to be said for it that it is the act and deed of a party not of the church of england considered as a church  as to the danger to the dissenters with respect to the toleration they now enjoy in england  the fears of that seem to be altogether groundless to any man that rightly understands either the nature of the toleration in england or the state of the question concerning toleration in scotland  in which it is manifest that the difference is so wide that no argument can be drawn from the one to the other either to strengthen or destroy  the scots oppose a toleration by a claim of right stipulated between the two nations and it is evident  when the act for security of the church of scotland was past in scotland  this very matter of toleration was not a little debated and the presbyterian opposers of the union in scotland were not backward to express their apprehensions of a toleration being brought upon them by the union  they were answered by the act of security which was supposed believed and intended to be effectual against such a thing  and had they not thought it sufficient but insisted in words at length that the english liturgy should not have been tolerated or at all used in scotland in public i may appeal to all the gentlemen concerned either in scotland or here in england that it would not have been denied  and the author of this is witness to large assurances given to this purpose but it was thought modester to set it down in less pointed terms  no man doubting but that an article to preserve the uniformity of worship in the church of scotland without any alteration in all succeeding generations must be supposed to contain a sufficient security against the english liturgy  now it would seem a very gross suggestion and reproach the church of england with strange injustice to allege that they should discontinue their toleration to protestant dissenters in england because they themselves having consented to the exclusion of episcopacy in scotland the scots hold them to their bargain  besides the toleration in england would the dissenters see their own right to it has a legal claim and a capitulation also on which it is founded and can not without manifest injustice be invaded by the church of england but to invade it because the scots will not tolerate episcopacy which they the english consented should not be tolerated would be a double injustice and is a reproach to the church of england so much as to imagine  i think this argument needs no further discourse  the scots do insist upon it that by the union they ought not and by tha constitution of their church they can not admit the common prayer book to be publicly used in scotland  and those that offer it to them know the people there will by no means bear it  i am loath to say that is the chief motive of the attempt  several other disputes happned in scotland after the union which can not be brought into the compass of a preface and must be referred to the further histories of those times  as the act for making the trials in cases of high treason the same in both countries  occasioned as is noted before by the disputes which happened at the trials of the four gentlemen brought from england on the invasion  the case of the drawbacks on fish cured with foreign salt imported between the making the union and the first of may which being a debate that can never happen again is not material only to note that though the intent and meaning of the act of union was not for them nor indeed the equity of the case  for they could not be supposed to drawback what they never paid yet the letter of the union being for them the parliament voted them their money which was a testimony of the regard the british parliament always have and must always have to the union the case in short was this  by the eighth article of the union several allowances are made as drawbacks upon fish cured in scotland and exported again  the reason of this allowance was because the salt with which they are cured paying a great duty  that duty ought to be drawn back upon exportation  now between the ratifying the treaty and the first of may when it was to take place a very great quantity of foreign salt french was imported which by the passing all the goods so imported as before paid none of the english duties  now it was alleged that as the duty did not commence upon the salt so the drawback ought not to commence which was the effect of that duty  but the letter of the act being express article the viii that all fish cured with foreign salt shall drawback etc the parliament voted it and scotland got about twenty seven thousand pound sterling drawback where they paid little or nothing of duty  i do not remember any thing material that happened in this interval more than what has been hinted at here  the parliament of britain went on to ease the scots in every thing that came before them and except the act abovementioned about treason i know nothing that past against the joint opinion of the scots members in two sessions of parliament which have sat before the writing these sheets  i have now only a few things to take notice of here relating to the performance of the work  which i must make some apology for and which shall close this preface  first that there are some acts of parliament which in the book are referred to as printed in the appendix but are not there  as the act of security of scotland formerly past there  the act in england entitled an act for preventing dangers arising from the said act of security in scotland  the several acts of parliament for naming commissioners for the treaties  and the act for plantation of kirks and valuation of teinds  these acts being all public and to be found in the several volumes of acts of parliament of the respective kingdoms i have omitted in the appendix an needless though referred to in the book  the appendix also swelling beyond my expectation  a note also of the difference of the several duties on goods exported and imported before and after the union and of the stations of the customhouse cruizers mentioned fol    of the first appendix and referred to n r s t v xxx of the second appendix are omitted the first as needless a book of rates of both being afterward published in scotland  the second as void by the course of things the said cruizers having never been built  fol   of the first appendix the last paragraph but one mention is made of a calculation of the damages done to the revenue by the importation of french goods into scotland between the end of the treaty and the first of may  but i find my self obliged to acknowledge ingenuously that after many essays to obtain such a computation i could never come to any account so exact as i could depend upon or venture to publish  the irregularity of the appendix may deserve some excuse but the various times in which the several parts were wrote even some before others were acted were the true reason of the irregular placing of the pieces and it is hoped the reader will accept that for a reason  as to the work it self  i shall say nothing but leave it to the charity of the world which in this age indeed runs very low it has many difficulties in its way many factions and parties to please  and must be censured by some i have endeavored to speak truth and relate fact impartially in all that is matter of history as to my own observations they are but my opinions and they must abide the fiercest attacks of parties as the passions and interests of men guide them  and i am perfectly vnconcerned at the event  d f  a general history of unions in britain in order to come to a clear understanding in the whole frame of this wonderful transaction the union it is necessary to let the reader into the very original of it and enquire where the first springs are to be found from whence this mighty transaction has been formed  and though this will of course lead us back a great way into history yet it will carry this advantage along with it that we shall see all the several steps which have been taken how providence has led the nations as it were by the hand and brought them by the hints of their mutual disasters to seek this treaty as the only harbor the ship of the state could safely come to an anchor in  nor is it unworthy observation especially to those who love to remark the connection of providence in the affairs of this world and the various turns the island of britain has had in the compass of a few past years all which have had their direct tendency to this great event though perfectly unforeseen either by the actors or the lookers on in those ages  the animosities between these two nations would require a great deal of time and art to describe they are not so remarkable for their antiquity and original as for their nature and circumstances  never two nations that had so much affinity in circumstances have had such inveteracy and aversion to one another in their blood  they have been both the inhabitants of the richest the beautifullest and most populous island in the world and by frequent mutual invasions made upon them by the same foreign nations who have left their race behind them it is not at all an excursion to say they are the same in blood of the same offspring and became inhabitants the same way  if it be objected that the north and northwest parts of scotland are irish and retain both the sirnames manners and language of the irish or the ancient scoti from whence the whole kingdom had its name it is also answered so has england in wales cornwall and westmorland the ancient britains who retain their sirnames manners and languages as distinctly as the highlanders in the north or the irish in the islands of scotland  but take the south part of scotland on this fide the tay the inhabitants though very ancient must be allowed to be the remains of the roman colonies afterward of the danes some saxons and among all these the picts who we suppose to have been the ancient inhabitants  it is true england is much more mixed in blood and the reason of this is plain in that being a nation powerful in wealth fruitful in soil and above all increasing in commerce more nations have sought to settle among them numbers of people have flowed in upon them from all parts of the world and blending their blood with the most ancient families have destroyed all that can be called national as to antiquity among them and they do not pretend to it  whereas in scotland under all the mixtures they have suffered their ancient families seem to have been preserved and foreign nations have only seemed to increase their number  however this be there is nearness of blood enough i mean as to originals to have occasioned some propensity to coalition and mutual neighborhood between the nations and one would have thought some happy accident might have fallen out some lucid interval some convenient crisis of circumstances or juncture of inclination to have brought them together made them fast friends and so have joined their victorious arms to the terror of their neighbors  but the rancor has run in the blood the hatred between the nations has looked like a mere original a sort of antipathy heredetary from generation born with the very nations and has long threatened us with being too fast rooted there ever to be removed but like a malignant rank leprosy by pulling up foundations  nor will all the history which i shall trace in the pursuit of this affair illustrate it more than the very story of the union it self the strange opposition made to the treaty and to the parliament in scotland against all manner of reasoning against nature against interest the aversion to it among those very people that are now made happy by it with what convulsions this evil spirit was cast out what struggles it made at parting how the poor enslaved people fought against their approaching freedom insulted the patriots of their liberty and with inexpressible uneasiness received the blessing of universal peace these things i say will be lasting testimonies to that original aversion that was planted in the minds of the people notwithstanding the nearness of their circumstances in other cases  i shall not go back to the wars here between the scots and picts and the britains in the time of the romans and how afterward in the declining of their empire the britains fatally to them called in the saxons to support them against the fury of the scots the famous picts wall built in the time of the romans the remains whereof are visible to this day are sad tokens of the ancient quarrels wars and devastations that were carried on between the two kingdoms even beyond our accounts of time  nor does it appear to me that there was in all those times any propensity between the nations to such a thing as peace no not for many ages after those times but if either side found it convenient to treat even those treaties were carried on with a kind of a professed resolution of renewed war on the first occasion and i think history gives us no account of any firm resolved peace ever made among them but only short truces of peace for a term of years very often for one year two or three at the end of which the war was supposed to break out again of course  nor were these wars carried on like the wars between other nations with policy temper and points of honor but all that could be expected when two terrible and warlike nations provoked to all possible extremes shall meet have been to be found here  these unhappy wars have therefore been all devastation and blood the invasions on either side have always been fire and death the land laid waste with burnings and plunder and then the armies fighting with fury and desperation no nations that ever fought since what we are told of in the old eastern and roman empires have killed so many in fight and if i should enter into proportions of land and people i need not make exceptions for them either sixty thousand thirty thousand twenty and fifteen thousand slain of a side have been the frequent numbers of which history gives account in the wars between these two miserable nations and that not seldom but very often and some very lately  i forbear to enter into a further description of the ancient feuds of these nations as what is but a melancholy retrospect to any that have but common compassion for their country this may serve to illustrate the present subject and make the peace we now enjoy the more valuable to posterity  the first entrance i shall make on the matter of coalition seems to begin with edward the first king of england and this as it was on a wrong foot so its continuance was accordingly  that victorious monarch possessed the whole island of britain for he pierced scotland to the orcades and traversed all the mountains of wales subdued all the petty princes of the britains and had projected to call himself king of britain  but providence had better things in store for this island his projected empire founded on conquest ended ere it began all his victories were unravelled in his effeminate luxuriant son and he that had torn the crown from his neighbors had in his posterity his own crown laid at the foot of justice and taken from the heads of a thoughtless young tyrant his son whose life was made to pay for the oppressions of his own subjects  it was in this kings reign the first project of uniting the two kingdoms was laid and though it proved abortive in its most early execution yet it is very useful to the present purpose and to the readers information to give the world a scheme of this designed union and to let those gentlemen who have opposed it now as a novelty know that it was the opinion of both the nations in all ages for this was in      that a union would be for the general good of the whole  see english buchan fol      it is true we find one of the kings of scotland viz robert bruce who was really one of the greatest kings scotland ever had among the instructions left for the conduct of his successor leaving this stated rule viz never to make a perpetual amity with the english buchan lib   fol     but the reasons given for it will not at all be brought in prejudice of a union or incorporation of the two nations for as to long recesses which that prince argued to prove that the scots by disuse would be rendered unfit for arms and so be the more easily worsted by the english who by foreign wars were always kept active and vigorous and by that means were likely to have advantages of them that can be no argument the nations now having no more occasion for that emulation  nor does it seem to me but the same principle of care for his native country which led king robert to be so thoughtful for time to come could he have seen what these ages have been brought to know would by the same reasoning have led him vigorously to have pursued a conjunction of the two kingdoms into one incorporated body if he had seen the least prospect of such an attempt being feasible and i believe this not from the nature of the thing only and its correspondence with his general interest  but from this note that in his successors times  when the first proper season seemed to offer it was not thought of only but pursued with all possible diligence as shall appear in its proper place  but to go back to the state of the wars in his reign and a little before  who ever will give himself leave to read the history of the wars at that time will wonder how scotland was able to struggle with such terrible losses and may reckon up above  00000 scotsmen slain in fight only against king edward the first besides all the other havoc five several invasions of a conquering enemy must be attended with  and yet with what vigor they shook off the yoke how they were to his death i mean king edward the first preparing new armies and in the space of but two years after it ventured a battle with his son edward the second at the head of  00000 englishmen at bannockburn and beat him out of the field with the greatest slaughter that was ever made in britain since the fight between william the conqueror and king harold there being as some histories say  0000 men slain on the english side  thus ended the union of conquest between the nations scotland recovered her liberty and england paid very dear for the experiment  but this is not the reason why i begin at this period but as the first sense of the blessings of union began to touch the people of this age it can not but be acknowledged the great and indeed the only point of time to take the rise of this voluminous story from  alexander the third king of scotland was one of the greatest instances of the vicissitudes and precarious condition of a royal state in the world in the space of about three years he had two wives and a flourishing offspring was left first a widower then childless and at last lifeless and the crown of scotland in a manner hopeless  henry the second king of england dying king alexander and his queen takes a journey to england in complement to king edward the first and to be present at his coronation i shall avoid disputing here any thing of the so much controverted article of homage let it be how it will it is not to the present purpose to me it seems not at all the business of that journey if it had there had been no need of the queens going too nor do i read of any thing but a visit of complement or a journey of curiosity to see the pomp and grandeur of the english court which was then very great  in this journey fatal to the family as well as to scotland the queen sickned and soon after dyed she was followed in a few months by both her sons david and alexander the latter being but just married to the daughter of baldwin earl of flanders  nor was this all disasters seldom come alone margaret the kings only daughter married to the king of norway dyed the same year leaving one daughter only named also margaret of whom presently  the king surprised with this general shock of mortality upon his family finding himself childless and unmarried but being in his prime of age and strength resolves upon marriage to restore his family and accordingly he marries joletta daughter of the earl of dreux in normandy  but heaven had yet further judgments for scotland for before any children were born of this marriage the king himself fell from his horse and his kingdom both at once for he broke his neck in the fall at or near kinghorn a little town in fife on the northside of the firth over against edinburgh  the only heir to the crown was now margaret daughter of hangonanus king of norway by margaret aforesaid the only daughter of alexander the third king of scotland  and here is the first demonstration of what i shall all along insist on in this history viz that never any rational prospect of uniting these kingdoms appeared in the world but both the nations unanimously agreed that union was for the mutual advantage of both and that it never was opposed by either nation as a nation but only as private interest strength of parties court intrigues and the enemies of both the nations have prevailed to prevent their happiness  alexander dyed in the year      without issue vid buchan de rerum scoticarum lib   fol    edward the first king of england a powerful and politic prince saw himself in a condition to manage scotland by force as afterward too sadly appeared but a better prospect at that time being in view he falls immediately upon a scheme which if providence had permitted it to have taken effect would have secured the peace of these kingdoms from that time and prevented the terrible effusion of blood which happened that very same age as well as for many ages since between both kingdoms  and this project was union the king had one son edward heir to the crown of england who afterward proved the most unfortunate prince that ever reigned in england  the crown of scotland had but one heir viz margaret of norway grandchild to alexander the third by margaret his daughter married to the king of norway it presently occurs to the king and his council that a marriage between edward his son and this young lady margaret then commonly called the maid of norway would necessarily devolve both the crowns upon his posterity and immediately establish the peace of both kingdoms  nor was the relation very remote for margaret was as above said the daughter of margaret only daughter of king alexander by king edwards own sister and therefore the dispensations from the pope were then thought necessary to be obtained as will appear presently  upon the death of king alexander says buchanan in the   th book of his history a convention of the estates was held at scoon to treat about creating a new king these are buchanans words alexandro cum tota stirpe praeter unam ex filia neptem extincto conventus ordinum sconam indicitur in quo de novo rege creando and statu regni interim componendo ageretur buch lib   fol     i confess considering the character and authority of buchanan i much wonder how he could say they met about creating a new king when in the same paragraph he says the whole lineage of alexander except one grandchild by his daughter being extinct  now if one grandchild was in being the convention of estates could not be met to create a new king  nor does it appear that their business was to create a new king but to settle the government of the kingdom in such hands as might secure the public peace during the absence of their young queen and till she could arrive from norway  and that this was their business is also evident from buchanans own relation in the same chapter quoted above where he says that when most of the nobility were come to the said convention in the first place they appointed vicegerents to govern matters eo cum frequens nobilitas venisset primum omnium sex creant qui summae reram praeessent buch lib   fol    for the present that is till their queen should arrive  to this assembly edward the first king of england sends his ambassadors to treat with them to desire their queen says buchanan as a wife to his son  the historical part of this affair is not so significant to the present purpose as the substance and insention the opinion and notion the nobility princes and people of both nations had of the thing they were then doing in which it will appear   that an entire incorporation of countries a coalition of interests and affection as well as commerce and constitution was designed even at that distance of time as the only means to settle the peace and happiness of both nations   that it was the best juncture that ever had happened or could happen for such a coalition and nothing but the immediate hand of providence who reserved it for a more happy time and for more happy instruments to finish could have prevented   and therefore buchanan says of it hi cum in conventu publico multa de vtilitate publica quae hoc matrimonium esset secatura disseruissent scotorum animos ab ea affinitate non alienos invenerunt erat enim edwardus vir magni animi magnaeque potentiae majoris etiam cupidus ejusque virtus patre vivo in bello sacro and mortuo in subigenda vallia enituerat neque scotorum nomen unquam anglo conjunctius fuisse meminerant quam sub postremis regibus nec odia vetusta unquam commodius aboleri posse videbantur quam si uterque populus honestis and aequis conditionibus in unum coiret buch de rer scot lib   fol    which his homely translator has englished thus the ambassadors in this session discoursed much of the public utility like to accrue to both kingdoms by this marriage neither did they find the scots averse therefrom for edward was a man of great courage and power yet he desired to increase it and his valor highly appeared in the holy war in his fathers lifetime and after his death in his subduing of wales neither were there ever more endearments past between the scots and the english than under the last kings yea the ancient hatred seemed no way more likely to be abolished than if both nations on just and equal terms might be united into one  here is the very substance of the queens late letter to the parliament of scotland about the union now made only here the people unhappily seemed blind to their own happiness and so long ago they were able to see it their mutual interest  the ambassadors discoursed with the nobility in the convention about the public utility like to accrue to both kingdoms  what is this but mutual stipulations regulations and in short a treaty between them how to make a union between the nations such as might be for the public advantage of both kingdoms  and this was done with general endearments between the kingdoms mutual civilities passed between the gentlemen concerned on both sides for the good of both we read of no jealousies no prejudices no radicated antipathies but the public good convinced both sides that nothing could contribute more to the rooting out and abolishing the ancient hatred than to have both nations on just and equal terms be united into one  nor is it remote to this purpose to enter a little into the articles of this union for though history is very silent in this matter yet as i have promised to search every thing in this history to the bottom i find among the records in the tower of london an ancient instrument or form of this union or confederacy which in the appendix to this work you will have printed at large and is numbered    and first to let the world be satisfied that even in so remote a time things of this nature were transacted with the same due caution and regard to the liberties and good of the people as they are now and that it was a national not a private act not an act of a few overawed by the power of king edward though several steps taken in it will be very necessary to be noted for i take this to be the most exact pattern of the present treaty of any that has ever gone before it as it was a treaty seriously set about by both nations with a real design for the general utility and with a design on both sides to bring it to pass which is more than can be said of all the treaties which have been set on foot since  the first step the king took after his sending ambassadors to treat with the convention seems to me to be the obtaining a dispensation from the pope the queen and the young prince being nearly allied and such was the subjection of the princes of the world to the roman tyranny that nothing could go on of this nature without the sanction of the church where by the way may be observed  that the pope as in all ages popes have done made his advantage of the occasion and takes this opportunity to demand of the king an old arrear of an annual pension of  000 merks granted by king john to the holy see and which king edward had lest five years unpaid  the king who knew well enough the influence ready money had in such cases readily answers the popes demands and issued his writ for payment of the money  the true copy of the original warrant to the treasurer is added in the appendix to this work which being very short i thought not improper to insert there as a thing the curious may be very well pleased to read and is marked no    it is to be noted the end of king edward in payment of this money was plainly to get the dispensation expedited for he never paid any more that i read of nor his successors either i mean on account of that old pension or grant of king johns  his holiness was so exceedingly obliged by this payment of  000 merks that he immediately dispatched the dispensation for the marriage of prince edward with the heiress of the crown of scotland though within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity which dispensation is enrolled in the patent roll of    ed  st and may be found in the appendix to this work no    the next step the king takes is to send ambassadors and letters to the king of norway giving his proxy to the bishop of durham one of the said ambassadors to espouse the lady in the name of his son edward wherein the dispensation obtained from the pope is repeated this letter and proxy is added in the appendix no    at the same time he sends letters to the keepers or guardians of the realm of scotland and to the king of norway in answer to letters received from them containing all the articles and agreements on which it was that he proposed this marriage which were published by the king for the satisfaction of the subjects of both nations in which you will find all possible care taken of the general good and sincere protestations that the end of this marriage was as is expressed in one of the letters ad honorem dei and tranquilitatem totius communitatis ejusdem regni  these testimonials are too significant not to deserve a place in this history and therefore are placed in their order in the collection and numbered          nor was this all but i find a large charter or grant made by the agreement of special commissioners on both sides and ratified by the king himself to the kingdom of scotland  in short it is a mere treaty of union between the kingdoms though not much collateral but rather particularly to scotland this has the great seal affixed to it and the king took an oath to observe it under the penalty of one hundred thousand pounds sterling an immense sum in those days to be paid to the church of rome toward carrying on the wars in the holy land and on the farther penalty of excommunication and subjecting his whole kingdom to an interdict things very terrible in those days  this instrument also is at large found among the records in the tower of london and is reprinted in prynnes collection fol             and added in the appendix or collection to this work no    another instrument is also recorded in old french wherein the security to scotland for surrendering her forts and strengths to the english on this marriage is settled and which you will find in the collection also no  0  thus the affair of an union was finished above four hundred and twenty years ago and these nations had flourished under its consequences no doubt  but heaven frowned on so great a work and the sins of both nations permitted not that blessing to come in their day for the lady dyed in her voyage from norway to scotland having a rough passage and being not able to bear the fatigues of the sea and thus all this fair fabric came to nothing was dashed in a moment to the inexpressible loss and regret of both the nations  buchanan says she dyed in norway before the commissioners arrived but our english historians and mr tyrrel in particular whom in this i follow lib   vol   fol   says positively she dyed in her voyage between norway and scotland  i cannot omit to remind the reader of these sheets what were the dismal consequences of this disappointment to both these kingdoms and as it was nothing but the immediate hand of providence that brought it to pass so it may without any charge of enthusiasm or overstraining the case be allowed to be one of the severest judgments that ever heaven inflicted on this island  and i insist on this not so much as it relates to the present history but as it may be needful for such people to reflect upon who have at the same time that they pretended to be lovers of their country yet vigorously opposed the uniting these nations in this last treaty  the breaking of the happy prospect of union between the two kingdoms was attended with strange confusions all which serve to enhance the value of their present united state the hopes of a prosperous peace were not greater on one hand than the prospect of dismal confusions was horrid on the other and though it be a digression i shall venture the trespass to give a short abridgement of the history of those times as in the course of these sheets it shall be needful to form a due connection and i promise my self the diversion will be as pleasant as profitable and that no body will think it lost labor to read over what in those ages was transacted on the stage of their native country  with the death of this princess all the thoughts of union between the kingdoms dyed also each party began to examine their separate interests not consulting what was fit to be done for the carrying on their national and general advantages  the business of scotland was how to settle the crown and who to declare king the conservators or keepers of the kingdom appointed by the convention of the estates assembled at scoon were according to buchanan duncan macduff earl of fife john cumin earl of buchan william frazer archbishop of st andrews robert bishop of glasgow another john cumin and one john steuart  the principal pretenders to the crown were john baliol and robert bruce their descent and the foundation of their claim is at large to be found in buchanans history lib   their titles were remote and not only pretty equally founded but their interest among the nobility was so equal and either way so powerful that nothing but an immediate and bloody war was apprehended as the consequence of their pretensions  the king of england disappointed in his hopes of bringing the kingdoms to a lasting peace by uniting them into one as before applied himself no more to consult their general good  but considering them in their separate capacity as two nations that could not long agree made it his whole study either first to subject scotland to england so as that making her dependent on england she should not be able to break with him or so to divide the scots among themselves as that they should be in no condition to hurt him  both his ends seemed easy to answer in the occasion that now offered it self for the scots nobility being as i have noted so equally divided in the interests of baliol and bruce that they knew not what course to take they resolved in order to avoid the confusions of a war and consequently the ruin of their country to refer it to the arbitriment of the king of england  this was a full testimony of the harmony and good understanding which was then between the nations and what a happy juncture it had been for a union if heaven had thought fit to bless the design with success any body may observe for the king of england was looked upon as such a disinterested friend to scotland and one that would willingly concern himself for their good that they leave the determination of the weightiest thing in the world to their nation wholly to his sentence  but i can not say the king acted with equal candor to the scots if what the histories of those times say may be depended upon for being a politic prince and having a long view of the effects of things before him he resolved to keep his eye upon the two particulars noted above in his determining this affair and rather to regard his own interest than the good of scotland or than the justice of the claim he resolved to sound the inclinations of the two canditates for the crown and so to give the kingdom to him that would conform himself most to his measures  upon this he treats first with the nobility and appoints a meeting at berwick then he exacts an oath of the competitors to stand entirely to and be determined by his award then he orders a select number out of the nobility of each nation as a council in this case twelve of a side mr tyrrel says forty of a side and exacts an oath of them to advise judge and determine rightly and truly according to their consciences  these were the politic appearances of his management the better to cover his true design for all this while he causes the two competitors to be sounded underhand to find out which was most likely to comply with his demands  at last the public debates beginning to draw near a period it was easy to see that baliols title was like to be approved by the twenty four as the best claim and that bruce would lose it this the king thought was the juncture to put it home in and therefore causes it to be proposed to bruce that though it was plain he would lose the crown yet if he would subject himself and the crown to the authority of the king of england he should be immediately declared  all men must allow it was politickly managed but all the craft of hell is lost upon an honest man bruce like a man of honor rejects the proposal with contempt and told them that proposed it that he scorned to enjoy the crown at the price of his countries bondage  baliol whose principle was worse though his title was better accepts the base conditions and obtains the crown swears fealty to the king of kngland and makes all the nobility that were in his interest do the same  all our historians do not agree in this account and mr tyrrel who is very particular in relating the proceedings vol   lib   fol  0       takes no notice of this but others and particularly buchanan being very positive lib   fol    i put it down as fact giving my authors authority for it and leave the reader to believe as much as he thinks fit of the fact the subject i am upon not depending upon it at all  but he that basely yields to a dishonest yoke in order to gratify his ambition is much more likely to break the conditions he makes than he that adheres to honorable articles and insists on what justice gives him a claim to and thus it was here for on the first affront offered to baliol by the english in consequence of his subjection he threw off the yoke and renounced that subjection the case in short was as follows  macduff earl of fife being injured as he conceives in a suit depending between him and the abernethians for the murder of his elder brother the king having determined in favor of the murderers appeals to the king of england against baliol  when the cause came to be heard john baliol was then at the english court and being present when he was called to answer offers to plead by a proxy or as we say to be heard by his council but was refused and obliged to come down and stand at the bar like a criminal and plead for himself  this broke off all his subjection fills him with indignation and from this time he studies nothing but revenge an opportunity soon offered to his mind for a war breaking out between the english and the french and both soliciting scotland for aid the estates of scotland determine though in an ill hour for scotland to assist the french  thus all the good temper of both nations one toward another vanished at once and the most bloody wars that ever this island felt happened between them  baliol by a solemn embassy renounces his submission to england as extorted by unjust methods and his friendship also  and edward in return furiously invades scotland both by sea and land  it is not at all my design nor to my purpose to enter here into the history of these wars or the battles ravages fire and blood which the two nations felt during the whole reign of the three edwards of england with but small intermissions the particulars whereof would of themselves make a large volume  the true reason of my mentioning these things will appear in my further prosecuting this story the short use of it is this that these two unhappy nations were always in extremes with one another nothing but the closest union or the most destructive war can be the state they must live in together and this i shall but too often make evident in these sheets  from this breach the war between the nations came to a strange height edward proved victorious over the scots and the consequences of that are easy to guess baliol was crushed his armies overthrown the country pierced even to the extremest part by the english  edward calls bruce to his side baliol is taken prisoner and surrenders the kingdom then the famous wallace gets up and carries on the war on the subject of mere national liberty overthrows the english in several encounters and is made regent but is again overthrown by edward and bruce at the great battle of falkirk and scotland then entirely submits to edward whose tyrannical government makes the very scots who had taken part with him against baliol conspire together to recover their liberty and one cuming leaguing with robert bruce son to that bruce who was to have been king these though enemies before join together to free their country but cuming designing to betray bruce is killed by him with his own hands in the very church at drumfries  how bruce after this recovered the kingdom from that subjection to the english how he was often overthrown by edward and several times reduced to hide himself in the mountains and most secret places of the kingdom and sometimes so long that he was supposed to be dead  how yet at last by innumerable attempts unwearied pains and invincible courage he retrived his fortune drove the english out of his country overthrew them with a terrible slaughter at bannockburn near stirling and after a reign of twenty four years full of continual war against the most powerful princes england had in these ages of the world he died in peace his country being recovered out of their hands these things would be too long a story here to relate  in this war by the best calculations i can make of armies raised and battles fought no less than six hundred thousand people of both nations perished and all for want of that happy union so near perfected and so disastruously lost a good lookingglass for those gentlemen who have openly wished these nations might make a breach either on one side or another to look into and for them to see if their designs had succeeded what their posterity might have had cause to thank them for  if it be objected that it does not follow that on a breach of this last treaty of union a war must necessarily have happened i shall take the liberty to enter upon that head by it self and believe these sheets will prove that a war must have been the inevitable consequence of breaking up this last treaty especially if broken up according to the project of those people that appeared to oppose it who we all know acted on principles both as to trade civil government and succession incompatible with the interest of both the present establishments and as much as can be said perfectly impracticable as the kingdoms were thus constituted but of this more hereafter  from this time we meet with no overtures of settled tranquillity between the kingdoms till the days of henry vii of england whose daughter margaret was married to james iv king of scotland  and though this marriage was the mother of union as i may term it and laid the foundation of almost all the projects that have happened since and from whence at last the crown of england devolved upon the royal line of scotland yet in his time there were no immediate steps taken toward it the outmost effect of this marriage was an immediate peace between the nations which however did not last long but king james falling in with the french interest fell out with his fatherinlaw king henry vii and after with his brother king henry viii and lost his life in that war  the first attempt subsequent to this was a proposal of henry viii who after this great quarrel was ended though he was victor offered to match his daughter mary prince edward afterward king edward vi being then not born to james the   th king of scotland and to secure the possession of the crown after himself to them jointly and the design of this match it was evident could be nothing else but a firm lasting and established peace between the two nations for having himself no sons and expecting none for the business of the divorce of his wife queen katharine was not then come into his head he foresaw this was the only step to unite the nations and put an end to these bloody contentions that for so many ages had been between them for that the heirs of that match would by consequence be possessed of both and so the whole island would become one happy and most powerful people united in interest in government and in every thing that would make them great  this proposal was so rational and so visibly tending to the general advantage of both kingdoms that it could not be supposed to meet with any opposition from such as were in the least concerned for the good of their native country on either hand  on the english side it met with an immediate good reception for king henry viii contrary to the general conduct of that prince whose temper was generally speaking bloody fierce haughty and too apt to insult such as fell into his hands yet here changing his temper he caused the scots prisoners taken at the late battle to be very well treated and committed to the several keepings of the english nobility who used them honorably and according to their quality  i know it is said that the king who had this project first in his head distributed the scots noblemen in the houses of the english lords that these might according to his private instructions deal with them apart and strive by promises and such like arguments to bring them to hearken to such a proposal and to begin the treaty  and that the said scots noblemen were by this artifice prompted and brought to make the first offer of this marriage as from scotland  but let this be as it will let the honor of the proposal ly where it will it is manifest both parties were well pleased with it and looked upon it as the best method to bring both nations to a state of prosperous and durable peace but satan hindered  it was evident that both kingdoms had a fixed inclination at this time for the union henry showed his good will in that he offered to heap up unusual honors upon the king of scotland upon the first project of the match as upon his undoubted successor to the crown such as making him a peer of britain by the royal title of duke of york a title vested in the crown and since the father of edward the fourth reckoned the next step to the throne but this was not all he offered to declare him lord lieutenant or deputy governor of england immediately upon the match this was to put the government as it were in his actual possession and make him king by the consequence of the thing  there is no doubt but had this match succeeded there would have been mutual stipulations of a complete coalition entered into by the respective parliaments of both kingdoms  but french and popish counsels prevented this happy conjunction as they have several others since and would have done the last for the clergy of scotland finding henry viii of england had crushed the power of the clergy in england and was suppressing the abbeys and monasteries curbing the extended authority of the pope and as they apprehended destroying their church they set themselves by all possible artifice to prevent this proposals taking effect and getting the french king to join his interest with theirs they wrought the king of scotland to such a dislike of the match that he rejected king henrys proposal with some indecencies refused him an interview at york though he had given his word to meet him there  this king henry so resented that a war immediately followed as upon a defeat of an union has generally happened in which war the scots nobility were so sensible of the wrong measures of their prince and the advantages to their country which he had rashly rejected that they followed him very unwillingly and at last wholly abandoned him at solanmoss declaring they thought it was not their duty to ruin their country to gratify the passion of their deluded monarch and the blinded fury of the clergy this cost king james his life who died of grief as buchanan relates rerum scoticarum lib   fol     its true had this match gone forward it had not had the designed effect at least not immediately because king henry the viii afterward had a son born who succeeded to the crown viz edward the vi  but this is not to the present case the design was the same nor did it die with the respective kings  nay after the birth of the young prince king henry the viii made a second proposal of an union viz of a match between his son edward and the daughter of the late king of scots and this went so far as to be approved in the parliament of scotland as may be seen in the registers of that time but this was again interrupted as the former had been by the death of king henry the viii who left the crown to his son edward the vi  in this reign the project of uniting the kingdoms revived immediately for the english council saw clearly the advantages accruing to both nations by an union and could not slip that happy juncture their king was a child not above nine years of age the queen of scotland was the like left by her father at five days old and crowned in her cradle the regency of scotland and the council of governors of the young king revive the treaty and propose a match between the king of england and the queen of scotland  and built it upon the late agreement made between king henry and the parliament of scotland  but the french and popish party who as i have noted already opposed uniting the kingdoms before on the pretense of the danger of the roman church had now much more reason to do so since king edward had declared himself as they esteemed it an heretic had disowned the pope and had erected a protestant church on the ruin of the romish and on these arguments they rejected the proposal and broke their former agreement  and here happened what i have all along observed to be the consequence of breaking up a treaty between the two nations viz a bloody war like as certainly must have happened again had not this last happy treaty interveened of which i am to discourse in these sheets  it is not my business to enter upon the particulars of the war on this occasion but two things it will be necessary to observe   st that this war issued in the defeat of the scots popish army at the battle at pinkie after which it was expected the young queen should have been delivered to the english and married to their king and truly if the frank and generous offer of the conquerors had been in the least regarded it had been so who after the victory made no spoil or havoc in scotland but as friends made a fair demand of their the scots queen to be married to their the english king that so the nations being united might for ever remain one  and this is to be seen in that famous declaration of the duke of somerset the english general which as it is in a style peculiar and not usual in the world among conquerors i could not omit and is in the appendix no     but   it was in vain to talk reason to a people resolved the popish party who saw evidently the ruin of their church and the french who saw the destruction of their ancient league wrapped up in the projected union of the kingdoms frustrated all the design by conveying the young princess into france and so this scheme came also to nothing  this had several bad effects which scotland afterward regreted first that it delayed the reformation in scotland for near thirty years after that in england and made it both difficult bloody tedious and for a long time imperfect of which i have treated elsewhere secondly it brought her under a french yoke and for a long time she groaned under the tyranny of french influence till the nation threw off tyranny and popery together and reformation came on hand in hand with liberty  and now the notion of union between the two kingdoms began to wear out as a thing that though both nations had inclination enough to engage in yet there was no juncture to make it feasible till the death of queen elizabeth who dying without issue the english crown devolved upon the scots line and this produced a kind of union i mean an union of the crowns but not an union of the kingdoms of the imperfection deficiency and inconveniency of which to both kingdoms i shall make some brief observations as they have been the motives to the frequent attempts for a more near conjunction in the succeeding times  the inconveniences to scotland in this partial union were first their removing their court to england their king according to the prophetic saying of henry the vii removing his seat of government from the less to the greater  this was naturally attended with the decay of trade in scotland by removing the concourse of strangers from scotland whose consumption of provisions and manufactures which are the foundation of commerce was a great loss to trade  with the exporting their ready money out of the kingdom by the constant attendance of their gentry and nobility at the english court where they spent their estates and sucked out the blood of their country to support their luxury and magnificence  with the continued emptying their nation of their people who all flocked to england either for public or private employment and depopulated as well as impoverished their native country but above all the bringing scotland under english influence both as to civil and religious government was a manifest token of the deficiency of this partial union for scotland was after this in a political sense though not in a legal sense always under the management of the english court it had the subjection without the advantages  her seamen were pressed into the english service as subjects yet at the same time excluded the merchants service as foreigners an english ship sailed with above one third scots men would be seized as not being sailed by english men and the colonies of england were at last all barred from them as much as from the french or dutch it would be too long a digression to recite here the various inconveniences scotland labored under from the deficiency of this partial or merely regal union and which made all the wellwishers to scotland desire either that there were a more entire union or that there were no union at all   nor was this unforeseen by either nation and therefore no sooner was king james the vi of scotland come to the crown of england but he began before he had learned quite to forget his own country to project a more near union of the nations as the only way to make them both completely happy this was in the year   0   when after several projects of uniting by his own absolute authority a thing then newly taken up in the world finding all other methods fail he proposed it to the parliament of england that to use his own words as they were made one in the head they might be inseparably conjoined and all memory of past divisions be extinguished at the same time he proposed it in scotland and both nations were so sensible of the mutual advantages of union that they readily agreed to it and commissioners were appointed on both sides to treat the names of the commissioners were as follows for scotland john earl of montrose lord chancellar of scotland frances earl of errol heigh constable of scotland george

merchants     we do not find among our authors any particular of the debates of these commissioners spotswood in his history fol     gives in a draught of the articles they agreed on which for want of room i only refer the reader to but having obtained from good hands a manuscript of sir george mackenzies being a little like a journal of their proceedings i could not but think it very much to the purpose to insert it in the appendix to this work where may be seen the true ground plat of the present union and the interest of both kingdoms clearly stated  as it stood then and saving in matters of religion remains still see appendix n     these articles thus mutually agreed were engrossed and signed by the commissioners on both sides and presented to the king the   th of december   0   but it was observed that the earl of salisburry at the presenting the draught to the king expressed it to be the meaning of the commissioners that these articles were but an imperfect agreement and that they were willing to finish and go through the same when ever he pleased  however the king offered it to the parliament of england and as spotswood says recommended it earnestly to them but the more secret history of that affair was that the king himself falling in at that time with the english clergy and opposing the prosperity of his own country upon the score of religion and absolute will found ways and means to puzzle this cause in parliament and first the difficulty of the postnati a thing which had the english at that time purposed a hearty union would never have stuck with them occasioned long struggle and at last the parliament referred it to the common law while this was doing the national aversion particularly in england seemed to revive and the public appearances in england of a spirit of division were such as one observes that very well discovered the king was become on english man otherwise he would never have born with those invectives and railings at scotland which sir thomas craig in his book de union regnorum says were then publicly used in the pulpits and in printed books while their king was a scotsman  nor was this all but the king in stead of forwarding the union of the two kingdoms or promoting the particular advantage of scotland fell in with the arbitrary projects of that time to make himself absolute in scotland  as he was also doing in england this would lead me into a vast ocean of national confusions which received their rise and conception in the tyrannical temper of this prince in which he laid the foundation of the ruin of his posterity which as remote to my present business purposely i omit  asto union nothing further was done till the year    0  and till that time which was about    years the subjects of scotland enjoyed a freedom of commerce in common with the english to all the english colonies but then some acts in england passing in prejudice of that freedom of commerce the scots renewed their complaints and a commission says sir george mackenzie was granted in the   d session of the first parliament of charles   d in scotland and by an act at the same time in england nominating commissioners to adjust these differences this was in       these commissioners met the    st january      and the scots commissioners gave in a proposal to the english for settling the differences about trade which paper i have also given you from an original manuscript of the said sir george mackenzie and which you will find in the appendix no     the debates which followed this paper says sir george served only to show the king the necessity of commencing a further treaty viz of a union and how ineffectual all other treaties would be to bring about the public peace of the two nations  to this end a parliament being called in scotland the    th of october      and the english parliament meeting the same day he caused the great affair of an union to be proposed to both at the same time the parliament of scotland by their letter to the king expressed their readiness to concur with the poposal and that they would grant commission to such as his majesty should nominate for that purpose to treat as their representatives and left it to the king to name the time place and quorum of their meetings  this being the substance of the letter i have omitted the letter it self which is to be seen in the registers in edinburgh  the parliament of england by what affairs obstructed i shall not determine did nothing in it that session but reassumed it in    0 and empowered the king by an act    carol   almost in the terms the scots had done before  the parliament of scotland pursuant to this granted a commission for a treaty which was almost verbatim the same with that granted in england that no debates might arise between the commissioners of both kingdoms about the difference of their commissions as had fallen out in the year   0   and because i shall endeavor to relate matter of fact abstracted from my own observations in this history i have with some difficulty obtained an original manuscript of the minutes of this short treaty  which are as follows  a transcript of the treaty in    0 wednesday the    of september    0 in the two and twentieth year of the reign of our sovereign lord charles the second by the grace of god of england scotland france and ireland king defender of the faith etc an act passed the parliament of england entitled an act authorizing certain commissioners of the realm of england to treat with the commissioners of scotland for the well of both kingdoms and in the same year an act passed in the parliament of scotland to the same effect  in pursuance of which acts and his majestys commissions under the great seals of england and scotland the commissioners in the said commissions named are all this day in the exchequer chamber at westminster where his majestys commission under the great seal of england was read publicly by the clerk attending the commissioners for england and also his majestys commission under the great seal of scotland by the clerk attending the commissioners for scotland which being done the lord keeper of the great seal of england did let their lordships know that his majesty had appointed somerset house for their future sitting in this affair and by consent of all their lordships adjourned their next meeting to be at somerset house on saturday next at nine a clock in the forenoon  at somerset house saturday the    day of september    0 this day the commissioners of both kingdoms being met the lord keeper of the great seal of england delivered to the earl of lauderdale lord high commissioner for scotland a copy in parchment of his majestys commission under the great seal of england attested by the clerk attending the english commissioners and received from his lordship the like copy of the commission under the great seal of scotland then their lordships received a message from his majesty in writing and heads therein proposed to be treated of which being read the commissioners of both kingdoms agreed to consider against their next meeting in what method to proceed upon his majestys message and also in what manner their lordships shall deliver their opinions at their general meetings upon which the next general meeting of the commissioners was adjourned to thursday the    of september instant at nine a clock in the forenoon after this adjournment the commissioners for england withdrew into their own chamber among themselves to consider of the method of their proceedings in this treaty  where first the lord keeper of the great seal and the lord ailingtoun acquainted the rest of the commissioners then present that his majesty had appointed mr john walker to attend their lordships as their clerk which their lordships approved of and ordered that he should subscribe their orders and papers by order of the commissioners for the kingdom of england john walker clerk  then upon debate it was resolved that nothing which shall be in debate or assented shall be taken as the opinion or resolution of the commissioners of either kingdom or drawn into consequence or any way made use of unless the whole be mutually agreed to also that their lordships would not treat by papers as in the treaty of      but that the joint resolutions of the commissioners at their general meetings only be reduced into writing and entered by both their clerks next it was resolved that these two propositions be offered to the commissioners for scotland at their lordships next general meeting as preliminaries to be jointly agreed and resolved on  then were read the several heads offered to their lordships consideration in his majestys message and upon debate it was agreed that the lord keeper of the great seal let the commissioners for scotland at the next general meeting know that upon due consideration had their lordships offered the third head proposed in his majestys message  viz the uniting both kingdoms into one monarchy under his majesty his heirs and successors inseparably to be the first point to be debated and then that his lordship desire the commissioners for scotland to propose on which of the two first heads to proceed next but that their lordships were of opinion not to proceed on the fourth or fifth heads till the others be agreed to  thursday the    d of september    0 before the general meeting of the commissioners of both kingdoms this day the commissioners for england met in their own chamber and it was agreed that what the lord keeper shall propose at the general meeting be done in the name of the commissioners  then the commissioners of both kingdoms being met the lord keeper of the great seal offered to the board what the commissioners for england had agreed on on saturday last as preliminaries for the better proceeding in this treaty the substance whereof being assented to by the commissioners for scotland it was agreed the committee of the commissioners of both kingdoms should be appointed for the wording of what was agreed to and to report unto the board  also his lordship proposed the third head in his majestys message to be the first article to be debated which was assented to by the lords commissioners for scotland but some objection being made against the words and successors in that head the commissioners for england withdrew to their chamber to consider thereof and what words were fit to be assented to where after some debate their lordships resolved that if the commissioners for scotland at their lordships return should insist upon leaving out these words and successors to yield to them therein  while the commissioners for england were in their chamber a message was brought from the commissioners for scotland by their clerk to know whether their lordships would name their committee there or at the board upon which their lordships named the earl of anglesey master attorney general and sir leoline jenkins and returned answer that they had named a committee of their commissioners  then the commissioners returning to the general meeting after some debate upon the third head agreed to leave out the words and successors and that the monarchy be styled by the name of great britain then the lords commissioners for scotland let their lordships know that they had

resolution of the said commissioners nor drawn into consequence or any ways made use of as such until the whole which shall be agreed unto be reduced into instruments tripartite under the hands and seals of the said commissioners according to their respective commissions nor then neither unless the same being presented to shall be approved and ratified by the respective parliaments so as this preliminary be not understood to leave room for debate or change of any thing by the commissioners which shall be put under their hands and seals as aforesaid  which alteration and addition being reported by the earl of anglesey to the commissioners for england was approved of  then the commissioners for scotland sent a message to the commissioners for england desiring that the said committee might meet again presently in the great room which was agreed to where being met the committee of the commissioners for scotland proposed an addition to be made to the first article of union agreed upon of these words they being of the progeny and posterity of king james his majestys royal grandfather of glorious memory which addition the earl of anglesey reported to the commissioners for england whose lordships upon debate thereof agreed to offer at the general meeting of the commissioners of both kingdoms the article thus altered that the two kingdoms shall be inseparably united into one monarchy under his majesty and the heirs of his body and for want of such heirs under the body of king james his majestys royal grandfather of glorious memory  then the commissioners of both kingdoms being met the lord keeper of the great seal read the two preliminary articles prepared by the said committees to which the commissioners for scotland declared their agreement and the commissioners for england theirs also his lordship read the two articles of union upon the third head in his majestys message worded by the said committees with the addition of such words as the commissioners for england upon the motion of the commissioners for scotland thought fit to assent unto to which articles the whole board consenting the said preliminary articles of union were written fair and signed by the respective clerks and then being openly read again by the clerk attending the commissioners for england were interchangeably delivered to the commissioners of both kingdoms to be entered in their respective books and signed by both clerks  next the earl of lauderdale lord commissioner for scotland offered the first head in his majestys message to be then proceeded on viz the preserving to either kingdom their laws civil and ecclesiastical entire to which his lordship declared they did agree in general but differed as to the meaning of it thus  that the laws and customs civil criminal and ecclesiastic judicatories and offices of either kingdom be preserved and remain entire in all time coming as they are before the union and that all actions processes causes and questions civil criminal or ecclesiastical concerning the subjects of scotland or any of them in their lives rights properties or other interests in scotland be only tried judged and determined in scotland by the ordinary and competent judicatories there and shall not be heard pursued or judged in england in the first instance or by way of appeal review reduction or by any other way whatsoever  after some debate had hereupon at the board to the end their lordships might the better consider thereof the lord keeper by the general consent of the commissioners of both kingdoms adjourned the next meeting to thursday the    th day of october next at nine a clock in the forenoon  after which the commissioners for england met in their own chamber to debate and prepare themselves upon this point against the next general meeting and after some time spent thereupon departed  thursday the    th of october    0 this day the commissioners for both kingdoms present being met in the great room the earl of lauderdale did intimate to their lordships that in regard of his majestys being at present at new market where many of the commissioners appointed for this treaty are attending on his majesty he conceived there was sufficient reason for adjourning their proceedings for some few days longer upon which by the general consent of the commissioners present the next meeting was appointed to be on thursday the  0 th of october instant at nine a clock in the forenoon  thursday the  0 th of october    0 the commissioners for england being met in their chamber the first head proposed in his majestys message was read with the proposition made by the commissioners for scotland as an explanation thereof which being debated by their lordships after some time spent it was agreed to desire the commissioners for scotland to express their meaning more clearly as to the legislative power of the parliament which will be for great britain after the union upon which the commissioners for both kingdoms being met the lord keeper offered to the board that the commissioners for england had considered of the proposition made by the commissioners for scotland upon the first head in his majestys message now under consideration and having read the proposition told their lordships that as the proposition is made the parliament which will be for great britain will have no legislative power to alter or change any laws how grievous soever besides there will be no power any where to alter the laws in scotland though the subjects of scotland should desire it and therefore desired their lordships the commissioners for scotland to explain their meaning upon that proposition  whereupon the commissioners for scotland desired to withdraw whose lordships soon after returning the earl of lauderdale delivered the meaning of the commissioners for scotland as follows viz our meaning is not hereby to determine every particular law of scotland to be unalterable but we cannot say any thing to the way of altering till the next article concerning the parliament be treated  upon which the commissioners for england desired to withdraw for a while to consider of what was offered and return presently  whose lordships being withdrawn to their own chamber the said answer of the commissioners for scotland was there read and upon some consideration had thereof it was agreed to take a little more time to consider more fully thereof and upon their return to propose the same to the board and a present adjournment then the commissioners for england being returned into the great room the lord keeper did let the board know that their lordships conceive the matter proposed worthy a little more time in which it might be better considered as well by their lordships the commissioners for scotland as the commissioners for england whereupon by the general consent of the commissioners of both kingdoms the next meeting was adjourned to saturday the    d instant at nine a clock in the forenoon  saturday the    d of october    0 the commissioners for england being met in their chamber read the last paper delivered by the commissioners for scotland and thereupon agreed to offer at the board that they are ready if their lordships of scotland please to proceed upon the second head proposed in his majestys message viz the uniting both parliaments into one and to receive what the commissioners for scotland shall offer thereupon  then the commissioners for both kingdoms being met the lord keeper expressed the sense of the commissioners for england upon the exposition made by the commissioners for scotland upon the first head proposed in his majestys message and did let the board know that if their lordships of scotland think fit they are ready to proceed upon that head and if they pleased to offer any particulars upon it the commissioners for england were ready to proceed thereupon  upon which the commissioners for scotland declared their willingness to proceed upon that head but desired time to consider of what shall be thought fit to be offered on either side upon it until another meeting  whereupon by the general consent of the commissioners for both kingdoms the next meeting was adjourned to thursday the    th instant at three a clock in the afternoon  then the commissioners for england returned to their chamber to consider in what manner to proceed upon the said head and after some time spent agreed to hear what the commissioners for scotland will at their next meeting propose upon that head  by his majestys order on the    th of october the next meeting of the commissioners of both kingdoms was put off to tuesday the first of november    0 at nine a clock in the forenoon  tuesday the   st of november    0 the commissioners for england being met in their chamber to consider of the second head in his majestys message now to be treated on agreed to propose to the commissioners for scotland that conceiving their lordships intend a proportion of number of members to sit in both houses of the parliament which shall be for great britain they desire to know from the commissioners for scotland what that proportion shall be for scotland as to england  then the commissioners of both kingdoms being met the earl of lauderdale declared that according to agreement the commissioners for scotland were ready to proceed upon the said second head  to which the lord keeper answered that the commissioners for england did likewise agree to it but supposing the commissioners for scotland intend a proportion of members as to the balance of that parliament desired to know what that proporrion shall be for scotland as to england  upon which the earl of lauderdale declared that they came to this treaty by the authority of the parliament of scotland and were named by his majesty and they did not see how their number should be less than now it is in the parliament of scotland without incapacitating some peers in scotland and cutting off some shires and royal burrows from sending members to parliament which would be a hard task to undertake their lordships being to give an account of this treaty to the parliament of scotland upon which the lord keeper told them that their lordships having proposed a thing which the commissioners for england could not expect it would be fit to take some time to consider thereof which being agreed to the next meeting by the general consent of the board was adjourned to tuesday the   th of november instant at three a clock in the afternoon to debate this subject  then the commissioners for england being returned to their chamber after some debate it was agreed to desire master attorney general to draw some reasons to be offered to their lordships consideration at their next meeting against what the commissioners for scotland have proposed concerning their parliament being entirely united to the parliament of england  tuesday the   th of november    0 the meeting of the commissioners of both kingdoms intended to be this day was put off till saturday next the    th of this instant at three in the afternoon  by his majestys order on the    th of november    0 the next meeting of the commissioners of both kingdoms was adjourned to the last thursday in march next coming  and never met more  any one that peruses this short treaty or rather conference may see that these times were not tempered for an effectual union and those that know any thing of the secret history of that day will also know there were private designs then on foot which made a nearer union inconsistent with the views of the court  the scots insisted on a conjunction of parliaments not an incorporation of foundations as has now been proposed england durst never hear of such a conjunction of parliaments on account of church matters knowing that though episcopacy was then established in scotland yet that the secret bent of that nation was presbyterian and they durst not think of a conjunction of houses on that score  and here i would ask leave of the gentlemen in scotland who have opposed the present union in regard of its hazard to the presbyterian church to remind them what reason they have to look back to the days of this treaty and be thankful that the union was not compassed at this time and to consider why they should have ventured putting it off to a further time since had it happned in that time when episcopacy had the face of a legal establishment in scotland the presbyterian church had for ever sunk under its weight and been exploded by the laws of both kingdoms both kingdoms had been obliged to keep it down and it could never miracles excepted have recovered it self in that nation  and thus i have traced the several endeavors to unite these kingdoms in former times in which i have been as brief as i can i shall conclude this with only one remark which i believe will appear to be just through the whole course of the several treaties hitherto named the first excepted which was disappointed by a mere judgment from heaven i mean the death of the maid of norway all the rest of the proposals for union between these kingdoms met with their particular obstructions from popery frenchinterest hometyranny or courtintrigues these were the only enemies of union and i believe it may without partiality be added and so it is now  we are now come to the present times king james the ii in england or vii in scotland had no other union in view but that of uniting all his kingdoms to the church of rome and this put him upon measures perfectly distinct from all that had gone before him from whence we have had two famous revolutions in britain one in the regal state of both kingdoms the other in the ecclesiastic state of scotland from episcopal to presbyterian  this was no sooner brought to pass but scotland put the king in mind of their desires to unite in their letter to king william of which presently  but all that princes reign this good design met with obstructions of which i shall be something particular in its place and thus we are brought down to queen anne in whose reign this great work was once attempted but proved abortive and at the second essay was brought to perfection as will be seen in the sequel of this story  of affairs in both kingdoms introductory of a treaty of union before i enter upon the proceedings in the reign of queen anne toward a general union of these kingdoms it is absolutely necessary to the right understanding of things to take a short view of the posture of public affairs in the respective kingdoms and what it was that rendered the union so absolutely necessary at this time that to all considering people who made any tolerable judgment of things it was plain there was no other way left to prevent the most bloody war that ever had been between the two nations  at the revolution as has been already noted and several times during the reign of the late king william motions had been made frequently both on the kings side and on the peoples also to come to a treaty but that prince had always one thing or other cast in his way to prevent his good design  the king was often heard to say that this island could never be easy without a union and if either of them understood their own happiness they would never rest till it was brought to pass and as i had the honor to mention it once among other things in a scheme of general peace among the protestant interests in europe i can not forget that his majesty expressing some concern at it returned i have done all i can in that affair but i do not see a temper in either nation that looks like it  and added after some other discourse it may be done but not yet  during the whole reign of this prince the breaches between the two kingdoms rather widened and increased than tended to a close and several national unkindnesses past between them which prepared both sides as it were to reflect upon and reproach the other there wanted not also a set of wicked instruments always to blow the coals of discord between the kingdoms into a flame and if possible to bring the nations to a rupture  some of these passages which i say tended to estrange the nations and as it were prepare them for a breach rather than for an union were these the settling an african or indian company in scotland and the several clashings of interest between the two nations on that head the affairs of glenco the difficulties about the succession and limitations the act of security there the act in england entitled an act for preventing dangers arising from the act of security in scotland the seizing the ship the worcester and execution of captain green and several others    all these things concurred to convince those that had the least knowledge of affairs in both kingdoms that nothing but an union could prevent the nations falling all to pieces as soon as ever the queen should die if not sooner and that therefore it was immediately and heartily to be set about as the only way to preserve the public tranquillity and prevent the certain mischiefs that threatened the whole body  i shall not enter into a particular history of these several cases as being too tedious for this tract but as it is necessary to say something of them to convey the right understanding of these matters to posterity and that more regularly to introduce the general thing i am upon viz the union i cannot wholly omit them  and first for the african company the large commission that company obtained by which they seemed to rival the english both in their guinea east india and west india trade was ill relished by the english who at that time were in an odd and unsettled posture as to those trades at home and as this is not rightly understood by a great many that run round about for reasons of the english parliaments falling upon that affair it may not be a miss to set it in a clearer light  the english east india trade being for a long time prescribed in the narrow limits of an exclusive company who tyrannized not a little in their absolute management of that trade and became grievous to the rest of the merchants many attempts were made to lay open their stock and increase so great and so beneficial a trade but the company withstood all the attempts that way and kept all invaders off till at last by the mighty advance of two millions to the government the new eastindian company got a charter and set up against them  how they rivaled one another and with mighty struggles too much embarrassed the whole nation till the king himself was obliged to concern himself in uniting them and how he brought that great work to pass are things not so much to my present purpose but at this time viz    june      the scots company obtained their settlement  what ever prospects the projectors of that company had in their view some of which will i doubt hardly bear a history i never heard one of them pretend that either the stock to carry it on or the market for their trade could be found in scotland and from hence with other particular objections which i believe they never debated i pretend to say they could never really propose any rational probability of success  if they imagined to obtain help from abroad they indeed were in the right for they could not but know that the merchants in england would leap at a proposal to get into the east india trade free from the bondage of the company mentioned before  but if they imagined also that this could do less than embark the english government against them and bring the public to concern themselves about it they were exceeding shortsighted or must at the same time believe the other very ignorant in the affairs before them  the first step the company took was to open books for subscriptions at london and afterward at hamburgh and this was no sooner done but the english company took the alarm at both and obtained by their interest with the government instructions to the english resident at hamburgh to oppose it there which was done most effectually the english resident as it was said tacitly threatening the hamburghers that the english should remove their staple of cloth to the city of bremen and ruin the trade of hamburgh whether he did actually threaten them so or no i do not affirm but it is certain he so managed affairs that the subscriptions begun there were stopped and the design on that side effectually ruined then they i mean the english east india company applied themselves to the english parliament and by offering plausible reasons there soon obtained their votes against it also and against any of the subjects of england subscribing to it and the scots merchants who had subscribed in england were ordered to be impeacht of a misdemeanour though the parliament being near a close those impeachments dropped of course  these things had the desired effect for they crushed the attempt of raising a new east india company in these parts of the world and the projectors then played their other game of darien in which they had the same unhappiness viz to put the english nation under a necessity of opposing them  i do readily allow the first scheme of a trade to the east indies had a probability of success in it a thing i can not grant to the affair of darien which i think had not one branch belonging to its contrivance but what was big with necessary abortions such as remote mines of gold to be gained and maintained by force against the spaniards in which england could not without breach of faith assist such as a trade for european goods with the spanish colonies which must always have been by force or by stealth and neither of these had any rational probability  as to their trade over land to the south seas and thence to the indies though much boasted of it answers for it self and seems a too impracticable whimsy to merit any reply much like that other dream of making a navigation or communication between the south seas and the gulf of mexico by the river of darien  which if all were done and the distance measured to that part of india to which we chiefly trade viz the coast of coromondel surrat bay of bengal etc i think any body will determine the voyage by the cape de bon esperance the better passage by much and very little if any thing longer  but to come to the case the company or rather the projectors who had now embarked the gentlemen in a subscription of  00000 pounds sterling carried on their design and with two ships  men and a cargo perfectly unqualified for any kind of trade either with english or spaniards set sail and landing at darien made a settlement there fortified themselves and prepared to maintain it  the spaniards who claim a right there and whether that right be disputeable or no is not the question here immediately proceed by a double method first to prepare to dislodge them by force and secondly apply themselves to the king of england claiming by virtue of the treaty made with england ratified and exchanged that no succor should be given to the scots from any of the english colonies in america  this as an express stipulation could not be denied by the english court and accordingly a proclamation was exhibited by the king of england and sent to all the english plantations forbidding trade or correspondence with them  i cannot help saying had the managers of the companies affairs had the least forecast of things they could not but have expected all that happened here and also might have known that had they acted right those proclamations could have done them no manner of damage  whover has the least knowledge of the affairs of that country and of the trade of the english colonies must needs know that had the scots company who had placed themselves at darien been furnished either with money or letters of credit they had never wanted provisions or come to any other disaster notwithstanding the proclamations of the english against correspondence  nor will any man be so vain to say that they ought to have ventured on such a settlement depending on supplies from the english especially when in their affairs of hamburgh and london which were before all this they had seen the english concerning themselves against their company much less should they have gone to plant themselves in a climate unfit for product it self with neither cash nor credit to buy in other places  at last it is apparent that notwithstanding the proclamations and after all the officious care of the governors of the english colonies yet several sloops of provisions came to them but found them on the other hand unfurnished to purchase except with such goods as were fit for no market nor could they give bills any where to make good the value  the trade to the spanish west indies is forbidden in those parts under the severest penalties of loss of goods confiscation of the ship and death of the people and yet we see that at jamaica for the english and curasoe for the dutch they carry on a prodigious trade encouraged by the gain of it  had the scots at darien had any thing sufficient to encoutage the traders thither they had never wanted provisions and as they were unprovided that way they must have starved had there been no prohibitions at all for they would have found few of the planters or merchants of the colonies inclined to have furnished them without money  this i think clears up the case sufficiently and therefore i shall say no more to it here it is thus far to the present purpose that this disaster of the scots be the fault where it will was one of the great occasions of ill blood between the nations while those that took all opportunities to widen our breaches on both sides continually cried out in england that the scots were encroaching upon our trade and setting up a new east india trade  and on the other hand in scotland they complained of the unnatural and barbarous treatment of the english  both which took with the common people of either nations to the unspeakable disquieting of their minds and raising continual reproaches against one another without giving themselves leave to enquire into the grounds and reasons of things  i have been the larger on this head because i think this to be the first handle that our quarrelsome people took hold of to object against one another and on which the future jealousies between the nations were pretended to be built  the affair of glenco was another step to national breaches and though every body tells me i must handle this very gently perhaps they may see there is not so much cause for it as they imagine  and having the honor to have had something of this from persons very near the king and perhaps from his majestys own mouth i shall only state the general so far as it has been reported to the injury of that glorious prince and to the exciting national animosities between us  in doing this i shall only avoid naming of persons let the guilt dye in their graves we are not now calling up the persons to judgment but setting the matter in a clear light  that the glencomen among several other clans of the highlanders were enemies to the government at that time had been in arms under dundee and had on all occasions shown their implacable aversion to king william and all the interest of the revolution needs no proof and is owned even by the greatest friends to the cause  that these people were not only very troublesome bu tdangerous and had committed several hostilities murders robberies and depredations on both the innocent country people their neighbors as well as on the garrisons of soldiers placed on that side to suppress them is also out of dispute  the defense made for this is short that they were fair enemies and had professt open war  it is answered thus that   they cannot be owned as open enemies because they really had no commissions from king james and   ly the war was as it were suppressed the generality had laid down their arms and submitted and these as a few desperados kept up the quarrel rather as an advantage of rapine and plunder than a service to their pretended master or his cause   suppose them at open war it has been the known practice in war when a governor of a garrison holds out without expectation of relief without any prospect but mere desperation and mischief to give such no quarter no conditions at all but even after taking the place to hang them up in cold blood as wild beasts that make no fair war and deserve no fair treatment   as his majesty had this account given him of these people and i do not find but it was a true account too it was the advice of the general and officers employed at that time that it was a mischief which as times then went might be very dangerous to the public and that therefore it behoved them to take some immediate course with them and since desperate mischiefs require remedies of the same kind they thought the first force the best and proposed to march immediately with a body of troops into the place and entirely root them out as a den of thieves and destroyers without which the peaceable subjects could never be safe nor the government be easy that the charge of maintaining troops there was an intolerable burden to the country and as there was no other way could prevail to preserve the peace it was absolutely necessary to come to extremity  his majesty who by his experience in military affairs was soon convinced both of the justice in point of war and necessity in point of government of this advice yet out of his mere goodness of disposition and general clemency answered he agreed to their reasons but required that before any such extremities should be used with them a proclamation should be published offering pardon or remission for all violences and villainies past to all these people without exception who within a certain time should come in lay down their arms and submit to the government and take the oaths as peaceable subjects  it is here visible that his majestys intentions were not only just and honorable to these people tho his implacable enemies but that he resolved like a merciful prince to try all reasonable methods of tenderness and goodness if possible to keep the peace and save the offenders too  with this proclamation commission was given to the military power if this merciful method could not prevail they should proceed to extremities and by force of arms destroy all those that should stand out and not comply with the proclamation and his majestys orders were as far as relates to this part as follows  the instructions were to sir thomas livingstoun dated jan         the first clause is thus  you are hereby ordered and authorized to march our troops which are now posted at innerlochie and innerness to act against those highland rebels who have not taken the benefit of our indemnity by fire and sword and all manner of hostilities to burn their houses seize or destroy their goods cattle plenishing or clothes and to cut off the men  the fourth article runs thus  that the rebels may not think themselves absolutely desperate we allow you to give terms and quarters but we are so convinced of the necessity of severity and that they cannot be reclaimed that we will not allow you to give any other terms to chiftains heretors or leaders but to be prisoners of war whereby their lives are saved but for all other things they must surrender on mercy and take the oath of alledgeance  in additional instructions one clause is thus dated    jan       if that mackean of glenco and his tribe can be well separated from the rest it will be a proper vindication of the public justice to extirpate that sect of thieves  thus far i think i may undertake to say his majesty proceeded by the known custom of all the most just governments in the world and it would be needless to examine histories to bring precedents here to justify the method  it is certain and all men allow that the glencomen had not complied with the proclamation nay they had rejected two indemnities  i know it is objected that glenco came and took the oath six days after the time made a legal and just excuse and sent word of his willingness to comply with it and that it was only a trespass of time which they supposed he had repaired that the end of the proclamation was answered and that the king who was mercifully inclined would never have taken the lives of people resolved to submit for a trespass of days  to this i answer as his majesty himself did in that case that indeed had he been in the field and on the spot and that excuse had been sent to him he might have accepted it  but that as commissions in cases of war are to be punctually executed he could not require it of the officers to accept it as an excuse against a positive proclamation and an express order besides i do not find any but the chief had gone thus far the rest not having come in at all  it is alleged that the execution was from private malice  but none could ever yet have the face to charge his majesty with that and i could never hear of any reason given why the commanders of the forces should have any much less those at whom the scandal of it was pointed upon pretense of giving unwarrantable orders  but the case chiefly lies here the men fell under the misfortune of a crisis in war they brought themselves into it by an omission of time to say they could not avoid it does not reach the case if the officers can be charged with any private revenge in this case i have only this to say   i never yet saw any reason to think so no personal grudge or quarrel ever appeared that i ever met with or was so much as  alleged in it or gain pretended to be made by it if the e of b  had any private game it neither affected the king nor the other persons charged with the thing   if it were so it no way affects the king against whom the reproach of this affair is since pointed who acted nothing but what was agreeable to the laws of war and mixed it with that general blessing of his temper an unusual clemency   if the commission given was executed with barbarity and blood killing people in what we call cold blood surprising them in peace and dependence on safety all this will turn upon the merits of the first cause for if they were by the laws of war to be destroyed all manner of surprises become justified by the same law as to the cruelties and excesses of the furious soldiers no man can have the face to reproach his majesty with that  the grand question remains yet behind why did not the king cause the offenders to be made examples and severely punish the murderers  i shall answer   if his majestys peculiar was too much clemency i think some of those that make loudest exclamations on this article ought to be silent since had exemplar justice been his majestys employment from his first landing we should have no reason to have said it was a bloodless revolution nor they perhaps have been alive to complain   for the reasons aforesaid his majesty often said it was a mootpoint in war whether they had broke orders or no and though i have the honor to know that his majesty exceedingly resented the manner yet it did not appear at all that they had laid themselves open to military justice in it or so much as given ground to call them to account before a council of war   as to national or civil justice the memory of the king can never be reflected upon in that unless some persons had pursued them at law obtained sentence against them and his majesty had protected them from the prosecution or execution of such sentences  thus far i think the king himself is entirely clear of this matter who else may have been guilty and how either of breaking orders going beyond them on niceties and executing them with barbarities i have no occasion to enter upon here i shall be far from defending such things and i am sure his majesty was far from approving it  but this is more completely answered by putting the world in mind that his majesty did refer the prosecution of that affair wholly to the parliament as more particularly appears by the parliaments address of thanks to his majesty for so doing  and that in their prosecution they found no room for legal process except against the officer who executed the orders in a manner so barbarous which officer fled from justice and was proscribed for not compearing  so that here was no legal process interrupted but all was frankly remitted by his majesty to the severest methods of justice which if it would not reach the persons concerned it is very hard the slander should reach the king  it might be said here you have no occasion to defend the kings memory in this case since the parliament of scotland cleared his majesty by their unanimous vote of    th of june viz that his majestys instructions contained no warrant for the execution of the glenco men  i shall only note that it is true the parliament past such a vote and it is as true the king resented very ill their usage of him as he had great reason to do frequently repeating that he thanked the parliament of scotland they had used him better than england had done his grandfather for they had tried him for his life and brought him in not gvilty i must confess it was very unaccountable the house should pass such a vote upon their sovereign whom no man had had the impudence to own a reflection upon in the case though they did it clandestinely and it had much better have become them to have searched after and punished those that slandered the king on that account  but the reproaching the king and those employed by him and who under him gave orders in it had its party uses what end it answered at that time is very well known and would make a very good history to the reproach of some pretenders to revolution principles but i choose to bury these things in silence neither are they any part of this design  i have assigned this as a second ground of national animosity not that it was acted by any of the english nation but as the gentlemen who improved it turned it all against the king it was still furnishing matter of railry against the revolution and succession which both turned upon one point and was now supported and pusht on in scotland by the interest and influence of the english court  i have digrest upon the subject on no other ground than to clear up the reproaches which envy would fain fix on the king and his memory which i think not at all accountable for it    the next general head on which our national discontents have been revived and indeed which has been strangely issued has been the succession of the crown  this has a long chain of derivations to fetch it from but i will contract them into as small a compass as i can  the original of the whole debate is to be placed if we will do justice in his late majestys sincere and constant care for the peace and security of these kingdoms  the king had seen the prospects of an union fly like a remote shadow as it were out of ken and finding reason to lay aside the thoughts of that blessed conjunction he found the next step needful was to preserve the public peace and hand down our liberties to posterity under the same security he had so happily fixed them in in order to this his majesty began to set himself seriously to work to settle the succession of the crown in the protestant line  before i enter into this large field i must take one opportunity more to exalt the memory of the king and put these nations in mind of the care that prince took abstracted from his own interest to settle both the liberties and religion of this island in spite of all the ill treatment he met with here  upon the revolution a great deal of clamor and reproach had been levelled at the king as if he pursued his own interest in the taking the crown of england though i must acknowledge i am at a loss to find out what he gained by it though i have had opportunities to know something of his majestys affairs but sure no body could charge his majesty with having an eye to his interest in what should happen after his death he could have nothing to propose to himself beyond the grave it could be of no moment to him who should enjoy the crown after him since he had no children of his own nor could he expect the succession should come to any branch of his family  covetousness and ambition may guide princes in their pursuit of honors and possessions to themselves and their families but when a prince has no family no relations that can enjoy after him it can not be rational to talk of ambition or interest in that case  his majestys memory is therefore untainted and even the enemies of his fame are defeated here for the very pretense fails them his anxiety for the settlement of the succession could savor of nothing but a mere concern and respect for the interest safety and liberty of the country and let any man give any other rational account of it if he can but this is by the way  in pursuit of this original design his majesty laid the groundplot of the succession to the house of hannover went himself to hannover and thence to zell to concert the measures of it on that side mastered some difficulties there too and then proposed it to the english parliament  how it passed in the english nation what opposition was made to it there and by whom what subsequent laws were made to strengthen and support it is not much to the present purpose to examine histories are full of the particular circumstances and no body that knows any thing of what past in those times can be ignorant of it  it remained only to make the same provision for scotland and the king began to turn his eyes thither when he was taken off by death and queen anne succeeded not to his crown only but to the same care and concern for the public peace and for the settlement of the nations by securing the succession of the crown  but to look into scotland a little the scots received the proposal of the succession with more coldness and diffidence than was expected and the heats occasioned by the debates on both sides were extraordinary the opposition made to the continuation of their united state in a successor had a specious and most unanswerable pretense to be made for it though it was made use of by two sorts of people with a quite different prospect  the scots had been very sensible of the visible decay of trade wealth and inhabitants in their country even from the first giving away their kings to the english succession and as the sinking condition of their nation was plainly owing to the loss of their court concourse of people the disadvantages of trade and the influence the english had over their kings so it was as plain there was no way to recover themselves but either better terms of union and alliance or a returning back to their separate selfexisting state  the most confidering and disinterested people reflected back upon their easy complying with the english and joining with the revolution without any conditions made for themselves with england as a nation and plainy said if they had demanded better terms they might have had them since their joining at that time was a thing of such consequence and upon which so much did depend that england could not have denied them and what they had to ask was so reasonable that nothing in reason could have been objected  the people who were of this opinion being some of them at the same time as far from embarking in the wrong interest moved strenuously for a treaty with england to ascertain the conditions chiefly respecting commerce on which they were willing to settle the crown but were unanimously for refusing to settle it at all but with such a treaty  as these gentlemen insisted upon a treaty with england in case they settled the succession with them so they considered in the next place of limitations both in case of failing of such treaty or in case of its being concluded in order to preserve the liberties of the people and to assert the right and power of parliaments and one of these limitations was that in case the treaty did not succeed then in the settling the crown it was provided the successor should not be king or queen of england  and yet i confess it seems plain to me the design of these people was not against having the succession settled even in conjunction with england as it now is and their general behavior since confirms this opinion besides the general character of the men themselves but their design appeared plainly to bring england over to such terms in matters of commerce as really it appeared scotland wanted and as england ought to grant  it is true a party joined in this that were against any conjunction at all that were against any succession but that of king james and whose real design was against the general correspondence of the nations and both sides had people among them who made use of these things further and further to divide the nation  nor did they fail of success for this was taken very hainously in england especially by the ignorant kind of people and they began in england to treat the scots very coursely the writers of the age began to discuss the separate sovereignties and exalt the titles of either side  in england one doctor drake writes a preface to an abridgement of the scots history wherein speaking something reflecting upon the freedom and independency of scotland the scots parliament caused it to be burnt by the hangman at edinburgh another english author writes of the absolute dominion of the english crown over the crown of scotland but he received the just punishment of being little regarded another writes of the easiness of reducing scotland by arms  against these mr anderson hodges and others write of the antiquity freedom and independency of scotland asserting it in the face of the world for which books the parliament rewarded them publicly  thus on both sides the case stood between the nations a pen and ink war made a daily noise in either kingdom and this served to exasperate the people in such a manner one against another that never have two nations run upon one another in such a manner and come off without blows  the heats on both sides being thus strangely blown up and the people of either kingdom beginning to run into excesses  just in this juncture as if the nature and necessity of the thing had driven both nations to it the queen proposes to the respective parliaments a treaty of union to be begun between the two kingdoms this was in the year   0  the wellwishers to the nations peace earnestly longed for this union on both sides but i cannot say that they had equal expectations of it as times then went  it was the first year of her majestys reign and the administration of things being then in hands in both kingdoms which her majesty afterward thought fit to change there is not so much wonder why this treaty came to nothing  there had been obstructions to the design in scotland where things were yet carried with more jealousy of the english court than afterward they saw reason to do this occasioned a protest from one sort of gentlemen against the queens naming the commissioners to treat  but even the very gentlemen who protested thought fit afterward to come in to the union as it was proposed and had no small influence in the success of it  the success of the union no doubt depended upon the choice of the persons appointed to treat and this depended very much on the representation of the ministry in either nation to the queen as to the ministry in scotland i shall say nothing the gentlemen nominated there might perhaps have come into measures for a treaty well enough most of the former treaters being the same as afterward finished it  but the design of the ministry in england seemed to act upon measures not so consistent with the true intent and meaning of the treaty as could have been wished  again the jealousness on both sides about church affairs in respect to the union were the ground of such difficulties as no body could surmount and lay as a secret mine with which that party who designed to keep the nation divided were sure to blow it up at last and therefore knew that all they did till that point was discust signified nothing and that when ever they pleased to put an end to it they had an immediate opportunity  without therefore entering upon such just reflections as i might very well be allowed to make upon the several persons and parts acting and acted in that i had almost said sham treaty i may place the whole miscarriages of it very justly upon this one particular viz that the affairs of religion were left to the absolute determination and appointment of the treaters and this might have instructed any body that this treaty would come to nothing since it was morally impracticable that the nice article of religion as it particularly then stood between the two churches could have been settled to the mutual satisfaction of both kingdoms by a commission in which there was not one person deputed or named by the church or instructed by them to enter upon the several articles of a treaty on either hand  i know it has been said and perhaps there may have been some truth in it that the article of religion was to have lien passive and dormant and neither side was to have concerned themselves about it by which some would have had it understood that either side was to remain in the condition they were then in  and that this was the meaning of the words of a certain person who when he was askt what care was taken of the church in that treaty replied for gods sake let us have no more of that jargon  i confess it is a charitable construction of the words to say the author only meant that things should be left to stand as they were and the treaters should have no other concern about it  but i presume those people hardly considered that then the establishment of either church had been left entirely to the future disposition of a british parliament who whenever they were governed by a majority on this or that side might have overwhelmed entirely the scots settlement and erected episcopacy upon them or vice versa with the church of england and i presume neither church would have thought themselves safe upon such a foundation i am sure they would not have had reason to have thought so  such a precarious union must needs have begot future convulsions in both kingdoms and if we may judge by what has happned since the treaters would have met with but very ordinary reception in scotland when they came home and the abandoning the church to the mercy of the parliament which was in effect giving her up to the church of england would certainly have inflamed the whole country  it is therefore the much kinder reflection to say these gentlemen never designed any union at all since to suppose the other would be to suggest that they designed to give up their native country to a bondage in matters religious which they knew was intolerable to their country and to lead them by the hand to an inevitable breach between the nations  for this reason i say that treaty was never sincerely designed if it was it must reflect either upon the understandings or upon the integrity of the persons concerned  however as i am here upon matters of history and collecting together all that has been done with relation to uniting the kingdoms as well what was abortive as what came to perfection i think this work cannot be complete without giving you the minutes of this treaty also as far as it proceeded  but because i would not interrupt the thread of history i have adjourned it to the appendix where you have it at large as i received it from the hand of a person of honor and undoubted integrity who was one of the commissioners to that treaty and wrote it down with his own hand the minutes are marked in the appendix n     upon the breaking up of this treaty three things happned to the further widening the unhappy breaches between the nations which however they discovered the furious temper of a party of men in both kingdoms ready and forward to inflame us and involve both nations in blood yet their evil design had this happy issue that it brought the nations to the grisis which inevitably brought on the great treaty it put us all into such a condition that nothing but a treaty for a nearer union or a bloody and irreconcilable rupture could be the consequence  and this i take to be a moving argument which in the judgment of the ministry made the treaty of union absolutely necessary and thus the greatest good came out of the greatest designed evil  the first of these was the affair of captain green and the ship worcester about the an english ship called the worcester of london captain thomas green commander homewardbound from the east indies put into scotland whether by contrary winds or for convoy or on what other occasion is not to the purpose  the african company there having a ship formerly seized by the east india company in london as she was fitting out in the river of thames and for which they had in vain solicited restitution they obtain of the government a power to seize and stop this ship by way of reprisal  accordingly the ship was seized on and brought into bruntisland and some time passed while the ship lay under such circumstances  during this time some of the ships crew whether in their drink or otherwise let fall some words implying that they had been pirating and particularly some very suspicious discourses intimating that there had been blood in the case  this prompted further enquiries and at last a plain and particular information was procured that this captain green with this ship worcester had met with a scots ship commanded by one drummond in the east indies had made prize of the ship and murdered drummond and all his crew  these suspicious and dark speeches were so taken hold of and tract that at last it came upon the stage and brought green and his ships crew into the course of public justice and after a very long trial they were found guilty of piracy robbery and murder and particularly the captain and five more were condemned to dye for it and the captain with two more were accordingly executed  it is not the work of this book to relate that story at its full length but i can not pass it here without a short abridgement of the proceedings because as scotland lies under much scandal on this account which as to the methods of public justice i think she does not deserve so the clearing up that point and the relation it has to the present subject i am upon i think will come out hand in hand and for that reason i engage in it  some of greens men either in their anger or their cups or both having let fall words that rendered him very much suspected of having been guilty of great villainies they were further watched in their discourse by some that had taken hold of their words particularly two negroes one haines and another who it seems being disgusted at the captain frequently let fall such expressions as gave the hearers reason to suspect there had been great villainies among them these speeches are all to be seen in the depositions of the witnesses too long to repeat here and particularly in the printed trial to which i refer  i shall not take upon me here either to condemn or acquit either side i know the world is divided on the subject some will have green and his crew to be guilty of all that is charged on them others say the company carried all against them that they might have a good pretense for confiscating the ship but be that as it will it is most certain the folly and imprudence of the men hanged them to say no more  from a little to more from dark expressions they fell to downright quarrelling and calling one another names which there seems to be good reason to believe might in part be true on both sides for some of them however innocent of this matter had been it seems guilty of wickednesses of other sorts black enough  this folly of theirs came at last to such a hight that it could be no longer concealed for it became the public discourse that they had been guilty not of murder and piracy only but of uncommon barbarities and not that only but that it was particularly on a scots ship and scots men viz captain drummond as aforesaid  at length it was brought to the ears of the government and as the public justice of all nations is obliged to take cognizance of such horrid things as were here suggested the fellows were examined and they frankly confessing green and five of his men were taken up the positive evidence were only two negroes but others so corroborated what they said and circumstances concurring to make almost every body believe the fact at least in that hurry they were upon a long hearing severally found guilty of piracy and murder  there are sometimes such crisis such junctures in matters when all things shall concur to possess not a man but even a nation with a belief of what at another time they would not believe even upon the same evidence and in this man seems acted by a kind of supernatural influence as if invisibly directed to bring to pass some particular thing pointed out by providence to be done for reasons of his own and known only to his inscrutable wisdom  just such a case this seemed to be the circumstances of green and his crew were very unhappy for them their being put into scotland where they had no manner of business no distress to force them in their being seized by the company the mens falling out among themselves and being the open instruments of detecting what no one ever could have charged them with their staying there when they might have gone and had no more business there from whence some allege they had no power to depart these and more concurring circumstances which were observed by the most curious and some of which were noted upon the trial seemed to jump together so visibly that all people seemed to acknowledge a wonderful and invisible hand in it directing and pointing out the detecting some horrible crime which vengeance suffered not to go unpunished  nor was this the sense of a few but generally speaking of the whole nation i mean of considering people and such as usually notice such things and particularly of many of those who cried out loudest of the matter when it was too late to apply any remedy in which i cannot but think they act unkindly to their country and indeed very unjustly since when the conviction of such circumstances was on the minds of the people it is no wonder the men were found guilty by the jury and i persuade my self they themselves would have done the same  on their being found guilty they were not immediately executed but several applications were made to england for their reprive the council of scotland reprived them for some days and as some people began then to object that the evidence was but too slight and that there was but one witness to matter of fact and that the one witness was but a negroe that he was not capable of the impressions of the solemnity of an oath that there was malice in it and the like on these and other considerations the government was so tender of the blood of the men that some have thought they had not died but for the rage of the common people who hearing that they were further to be reprived got together in an unusual multitude on the day appointed for their execution crying out for justice  and this part of the story is the occasion of my relating so much of it since the tendency it had to inflame the nations one against another began here  on the day appointed for execution the privy council was set and the magistrates of edinburgh were called to assist  where the point was debated whether the condemned persons should be executed or no i will not say the rabble influenced the council in their determinations that way  but this is certain that the discontent of the common people was very well known and that they were furiously bent upon some violent methods was very much feared  that a vast concourse of people was gathered at that instant in the parliament closs at the cross at the prison and throughout the whole city that they publicly threatened the magistrates and even the council it self in case they were not brought out that day and some talked of pulling down the tolbooth which if they had attempted they would have sacrificed them in a way more like that of de wit than an execution of justice  however it was the council determined the matter that three of them viz the captain thomas green john mather and james simpson who were thought to be principals in the murder should be put to death that day  when the magistrates of edinburgh came out they assured the people that they were ordered to be executed and that if they would have a little patience they would see them brought out and this pacified them for the present  soon after the council breaking up my lord chancellor came out and driving down the street in his coach as he past by the cross some body said aloud the magistrates had but cheated them and that the council had reprivd the criminals  this running like wildfire was spread in a moment among the people immediately they ran in a fury down the street after the chancellor stopped his coach just at the tronechurch broke the glasses abused his servants and forced him out of the coach some friends that were concerned for the hazard he was in got him into a house so that he had no personal hurt twas in vain for his lordship to protest to them that the men were ordered to be executed they were then past hearing of any thing the whole town was in an uproar and not the mob of the city but even from all the adjacent country was come together nothing but the blood of the prisoners could appease them and had not the execution followed immediately it cannot be expressed what mischief might have happened  at last the prisoners were brought out and led through the streets down to leith the place of execution being by the laws appointed there for crimes committed upon the sea  the fury and rage of the people was such that it is not to be expressed and hardly did they suffer them to pass or keep their hands off from them as they went but throw a thousand insults taunts and revilings they were at last brought to the gibbet erected at the seamark and there hanged  nor can i forget to note that no sooner was the sacrifice made and the men dead but even the same rabble so fickle is the multitude exclaimed at their own madness and openly regrated what they had done and were ready to tear one another to pieces for the excess  this was not acted there with more fury than it was with the outmost indignation resented in england  still i am to be understood of the common people for the government of neither side had any resentment or dispute all things having been carried on by legal methods process and trial according to the form of law and usage of the country  but here was new matter for the enemies of both nations to work upon and too much fuel was thrown into the fire of national contention on both sides  in scotland it was said the court of england would protect them and they would be pardoned only because they were scots men that were murdered and the like  in england it was said the rabble had cried out to hang them because they were englishmen that they had said they wished they could hang the whole nation so and that they insulted them as they went to execution with the name of english dogs etc  never was such an unfortunate circumstance to exasperate the common people on both sides and to fill them with irreconcilable aversions that might prepare them for blood and if in england it had gone a little higher it would not have been safe for a scots man to have walked the street  certain it is that tho the men had been innocent for that was now alleged yet as they were condemned by a due course of law tried and executed by the common form of justice in that country and in the same manner by which their own subjects were tried and executed the fault must ly in the witnesses and the jury that believed them but there could be no pretense to make it a national quarrel at all  that in england it had been but too frequent to try and condemn innocent men and that if evidences swore the fact it might be the misfortune of any innocent man to fall under such a disaster the crime lay in the villainy and perjury of witnesses but the nation could not be quarrelled on that account  but still these things left a corroded mass of ill blood in the minds of the people on either side and as improved by the malicious fomenters of our divisions they were very unhappy at that time  to exasperate the people yet more it was reported that captain drummond was yet living that neither he nor any of his men was ever touched by green or his crew and some seamen who landed in england made affidavit directly contrary to the evidence that hanged them  i shall no further enter into the merits of the case than serves to the matter of national heats  the thing was generally thought to be a hasty execution but the argument that it ought to be no ground of a national quarrel prevailed in england and the rest of the prisoners in scotland were reprived from time to time and at last let go  in both these cases the mischiefs of tumult and rabbles is to be observed and how easy it is to set nations on a flame by the violent fomenting the passions and humors of the people and how much those sort of men are to be detested who blow the coals of strife and dissension in a nation prompt the fury of an enraged multitude to fly in one another faces and insult the laws and governments of both countries at once  the end of this account is to make out what i at first noted concerning the causes which wrought these two nations up to such a necessity of a union that either it must have been a union or a war the animosities on both sides being raised to such a pitch that they could no longer have remained in the usual medium of peace  nor was this unhappy story the least cause of the growing aversion between us which was now come to a very great hight  the second head to which i ascribe the growing alienation between these two kingdoms was the act of security in scotland  this act made a great noise in the world and was magnified in england to such a hight that it was looked upon as in effect a declaration of war to commence at the queens demise and however designed was effectually made so by what after happened  the marquess of tweeddale was high commissioner to this parliament a person of extraordinary temper candor and modesty  the matter of the succession had in the preceding parliament been rejected on this supposition that it was not prudent for scotland to join with england except such conditions of commerce and navigation were first obtained by treaty with england as were just and honorable for scotland and abundance of honest gentlemen who were far enough from so much as being suspected of favoring the jacobite interest joined together in this demand they were willing to come into the succession provided they had such and such conditions as they thought were reasonable to be insisted on in behalf of scotland among which the liberty and freedom of trade to the english plantations was one   there were many very learned debates in the preceding parliament upon this head great and popular speeches made on the subject  and the act of security was offered and voted but could not then be past for things began to run high in the parliament which occasioned a recess  this was taken in england in a most heinous manner and nothing was now talked of there but the scots buying arms and ammunition training and exercising their men and mighty things were suggested in england which the scots might do and sometimes which they would do the printed news papers gave a most formidable journal of the duke of athole drawing out his highlanders encamping three days with seven thousand men how armed how well officerd and the like another paper told the world of sixty thousand men in scotland armed and trained and ready to take the field  however absurd these things were and that wiser men who knew the state of scotland saw there was nothing in it but what every nation in the world would have done in the like case that it was neither more nor less than arming their militia and putting them into some order which for several years past had been entirely neglected yet i say however absurd the suggestions were they were improved in england to all manner of extremes and some most ridiculous excesses were run into both public and private  it is no doubt but as scotland was acknowledged to be independent whatever the forward pens of our politicians would have pretended yet i say being acknowledged independent even by the english parliament it was a very material thing to have her concur in establishing the succession of the crown on the same person as england had done  two things moved in this affair on the english side   some would not have it done at all and therefore were for irritating the english against the scots that it might come to a rupture in stead of a settlement and this by putting it upon scotland to declare without a previous treaty which they knew would never be accepted   others would gladly have had the scots come into the succession but were willing to have them do it without any conditions thinking that scotland ought still be kept low for fear of their principles which lead them to be no friends to the english church establishment   both these cried out and exclaimed at this act of security and represented it to the world as if the scots were going actually to separate from england  there was one clause in the act of security which entirely excluded the successor to the crown from governing both kingdoms together  this the enemies of scotland presently represented in england as a design to restore king james and a great many honest people were brought in to believe that the scots even the presbyterians themselves were so alienated from england and so obstinately bent against joining with her on any account that they would never again be under the same head nay that they would rather league themselves with france and restore king james than come to any terms with her and this was as it were confirmed when the scots subsequent to these things passed an act for trading with france though as their circumstances then stood it was very necessary to them  nor was this run to any thing less in england and they began to talk loudly there of forcing the scots to the succession but this was by such as either coveted a breach between the two nations upon any terms or really did not understand what they said the latter appeared by their printing some pieces to prove the right of the house of hannover to the crown by succession a thing all people that kno any thing of the affairs of europe kno it was the foundation upon which the present establishment pretends to be built  but on that much safer and much more divine right of the english constitution and scots also i mean parliamentary limitation  things ran very high now in both nations the measures taken in scotland seemed to be very well grounded and their aim well taken for either england must comply with scotland as to such treaties as were reasonable or else she might have the satisfaction to see clearly scotland by this act was placed in an entire separate state from her who she would join with what prince she would bring in where she would bestow her crown was not to the purpose two things she had made plain   that she was resolved to have it wholly in her own hands to bestow as she thought fit   that wherever the english crown was bestowed the scots crown should not without conditions be obtained   this effectually settled and declared the independency of scotland and put her into a posture fit to be treated with either by england or by any other nation  nor did the apprehensions which this gave the world of the scots designing to restore king james do her any disservice for though nothing is more certain than that the jacobites as they are called conceived great hopes from these things and flattered themselves exceedingly that the return of their king as they called him would be the effect of all these breaches and therefore fell in heartily with all these things and as far as possible carried on the aversion to a settlement with england yet it is as certain that the gentlemen who mainly carried on this project had no more eye that way than to the great turk but were sincerely bent to the prosperity of their country and the establishment both religious and civil as fully appeared afterward by their heartily pursuing the treaty that followed  the drift of the whole matter was the bringing england to terms bringing the english nation to a treaty and though it is confessed that the prospect was remote and melancholy england at the time being averse to any such thing yet as these gentlemen saw there was no other way to redeem scotland from the discouragement she then lay under with respect to the absence of her court the dependence of her gentry and nobility the limitations and restrictions of trade which by the act of navigation she was fettered with and several disadvantages her present conjunction which was made without any treaty laid her under  and therefore they stood strictly and resolutely to their measures and the more the court in england pusht at her joining in the settlement and used all possible means to bring it to pass the more averse they appeared and the farther they went off from it  thus i say this act of security being only attempted in the first session of parliament was perfected in the next and every day further and further advances were made seemingly to an entire and lasting separation of the kingdoms from one another  there were other steps made to this on both sides as to matters of trade as shall appear immediately  england who was all this while under a very unhappy conduct and acted upon quite different foundations from what we have seen her happily brought over to since took the worst measures upon the scots proceedings then that ever a wise people could have taken for the english parliament sitting soon after viz   0  the scots act of security came to be considered and however influenct by a precipitant party god only knows they past an act in my opinion the most impolitick i had almost said unjust that ever past that great assembly  this was that act of parliament entitled an act to prevent the mischiefs arising to england from the act of security in scotland in which they in a manner declared open war with scotland unless by the   th of december the next year they should settle the crown in the same person as now settled in england  for they appointed    men of war to be fitted out to prevent the scots trading with france declared the scots in england aliens and several other articles as in the act it self may more at large appear  this was done in that famous parliament called the tacking parliament and it was the less to be wondered at because which is the subject i am at present upon the heats between the nations which were at this time improved by the parties on both sides were risen to a very great hight all things tended to exasperations and provocations no man of temper seemed to show himself on either hand and those who bore the least regard to the general good of both kingdoms foresaw nothing but an unavoidable war between us and indeed had matters stood thus but a very little longer it had been impossible to have avoided it and that in a most unseasonable time for europe which was then engaged in the most furious and most critical juncture of the war with france being the year before the battle at blenheim  thus the party in scotland who had laid their scheme in hopes that england would have come into measures for the general good saw themselves disappointed and though its true that had england then seen with the eyes of her national understanding and had she not been ridden by a party who openly pursued the ruin of her very constitution i mean as established on the revolution principle i say had she not been under that unhappy influence she had taken other measures yet as it was nothing was to be expected  however the gentlemen in scotland happily resolved to wait for the issue of things and firmly adhered to their new scheme scotland began to be talked up in the world a little and these very enemies who as they thought wounded her by talking up the mighty formidable things this act of security might produce really raised her reputation nothing was more absurd than their allarming england at the chimeras of their own heads such as scotlands buying  0000 stand of arms in holland laying in  0000 barrels of powder arming  0000 men and the like all which in reality was nothing at all but mustering their traindbands as they call them in england and buying about  00 barrels of powder for the castle of edinburgh in their allarming england i say at these mighty things they really raised the reputation of scotland in the world and made her begin to make a different figure in the eyes of other nations and there is no doubt had things gone on to a rupture as wicked men on both sides wished and good men began to fear scotland might have found some powerful princes willing to have accepted her crown and to have in the mean time supported supplied and encouraged her to stand upon her own feet  but i will do the gentlemen who managed this affair this justice that i believe they had it not at all in their design to fly to the protection of any foreign power no not to any protestant power in europe unless forced to it by the precipitant measures england was then in all probability going into and if they had done it then i can not see how they could have been blamed  but as to the present state of things the gentlemen who managed this part seemed to me always to aim at obliging england to give them good terms and to put themselves in such a posture in the world as should make england see it was worth their while to do so as well as that they ought to do so and this was so just a step and the aim so well taken as by the consequence appeared that i think it is the greatest panegyric that can be made on those gentlemen to say they brought to pass by it all the great things which god in his providence has thought fit to do toward our peace and happiness in this island  if they did not design this or had not this honest aim in view they less deserve the praise but it is evident providence made their measures instrumental to bring it to pass  thus stood the affairs of this island at the end of the year   0  when the aversions between the two kingdoms by the several steps i have noticed was come to a great hight the people seemed exasperated against one another to the highest degree the governments seemed bent to act counter to one another in all their councils trade clasht between them in all its circumstances and every parliament run further and further into the most disobliging things that could be england laid a new impost upon scots cloth scotland prohibited all the english woollen manufacture in general and erected manufacturies among themselves which had they been prudently managed too might have been very advantageous to them but of that by the way scotland freely and openly exported their wool to france germany and sweden to the irreparable loss of the english manufactures having great quantities of english wool brought into scotland over the borders which it was impossible for england to prevent so that the famous trade for wool to france by rumney marsh commonly called owling was entirely dropped and france not supplied only but glutted with wool  on the other hand england was proceeding to prohibit the importation of scots cattle and to interrupt by force their trade with france and had this last proceeded to practice all the world could not have prevented a war between both nations  but more prudent counsels prevailed and gods providence unravelled all these schemes of destruction which mad men had drawn for the ruin of their native country and as many times things evil in their design are overruled by an invisible hand and bring to pass that very good which they were prepared to destroy even so it was here for these confusions were the very things that brought both the nations to their senses i mean brought them both to better temper  the consequences of a bloody war just breaking out in the bowels of their native country in the ruin and certain desolation of which they must necessarily have a great share opened the eyes of the most thinking people on both sides even of those who in themselves had no real inclination to the conjunction of the kingdoms and thus the necessity of taking new measures began to appear both ways  in england the weight of the present war which every day rather increased than decreased in scotland their declining condition and disunited circumstances in england the matter of security in scotland the prospect of advantage all concurred to sway the inclinations of wisemen to heal these breaches  i have now shown by what steps these two nations were brought to the very brink of mutual destruction and the sequel of the story will tell any body who were the parties that prompted both nations to these unhappy extremes i shall in the next place a little examine how all this tide of mischief and folly turned and how they began to come to themselves in both kingdoms and this will so naturally lead us to the history of the union that i can not think of a more proper introduction  the party in england who had the reins of the administration in their hands had given other testimonies than this of their precipitant measures and as they had made not this nation only uneasy but their own too so as things generally take new turns when they come to extremes the english nation began to be alarmed at the proceedings as tending to the subversion of all the fabric of government erected by the revolution  the occasion of all this is too long to relate here and the history of the tacking the occasionalbill to the moneybill in that parliament in england is too well known to need any recital it is enough to say here that pushing at such hot measures in england as is usual in all precipitations like an ax struck upon a hard stone the blow rebounded and the weapon flew out of the hand of the unskilful workman  the project failed the party overthrew themselves and never recovered  the queen far from approving the extravagancies they were running things to and awakned by the danger of her peoples liberties which were as dear to her self as to them finding to what mischiefs these warm gentlemen were leading her and being by the goodness of her disposition as well as experience in the english affairs particularly averse to things hard or severe upon her people much more so to all manner of illegal severities  put a full stop to this career of mischief  and though indeed they had brought things to the very edge of destruction both in england on their own business as well as in the affairs of the two kingdoms yet the queen immediately shifting hands and applying with her usual wisdom to the establishing the minds of her people retrivd this whole affair restored england to the tranquillity so much desired filled up her ministry and all offices of trust with men of the same candor and moderation with her self openly abandoned and discouraged the measures of those people who had run things to such excesses and resettled the minds of her people distracted with apprehensions of ruin and partyconfusion  thus the ministry in england was entirely changed the lord keeper sir nathan wright deposed sir edward seymour comptroller of the household put out of her family the earl of nottinghame secretary of state and several others laid aside the props of the highflying party as they were called were left out of the council and removed from their places in the government  in the several countries the peoples approbation of her majestys proceedings and their joy at this change of instruments was testified by the universal contempt put upon the affair of the tacking and of the occasionalbill as well as of all hot men and hotmeasures and this testified by the change in their elections of parliament men a new parliament being then to be chosen in which so general an aversion to the occasionalbill or any thing invading the toleration and particularly to the affair of the tack appeared that in spite of all oppositions a great number of the tacking members were thrown out and such a change of men appeared in the next parliament that whereas in the other parliament the highparty had a majority of sixty two or there about for every thing they joined in on the first trial of the strength of the house which was perhaps the greatest that has been known of late years it appeared the whigparty had the majority by above seventy voices and these by the turning out severals on the trials of elections and other circumstances rose up to be above a hundred though after they seemed to lose some ground again but it did not last  things being thus happily turned in england and the first step for the establishing and settling this new party in their seats of management taken it was wonderful to see the change it made in all the affairs of the nation how every thing succeeded unheard of victories abroad unusual cheerfulness at home and a new face of prosperity seemed to guild the affairs of the nation the feuds of parties died in every place peace union and temper began to be the companion of every society and the ancient animosities between neighbor and neighbor between friend and friend which formerly crept not into society only but even into our families and our very beds declined a pace the queen encouraged peace and love and unity among her people and pressed the nation to it upon all occasions and all good men began to encourage it by their examples  in this general felicity of affairs in england scotland came into remembrance her majesty as having an equal regard to the good of all her subjects and as being justly concerned not for the change of the temper and condition of her people only but for the continuance of it to them in ages to come could not but be solicitous for the removing the obstructions which lay in the way on either side  when the wisest heads in both nations had been consulted with on this article though opinions differed yet no medium could ever be found so effectual to secure this peace and remove all possibility of a fracture like renewing the treaty of union  and thus i am brought down to the general article of the treaty by the mere thread of the story the feuds of parties the folly of statesmen the fury of rabbles and the general reviving of the old animosities between the people had been screwed up to a dangerous hight as is noted already by that very party who had on all occasions shown themselves enemies to the present establishment and future peace even of both nations and by this method they thought they had rendered the succession to both crowns impracticable for the house of hannover and secured an inevitable rupture between the nations when ever it should please god to remove her majesty out of this world  but great are the wonders of inscrutable providence these very schemes contrived in the deeps of infernal malice brooded on by that party who ever envied the liberty of protestants and the tranquillity as well as privileges enjoyed by the people of this whole island and hatched by the warm influence of a reigning party by which they flattered themselves they had effectually overthrown the project of a union of the kingdoms made their coalition impossible and all schemes projected for it impracticable i say these very things made way for that same union they were calculated to destroy  the hight those measures i have been speaking of was brought to made as it were a force upon both nations to come to this treaty  it was now but a few months to come when the nations must directly fall out english men of war must be fitted out to cruise upon the scots and we that consented or at least did not scruple to have the dutch carry on a free trade with france must go and fight with our own brethren for it  whereas had we been in our trading senses we would have done it our selves  the crisis things were come to now was such that they could no longer stand at a stay but we must fall out with the scots or unite with them all methods to bring them to settle the succession without a treaty had been in vain used by the party before who would gladly have tricked them into it but the scots were too wise to fall into that snare  the present ministry were for fairer dealings with them at the same time wisely concluding that to gain of the scots what they ought to grant it was reasonable to grant to the scots what they ought to have  and that a treaty with them might be made effectual the only way was to set about it upon an honest foot and then pursue it sincerely and not upon sharping and tricking on either side as before  but there yet seemed to ly one invincible obstruction in the way of this treaty and that was the act of parliament passed in england the last session which as before noted had declared a kind of war against the scots in case they did not come into the succession by such a day and upon the first motion to a treaty the scots declared they could not enter into any treaty with england till that act was repealed  this had indeed a great deal of reason in it and such as could not be withstood for the honor of the scots seemed very much impaired in that act and that they could not come to a treaty upon equal terms while such a law stood in force upon them which seemed as if it had been a sword over their heads drawn to awe them into a treaty  the queen who was resolved if possible to bring this great event to pass and who strove to do it so as might give all her subjects satisfaction undertook to clear up this difficulty and at the next parliament which met in england october      0  in her speech to both houses recommended the taking away of this obstruction by repealing that act in order to introduce a treaty of union which her majesty saw now more clearly in view than ever before  i know there were strong struggles in england against repealing this act and that chiefly without doors the party foreseeing that if this step was taken in parliament the union which they really dreaded would of course come upon the stage to this end it was represented as dishonorable to make such an advance to the scots that it was an insulting of england to have the scots say they would not treat with her till such and such conditions were performed  that this was letting the scots prescribe preliminaries upon england and if england complied it would make them more encroaching  but the temper in the parliament was quite different from this it was plain there that the scots were in the right to ask this as a preliminary that the treaty would for ever be subject to this objection that it was not free but done under the terror or force of that act of parliament that as it was not honorable for the scots to have a treaty forced upon them under such circumstances so neither was it honorable for england to force a treaty upon them that the act was unreasonable in its own nature that england could have no pretense but mere violence to intermeddle with the scots commerce who were a free nation and ought to be at liberty to trade with any nation that they thought fit to trade with that their trade with france was done by their own act of parliament passed by the queen and was not inconsistent with or contraveening any treaty or contract with england that scotland was under no treaty of commerce or under no obligation to trade or not to trade as england did that as to the confederacy and the war in which they were embarkt with enggland that laid them under no obligation since the dutch were in the same confederacy and yet openly proclaimed a free trade with france nor did the english pretend to obstruct them in it that scotland was as independent of the english government as the dutch and ought to be at liberty to trade unmolested as well as they  these arguments backed with an administration of government now quite recovered from the tyrannical principles of those formerly in power soon influenct the parliament to repeal the act and take this step by way of advance to the scots by which they let the scots see they were in the hands of their friends that now they might expect fair dealings and had room to treat with freedom and honor  this was a great mortification to those gentlemen who had promoted that act who now together with their whole party set themselves with all their artifice to oppose the treaty in all its parts in both kingdoms to raise scruples imprint jealousies misrepresent persons and things embroil councils raise scandals and in short to do every manner of thing they could to embarrass and obstruct the treaty and in the first place to prejudice the minds of the common people against the union as such what fatal success they had how they carried it on even beyond the conclusion of the treaty with what difficulties it was encountered how begun how carried on how finished and how since assaulted and with difficulty enough preserved will be the subject of the ensuing sheets  of the last treaty properly called the union and first of the treaty in london i am now come to the great and capital treaty which has at last by the blessing of god been brought to a happy conclusion   i am not insensible that in the strange variety of circumstances changes of prospects the turns of management the accidents and niceties with which it has been carried on the infinite difficulties the zealous promoters of it met with the restless attacks of a strong party to disappoint it who never gave over their struggle no not even after it was done in this labyrinth of untrode paths i may easily misplace some things and omit others and i cannot but introduce my account of it with this caution that though i believe no man can have collected with more care nor has had the opportunity to remark things with more advantage having been eye witness to much of the general transaction and furnished by the best hands with every most secret affair in the carrying it on yet many minute things may have past my pen which it is impossible for me to atone for but by making this proviso that the reader may be assured nothing material can have slipped me and i have used all necessary caution to furnish my self with the whole truth of fact whatever omission of circumstances i may make an apology for  i have already related the issue of the treaty begun the first year of the queen and made my observations of the reason of its miscarriage it may be observed that her majesty understanding the true reasons of the disappointment which twas thought lay in the persons treating particularly on the english side whose disposition to finish it for the public good it was supposed did not appear at all to her satisfaction in which i have further already explained my self obtained a new act of parliament in england and the like in scotland impowering the queen to appoint commissioners on either hand to treat of an union between the two nations   and here it is necessary to observe how well the ground plot of this work was laid that all obstacles might be removed which might threaten it with another abortion it had been noted that the most dangerous rock of difference on which this union could split and which could now render it ineffectual was that of religion here it was certain they could never unite and the breach therefore being irreconcilable the best course that could be taken with it was to let it quite alone as a thing neither side should meddle with at all and consequently the jealousies and suspicious on both sides must vanish and the great obstructions which the enemies of the treaty relied on for its miscarriage were at once removed  this was a masterpiece of policy and showed that her majesty had other persons to consult with and had taken other measures than before and gave people very early impressions of the success which has since appeared  but there was yet some political difficulty to pass and here being to tread truth almost on the heels those readers that are willing to have it told plainest must excuse me for naming peoples names i have avoided on all occasions the mixing satyr and reflection in this relation as much as possible  the political difficulties i speak of here and which i think gave the greatest shock to this affair consist of two parts   succession   nobility   the vehemence with which the several parties who managed these topics acted their respective and exceedingly remote prospects and by what strange mystery concurring providence like the wheel within all their wheels centered them all in uniting the nations as it is a secret history few understood and may be as necessary as diverting so the heads of it may be viewed in the following scheme   the succession being the main thing that lay at the bottom of every ones project i shall first speak to the particulars of that there was a party in both kingdoms but most powerful in scotland whose design was principally and directly against the protestant succession as such these we must allow to be setting every wheel at work and acting with all their power and policy against every thing which looked that way     when they saw it convenient they acted against an union in its general term and frequently some of the less politic of that party let fall the excrescence of their principles in direct terms and pamphlets were wrote upon that scheme such as one showing the necessities of a war with england etc another showing the advantages of an union with other nations and france in particular others argued continually the mighty terms and the advantages of commerce scotland might obtain from france and not only proposed them as equivalent to the trade with england but run on to such weak extremes as to say that scotland made no advantage of her commerce with england  but these may well be said to be the less politic part of these gentlemen who were in the design above for they lost ground even against the union it self by it and when the committee of parliament appointed to examine the exports and imports reported that scotland exported to england above  00000 pounds sterling per annum in linen cattle etc the imports from thence appeared so small that the objectors dropped their arguments upon that head and learned to talk with more caution  but the more subtle managers of this design against the succession went on by different measures and with great policy they acted every party as far as they thought they could be brought in to be subservient to their design  thus first seeming to quit their direct opposition to the succession as a thing too open and too much clashing with the temper of the time they fall in with that party who were for the succession with limitations not that they would have concurred with the event had these limitations been never so great but that in their debating the limitations they might find room to clog the succession it self in such manner as the other party could by no means accept of it  from the same principle proceeded that famous resolve in their act of security by which the succession met with two invincible obstacles from whence they knew some time or other new disputes must arise   that no successor at all should be named till after the queen   that when it was named it should be with this limitation that it should not be the same that should succeed to the kingdom of england  this was a masterpiece of policy and had the most specious pretense in the world viz the hardships which scotland had suffered under the influence of england in matters of commerce and sovereignty and therefore it was added immediately upon the said clause unless that in this present session of parliament or any other session of this or any ensuing parliament there be such conditions of government settled and enacted as may secure the honor and sovereignty of this crown and kingdom the freedom frequency and power of parliament the religion liberty and trade of the nation from english or any foreign influence see the act of security printed in the appendix to this work no    the running things to this height in scotland put every parties measures to a full stop the gentlemen who were against the succession in general and of whom i am now treating had most effectually carried their point for as they presumed england could never come in to such a treaty as they demanded so they had effectually foreclosed the succession of hannover by determining that the successor of england and scotland should not be the same  and it is remarkable to note here how universally all those gentlemen whose aim was against the succession fell in with those whose design was only to have advantageous terms from england for it  but this very point gained brought about the main work and the contraries that concurred in this act though from clashing interests by the strange circulation of causes worked all together into another extreme which none of them designed and that was the union  upon the passing the act of security england grew very uneasy and not to mention the common apprehensions of the people nor how and by whom they were increased and fomented the act of parliament past entitled an act to prevent the dangers arising from the act of security in scotland etc is a demonstration of what the tendency of these things would be for this act which i have also for the better understanding of the story abridgd and printed in the appendix no   brought both nations under the necessity of a war by the christmas following the english being then obliged to fit out a fleet to interrupt the scots commerce if their act of security was not repealed  things being brought to this extremity the only remedy that those who wished well to both nations could contrive was to revive a treaty of union and set heartily about it  and the first step the queen took toward it was to propose it to the scots parliament who voted  that they could enter into no treaty of union till that act of parliament mentioned above was repealed in england  though this was a very bold resolve yet the queen who saw some reasonableness in it managed things with so much wisdom and moderation and the parliament who saw with differing eyes from the other and was of a quite differing temper found something so severe and so hard upon scotland in that act of parliament that they made no difficulty to make that step in advance to scotland  upon this foot turned the first appearance of the union now let us see how the parties managed themselves on all sides  the inclination on both sides to an union however afterward managed seemed so universal that the party i am speaking of thought it was not proper to appear against it directly but acting still under disguise they puzzle the cause first with the wild debate of a federal union or an union partial and imperfect  and thus they fell in with the party who were for the union not that they had the union in their design but because they thought the thing impracticable in it self that it would make the people sceptick in government and that so it would certainly miscarry and the succession would be lost that way  accordingly the limitations were by secret influence opposed and the scheme of succession laid aside to go upon the chimera of an union as they thought it to be and i could be very merry with some gentlemen here upon the banters and jests they always treated the scheme of an union with as a thing they little thought would ever be licked into any shape or ever obtain upon the nations to pass into a law  thus i have brought the remotest party who were downright enemies of the union to fall into it  from whence let their design be what it will i must tell them they did it this service that it made the union very popular however it came to be otherways afterward  i come next to the difficulty about nobility and this worked in to an union by as it were a natural consequence for the ancient nobility finding their sway with the people lessened and their power as well as their honor eclipsed by the crown daily creating numbers of what they called upstart lords were easily engaged in limitations to prevent their future monarchs increasing the numbers of their rank to the diminution as they took it of the ancient families  but when they came to consider the scheme of distinction made for the representing the nobility in a british parliament they were the more easily brought into the union as an effectual step to prevent the reducing their honor by multiplying their numbers and as a thing which would seem to distinguish them from such of the modern nobility which they reckoned already a burden to them  next among the whig interest and who were really honest in their designs for the general good were yet two parties  one party without reflection on any had taken a just umbrage at the growing power of a certain great man and as they had reason to ward off personal resentments in case their figure was diminished and having their true interest in view together with the public good esteemed it their good fortune to have them both stand upon one bottom  and these gentlemen came heartily and honestly into the measures of the union  another party were for the succession limited etc but not for the union these brought the former first to them thinking they would rather be for the succession and lay by the thoughts of the union but finding them entirely for the union they fell in together  the view of the court in england was plain viz for the succession at any rate and therefore till this juncture they had espoused that party in scotland who were for the succession though with limitations and this the more easily brought those gentlemen into the union since there they secured the succession and had the english limitations confirmed which they knew and acknowledged were better than their own  thus the two whig parties joined and the duke of queensberry who had in concert with her majesty and the english court removed all the seeming difficulties on the part of scotland appearing publicly for it the union as i have already noted grew very popular the court and the whig lords concurred in the general good the jacobite interest were abandoned and the union grew up between all the extremes as a consequence and it was merely formed by the nature of things rather than by the designs of the parties  things being brought to this pass the acts of parliament passed and the queen empowered to name commissioners i shall pursue the proceedings in order as they ly before me and make the needful observations as i go  the respective acts of parliament for this nomination as absolutely necessary to the better understanding of the case and laying a regular scheme of the whole matter before the eye of the reader i have annexed in the collection herewith marked  they that had so wisely contrived the beginning of this work could not be at a loss to find out proper persons for the managing the treaty in both kingdoms and therefore it was not long before her majesty named the commissioners for both kingdoms whose names we shall presently come to  i shall not descend to encomiums on the persons of the treaters for i am not about to write panegyricks here but an impartial and unbyast history of fact but since the gentlemen have been ill treated especially in scotland upon this very head charged with strange things and exposed in print by some who had nothing but their aversion to the treaty to move them to maletreat them i must be allowed on all occasions to do them justice in the process of this story  and as i must own that generally speaking they were persons of the greatest probity the best characters and the steadiest adherence to the true interest of their country so their abilities will appear in every step taken in so great a work the bringing it to so short a conclusion and that in so little time the reducing it to so concise a form and so fixing it that when all the obstruction imaginable was made to it afterward in the parliament of scotland the mountains of objection which at first amused the world proved such molehills were so easily removed raised so much noise and amounted to so little in substance that after all was granted that in reason could be demanded the amendments were so few and of so little weight that there was not one thing material enough to obtain a negative in the english parliament  i cannot but note here that even those amendments were not made by reason of any omission in the treaters but the parliament found the opposing party to the succession had two handles to lay hold on in scotland and therefore in prudence gave way to such amendments as they had the least reason to justify these two heads which i call handles against the succession were   strength of party by which they hoped to carry it at once and throw out the treaty brevi manu and this they endeavored to form upon a general dislike they having blackened it with the mark of a thing dishonorable to the sovereignty and the independence of the nation   if they found that would not do then to load it with such ridiculous amendments as they knew would cause it to miscarry in the english parliament which they also thought would give scotland great advantage and increase the animosities in scotland against the english when the rupture should appear to be from england and the most reasonable concessions of scotland be rejected by them   but both these projects failed them the first was effectually answered by the nature of the thing and their strength failing them they found they had cast up their account false their motion being thrown out by a great majority in voting the first article as will appear presently  the second when they came to examine particulars had not sufficient strength of reason to support it all the amendments they could pretend to were so small that as above the parliament of england never thought it worth their while to dispute them and the treaters themselves for the most part went into those amendments as they were offered  indeed this was a disappointment to some people who made no question at least to puzzle the cause and raise such difficulties as should require a remitting the treaty back to scotland and so spin it out in length that the nations might have leisure to form the separate parties into some order and raising their friends on both sides if possible bring it to a breach  and that i do not pass an unjust censure i refer the reader among infinite pamphlets published against this affair to one very plain and barefaced author mentioned before entitled the necessity of a war with england in order to cure the present distempers of the times  i should do the fomenters of the nations divisions too much credit to trouble the reader of this with any of their printed oratory against this union much less enter into any disquisitions upon the subject of their clamours  but i may perhaps touch upon the principal heads of their objections and let the world know also who were some of the objectors  when the acts were thus passed and her majesty had named commissioners on both sides and the work seemed to be going about in earnest the learned scriblers of the age began to harrass the world with their schemes and all the mountebank statesmen of the times set to work to propose their wondrous methods for curing this ancient distemper of the nations and striving to have it said of themselves who was forwardest in the great work  the industry they discovered had in nothing a greater concurrence than in this that the whole crowd of writers with an universal agreement had the honor to be entirely mistaken and not one of them had eyes to see to the true interest of the nations every man as in such cases is usual eyed the respective interests or advantages as he thought of the nation to which he belonged and set himself to work to answer the objections of the other defending arguing and fatiguing their own heads and their readers with the confused labyrinths of their own projects but not once touching the true string which with a national unison would have immediately sounded out the harmony of general peace  nor am i at all arrogant in saying they were all so generally mistaken in their notions of what this union should be since as i have said every one fell to arguing the single and separate advantages of the nation they belonged to insisting on their politic notions and wise schemes for their respective advantages but not one that i met with ever entered into the true and only notion essential to the union i mean the principle of selfdenial how far either nation was to condescend and advance to one another how the present union consisted not in gaining advantages on either hand of one and other but in abatements in giving each other advantages in yielding up privileges opening the treasures and strength of either nation to the good and benefit of the whole  they never dreamed that to unite was in it self a full and a general retribution for every step taken from one side to the other that a new national interest was to be erected and that giving or conceding rights advantages and interests whether in commerce or in privileges was losing nothing at all but was like a man giving presents to a lady whom he designs to make his wife which is but taking his money out of one pocket and putting it into another or like a man settling his estate in jointure on his wife which is still his own and is effectually secured for his posterity  the gentlemen must pardon me if i tell them that for want of this true and original notion of union they took but too much pains to inform us all they had neither the spirit of union in their minds nor the knowledge of it in their heads  and this run them upon wild dilemmas and dark schemes of federations and confederations this sent them to belgia helvetia polonia and i know not whither for examples for schemes precedents and i know not what strange systems of national unions all which i must take the liberty to say were as wide from the only step that could make these nations happy as the east is from the west tended to nothing but confusion of interests national jealousies and in the end war and destruction  these gentlemen were for making bargains between the nations not for bringing two great and mighty kingdoms into one vast united body the same in interest the same in prospect the same in every substantial constituting part the advocates of either people talked like counselors pleading for their clients not like two friends that were striving who should part with most for the interest and engagement of the love of each other  in short the union has been brought to pass not by gaining from but by yielding to one another not by making conditions and advantages of one another but by conceding to one another one part opens the treasures of their trade the other struggles to bear their share of the weight and burden of expensive and bloody wars this part yields up one thing that abates another and mutual condescensions not mutual encroachments have brought this work to pass  and here lies the great mystery of the union they that think strange of the circumlocutions the wisest heads have taken may find them here they that enquire into the reasons of former miscarriages may find them all here if there was any want of temper any mutual distrusts any secret murmurs of parties any jealousies of consequences it was all to be found here that the people who debated these points never looked beyond the present state never considered the conjunct capacity of the nations never drew the balance of interests or stated the affairs of both nations into one account current  had they ever done this they would have seen that monster as they called the union a most beautiful creature admirable in its contexture agreeable in its figure squared like a most exquisite piece of architect both for ornament strength and usefulness they would have seen it a complete circle all the lines of which were drawn from and depended upon one general center the public good a mighty arch every stone of which mutually contributed not to its private support only but to the strength of the whole here is the true original of the union and the wisdom of the treaters on both sides was in nothing more conspicuous than that they came to this treaty furnished with the true notions of what they were to do and consequently the properest and only method for the doing it could not be concealed from them and we cannot but observe that through all the course of the treaty the gentlemen kept themselves closs to this principle to yield to one another in every thing which the nature of the union they aimed at required and the nature of the thing before them would possibly permit  i must confess to me all the notions of federal unions guarantees and everlasting peace which our several writers filled our heads with while the treaty was appointed but not yet begun appeared to me as imperfect embrios false conceptions and births that must end in abortions and disappointments i will not say i had foresight of events enough to prescribe what methods should be taken or what issue would be produced from the treaty then in view but this i took the freedom always to tell the world that it must be a general complete entire and indissolvable union of interests and parties depending upon equalities of privileges and equalities of burdens equalities of prospects and equalities if possible in desires or that it would be imperfect in its parts and confused in its whole  i know one reason why this sort of union was less thought on than perhaps it would have been was because the gentlemen when they come to examine what had ever been attempted this way found nothing of a full and entire union but that under the conquest of the parliament times  and alas says one this must be rendered so odious because twas the work of a tyrant an usurper and what not that no body could bear to recommend it and if at any time a man was driven by the necessity of his judgment the convictions of his reason and the consequences of argument to come to the borders of that scheme he would start at the hint as if he had seen a spectrum and fly even from his own reason because it concurred with what was hit upon by the man and the people he did not approve  and why will you go by whitehall gentlemen where so many wicked rebels triumphed over their monarch why will you use the navy nay some of the very ships with which the same oliver cromwell beat your neighbors  if oliver had not been a master of politics he had never been oliver cromwell in the terms we are now talking of him and because he hit upon the only step that could be taken to fix the union of the two nations must we reject it and rather destroy the kingdoms than close with his unhallowed method  reason and the nature of things guides all men whose eyes are open to the same methods when they are pursuing the same designs let oliver cromwell be what he will and who he will it is no part of my business here take him in all the blackest figures he can be represented  what was the end he pursued in his uniting scotland to england  it was so to join them that both parties being made entirely easy might without hesitation submit themselves to his otherwise precarious authority and was he right in this that to give the two nations a free and full communication both of trade privileges and advantages was the true and only way to make all people easy  so far his project may be good for us without so much as touching upon the parallel  the business of the union was to make the nations easy to put them in a state of mutual advantage if forty tyrants have pursued the method for it though with wicked designs it was for us to take the method and mend the design as much as we could  oliver cromwell made a conquest of scotland  well and what then  let those people who have talked so much of an union of subjection and conquering scotland go back hither for a precedent oliver cromwell knew as well what belonged to conquest as any body in this age will pretend to nor was he less politic in keeping than terrible in obtaining and what did he resolve all his northern conquest into  nothing but union the best concerted the best executed the best approved that ever this island saw till now nor could all the heads in christendom have formed the present happy union but from the schemes of those times  if ever nation gained by being conquered it was here they were subdued first and then made happy and scotland flourished justice had its uninterrupted course trade increased money plentifully flowed in and all under what they called tyranny and usurpation all under a standing army government and with all the disadvantages that can be imagined from such a constitution as tended to subjection not liberty poverty and misery not peace and plenty  and what was the foundation of all this nothing but the natural product of common reasoning he found that the only way to preserve the conquest he had made on the powers of the nations was to make a conquest of their affections that the only way to do this was to let them see their interest and happiness in his government and that this could only be brought to pass by uniting and entirely incorporating the nations into one communicating peace privileges and all possible advantages to them  and thereby letting them see the true way to their prosperity  no man will say this was not the most politic step he could take and must we contemn the method because we cannot be reconciled to the man  certainly if union and incorporation of interests was able to make the nation happy under a standing army and an absolute government as that was things in their nature inconsistent with liberty and national prosperity it must be much more capable under a just and limited government where law governs the very actions of the sovereign and all the branches of power are squared by and sincerely employed for the public good and it can be no lessening the value of any true scheme of national management that a person used or contrived it that we call a tyrant or an usurper let him be never so much a tyrant he showed he had the true spirit of government in him by this that he knew the only way to make his government safe was to make it easy and to have the people quiet was to make them happy  and this he did by union an entire incorporated union  and the event proved his measures were rightly taken  our end is now the same though our views are differing to make the people happy is the end  if union be the way why is it to be liked the worse because oliver cromwell drew the scheme  i have made this digression not purely to show how our writers came to be mistaken in their schemes and why they never hit upon this draught in all their proposals though that introduced it but also to prove that this entire incoporating union has in it self the seed of national felicity in that it wrought then that wonder which the world can rarely produce viz liberty in tyranny prosperity in conquest and a nation saved even in being subdued  could it produce this wonderful effect much more must it be supposed capable now and i am persuaded no man in his senses will like the effect of the present union the worse for its receiving any of its parts from the politics of these times if the happiness of the present time may be seen in it  and here i must own that the present union has some advantage though the nations have paid dear for the experiment in that it has been formed upon the foot of all the most politic schemes of former times and all the miscarriages of former treaties have been as warnings to furnish the experience of these times to make them wary and instruct them how to avoid the rocks that others split on  i have now brought the treaters to london their names and the commission for them respectively to treat i have inserted in the minutes of the treaty as it was laid before the parliament of scotland and immediately following this part  when they first met they hardly knew what measures they should take they knew what business they came to do but i dare say the gentlemen will bear with me in saying they could not foresee the manner and management that followed and it was a pleasing surprise to find all sides and parties to agree in leaving all politic methods formerly studied rather to delay and defeat the design of an union than to complete it and to fall in heartily to consider as the general thesis what could conduce most to the main design of their meeting the union and in order to this they resolved not to study advantages against one another nor to demand on either side any thing but what was agreeable to both kingdoms in their united capacity this was a happy indication that both sides came together with a true spirit of the union among them that they sincerely intended to apply themselves to it with the utmost diligence and to pursue it by all the most proper methods to bring it to pass  the very contrary extreme of which is what as i have already noted has been the principal occasion of the miscarriage of all the former treaties and which good men were very much afraid of now   before they met in public some of the commissioners on both sides had a meeting among themselves privately to consider of the method of proceeding  and here it was first debated in what manner proposals should be delivered and received some were for having conferences of every thing that should be proposed for the convenience of free reasoning others objected against that as tedious and offered as the most expeditious method that every thing should be delivered in writing and then the commissioners respectively meeting apart might reason among themselves and give in their resolutions the more perfect  and this was agreed on by both parties  this is the cause that in the minutes of this treaty we have little of their private reasonings recorded since their having been thus by themselves they have not been noticed so as to come to light in any regular manner  there was but one public conference which was desired by the commissioners for scotland and this was about the number of the scots representatives in parliament and in this it is impossible to get the particular arguments used on both sides the particular persons on either side were as follows  first the lord treasurer of england who opened the thing and desired the commissioners for scotland to propose their reasons why the english should give a greater number than was mentioned  lord chancellor of scotland spoke next and gave reasons why they insisted upon a greater number  mr secretary harley replied to lord chancellor of scotland  the lord chancellor spoke a second time in answer to mr secretary harley  the earl of pembroke spoke after to what the lord chancellor had offered  the earl of stair replied to the earl of pembrokes speech  the lord keeper spoke next  sir david dalrymple followed the lord keeper  duke of devonshire to sir david  and mr seton of pitmedden concluded  the great design of the arguments on the part of the scots commissioners were summed up in this  that they could have no precedent as to number of representatives argued from oliver cromwells division because he was arbitrary and neither gave a just representation to england or to ireland  that the present scheme of taxes could not be the rule but if the representative was to be measured by the proportion of taxes it was on their side since immediately upon the union those taxes would be greater  that if any rule could be laid down it ought to be an arithmetical proportion between the number of people and the taxes paid considered on both sides respectively in which case the hollanders were brought as an example where if you take the people without their circumstances of wealth they bear no proportion because their riches are vastly greater than their numbers if their riches are taken without their people the disproportion would be as great the other way  upon the whole it was concluded there could be no certain rule to direct their lordships the commissioners but the present circumstances of the nations should be judged of by both sides and such a representative to be allowed as should be agreeable to justice in both  upon this debate their lordships retired on either hand and the next day the commissioners for england brought in a proposal for a representative for scotland augmented to forty five commoners and sixteen lords which the scots commissioners acquiescd in as will more particularly appear by the minutes of the treaty which are inserted at large as they were extracted out of the books of the commissioners and beginning with the commissions respectively given to the persons appointed to treat as follows  first the commission to the persons appointed for scotland anna dei gratia magnae britaniae franciae and hyberniae regina fideique defensor etc omnibus probis

whereas the kingdoms of england and scotland were first united in allegiance and loyal subjection in the person of our royal great grandfather king james the first since which happy conjunction it has

royal great grandfather but also in the time of our late royal uncle king charles the second and whereas we out of our princely zeal and care for the welfare and happiness of our subjects being also desirous of a nearer and more complete union between our two said kingdoms of england and scotland did recommend to our parliament of england from the throne to consider of proper methods for obtaining the same and whereas in our parliament held at westminster the third and fourth years of our reign an act passed entitled an act for the effectual securing the kingdom of england from the apparent dangers that may arise from several acts passed in the kingdom of scotland in and by which act of parliament it was enacted that such persons as should be nominated by us under our great seal

writings or instruments quadrupartite every part to be subscribed and sealed by them to the end that one part thereof may in all humbleness be presented to us two other parts thereof to be offered to the consideration of the parliament for the realm of england and another part thereof to be offered to the consideration of the parliament for the realm of scotland at their next sessions which should be held in each kingdom respectively after such writings or instruments should be subscribed and sealed by the said commissioners that thereupon such further proceedings might be had as we and both

any part thereof as they shall think fit is wholly reserved as in and by the said act relation being thereunto had may more at learge appear and whereas in the fourth year of our reign an act was made

knight attorney general sir simon harcourt knight solicitor general sir john cook doctor of laws advocat general stephen waller doctor of laws    after the lords commissioners for both kingdoms had taken their places the commissions were opened and read by the respective secretaries  the lord keeper of the great seal of england addressing himself to the lords commissioners for scotland spoke in these words my lords  we the commissioners appointed by her majesty and authorized by the parliament of england to consult and treat with your lordships as empowered in like manner by her majesty and the parliament of scotland concerning an union of the two kingdoms and such other things as we the commissioners on both parts shall think convenient and necessary for the honor of her majesty and the common good of both kingdoms do apprehend there never was in any assembly of this nature so little occasion as at present for the commissioners of england to give any verbal assurances of their zeal to promote and complete so far as in their power the great and good design we are met about since it cannot be doubted but that we bring along with us the same sentiments which so lately appeared in the parliament of england when they took care to manifest by a solemn act that they did postpone all other considerations to their evidencing a good and friendly disposition toward the kingdom of scotland  the parliament of england in making that unexpected advance seemed resolved if possible to attain that union which has been so long thought necessary by all that wish well to the prosperity of both nations  and we most sincerely assure your lordships that we accordingly meet your lordships with hearts fully resolved to use our outmost endeavors to remove all difficulties in this treaty to prevent all misunderstandings to cherish and improve the good dispositions to one another we meet with to have the general and joint good of both kingdoms solely in our view and not the separate of either but to act as if we were already united in interest and had nothing left to consider but what settlements and provisions are most likely to conduce to the common safety and happiness of this whole island of great britain  which measures if pursued on both parts we hope may enable us to prepare such terms of union as may prove satisfactory to her majesty and the parliaments of both kingdoms    and the earl of seafield lord high chancellor of scotland on the part of the lords commissioners for scotland spoke as follows my lords  the lords commissioners for scotland have desired me to assure your lordships that they meet you on this occasion with great willingness and satisfaction to treat of an union between the two kingdoms and of such other matters and concerns as may be for her majestys honor and the maintaining a good understanding between the two nations  we are convinced that an union will be of a great advantage to both the protestant religion will be thereby the more firmly secured the designs of our enemies effectually disappointed and the riches and trade of the whole island advanced  this union has been often endeavored both before and since the kingdoms were united in allegiance under one sovereign and several treaties have been set on foot for that end tho without the desired success but now we are hopeful that this shall be the happy opportunity of accomplishing it her majesty has frequently signified her good inclinations toward it and we are the more encouraged to expect success in this treaty by the good disposition appeared in the parliament of scotland for it and by the friendly proceedings in the last session of the parliament of england which gave general satisfaction  we have great confidence in your lordships good intentions and we shall be ready on our parts to enter into such measures with you as may bring the treaty to such a conclusion as may be acceptable to her majesty and to the parliaments of both kingdoms    ordered that copies of the two commissions be prepared and signed by the respective secretaries and interchangd against the next meeting  adjourned to monday next the    d instant   a clock in the evening  monday the    d april   0  the lord keeper in name of the lords commissioners for england delivered to the board articles of preliminaries which were read as follows i that all proposals made by either side be made in writing and every point agreed on shall be reduced into writing ii that no point though agreed on and reduced into writing shall be obligatory on either side till all matters be adjusted in such manner as will be proper to be laid before the queen and the two parliaments for their approbation iii that there be a committee appointed consisting of a certain number of each commission to revise the minutes of what passes which are not to be inserted by the secretaries in their respective books but by order of the said committee having first made report thereof to the respective commissioners and received their approbation of the same iv that all the proceedings of the commissioners of both kingdoms during the treaty be kept secret   the lord keeper also delivered to the board the following proposal which was read  that the two kingdoms of england and scotland be for ever united into one kingdom by the name of great britain that the united kingdom of great britain be represented by one and the same parliament and that the succession to the monarchy of the united kingdom of great britain in case of failure of heirs of her majestys body be according to the limitations mentioned in an act of parliament made in england in the    th and    th year of the reign of the late king william entitled an act for the further limitation of the crown and the better securing the rights and liberties of the subjects  adjourned to wednesday the    th instant   in the evening  wednesday the    th april   0  the lord chancellor of scotland acquainted the board that the lords commissioners for scotland do agree to the preliminary articles proposed by the lords commissioners for england at the last meeting for regulating the methods of proceedings in this treaty  the following proposals were also delivered to the board by the lord chancellor of scotland and were read   that the succession to the crown of scotland in case of failure of heirs of her majestys body shall be established upon the same persons mentioned in an act of parliament made in england in the    th and    th year of the reign of the late king william entitled an act for the further limitation of the crown and the better securing of the rights and liberties of the subjects   that the subjects of scotland shall for ever enjoy all rights and privileges as natives of england in england and the dominions thereunto belonging and reciprocally that the subjects of england shall enjoy the like rights and privileges in scotland   that there be free communication and intercourse of trade and navigation between the two kingdoms and plantations thereunto belonging under such regulations as in the progress of this treaty shall be found most for the advantages of both kingdoms   that all laws and statutes in either kingdom contrary to the terms of this union be repealed   the lords commissioners for england withdrew and being returned the lord keeper in their lordships names delivered to the board the following answer which was read  the lords commissioners for england are so fully convinced that nothing but an entire union of the two kingdoms will settle perfect and lasting friendship between them that they therefore think fit to decline entering into any further consideration of the proposal now made by the lords commissioners for scotland as not tending to that end and desire that the lords commissioners for scotland would be pleased to give in their answer to the proposal delivered on monday the    d instant by the lords commissioners for england in order to an entire union of both kingdoms  adjourned to thursday the    th instant   in the evening  observations on the minutes of the three first days the ceremonies on either hand being over wednesday was the first day in which it may be said any thing of business was entered upon  the commissioners on the english side presented a summary as it may be called of an union in general by which it is plain a complete incorporation of the two kingdoms was proposed  the scots proposal was less general and yet readily agreeing to the succession to a communication of privileges and an intercourse of trade  i mention this here because it was afterward objected to the treaters on the scots side in the following parliament that they had given up their country to the english in coming into an incorporating union immediately without proposing any terms which might have been more advantageous to scotland  it is manifest the scots commissioners did make proposals of uniting which were not incorporating or at least which being restricted to their own country only were significant of a concern for scotland leaving the proposal on the behalf of england to the english commissioners  but as will appear in the subsequent minutes the english commssioners were come to a resolution previous to this treaty viz that nothing could complete the felicity of either kingdom and for ever remove all possible difficulties breaches and separation of interests from among them for the future but an entire and incorporating union by which the two nations should be formed into one government be under one sovereign head in one represented body standing upon one foundation enjoying equal privileges and in common bearing one general proportion of burdens the same in end and mean having but one common interest one name and being for ever hereafter but one people  this therefore they laid down as the thesis of their future conferences and pursuant to this the first general they delivered in contained the three and most essential articles of the following treaty viz the uniting the two kingdoms into one the settling the representation in one assembly of parliament and the settling the succession in the same line  and the scots proposals being short in the general incorporating part the english commissioners insisted upon it as above declining to treat upon particulars till that was first determined all debate of particulars being not so directly tending to a conclusion till the great and main question was agreed to whether the union should be entire or no in the sense as above  the prosecuting this question will effectually defend the scots commissioners who tho they were afterward convinced of the main point in debate viz that nothing but an entire union would be effectual to settle a lasting friendship between the two nations yet did not so easily give up their other proposals as was suggested nor did they give them up at all merely upon the english commissioners refusing to treat on any other foot  for the directest answer to a resolution so positive as that might have been thought to have been an equal stiffness and refusing to resolve upon so general a clause till other heads had been adjusted  but the commissioners on the scots side found themselves convinced first of the sincerity and candid intentions of the commissioners on the english part to pursue such a treaty and in such a manner as might most conduce to the mutual happiness of both kingdoms and to make the union both lasting and effectual  secondly they found themselves convinced upon serious debate and further enquiry into particulars that nothing but this incorporation of interests privileges and circumstances could make an effectual lasting indissolvable union and so they came unto it with the same sincerity and from the same candid design of settling the whole and of acting to the advantage of either party  not being at all overruled awed or drawn in as was objected afterward against them  and this would appear at large if the long debates speeches and arguments on both sides could have been recovered  thursday    th april   0  the lord chancellor in the name of the lords commissioners for scotland delivered to the board an answer to the proposal made on the   d instant by the lords commissioners for england with a provision thereinmentioned which was read  the lords commissioners for scotland have considered the proposal given in to them by the lords commissioners for england on monday the   d instant and do agree that the two kingdoms of scotland and england be for ever united into one kingdom by the name of great britain that the united kingdom of great britain be represented by one and the same parliament and that the succession to the monarchy of the kingdom of great britain in case of failure of heirs of her majestys body shall descend upon the most excellent princess sophia electoress and duchess dowager of hannover and remain to her and the heirs of her body being protestants to whom the succession to the crown of england is provided by an act made in the   th and   th year of the reign of the late king william entitled an act for

opinion that the provision added by the lords commissioners for scotland to the proposal made by the lords commissioners for england upon the   d instant is a necessary consequence for an entire union

monday the   th instant   in the evening  observation ii the commissioners for scotland after the debates and reasonings on the last day about the general proposal of the union as an incorporating entire union had also a meeting among themselves in which it was determined after a long consideration to agree to the proposal made by the english commissioners of a full and entire incorporation  this is what was afterward reflected on in scotland and which the opposing party called a betraying their country and as far as possible incensed the people against them who punning on the word treaters called them the traitors and on this foot it was that when the rabble in edinburgh first took a head they pretended to insult the treaters as the persons that had given them up to the english and accordingly began with sir patrick johnstoun a person who was otherwise universally beloved among them and had merited the esteem he had with them by a sober discreet and gentlemanlike behavior as well when in the government having been provost of edinburgh but the year before as at all other times  monday april the   th   0  the lord keeper in the name of the lords commissioners for england

united kingdom of great britain  the lords commissioners for scotland withdrew and being returned the lord chancellor in their lordships names delivered to the board the following answer which was read  the proposal given in by your lordships contains so many particulars that the lords commissioners for scotland do propose before they offer any answer to it that there be a committee appointed of an equal number of each side to adjust the several points therein and desire that your lordships will order an account of the taxes and other things in your proposal to be laid before the said committee as the lords commissioners for scotland shall be ready to do on their parts  the lords commissioners for england withdrew and being returned the lord keeper in their lordships names delivered to the board the following reply which was read  the lords commissioners for england have desired a state of the taxes and other things in their last proposal mentioned to be laid before them in order to refer the same to the consideration of a committee to consist of an equal number of each side which their lordships propose to be the number of eleven on each part and of them any six to have power to proceed in the matters referred to them  the lords commissioners for scotland agreed to appoint a committee to consist of eleven of each side and of them any six to have power to proceed and that they should be nominated next meeting  adjourned to the   st of may   0    in the evening  wednesday the  st of may   0  the lords commissioners for both kingdoms proceeded to

acquainted the board that he was directed by the lords commissioners for england to let their lordships know that the account of the revenues and debts of england desired the    th past to be laid before the board had been prepared but were not drawn in such a manner as would fully answer the end for which they were proposed for which reason they were directed to be drawn in another method and hoped they would be got ready to lay before the board next monday  adjourned to monday the  th instant  observation iii the main points of union being thus settled as above and all the federal provincial and confederating schemes which the world without doors had filled their heads with being vanished the commissioners fell closs to their work and the first article proposed by the english commissioners laid the scheme of the whole affair viz customs excises and temporary taxes prohibitions restrictions and regulations of trade  the great question now before them was how to fix a center in all these or a great standart of equalities so as every part might bear its equal share of the burdens of the war in proportion to its capacity and every part enjoy its equal share of the advantages of commerce each bear an equal part of the weight of the government and reap an equal part of its protection this scale of equalities had a great variety of discording parts in it to bring together the difficulties of which was the business now before them and the method of reconciling them will appear in the further observations on these proceedings  the first thing requisite to bring this matter into a way of debate was for either side to give in a true state of the ordinary revenue the debts and the extraordinary taxes of either kingdom that a scale of proportions might be formed  i mention it here to note how naturally every thing occurred in order to the main end and how after the first concession of an entire incorporation every thing that might tend to completing that design came in of course for without doubt equalities and proportion of taxes privileges and advantages was and must be the only method to bring about a complete entire union of interests and it was impossible to be done without it  the undertaking indeed amazed the world and when people began to look into it with but a transient view it appeared a perfect chaos a mass of absurdities which it would be impossible to reconcile the people who had proposed their federal schemes laughed at this project and talked of it as impracticable called it a chimera of the english ministry and pretended to prophesy its dwindling into nothing and bringing the treaty to the same issue as was done in the last commission  but when abler heads began to look into it and take it to pieces the parts all appeared capable of reduction into form and the presages of the gentlemen who had so banterd it appeared groundless the mass began to move and every thing retiring to its proper place guided by the temper moderation and application of the commissioners the beautiful thing called union began to show it self and the nation began to conceive hopes of its being perfected in spite of all the seeming difficulties with which the enemies to the design had clogged mens expectation  as will appear hereafter  to bring the balance of circumstances upon the stage it was absolutely necessary to enter into the several inequalities in which the two kingdoms then stood these inequalities as they lay particularly before the treaters consisted in matters of taxes customs excises and commerce  in order to state these the several debts and revenue of the respective nations were stated abstracts of which are annexed to these observations as they were given in to the commissioners of both kingdoms  monday the  th of may   0  the lord keeper acquainted the board that the lords commissioners for england had delivered to their secretary a state of the revenues and income of england and also of the debts of the said kingdom which were to be laid before the lords of the committee of both kingdoms at their next meeting  adjourned to thursday the ninth instant  thursday the  th of may   0  the lord chancellor acquainted the board that the lords commissioners for scotland had delivered to their secretary an account of the revenue in scotland and the sum about which the debts of that kingdom would amount to to be laid before the lords of the committee of both kingdoms  the lord chancellor in the name of the lords commissioners for scotland delivered to the board an answer to the proposal made by the lords commissioners for england on the    th april which was read  the lords commissioners for scotland do agree that all parts of the united kingdom of great britain be under the same regulations prohibitions and restrictions and liable to equal impositions and duties for export and import but in regard several of the funds relating to the customs are already appropriated for the payment of debts properly belonging to england it is proposed that an equivalent be allowed for them  the lords commissioners for scotland do also agree that all the subjects of the united kingdom shall be liable to equal land taxes or taxes upon the poundrent providing the proportion for scotland shall only be l   000 when one shilling is imposed on the pound rent on england so that   000 in scotland shall be reckoned equal to the   shil aid now imposed on england and so proportionable and to be raised in the same manner now used in scotland and free of all charges  the private rights of corporations and companies are reserved to be considered in the course of this treaty  the lord chancellor in the name of the lords commissioners for scotland delivered also to the board the following proposal which was read  the lords commissioners for scotland do propose that neither of the kingdoms be burdened with the debts of the other contracted before the union  adjourned to friday the  0 th instant   in the evening  observation iv it was in the debates of this day that the great difficulties lay and indeed those that seemed most concerned for the success apprehended something here too difficult to be mastered and that would render all the rest abortive  the state of the affairs of either nation was in short thus   england had very large incomes or revenues and their customs and excise brought in vast sums viz customs         l per annum excises     0  l per annum    but on the other hand england had vast debts lay upon them to discharge and for the discharge of which these revenues and almost all their other taxes the land tax and malt tax excepted were appropriated   scotland had but small revenues her customs and excise producing but the following sums viz the customs let out in tack or farm from year to year only at  0000 l per annum the excise farmed also at   000 l per annum    but then the revenue of scotland was entirely free from anticipations or appropriations on any account of debt not but that there were public debts too but the revenue was not charged with them  now upon the uniting the revenues of both kingdoms under these differing circumstances there were but two possible methods that could be proposed either   that each kingdom coming to a full point in matters of revenue should like two tradesmen coming into partnership pay off their own respective debts and bring in their several proportions of stock clear of all incumberances or   that putting the general accounts of debts and stock together the english should make good the inequalities to the scots some other way   the scots commissioners wisely proposed for the ease of their own country that the revenues of scotland should not be at all chargeable with the english debts  and this was thought to be a very good argument to excuse scotland from some duties which notwithstanding the general article of paying equal taxes scotland could by no means bear of these as they respect customs or excises foreign or home trade i shall speak as they come in order  but the english commissioners adhering to the first principle of the treaty viz of its being an entire incorporating union were on that account obliged to insist upon this also which formed afterward the sixth article viz that there be an equality of customs excises and all other taxes throughout the united kingdom as that without which the union could not be entire  this being laid down as a general thesis in the whole debate two things came in course to be examined as mediums   a scale of proportions to form the equalities   an equivalent to be given for supplying unavoidable inequalities   and this will be found to run through the whole series of the treaty as the foundation of the whole and however after ridiculed and reflected on by the opposers of the treaty it appears to be the only foundation they could have gone upon and which was the only medium to bring the treaty into a possibility of coming to a happy conclusion  no man could deny but all equalities consisted in proportions and to have extended the thing called equality of taxes to a numerical equality as some pretend in england was saying nothing the customs manner of valuation of land and innumerable circumstances of scotland rendering it impracticable  the english commissioners therefore when they insisted upon an equality of taxes readily agreed to the giving scotland an equivalent for the payment of their own debts so far as their customs and excises should come into the appropriations of the english revenue  what alterations exceptions and abatements were made as to equalities of taxes will be spoken to in the minutes of the scots parliament where the exceptions were made and those calculations adjusted  friday the  0 th may   0  the lord keeper in the name of the lords commissioners for england delivered to the board a reply to the answer made on the   th instant by the lords commissioners for scotland to their lordships proposal on the    april last which was read  the lords commissioners for england observing that in the answer made by the lords commissioners for scotland the   th instant to their lordships proposal of the    april that there be an equality of customs excises and all other taxes throout the united kingdom of great britain the lords commissioners for scotland take no notice of what relates to excises the lords commissioners for england do therefore think it necessary to insist upon their said proposal as that without which there cannot be an entire union between the two kingdoms of which their lordships are so desirous on their parts that they are ready to agree to an equivalent for what scotland shall be taxed toward payment of the debts of england in all particulars whatsoever  adjourned to monday the    th instant  0 in the morning  monday the    th may   0  the lord chancellor in the name of the lords commissioners for scotland delivered to the board a further answer to the proposal made by the lords commissioners for england on the    th april last which was read  the lords commissioners for scotland did take into their consideration the proposal offered by the lords commissioners for england the    th april and found it comprehended so many particulars that they judged it most proper to answer it point by point accordingly on the   th instant they gave an answer as to the customs and land tax and did not mention any thing therein of the excises because the consideration of these was depending before the committee of the commissioners of both sides but to satisfy the lords commissioners for england that nothing shall be wanting on the part of the lords commissioners for scotland that is necessary for the attaining an entire union they do agree to the equality of excises on ale beer mum cider sweets perry lowwines aquavitae and spirits but they do propose an exemption from all other burdens and excises within scotland for a competent time to be adjusted in the course of this treaty that the subjects of scotland may by the benefit arising from the communication of trade be put in a capacity to bear a proportion of other burdens and excises being willing at the commencement of the union to bear equal excises on all that is exported from scotland to england or the plantations and the lords commissioners for scotland do hope that the lords commissioners for england will be convinced that the immunitie from these other burdens and excises for a term of years is consistent with an entire union and will not put the trade on an unequal foot when the present circumstances of both kingdoms are duly considered  and whereas the lords commissioners for england did by their proposal declare they were ready to agree to an equivalent for what scotland shall be taxed in toward the payment of the debts of england in all particulars whatsoever the lords commissioners for scotland are ready to enter with their lordships into the consideration of this equivalent and how to make it effectual  the lords commissioners for england withdrew and being returned the lord keeper in their lordships names delivered to the board their reply to the foresaid answer which was read  the lords commissioners for england taking into their consideration the paper delivered to them this meeting by the lords commissioners for scotland are so sensible of the lords commissioners for scotlands having agreed to an equality of excises as to all excysable liquors as the lords commissioners for england understand the same and to an equality of excyses and burdens on all goods exported to england and the plantations which the lords commissioners for england do not doubt will be agreed to by the lords commissioners for scotland as to all goods exported to all places whatsoever that to show their readiness to comply with every thing reasonable to the bringing this treaty to a good effect they are willing to enter into the consideration of the particular excyses and burdens point by point which being of several natures so that they will require to be distinctly considered the lords commissioners for england find it necessary to desire a little time for giving their opinion on each particular head but in general are inclined to consent to an exemption of excyses and burdens as proposed in such cases where it may be done without prejudice to the trade or manufactures of england as to the excyses where an exemption cannot be consented to without such inconveniency the lords commissioners for england will consider of a proper equivalent or some other expedient to promote the desired union of the two nations  and as to those customs and excyses to which their lordships have already agreed and for which an equivalent is to be allowed to the kingdom of scotland the lords commissioners for england do think it would tend to the dispatch of this treaty that the committee already appointed should continue to sit in order to the adjusting that matter  adjourned to wednesday the    th instant   in the evening  wednesday the   th may   0  the lord keeper in the name of the lords commissioners for england delivered to the board an answer to the proposal made by the lords commissioners for scotland on the   th instant which was read  the lords commissioners for england taking into consideration the proposal made by the lords commissioners for scotland on the   th instant that the kingdom of scotland should be for a comperent time exempted from all excyses and burdens others than such as have been agreed unto by the lords commissioners for scotland have in order to comply with the said proposal so far as can be done without prejudice to the trade and manufactures of england distinctly enumerated and considered the several excyses and burdens which are now payable by virtue of the diverse acts of parliament in england and which have not yet been agreed to by the lords commissioners for scotland and do find the same to consist of the particulars which are hereafter mentioned together with the opinion and answers of the lords commissioners for england to the said proposal as to each of the said respective duties  i the duty on stamptpaper vellom and parchment one moiety whereof expires on the first of august    0 the lords commissioners for england do consent that the kingdom of scotland be exempted from the whole duty until the first of august which shall be in the year of our lord    0  ii the duty on births marriages and burials which being to expire the first of august next and therefore before the desirable union can take place the lords commissioners for england do conceive it to be wholly unnecessary to enter further into the consideration of that duty  iii the duty payable on windows and lights till the first of august    0 the lords commissioners for england are of opinion that the kingdom of scotland shall be exempted from the said duty during that term  iv the duty on coals and culm payable to the  0 th september    0 as to this duty the lords commissioners for england do consent that the kingdom of scotland do remain exempted from the said duty during the said term as to all coals and culm consumed within the kingdom of scotland and no otherways  v the duty on malt granted for no longer time than the    th june   0  the lords commissioners for england do consent that the kingdom of scotland shall remain exempted during the said term from the said duty  vi the duty on salt as to this duty the lords commissioners for england to show their willingness to ease for some time the poor of the kingdom of scotland do consent that the kingdom of scotland shall for a competent time after the union to be settled in the progress of this treaty remain exempt from the payment of that duty for all salt spent in kind or used in provisions spent within the kingdom of scotland provided that the lords commissioners for scotland do propose effectual methods to the lords commissioners for england for securing that the like duties as are now payable in england be paid and collected in the kingdom of scotland after the union without fraud as to all salt exported from that kingdom either in kind or provisions  the lord chancellor in the name of the lords commissioners for scotland delivered to the board an explanation of their agreement to the excises etc mentioned in their lordships paper delivered to the board the    th instant which was read  the lords commissioners for scotland by their paper delivered the    th instant did mean an equality on all exciseable liquors as the lords commissioners for england did understand it and they are willing there be an equality of excises and burdens on all goods exported to all places whatsoever which they agreed to by their proposal the   th instant  adjourned to friday the   th instant in the evening  friday the    th may   0  the lord chancellor in the name of the lords commissioners for scotland delivered to the board the following paper in relation to the several taxes and excises to which their lordships had agreed and renewing their proposal of the    th instant for a general exemption for some competent time from all other excises and burdens than those already agreed to which was read  the lords commissioners for scotland since the last general meeting have again considered the proposition made by the lords commissioners for england the    th april last viz that there be the same customs excises and all other taxes and the same prohibitions restrictions and regulations of trade throout the united kingdom of great britain with the papers which have been since delivered by the commissioners of both kingdoms upon that subject and do with great satisfaction observe that the difference as to that important proposal is brought to a very narrow compass and the lords commissioners for scotland take this occasion to acknowledge the sense they have of the regard shown by the lords commissioners for england for the subjects of scotland after the desired union and the lords commissioners for scotland having by their several proposals and answers agreed to the same regulations of trade and to an equality of customs and excises upon all exciseable liquors and a quota of land tax all to commence from the union as also to an equality of all other taxes after some years they do conceive that they have fully complied with the said proposal of the    th april excepting only that they have proposed an exemption for sometime from all further burdens than those expressly consented to and as to the exemption desired the lords commissioners for scotland are very sensible that the lords commissioners for england have not only by their paper of the    th instant declared that they were inclined to consent in general to an exemption of excises and burdens as proposed in such cases where it might be done without prejudice to the trade and manufactures of england but that in pursuance of that good disposition their lordships by their paper the    th instant have consented to an exemption in favor of the subjects of scotland from the several duties and for the particular terms therein mentioned whereby the immunity desired is so far granted but the lords commissioners for scotland from their consideration of the present circumstances of that kingdom find themselves under a necessity to renew their proposal of a general exemption for some competent time from all other excises and burdens besides those great duties and taxes already consented to that the subjects of scotland may by the benefit of trade be enabled cheerfully to bear an equality of all other burdens which will greatly advance a firm union and coalition of affection and interest betwixt the two kingdoms  adjourned to saturday the   th instant   in the evening  observation v the commissioners were now entered upon the great enquiry about equalities and the first matter relating to taxes was that of the land tax the land tax in england was a formidable thing being called a tax of four shillings in the pound of the rent of lands etc and the people who were fond of throwing a tangled skein in the hands of the treaters that might shock them at the beginning would have gone upon that foot alleging that though the rents in scotland were differing from those in england yet that  0 sh sterling revenue being the same thing any where it could as well afford to pay   sh out of it in scotland as any where else and upon this foot it seems were for bringing the rents of land in scotland to a true estimate and so they would call this way of taxing an equality  but to this it was answered first that the scots way of collecting their taxes being rigorous and exact if   s per l were laid by parliament upon the whole island their assessments would bona fide be   s per l upon the rack rent of all their lands  whereas   s per l in england never puts the assessors out of their old road but every county being rated in the very body of the act the title is ipso facto repealed since if the lands etc of that country will raise the money by an assessment of   s   d per pound and it is known some do for less the law is satisfied and the end answered  now to tax scotland at   s per l upon her nett rent and tax the northern and western counties of england but at so much money which they can raise by a proportion of    d to  0 d at most per l would be unreasonable  so that it was plain scotland could not be taxed at a pound rate but at a proportioned sum leaving them to the division of it to raise it as they see fit  ii the sum charged upon lands in england after it is levied and raised from the tenant stands charged with large deductions and charges upon the levying collecting and receiving and those charges if some calculations are right amount to little less than   d per l upon the money received besides public losses by the insolvency of receivers and their securities which oftentimes runs deep into the money and which though they cannot be brought into an exact account yet put all together    d per pound may at least very well be charged upon the whole as an offreckoning or discount upon the money between the collection and exchequer  this    d per pound upon the money collected is   d   0 per pound upon all the rents in england and amounts in every land tax to near a hundred thousand pound sterling  now as on the other hand the scots collect all their tax at their own charges clear of all losses deficiencies or defalcations and pay it in nett to the exchequer or public treasure to charge them by the same numerical equality with england would be to make them pay their taxes clear of charge and bear part of the expense and loss in collecting ours  iii differing customs and manners of paying rent and letting out lands in the two kingdoms make a numerical equality impracticable  in england the rents are paid in money in scotland they are generally speaking paid in kind or victual as they call it now though it is true this may and is in some respect brought to a head by a general valuation yet with this difference against a scots landlord to an english viz that the scots landlord stays two terms and runs two risques in his receiving the rent of his land  first he stays the term agreed to receive of his tenant and secondly he trusts the merchant a second term to whom he sells the produce he receives of his tenant in the same sense he runs two hazards one in the solvency of the tenant and the other of the merchant which makes a considerable difference in the essential value of the rent and consequently of the purchase of such an estate and though the purchase or real value of lands in scotland may not come into this dispute yet were an estate let in england to pay the rent in kind it would sell for much less than an estate of the same value paid in specie nor would it be taxed at near so much in our common assessment  iv the difference in letting lands in england which are in many places fined down and the stated rents reduced makes another variation whereas in scotland lands are let without leases or but on short terms and at a rackrent any man that knows what belongs to letting or taking lands in england cannot be ignorant  that the landlord letting a long lease to the tenant confining him to such and such improvement makes frequent considerations in the rent and so the land being taxed by the rent is taxed under the value  on the other hand should this article of   s per l be insisted on in the literal sense and the scots come to consider how to avoid it by fining down rents and other advantageous methods which they may easily find out they might soon evade the act and pay little or nothing and this would be an evil hard to discover and if found out almost impossible to cure  from these reasons it was plain a numerical or arithmetical equality could not be the foundation of those debates  but as it was very well styled it behoved to be a geometrical equality founded on a scale of proportions and that scale formed upon due considerations not of real value only but of circumstances and prospects of either kingdom  a second calculate was then proposed from the proportion which scotland was obliged to pay under oliver cromwell who having reduced scotland by arms incorporated them into one body with this nation and by this incorporation they were rated at  000 l per month in their land tax when england was rated at  0000 l per month  it also appears by the same calculation that scotland paid this  000 l per month when england paid but   000 l per month  now to apply this calculation to the present case the land tax in england in time of war at   s per l is supposed to raise two millions sterling  the scots paying  000 to englands   000 per month which is something less than a sixth part by the same rule in two millions per annum which the said land tax raises they must be chargeable with            per annum land tax  but this arbitray difference which oliver cromwell and his parliament made as is observed was in consideration that england had for diverse years past been at almost all the expense of war yet still at the former calculation scotland would in a four shilling aid pay half that sum viz             per annum  now to examine the rents of each kingdom the annual rents of lands in scotland must by the first calculation amount to one million six hundred sixty six thousand six hundred sixty six pound thirteen and four pence sterling per annum and by the last calculation just half the money  both which sums it was alleged are far wide of an equality and far beyond what scotland is able to raise  i am the larger on this head that posterity may see the reasons why these calculations were made and have the arguments preserved for their use if it be disputed hereafter why scotland should pay so small a proportion in the land taxes or four shilling aid and which may help others to defend scotland against future attempts to enlarge their expenses  the next thing was to examine what was or what might be counted a due equality and here it will be necessary to enter a little into the short history of taxes in scotland since the restoration which bringing it down to the present time may serve as a rule to this matter  anciently the levying money upon land in scotland was called in general the taxation and the manner of levying it was by rules altogether obsolete and now grown out of use as the custom of tenths fifteenths subsidies etc are in england  the now method of taxing land has its beginning as to practice in the assessment of  000 l per month settle in scotland in cromwells time when an union was actually formed and settled between the nations of which however deficient in it self without doubt this may be said that it had in it the essential parts and might be modeled into a complete coalition  this is the tax they now go by in scotland and is called there the cess by which is understood a months assessment it is raised upon land by a method peculiarly exact and i have never heard any one complain of the inequality  it is raised as is before noted without any charge deduction or defalcation and is paid nett into the treasury  according as the occasions of the government require this tax is increased but then not the sum per month is increased but the number of months are increased which by the help of time increases the sum  the original of the demand was as before and of the method but the continuance of it was thus introduced  in former times the kings of scotland contented themselves with the ancient demesnes crown lands customs etc and on extraordinary cases the taxation as above was their supply excises of any sort were altogether unknown till the days of king charles the second  king charles the second in the year      obtained of the scots to give him a settled sum of  0000 l sterling during his life in consideration whereof he promised never to demand any cess or taxation except in time of war as by the words of the act as follows      act of the   st parliament cha   the estates of parliament taking to their consideration the great happiness this kingdom has enjoyed etc and that the kings majesty has been graciously pleased notwithstanding all the provocations given to himself and his royal father to evidence his affection and favor to this his ancient kingdom etc do with all humble duty acknowledge his majestys unparalled grace and goodness etc  and seeing for the due establishment of his majestys authority and settling and securing the peace of the kingdom his majesty may have occasion to raise and keep some forces within this kingdom and his majesty has signified his resolution not to raise any more cess therefore and from the due sense of their duty and obligations the estates of parliament do in the name of the kingdom make an humble and cheerful offer to his majesty of a yearly annuity of  0000 l sterling during all the days of his majestys life time  this  0000 l was raised by  000 l laid as impost on foreign importations and   000 l per annum on malt brewed into liquor for sale but as this was a novelty and uncertain in its produce a cess was granted to make good the deficiency which deficiency generally amounted to   months cess more or less and other cess than this scotland knew none till the convention      which being a time of war a cess was imposed but not exceeding   months  here it may be observed that in these times the excises and customs of scotland could not raise  0000 l per annum put together which i note for the other uses which i shall make of it hereafter but to go on with my history  from this time to the year      scotland had no more cess nor was at any charge more than to make good the deficiency of the  0000 l mentioned before except   months cess during the dutch war expiring at candlemas       about this time the nation being very unhappily divided into parties had the misfortune not only to have a religious division but a court division also and people strove at any price to oblige the sovereign in giving up their privileges and liberties to be trampled on by arbitrary designs the first fruits of this courting the prince appeared in that they brought a tax   months cess upon the country to be continued for   years which though in time of peace was backed with a specious pretense of the disaffection of the phanaticks or to express it in a more modern phrase the danger of the church as follows  act of convention  0 july      the convention of estates of the kingdom of scotland by his majestys authority and command at this time assembled considering the great happiness etc and as all kings and estates do at present carefully secure themselves and their people by providing against all such foreign invasions and intestine commotions as may make them a prey to their enemies so it is not fit that this kingdom should only of all others remain without defense in a time when these dangerous field conventicles declared by law rendezvouzes of rebellion do still grow in their numbers and insolences against all which the present forces cannot be in reason thought a suitable security in recognizance thereof etc the convention of estates etc do humbly beseech his majesty to accept their cheerful and humble tender of a new supply  this was the first infraction upon the scots to cover which duke lauderdale then commissioner feignd a new word and put upon it the gloss of a voluntar offer or free gift  when this had been imposed for about   years and   years before it expired king james then duke of york and high commissioner in scotland anno      obtained the continuation of this   months cess for   years which was to the year      after this when he came to the crown he advanced it by his mere absolute command to   months cess and had it confirmed to him for his life vide the act as follows    th act of parliament jan   the estates of parliament calling to mind the many great blessings they have and do enjoy under the protection of the royal government and especially by the many deliverances from the rebellions insurrections and designs of fanatical traitors from whom they could expect no less than confusion in religon oppression etc and that the terror of his majestys forces has been very instrumental for procuring our present security but considering that not only these enemies continue their inveterate hatred against king and people but that their frequent disappointments have heightnd their malice to despair and that the present forces may be too few to undergo all the fatigue which his majestys service etc may require and to demonstrate to all seditious men that this nation is resolved to bestow all they have in the kings service rather than to bear the least of their insults do therefore for themselves and the nation represented by them make a hearty and dutiful offer etc over and above the   months already imposed etc whereby there will be   months cess payable at each term hereafter and as a farther evidence of their entire affection etc they humbly and heartily offer a continuation of the said   months cess termly during all the terms of his majestys life time which god almighty long preserve  in this taxation or cess the several court parties struggled who should give their country away fastest the bishops got into every part of the civil jurisdiction the severities against the people first drove them into desparations and rebellions and then such advantages were taken and such use made of the said insurrections to ruin others that the poor people were brought to the brink of general ruin the nation being brought to that pass that a man might be fined or for faulted that is his estate taken from him for his wives giving a halfpenny at his door to a common beggar on pretense it was relieving a rebel  thus poor scotland was bought and sold and the example is useful for our observation a great many ways for thus shall every nation be used that is divided into contending parties and exposed to an encroaching government  but that i may not have said all this foreign to the present purpose it is very observable and this is the reason of the quotation that this will make one period for taxation viz the highest that an arbitrary prince backed with a mercenary nobility and a governing clergy even in the greatest extreme of absolute tyranny ever imposed upon this nation which at that time it is evident they desired to squeeze and cared not if they entirely ruined  come we now to the revolution which these exorbitances had no little influence upon the first thing transacted upon the meeting of the estates or convention of scotland was to break these chains reassume the power of raising taxes by parliament and make themselves judges both of the occasion and of the sum  however as in england since the revolution greater occasions have called for immense sums to carry on the war and such taxes have been raised as were never heard of before so in scotland the parliament have agreed to such taxes as the aforesaid time of tyranny excepted were never known in scotland before  yet in the carrying on this war six or seven months cess has one time with another been thought scotlands full proportion and the late king excepting one or two years on extraordinary occasions always contented himself with it and this at the same time that england raised   s per l upon their land nor did queen anne ever demand more of her subjects in scotland though the weight of the war was as great as ever and this was called another period of taxation  now what was meant by a geometrical scale or equality in taxes is drawn from these proportions  that since exact valuation of rents cannot be made on both sides and least of all in england it seems as good a way to come at this equality as any could be proposed  that the highest period of taxes that ever scotland bore since the restoration may be taken on one hand and set against the highest period of taxes that ever england bore that is of a land tax on both sides and put these together as the scale of equality  thus suppose the scots   months cess though that was the height of tyrannick imposition and though it is allowed the scots are manifestly impoverished and less able to bear it than they were yet say it be full   months cess and set this against the english   s per l it could not be found that any more just calculation could be made and the proportion seemed so clear that every side appeared content with it  thus when ever a tax upon land for   s per pound is granted the scots pay   months cess if of   s per pound in england   months cess and so in proportion  there were other calculations offered about that time but none seemed so rationally and so exactly stated to the circumstances of the nations or built on so just a foundation and therefore it met with less difficulty than was expected as will appear hereafter  saturday the    th may   0  the lord keeper in the name of the lords commissioners for england delivered to the board their answer to the paper delivered by the lords commissioners for scotland the   th instant which was read  the lords commissioners for scotland on the  th instant proposed a quota of a land tax and agreed to the same regulations of trade and to an equality of customs and on the   th agreed to an equality of excises on all exciseable liquors but at the same time their lordships proposed an exemption from all other burdens and excises for a competent time  the lords commissioners for england did the same day return answer that their lordships would enter into the consideration of the particular excises and burdens point by point and on the   th instant did return their answer distinctly to the particular excises and burdens payable by virtue of several acts of parliament in england in such manner as their lordships had reason to hope would have been to the entire satisfaction of the lords commissioners for scotland but the lords commissioners for england finding by the paper delivered in on the   th instant by the lords commissioners for scotland that though they do take notice of the said answer of the   th yet their lordships have thought fit to renew their proposal of a general exemption for some competent time from all other excises and burdens besides these their lordships had already consented to the lords commissioners for england did understand that proposal of the   th to extend only to such other burdens and excises as are now subsisting in england to every one of which their lordships think they have given a full and distinct answer and if it shall appear that any particulars have been omitted in that answer the lords commissioners for england will enter into the consideration of them and return their opinion thereupon but if the lords commissioners for scotland would extend their proposal of the   th to an exemption from all burdens and excises which the parliament of great britain may hereafter find necessary to impose on the united kingdom the lords commissioners for england are of opinion that it cannot be supposed the parliament of great britain will ever lay any sort of burdens upon the united kingdom but what they shall find of necessity at that time for the preservation and good of the whole and with due regard to the circumstances and abilities of every part of the united kingdom and to allow of any supposition to the contrary would be to form and set up an unanswerable argument against the union it self therefore the lords commissioners for england do desire that the lords commissioners for scotland would take into their consideration the several particulars in that paper delivered to them by the lords commissioners for england on the   th instant and return such answer to them as their lordships shall think fit  adjourned to tuesday the   st instant   in the evening  tuesday the   st may   0  the lord chancellor in name of the lords commissioners for scotland delivered to the board their lordships answer to the papers delivered by the lords commissioners for england the   th and   th instant which was read  the lords commissioners for scotland have taken into their consideration the papers delivered by the lords commissioners for england on the   th and   th instant and do understand that the first contains all the several kind of burdens and excises now in use in england besides those to which the lords commissioners for scotland have already agreed  and as to the several particulars contained in the said papers    as to duties on stamped paper vellom and parchment seeing the exemption from that imposition can have no influence on trade or manufacturies and that the said duty does affect the securities of the subjects estates adding likewise a new condition which being omitted may make their rights and titles void and further considering that the said duty will be uneasy to the people chargeable in collecting and of small value the lords commissioners for scotland do propose that the kingdom of scotland be wholly exempted from the same or at least that the exemption from the said duties agreed to by the lords commissioners for england in the said paper of the   th instant be prolonged beyond the year    0 to a certain period as to that moiety which is imposed for perpetuity    as to the other particular duties which expire in the year    0 or sooner from which the lords commissioners for england have agreed that the kingdom of scotland shall be exempted the lords commissioners for scotland do understand that it was the meaning of the lords commissioners for england to extend that exemption to the duty laid on cynders    as to the duty on salt the lords commissioners for england having consented that the kingdom of scotland shall for a competent time after the union remain exempted from the payment of that duty for all salt spent in kind or used in provisions within the kingdom of scotland provided that the lords commissioners for scotland should propose effectual methods for securing that the like duties as are now payable in england be paid and collected in the kingdom of scotland after the union as to all salt exported from that kingdom either in kind or provisions the lords commissioners for scotland have herewith given in a scheme of such regulations as have occurred to them for securing that the duty proposed be collected in scotland as to all salt exported from that kingdom in kind or provisions and are willing to agree to what other methods shall be proposed on that behalf by the lords commissioners for england and their lordships are ready to enter with the lords commissioners for england on the consideration of the time to which the said exemption shall be limited and the lords commissioners for scotland doubt not but as the lords commissioners for england have agreed to the exemption proposed from all burdens or excises now in use but those consented to by the lords commissioners for scotland that the lords commissioners for england will also agree that the kingdom of scotland remain exempted from any duties except these agreed to which may be laid on by the parliament of england before the union  and as to the general exemption formerly proposed on the part of scotland from all other burtheus than those consented to for a competent time the lords commissioners for scotland considering what the lords commissioners for england have observed that it cannot be supposed the parliament of great britain will ever lay any sort of burdens upon the united kingdom but what they shall find of necessity at that time for the preservation and good of the whole and with due regard to the circumstances and abilities of every part of the united kingdom therefore the lords commissioners for scotland to avoid the difficulty that may arise in that matter do agree not to insist further at present but to leave the continuation of the said exemption to be determined by the parliament of great britain  and the lords commissioners for scotland having by this and their former papers answered the proposal made by the lords commissioners for england on the   th april concerning the equality of taxes the lords commissioners for scotland take this occasion to put the lords commissioners for england in mind of a proposal given in to their lordships the  th instant concerning the quota of land tax for the kingdom of scotland not doubting but that the lords commissioners for england will agree to the same  the lord chancellor did also in name of the lords commissioners for scotland deliver to the board the following proposal which was read  proposal for the effectual preventing the exportation of scots salt to england or the plantations without paying the same excises with which english salt is charged during the exemption allowed to scotland from the said duty    that no salt be transported from scotland to england by land under the penalty of forfeiting the salt and the horses used in transporting it and pay ten shillings for every bushel of salt so transported for which the carrier as well as the owner shall be liable conjunctly and severally and the carriers to be imprisoned until the said penalty be paid    that all salt waterborn be entered at a custom office and that before shipping there be a report made expressing to what port the ship or vessel is bound and if bound to any port within scotland there shall be sufficient security given for the duty payable in six months with this condition that in case a certificate be returned from the collector or collectors where the ship or vessel is bound that the same quantity was truly and without fraud found loaded at the said port or ports reasonable allowance being made for waste since the embarkation then and in that case the bond for the duty to be come void and in case the ship or vessel be bound for england or the plantations the excise or duty chargeable on the like salt in england shall be presently paid in money and a transire or certificate subscribed by the collector expressing the quantity of salt entered and the duty paid and if any ship or vessel load salt on board and export the same without duly reporting entering and carrying the said transire or certificate along with him to be produced at the port of discharge the ship or vessel unloading shall be confiscated and the master imprisoned for three months and in case of any fraud or connivance in the collector or other officers of the customhouse the said collector or other officer shall be liable to pay a years sallary and be deprived of his office    as to provisions all fishes and flesh barreld for exportation are appointed to be packt and cured with foreign salt without any mixture of scotch or english salt by the law of scotland which foreign salt falls under the regulation of foreign trade and there are no other valuable provisions that can be imported from scotland and the lords commissioners for scotland are willing to agree to any further proposal that shall be made for preventing fraud in importing scotch salt or salted provisions  her majesty came to the meeting and being seated in her chair spoke to the lords commissioners as follows my lords  i am so much concerned for the union of the two kingdoms that i could not satisfy my self without coming before i went out of town to see what progress you had made in the treaty and to recommend very earnestly to you the bringing it to a happy conclusion with as much dispatch as the nature of it will admit not doubting of the general satisfaction which my subjects of both kingdoms will receive in finding you overcome all difficulties to attain so great and public a good    the lord keeper desired to know of her majesty if she would be pleased to hear the proposals made on either side and the resolutions hitherto taken thereupon read by the respective secretaries which her majesty was pleased to allow of and the same were read accordingly  after reading whereof her majesty went away and the lords commissioners adjourned to thursday the   d instant  0 a clock in the morning  observation vi and thus after all the difficulties which were thought unsurmountable by some and endeavored to be made so by others the affair of the land tax was settled the next article was the equality of excises customs and other appropriated funds and these had sundry difficulties  some were grievous to scotland with respect to their magnitude only in which case though scotland was to be supposed to pay duties under the same denominations yet the scots commissioners pretended to insist upon it that they were not able to pay the same sums with england but that it must be reduced to a proportioned equality as in the land tax and this respected the excise and several branches of the customs  others were grievous to scotland in the kind and were thought impracticable at least for a time the trade poverty and other circumstances of scotland not admitting them these were the tax upon malt and the excise or duty on salt  others again were such as were altogether impracticable as having none of the materials to work on in scotland or such as could not rationally be expected from them such as the taxes upon coals culm hawkers and pedlars hakneycoachmen births burials and marriages glasswindows stamptpaper and the like  in the beginning of the debate on these heads the equality of customs export and import with the same restrictions and regulations of trade was agreed to by the scots commissioners for the necessity of commerce made it plain there could be no adjusting trade without that an open free uninterrupted commerce by land being the consequence of an union they would otherwise ruin the english trade by supplying the english markets with all sorts of imported goods cheaper than the english merchants could do and this would be a most destructive article in trade especially in fine goods for example in linens from hamborough or holland or in tobacco coffee tea chacolate and such other things as were then under large duty and small carriage these would all be spread over england by the scots and make unspeakable confusions in trade  it was the sooner concluded therefore that the customs prohibitions and charges of all foreign importations must be numerically and literally the same in both nations but as the english customs were already impropriated to pay the english debts and the scots had before proposed that neither kingdom be burdened with the debts of the other contracted before the union this equality was found very difficult and next to impracticable and this brought on the affair of an equivalent of which hereafter  this now run through all the heads of taxes for there remained no question but that an equivalent was a full compensation for any difficulty proposed and yet the settling an equivalent here seemed no satisfaction it was alleged an equivalent was a national satisfaction indeed but not a personal that it could not relieve the particular people it oppressed no nor make good the damage of the particular trade it would injure and therefore the scots commissioners strove hard to avoid the taxes wholly rather than to come into them though with an equivalent  but it was not to be done there could be no other method that could make both sides equally easy  after this had therefore been long discoursed the scots commissioners came in to the article of equality of excises on liquors and the customs on exported and imported goods the debate of what that equality was did not ly before them but seemed referred on both sides to the respective parliaments and there we shall meet with it again at large  the customs and excises on liquors being thus settled the scots commissioners excepted against all other excises and burdens and insisted upon it as a thing scotland was not then in a condition to come into at least for the present as you see it expressed in the minutes of may    and it is observable the scots commissioners made this proposal with a great deal of candor and regard to the english as appears by their obviating the objection which they knew would be made of the carrying salt and malt into england for it was the particular duties on salt and malt which they had an eye to in this proposal in which they desired exemption for so much only as should be consumed in scotland  upon this occasion the committee was appointed to examine and state the nature of the equivalent and on which particular articles it was to be allowed and as this was doing the commissioners in their meeetings went upon the particular points of excises or taxes which were to be objected against  the stamped paper the births burials windows etc were without much difficulty conceded to the scots for as the circumstances of those duties made them improper so the stamped duties could not have been extended to scotland the methods and customs of which would have made it impracticable in some cases and intolerable in others  the duties on coals culm and cinders also occasioned very small debates the scots being no otherwise exempted from those duties than a great part of england is who pay no duty for all their riverborn coals and the quantity of coals carried by sea in scotland is so very small as not to deserve any notice howbeit all the coal exported from scotland or scots coal expended in england pays as in england  the births and burial act expired and having been grievous in england it was not probable it should be renewed  the hakneycoachmens act could not concern scotland there being so few hakneycoaches in edinburgh as not to make it worth notice  the malt and salt tax occasioned the greatest debate the circumstances of scotland were argued though with great modesty and decency on either side and the english commissioners were soon made sensible that in the present circumstances of scotland those duties could not be born there  and indeed they would have been intolerable to the poor and not only as to the magnitude but as the manner of taxing them had been particularly oppressive to the scots in their trade    because they are exorbitant in their rate being charged not upon the value but upon the bulk of the commodity and the goods bearing so different a value in scotland and in england to put the duty equal would be to tax the scots in three times the sum they are taxed at in england  for example the duty upon salt is charged by weight in general and this being calculated in scotland would amount to    s   d sterling upon   s value and in england to but    s   d sterling upon  0 s   d value or thereabout let any man state the proportion here they will easily allow the tax to be intolerable to the scots since by the same proportion the english ought to pay   l    s   d for the same quantity of salt or the scots ought to pay but   s   d for that which by this tax is rated at    s   d and the like tho not in so great a difference for the malt    the weight of the salt tax lies especially on the poor who in scotland live very much on salt meats and whose differing condition from the english does not permit nor cannot bear being taxed at all much less equal to the english  these arguments brought the english commissioners to agree to an exemption for a time the scots commissioners insisted upon an exemption to perpetuity but the answer of the english commissioners stated in the minutes of the    th may is very clear and obliged the scots commissioners to acquiesce  for it could not be thought reasonable to tie up the hands of the united kingdom for ever not to lay on such duties or taxes as the circumstances of trade and of the nation might make reasonable  the treaters on both sides therefore acquiesced in the exemption from the other several duties during the respective terms they were given for leaving the consideration of further exemptions to the british parliament what alteration this part received and upon what consideration in the parliament ensuing in scotland shall appear in its place   there was an objection offered here about what duties might be laid on by the very next parliament of england which being to sit almost at the same time with the parliament in scotland and consequently before the union could commence might alter the state of the present duties and so the conclusions might be all to be made over again  but this was after some debate regulated as per the minutes by obliging scotland to raise her part of the charge of the year   0  as usual and england her part each separately and a part and the several duties and funds mentioned were to remain just as they stood at the time of the treaty  this and the quota of land tax being brought in together was readily agreed to on both sides  and thus this great difficulty which was thought the most dangerous in the whole treaty was brought into a very narrow compass for the business was now only to state the matter of the equivalent what it should be and how to be disposed  what it should be admitted no long debate for as it was a payment of money nothing but money could be an equivalent to it  how much it was to be depended upon matter of fact and was reserved to exact calculation from the foot of the customs and excise  as to the manner how it should be disposed the commissioners did not adjust it at all save in generals of which hereafter in its course  it has been objected indeed as an omission in the commissioners that they did not adjust the application of the equivalent in scotland but their reasons were   because they had a respect to the parliament of scotland who were to come after them and who perhaps might enter farther into that part and indeed might claim a right exclusive of all others to dispose of it    they were not willing to enter upon a thing in which the determination of properties might be entangled conceiving it did not ly before them to conclude private interests or exclude any as they might have done who had reason to claim upon old debts some in king jamess time and some in king charless time and the like    it was thought this might raise objections against the union in people who being biased by their interest would oppose the general interest on their own particular accounts  it was now that the union appeared hopeful and people began to be surprised at the success the queen her self pleased with the prospect came to the meeting and hearing the minutes read expressed an extraordinary satisfaction in the steps taken by the commissioners and the hopes conceived of bringing this great matter to a happy conclusion  thursday the    d may   0  the lord keeper in name of the lords commissioners for england delivered to the board the followng answer to the paper delivered by the lords commissioners for scotland the    st instant which was read  the lords commissioners for england having considered the papers delivered by the lords commissioners for scotland on the    st instant and being desirous to remove all difficulties in this treaty return this answer  that whereas the lords commissioners for england have already consented that the kingdom of scotland be exempted from the whole duty on stamped paper vellom and parchment till the   st of august    0 at which time one part thereof expires the lords commissioners for england do now consent that the kingdom of scotland shall not be charged with the other part of that duty during the continuance of that duty by any act now in force  and do agree it was and is the intent of the lords commissioners for england that the kingdom of scotland be exempted from the payment of the duty laid on cynders in such manner as the lords commissioners for england have before agreed that the kingdom of scotland be exempted from the payment of the duty on coal and culm  and as to the scheme proposed by the lords commissioners for scotland for securing that the duty on salt now payable in england be collected in scotland after the union as to all salt exported from that kingdom in kind or provisions the lords commissioners for england have thought it necessary to receive some information concerning that matter from the officers principally concerned in the management of that duty and until the lords commissioners for england can be satisfied concerning the sufficiency of these or other methods for the end proposed they conceive they cannot properly enter with the lords commissioners for scotland on the consideration of the time to which the exemption of scotland from that duty shall be limited  and as to the duty which may be laid on by the parliament of england before the meeting of the parliament of great britain for the service of the year   0  the lords commissioners for england do agree that the kingdom of scotland shall not be charged with those duties upon this consideration that the parliament of scotland do make the necessary provision for the public charge and service of the year   0  in that kingdom provided that if the parliament of england shall think fit to lay a further charge on the customs or those excises of which the lords commissioners for scotland have agreed to bear equal burdens in such cases the lords commissioners for england propose the kingdom of scotland be liable to the same customs and excises having an equivalent to be settled by the parliament of great britain and as to the quota of a land tax for the kingdom of scotland proposed by the lords commissioners for scotland the lords commissioners for england do agree that whenever the sum of         lib   sh   d shall be enacted by the parliament of great britain to be raised in england on land and other things usually charged in acts of parliament for granting an aid to the crown by land tax the kingdom of scotland shall be charged by the same act with the further sum of lib   000 as the quota of that kingdom to such tax and so proportionably for any greater or lesser sum raised on the kingdom of england by any tax upon land and other things usually charged together with the land  adjourned to friday the   th instant   in the evening  observation vii it is very remarkable here that in the exemptions from several duties in this treaty there is a certain limitation only to the act then in force and to the time for which these duties were then laid on from whence some afterward took occasion against the treaters on the scots side as if they had thereby tacitly consented that those duties should be charged upon scotland after the expiration of the time limited  but they that please to examine more nicely into this matter will find it quite otherwise the english commissioners consenting to an exemption from taxes to the scots for as far as the several duties debated were laid seemed as much as could reasonably be expected they should agree to since to have gone farther had been to abridge the united parliament that was to follow and tacitly to acknowledge what was but too frequently suggested that they would be partial to the english and consequently might oppress the scots this was the true meaning of that part of the answer the english commissioners gave to the scots paper may    viz but if the lords commissioners for scotland would extend their proposal of the   th to an exemption from all burdens and excises which the parliament of great britain may hereafter find necessary to impose on the united kingdom the lords commissioners for england are of opinion that it cannot be supposed the parliament of great britain will ever lay any sort of burdens upon the united kingdom but what they shall find of necessity at that time for the preservation and good of the whole and with due regard to the circumstances and abilities of every part of the united kingdom and to allow of any supposition to the contrary would be to form and set up an unanswerable argument against the union it self  this was very happily foreseen and by this method prevented for nothing was more certain than that this very argument would be raised and in the debating this treaty in scotland in the parliament there it was one of the great pleas and thought to be an unanswerable argument against the union viz that the parliament of great britain might and would being biased by the majority of votes on the english side lay burdens on scotland without regard to the circumstances and ability of that part of the united kingdom and it would indeed have been an unanswerable argument if the lords commissioners had extended their limitations of taxes beyond the expiration of the acts which were then in being  therefore they resolved to leave it indefinite only with their concessions as reasons for and precedents of future abatements to scotland and this the commissioners of scotland found so reasonable as that they could not indeed object against it as to any duties which the parliament then in being in england and which were at hand to fit viz in october next following it was but just to ty them up and the english commissioners came readily into that and thus they went on hand in hand yielding to one another in every thing which might without injury be granted and which might in the least contribute to the great and main end of the treaty the union  and now they having clerks appointed to assist them in the calculations of the equivalent which took up a great deal of time they were obliged to adjourn the affair of funds taxes proportion of debts etc and go upon other articles in the mean time  friday the   th may   0  the lord chancellor in name of the lords commissioners for scotland delivered to the board the following paper which was read  the lords commissioners for scotland are very sensible of the care which the lords commissioners for england have taken to remove difficulties in this important article concerning common taxes and impositions and their lordships doubt not that the joint desires and endeavors of the lords commissioners for both kingdoms will bring this treaty to a good and speedy conclusion in every point  and as to the particulars contained in the answer given in by the lords commissioners for england the    d instant the lords commissioners for scotland do accept the said answer as satisfying as to the exemption of the kingdom of scotland from the duties upon stamped paper vellom and parchment and upon cynders and as to the quota of land tax for scotland  and as to the article concerning the salt the lords commissioners for scotland are very well satisfied that the lords commissioners for england take what time they judge needful for informing themselves and preparing the most proper methods for securing what their lordships proposed the lords commissioners for scotland being very ready to concur on their part  as to the duties which may be laid on by the parliament of england before the meeting of the parliament of great britain the lords commissioners for scotland do understand that the said answer is intended by the lords commissioners for england as an agreement to the proposal made by the lords commissioners for scotland that that kingdom might remain exempted from all other duties laid on by the parliament of england before the union except these consented to and the lords commissioners for scotland do agree that all necessary provision shall be made within the kingdom of scotland for the charge and service of that kingdom during the time that shall interveen before the meeting of the parliament of great britain  and whereas the lords commissioners for england do propose that if the parliament of england shall think fit to lay a further charge on the customs or those excises of which the lords commissioners for scotland have agreed to bear equal burdens in such cases the kingdom of scotland be liable to the same customs and excises having an equivalent to be settled by the parliament of great britain the lords commissioners for scotland do consent in the terms proposed  and seeing the adjusting of the equivalent and settling the endurance of the exemption from the duty on salt may require some time the lords commissioners for scotland are ready either to proceed on these matters until they be fully adjusted or to enter on the consideration of the constitution of the parliament of great britain the reservation of laws and judicatures or any other remaining head to be treated on as shall be agreed by the lords commissioners for both kingdoms while in the mean time the committee is preparing what lies before them  adjourned to saturday the    th instant   in the evening  saturday the    th may   0  the lord keeper in name of the lords

hitherto been under the consideration of the commissioners for both kingdoms appearing by the paper delivered by the lords commissioners for scotland the   th instant to be adjusted except only the determination of the equivalent and the time for which the exemption of scotland from the duty on salt is to endure both which things are put into a proper method to be brought to a conclusion the lords commissioners for england are ready to receive any further proposal from the lords commissioners for scotland in order to the bringing this treaty to a speedy and happy conclusion  adjourned to

preparing a proposal concerning the reservation of laws and judicatures in scotland after the union which would be ready to offer to the board at next meeting  adjourned to wednesday the    th instant   in the evening  wednesday the   th may   0  the lord chancellor in the name of the lords commissioners for scotland delivered to the board the following proposal which was read  the lords commissioners for scotland having already agreed to an equality of customs and excise upon all exciseable liquors and to the same regulations of trade throout the whole united kingdom as a consequence thereof their lordships do now agree that the laws concerning regulation of trade customs and excise upon all exciseable liquors be the same in scotland after the union as in england  but the lords commissioners for scotland do propose that all other laws in use within the kingdom of scotland do after the union and notwithstanding thereof remain in the same force as before but alterable by the parliament of great britain with this difference betwixt the laws concerning public right policy and government and those which concern private right that the laws which concern public right policy and government may be made the same throout the whole united kingdom but that no alteration be made in the laws which concern private right except for evident utility of the subjects within that part of the united kingdom now called scotland and as to the judicatures within scotland the lords commisioners for scotland do propose as follows  that the court of session or college of justice do after the union and notwithstanding thereof remain in all time coming within scotland as it is now constituted by the laws of that kingdom and with the same authority and privileges as before the union subject nevertheless to such regulations for the better administration of justice as shall be made by the parliament of great britain  that the court of justiciary do also after the union and notwithstanding thereof remain in all time coming within scotland as it is now constituted by the laws of that kingdom and with the same authority and privileges as before the union subject nevertheless to such regulations as shall be made by the parliament of great britain and without prejudice of other rights of justiciary  that all other courts presently in being within the kingdom of scotland do remain but subject to alterations by the parliament of great britain and that all inferior courts within the said limits do remain subordinat as they now are to the supreme courts of justice within the same in all time coming  that no causes in the kingdom of scotland be cognoscible by the courts of chancery queens bench common pleas or any other court in westminster hall and that the said courts or any others of the like nature after the union shall have no power to cognosce review or alter the acts or sentences of the judicatures within scotland or stop the execution of the same  that there be a court of exchequer in scotland after the union for deciding questions concerning the revenues of customs and excises having the same power and authority as the court of exchequer has in england and that the said court of exchequer in scotland have power of passing signatures gifts tutories and in other things as the court of exchequer at present in scotland has and that the court of exchequer that now is in scotland do remain until a new court of exchequer be settled by the parliament of great britain in that kingdom after the union  that after the union the queens majesty and her royal successors may continue a privy council in scotland for preserving of public order and peace until the parliament of great britain shall think fit to alter it or establish any other effectual method for that end  that all heretable offices and jurisdictions and offices or jurisdictions for life be reserved to the owners thereof as right of property notwithstanding of this treaty in the same manner as they are now enjoyed by the law of scotland  that the rights and privileges of the royal buroughs in scotland as they now are do remain entire after the union and notwithstanding thereof  adjourned to thursday the  0th instant   in the evening  observation viii the reserve of judicatories in scotland being now the debate it is needful only to explain a few things for the information of the reader as to the nature of those judicatories and reserves  it was absolutely necessary to reserve the laws courts of justice and civil or criminal judicatories because the respective kingdoms being governed by differing customs rites laws and methods of justice it would have infinitely embarrast the treaty now and the kingdoms afterward to have made any alteration it would have perfectly put a stop to all public justice for a time and all the persons bred to the law in that kingdom who had changed their laws would have been rendered unable to practice or discharge their duty to their clients etc and have been by consequence divested of their livelyhoods these difficulties appearing so great the english commissioners came readily into it only with a few restrictions as   that all laws for the regulating trade customs and excises be the same in scotland after the union as in england this was absolutely necessary to be done though if they should extend the word to all laws for regulation of trade it might be run out to difficult extremes and occasion an unanswerable dispute but moderately speaking it was absolutely necessary to prevent the confusion among officers in collecting the revenue stating and settling the customs and excises which were now to be extended to both countries   again it was most necessary that their other laws should be alterable by the parliament of great britain otherwise this had been to tie up the hands of the future constitution from making necessary provision against whatever inconveniences might happen in the government and i mention this here because in the tumultuary clamours raised afterward against the treaty and against the treaters this was one of the great quarrels that they had given up the laws and constitution of scotland and had subjected them to the arbitrary votes of a british parliament in which it was alleged the majority being so much english the scots could expect nothing but disadvantage but it is apparent and was at the time of the treaty considered that the leaving the laws of scotland subject to alteration by the british parliament signified no more than leaving room for the parliament in cases of necessity or indeed on all occasions to make laws for scotland as should appear needful for the public advantage always reserving their general form of law and proceedings of justice as before and without this scotland must have been miserably left without a legislature and have had no opportunity to have helped her self in cases contingent or have obtained any more or other laws for the rectification of any of the common abuses of her government which it seems these objectors did not think it worth their while to consider   and that this alone was the meaning of this word alterable by the parliament of great britain and that it was understood so on both hands is evident from the very words of the proposal of the scots commissioners when they propose the alternative between public and private right  with this difference betwixt the laws concerning public right policy and government and those which concern private right that the laws which concern public right policy and government may be made the same throout the whole united kingdom but that no alteration be made in the laws which conern private right except for evident utility of the subjects within that part of the united kingdom now called scotland  the three next articles do also still more evidently confirm this viz that the court of session or college of justice do after the union and notwithstanding thereof remain in all time coming within scotland as it is now constituted by the laws of that kingdom and with the same authority and privileges as before the union subject nevertheless to such regulations for the better administration of justice as shall be made by the parliament of great britain  that the court of justiciary do also after the union and notwithstanding thereof remain in all time coming within scotland as it is now constituted by the laws of that kingdom and with the same authority and privileges as before the union subject nevertheless to such regulations as shall be made by the parliament of great britain and without prejudice of other rights of justiciary  that all other courts presently in being within the kingdom of scotland do remain but subject to alterations by the parliament of great britain and that all inferior courts within the said limits do remain subordinat as they now are to the supreme courts of justice within the same in all time coming  now it was thought most irrational to argue that the laws and constitution of justice in scotland was in this treaty given up to the english when as by these articles the courts of justice and the general form of administration such as the session justiciary and all other courts were to remain in force for ever or in all time coming  and yet as if this had not been enough to secure the scots from this fear the commissioners for scotland form the negative and in it enter on the particulars viz that no causes in the kingdom of scotland be cognoscible by the courts of chancery queens bench common pleas or any other courts in westminster hall and that the said courts or any other of the like nature after the union shall have no power to cognosce review or alter the acts or sentences of the judicatures within scotland or stop the execution of the same  the privy council indeed was left to the queen to dissolve or continue as her majesty might see cause  but that was by the treaty subject to parliamentary determination and how the queen referred it to the parliament will appear in its course  nay the treaters were so tender of this general invading the particulars that they took care to exempt private jurisdictions and properties from the power or cognizance of parliament which is what is not done in england and which it has been thought even in scotland too had been better left to the parliament in time to have dissolved giving satisfaction to the parties concerned i mean such as heretable offices jurisdictions for life etc  all these provisions were so exactly stated and so forcible in themselves and the scots commissioners had so shown both their capacity in the affairs of scotland and their candor in respect to union in the great affair before them that the english commissioners made no objection but agreed to it as they the scots commissioners had brought it in without any amendment  and this formed the        0    articles of the union which were so clearly digested that they admitted little or no debate afterward in the parliament of scotland where all the rest past the strictest scrutiny and almost a fiery trial  thursday the  0th may   0  the lord keeper in name of the lords commissioners for england delivered to the board the following answer to the proposal made by the lords commissioners for scotland the    th instant which was read  the lords commissioners for england having considered the several proposals contained in the paper delivered the    th instant by the lords commissioners for scotland and being extremely desirous to bring this treaty to a speedy and happy conclusion do agree to the same reserving still the consideration of the courts of admiralty of scotland to the further progress of this treaty  adjourned to saturday the   st june   0    in the evening  saturday the  st day of june   0  the lord keeper in name of the lords commissioners for england acquainted the board that their lordships for england were preparing some proposals which would be ready to offer to the board at the next meeting  adjourned to wednesday the   th instant   in the evening  wenesday the  th of june   0  the lord treasurer in name of the lords commissioners for england delivered to the board the following answer to the proposal offered by the lords commissioners for scotland the    st of may past which was read  the lords commissioners for england having taken into consideration the proposals delivered in to them the    st day of may last by the lords commissioners for scotland for the effectual preventing the exportation of scots salt to england or the plantations without paying the same excises with which english salt is charged during the exemption allowed to scotland from the said duty do give the following answer to the several proposals therein    as to the first article of the said proposal viz that no salt be transported from scotland to england by land under the penalty of forfeiting the salt and the horses used in transporting it and paying ten shillings for every bushel of salt so transported for which the carriers as well as the owner shall be liable conjunctly and severally and the carrier be imprisoned until the said penalty be paid  the lords commissioners for england do agree to the same with the alterations following viz that no salt be transported from scotland to england by land in any manner whatsoever under the penalty of forfeiting the salt and the cattle and carriages made use of in transporting it and paying  0 shillings for every bushel of such salt and proportionable for a greater or lesser quantity for which the carrier as well as the owner shall be liable conjunctly and severally and the persons carrying the same to be imprisoned by any one justice of the peace by the space of six months without baill or mainprize and until the penalty be paid    as to the second article relating to salt waterborn to be carried from port to port in scotland and salt exported from scotland to england or the plantations  the lords commissioners for england as to that part of it which relates to salt waterborn to be carried from port to port in scotland do agree to the same  and as to that part of the said proposal which relates to salt exported from scotland to england by sea the lords commissioners for england do propose that there shall be paid in england for all salt made in scotland and imported from thence into england the same duty upon the importation as shall be paid for salt made in england to be levied and secured in the same manner as the duties on foreign salt are to be levied and secured in england and if any other salt which is not made in scotland shall be imported from thence into england the same to be charged with the duties on foreign salt imported into england to be levied and secured in the same manner  and as to the last part of the said article relating to salt exported from scotland to the plantations  the lords commissioners for england do not insist that any duty ought to be paid for the same or for salt exported from scotland to any other foreign place whatsoever in regard that upon the exportation of salt from england to the plantations or any other foreign parts the duty before paid for the same is to be repaid    and as to that part of the last article of the said proposal which relates to salted fish exported from scotland into england  the lords commissioners for england do propose that for all such fish there shall be paid in england upon the importation thereof such sums of money as by the law relating to the duties upon salt in england are allowed and repaid to the exporter thereof upon exportation of the like fish from england to foreign parts in regard all salt used in fish cured and consumed in england is liable to duties of the same value and in case the said fish shall be reexported from england the duties paid for the same upon importation thereof shall be repaid  and as to all salted fish exported from scotland to any other place the lords commissioners for england do not insist that any duty shall be paid in scotland for the salt used therein in regard upon the exportation of such fish from england to any foreign parts the exporter thereof has an allowance out of the duties on salt of so much money as the duty of the salt used in curing such fish amounts to  and as to that part of the said article which relates to salted flesh exported from scotland in regard all salted flesh consumed in england or made use of for victualling of ships there or exported from england to parts beyond the seas is cured with salt for which the duty on salt is paid in england and not repaid upon exportation of any such flesh from england and there being so much salt used in the curing one hundred weight of flesh each hundred weight being computed at one hundred and twelve pound weight as the duty thereof payable in england amounts to two shillings  the lords commissioners for england do propose that there be paid in england upon the importation of every such hundred weight of flesh from scotland two shillings and that before such flesh is so exported from scotland an entry be made at the customhouse of the port of exportation in scotland of the quantity of flesh so to be exported and the port in england for which the same is bound and security given by bond to her majesty at the said port of exportation in scotland that the said flesh shall be landed at the port in england for which the same shall be so entered or at some other port in england the danger of the seas and enemies excepted which bond shall be delivered up upon producing a certificate from the collectors or officers of the customs of the port of importation in england that such flesh was landed and left at the said port and that the duty of two shillings be paid in scotland for all salted flesh made use of for victualling of ships there or exported from thence to any other parts besides england and that no salted flesh be brought into england from scotland by land under the penalty of forfeiting the same or the value thereof and the cattle and carriages employed in carrying thereof and of the like imprisonment as they have before proposed in case of salt brought from scotland to england by land  and if any frauds shall hereafter appear which are not sufficiently provided against by the foregoing proposals the lords commissioners for england do propose the same shall be subject to such further provisions as shall be thought fit by the parliament of great britain  and whereas the lords commissioners for england did in their paper delivered the    may last past consent that the kingdom of scotland should for a competent time remain exempted from payment of the duty on salt for all the salt spent in kind or used in provisions spent within that kingdom the lords commissioners for england do now propose that the kingdom of scotland shall remain exempt from payment of that duty for all salt spent in kind or used in provisions within the said kingdom for the term of seven years after the union upon the lords commissioners for scotlands agreeing to the proposals abovementioned  the lord treasurer in name of the lords commissioners for england also delivered to the board the following proposal which was read  that all admiralty jurisdiction be under the lord high admiral of great britain or commissioners for the admiralty of great britain for the time being and that appeals from the high court of admiralty of great britain be to the queen in the same manner as is now settled in england  adjourned to friday the   th instant   in the evening  friday the   th june   0  the lord chancellor in name of the lords commissioners for scotland delivered to the board the following paper which was read  the lords commissioners for scotland do agreee to the proposal contained in the answer delivered by the lords commissioners for england the   instant concerning the effectual preventing the exportation of scots salt from scotland to england without paying the same excises with which the english salt is charged during the exemption allowed to scotland from the said duty with the following alterations    as to that part of the second article viz that if any salt which is not made in scotland shall be imported to england from thence the same to be charged with the duties of foreign salt imported into england to be levied and secured in the same manner the lords commissioners for scotland do understand that it is not the meaning of the lords commissioners for england by the said proposal to lay a double duty on foreign salt exported from scotland to england once to be exacted at importation of the said salt into scotland and the like duty at the importation into england from scotland but that the foreign salt imported into scotland be charged at the importation there with the same duties after the union as the like salt is charged with being imported into england to be levied and secured in the same manner and for further security in that case the lords commissioners for scotland do propose that certificates be sent with foreign salt exported from scotland into england from the customoffice in scotland where the said foreign salt was first imported to the custom office in england where the said salt shall happen to be transported bearing the payment of or security given for the duties at the said port under this penalty that foreign salt exported from scotland into england without such certificates shall be confiscated    as to the third article relating to salted fish or flesh exported from scotland into england and salted flesh made use of for victualling of ships in scotland or exported from scotland to parts beyond the seas the lords commissioners for scotland do apprehend that the said articles do only concern such fish and flesh as is cured in whole or in part with scots salt there being an obvious difference betwixt the case of these and of such fish and flesh exported from scotland to england as is wholly cured with foreign salt in regard that foreign salt is to pay the like duty as in england at importation into scotland and therefore ought not to pay a second duty  and the lords commissioners for scotland do propose that if the duty on salt take place in scotland after the expiration of seven years during which time the exemption is agreed to that then the kingdom of scotland shall have an equivalent  the lord keeper in name of the lords commissioners for england delivered to the board the following proposal which was read  the lords commissioners for england being extremely desirous to come to a speedy conclusion of the present treaty for an union of the two kingdoms and it having been already agreed that the united kingdom be represented by one and the same parliament their lordships have turned their thoughts to consider what may be a proper and reasonable number for the representative of scotland in the house of commons of the united parliament and dopropose to the lords commissioners for scotland that thirty eight persons be the number by which that part of the united kingdom now called scotland shall be represented in the house of commons when ever a parliament shall be called in great britain  adjourned to tuesday the    instant   in the evening  tuesday the    th june   0  the lord chancellor in name of the lords commissioners for scotland delivered to the board the following answer to the proposal made by the lords commissioners for england on the  th instant which was read  the lords commissioners for scotland in answer to the proposal delivered by the lords commissioners for england on the  th instant concerning the admiralty do agree that all admiralty jurisdiction be under the lord high admiral of great britain or commissioners of admiralty of great britain for the time being and as to that part of the said proposal which concerns appeals from the high court of admiralty the lords commissioners for scotland do propose  that the court of admiralty now established in scotland be continued and that all reviews reductions or suspensions of their sentences in maritime cases competent to their jurisdiction remain in the same manner after the union as now in scotland until the parliament of great britain shall make such regulations and alterations as shall be judged expedient for the whole united kingdom providing there be always continued in scotland a court of admiralty such as is in england for determination of all maritime cases relating to private right in scotland competent to the jurisdiction of the admiralty court  and the lords commissioners for scotland do further propose that the heretable rights of admiralty and vice admiralties be reserved to the respective proprietors as rights of property  the lord chancellor did also in name of the lords commissioners for scotland deliver to the board the following paper which was read  the lords commissioners for scotland having considered the proposal made by the lords commissioners for england the  th instant viz that thirty eight persons be the number by which that part of the united kingdom now called scotland shall be represented in the house of commons when ever a parliament shall be called in great britain do find such difficulties in that matter that they are under a necessity to propose a conference betwixt the lords commissioners for both kingdoms on that subject in which their lordships doubt not but to satisfy the lords commissioners for england that a greater number than is mentioned in the said proposal will be necessary for attaining the happy union of the two kingdoms so much desired on both sides and the lords commissioners for scotland are willing now to enter on the said conference or when the lords commissioners for england will please to appoint  the lords commissioners for england withdrew and being returned the lord keeper acquainted the board that the lords commissioners for england do agree to a conference with the lords commissioners for scotland upon the subject contained in the paper delivered by the lords commissioners for scotland at this meeting and that the said conference be the morrow at six a clock in the afternoon  adjourned to wednesday the    th instant   in the evening  wednesday the   th june   0  the lords commissioners of both sides entered upon the conference desired by the lords commissioners for scotland the   th instant concerning the representative for scotland in the house of commons in the united parliament of great britain and the conference being over  adjourned to friday the    th instant   in the evening  friday the   th june   0  the earl of mar in name of the lords commissioners for scotland delivered to the board the following answer to the proposal made by the lords commissioners for england the   th instant which was read  the lords commissioners for scotland having considered the proposal delivered by the lords commissioners for england on the   th instant with the conference that followed on the subject of that proposal their lordships are hopeful that the lords commissioners for england are convinced of the real difficulties occurring in that matter on the part of scotland and the lords commissioners for scotland do find themselves still under an absolute necessity for bringing to a happy conclusion the union of the two kingdoms to insist that a greater number than that of thirty eight be agreed to as the representative for scotland in the house of commons in a parliament of great britain  the lord keeper in name of the lords commissioners for england delivered to the board the following answer to the proposal made by the lords commissioners for scotland the   th instant which was read  the lords commissioners for england having considered the paper delivered in by the lords commissioners for scotland on the   th instant concerning admiralty jurisdiction do agree to the first proposal thereincontaind with this addition  that the admiralty court proposed to be continued in scotland after the union shall be subject to such regulations and alterations as shall be thought proper to be made by the parliament of great britain  the lords commissioners for england do likewise agree to the second proposal in the said paper contained touching heretable rights of admiralty and viceadmiralties in scotland with this provision viz  that these heretable rights as to the manuer of exercising the same shall be subject to such regulations and alterations as shall be thought proper to be made by the parliament of great britain  adjourned to saturday the    th instant one a clock  observation ix there were some debates and a little time spent about the matter of the admiralty but it was soon adjusted and needs no remark on it only as to the matter of appeals to england which however were found necessary and agreed to with some little trouble  but here had like to have happened a difficulty about appeals in causes of private right in scotland  before the union appeals in law lay from the lords of the session to the parliament and the house of peers of great britain being now to be the sovereign judicature of britain there could be no appeals but to them in parliament this it was thought would be a grievance by reason of the distance of place the expense of traveling and the charge of prosecuting those trials at the bar of the house of peers  it was objected that the scots peers could not be allowed to vote in matters of judicature either in civil or criminal cases in england and they gave a seeming substantial reason for it viz that the scots reserving their judicature session and justiciary to themselves in which the english have no voice it would be unreasonable to desire the scots should be let into that in england which is reserved from the english in scotland  but to this it was answered the lords in england as peers assembled in parliament as they were before the sovereign judicature of england would after the union be together with the sixteen scots peers the only sovereign judicature of britain and have their voices in the judicature of scotland as well as of england  if this be made out then the objection against the scots noblemen voting in judicial matters in england would by consequence fall to the ground  the judicature of the lords consists in their trying their own members for life and in determining the proceedings of all the other courts of justice in the nation an appeal going to them from all other judicatures whatsoever whether before or after judgment  in trials of peers it is plain by this union the english lords will have a vote in the scots judicature since they will have the power to try all the scots peers for their lives or otherwise in any case wherein they shall become obnoxious to the law  and as to appeals it was therefore absolutely necessary they should ly before the house of lords they being the only supreme judicature and to have had appeals before any other had been to have two supremes unless commissioned by them and if commissioned by them and made certain they had been too inferior and also not to be depended upon in matters of such moment to solve this difficulty a short scheme was handed about for the regulating that point so as to vest the whole authority of the law judicially in the british peers in parliament and settle the essential part in them without nevertheless imposing the trouble upon the scots of coming up with their causes to the lords bar which would be intolerable  the scheme was as follows  the scots have now an appeal from the lords of session which are their judges of assize or whatever else they may call them  this right of appeal must not die though the parliament before whom it lies is dissolved but must devolve upon that power to which as the center of the whole their parliament devolves viz the parliament of britain otherwise should the right of appeal die which is one article of the scots claim of right they endanger their property and may upon a thousand not unlikely circumstances revert to tyrrannick power and even a parliament may not help them  the right of appeal being not dissolved but transferred to the general center of power where or on which branch of that power must it reside not in the commons that would be to make them a court of judicature which they to not pretend to and can not by their constitution accept  not to the select number of scots representatives that would be to give them more power than the english representatives one having a judicial authority the other not  not to a number chosen by the scots that would be a new creation and be a reserve of some power superior even to the general supreme power of parliament and many ways give umbrage of a possibility of return to a separate constitution which would be really inconsistent with a national incorporated union and capable of keeping on foot continual jealousies complaints and discontents among us and might sometime or other break out into a rupture again and unravel the very union it self  to regulate this we must fly to one general maxim which we must adhere clossly to in all matters of this dispute viz that the great center of power whether civil or criminal is and is to be lodged in the parliament then to be called the parliament of great britain  the judicial power in scotland is immediately in the session as it is in england in the judges the lords of the session in scotland as the judges in england receive their commissions from the sovereign and in her name and by her authority though by special law obtained in both kingdoms they are so fixed as that they can not be turned out but upon misbehaviour  from the session in scotland and all acts sentences or decreets there lies an appeal to the parliament who sitting in one house are the sovereign judicature of the nation as well commons as lords from the judges in england appeals ly to the chancery and from thence to the house of lords as the supreme judicature of this nation  but both parliaments being to be incorporated into one as both nations by consequence will be one so the public justice must run in the same channel and the appeals of both kingdoms ly before the british peers only as that sovereign ocean of justice into which all the streams must flow  but to the end that scotland may as far as may be eased in that inconveniency which her distance from the capital may bring upon her and in which she suffers otherways deeply enough appeals from the courts of justice in scotland may be tried in scotland  a court of appeals may be erected in scotland delegated from the peers of britain assembled in parliament to be named annually or triennially or every session or otherwise as in the treaty of union shall be agreed  these delegates to be named out of the scots nobility and gentry to be chosen by ballot or by the usual way of voting in the house of peers  that they should be scots is but equal as they are only to judge of causes in scotland and is agreeable to the constitution of england which causes all trials at law to be tried in the county where the party dwells and to be determined by a jury of the freeholders or inhabitants of that particular county and of no other  and yet this does no way lessen the authority of the parliament but preserves the title of the lords here to a voice even in the supreme judicature of scotland  this scheme as it entitules the parliament of united britain to its full and complete jurisdiction so it preserves the right of appeal to the scots prevents the expensive proceeding of carrying their appeals to england and takes away all the force of the objection against the scots noblemen having a voice in the english judicature  thus the union in point of judicature may still be complete and the general incorporation not at all obstructed the course of justice left free and open and both nations equally concerned in it  the english peers are let into the sovereignty of the scots judicature as well as of their own and the scots let into all the necessary privileges which the right of their peerage and the nature of an incorporated equality requires  there were reasons to be given why this proposal was not further entered upon though both sides approved of the method some of which were perhaps such as these   that one side were willing enough to have all appeals come to england   others willing to have as few as possible made at all and supposing that the inconveniences of pursuing an appeal to england would incline people rather to acquiesce and make the judgment of the session more definitive  but these things by the way   saturday the    th june   0  the earl of mar in name of the lords commissioners for scotland delivered to the board the following answer to the paper delivered by the lords commissioners for england the    th instant which was read  the lords commissioners for scotland having confidered the paper delivered by the lords commissioners for england on the   th instant concerning admiraltyjurisdictions do agree to the same  the lord keeper in name of the lords commissioners for england delivered to the board the following paper which was read  the lords commissioners for england having taken into consideration the reply delivered the  th instant by the lords commissioners for scotland to the answer of the lords commissioners for england to the proposal made by the lords commissioners for scotland the   st of may last for the effectual preventing the exportation of scotch salt to england or the plantations without paying the same excises with which english salt is charged during the exemption allowed to scotland from the said dutys and as to falted provisions  as to that part of the reply which relates to the second article in the said answer concerning salt not made in scotland imported from thence into england the lords commissioners for england did not intend that a double duty should be laid on foreign salt exported from scotland to england and therefore the lords commissioners for england do agree to the proposal in the said reply that all foreign salt imported into scotland be charged at the importation there with the same dutys after the union as the like salt is charged with being imported into england to be levied and secured in the same manner and to the further security by certificate therein proposed to be sent with foreign salt exported from scotland into england  and as to that part of the said reply which relates to the third article in the said answer touching salted fish or flesh exported from scotland into england and salted flesh made use of for victualling of ships in scotland or exported from scotland to parts beyond the seas it appearing by the said proposal delivered by the lords commissioners for scotland the   st may last that all fish and flesh barrelled in scotland for exportation are by the law of scotland appointed to be packed and cured with foreign salt without any mixture of scotch salt the lords commissioners for england do not insist on the said third article in their said answer provided it be agreed that all salted fish or flesh exported from scotland to england and all salted flesh made use of for victualling of ships in scotland or put on board to be exported from scotland to parts beyond the seas that shall appear to be salted with scots salt or a mixture of such salt shall be forfeited and as such may be seized n england or scotland  as to the last part of the proposal of the lords commissioners for scotland that if the duty on salt take place in scotand after the expiration of seven years that then the kingdom of scotland shall have an equivalent the lords commissioners for england do understand that the equivalent is only to be extended to such part of the duties as shall be applied to the payment of the debts of england  the lord keeper did also in name of the lords commissioners for england deliver to the board the following proposal which was read  the lords commissioners for england being assured by the lords commissioners for scotland that there will be found insuperable difficulties in reducing the representation of scotland in the house of commons of the united kingdom to thirty eight members the number formerly proposed by the lords commissioners for england do to show their inclinations to remove every thing that would of necessity be an obstruction to the perfecting the union of the two kingdoms propose to the lords commissioners for scotland that forty five members and no more be the number of the representatives for that part of the united kingdom now called scotland in the house of commons of the united kingdom after the intended union  and there being an absolute necessity that the number of peers to be admitted into the house of lords of the united kingdom for that part of the united kingdom now called scotland be regulated in proportion to the number to be admitted into the house of commons do propose that sixteen peers be the quota of scotland in the house of peers of the parliament of the united kingdom after the intended union  adjourned to tuesday the    th instant   in the evening  tuesday the   th june   0  the earl of mar in name of the lords commissioners for scotland delivered to the board the following answer to the proposal made by the lords commissioners for england the   th instant which was read  the lords commissioners for scotland having considered the paper delivered by the lords commissioners for england the    th instant containing a proposal that forty five members be the number of the representatives of that part of the united kingdom now called scotland in the house of commons of the united kingdom after the intended union and that sixteen peers be the quota of scotland in the house of peers in the parliament of the said united kingdom and being most desirous to concur in what is further necessary to finish this treaty and at the same time sensible of the difficulties on the part of the lords commissioners for england in that matter do not insist for greater numbers by virtue of this treaty of representatives in the house of peers and the house of commons in the parliament of great britain than these proposed by the lords commissioners for england providing that all the peers of scotland and their successors to their honors and dignities be from and after the union reckoned and declared peers of great britain and that they enjoy in their respective degrees and orders all other titles dignities preheminencies immunities and privileges whatsoever as fully and freely as the peers of england do at present or the peers of britain may enjoy hereafter  and the lords commissioners for scotland do further propose that the peers of scotland for that time being and their successors do at and after the union according to their different degrees and orders enjoy the rank and precedence of all peers to be thereafter created of the like orders and degrees in the said united kingdom  adjourned to the   th instant    a clock  observation x there was now the only remaining difficulty of the union before them and this was the consequence of the third article viz the uniting the parliament and how to state the proportion of the representative was the present case  the difficulty was double not only how to draw the proportion so as might consist with the equalities spoken of before which were the foot or rule of the treaty but how to draw it so as that either parliament who were to confirm this work should be rationally supposed to come into it  abundance of schemes were proposed for this as mens fancies guided them and the debates without doors were much warmer than those within however as it was a thing required particular application so it was the best step that could have been taken by way of preliminary to propose a conference wherein both sides had full scope to deliver their arguments and reasons in the case since to have gone on by proposals and answers in writing would have taken up more time than was needful to be spent in such an affair and have kept it depending whereas both sides were pleased with the hopes and both the kingdoms big with expectation of the success of this treaty and the conclusion of the long expected union  there was no occasion to look far back into former years for help in this calculation there was but one precedent in the whole world from which any scheme could be drawn and that was in the transient union made by oliver cromwell in which as i have noted before he brought every thing by a scale of proportions to a point as things then stood  this model of a representative was taken from the scheme of proportions upon which he had formed his taxation in which scotland being rated at about a    th part of the land tax had also allowed her about a    th part of the representative as follows england was taxed at  0000 l per mensem and was represented in parliament by  00 members scotland was taxed at  000 l per mensem and was represented in parliament by  0 members   now abating a few fractions which in dividing persons cannot be exactly observed it is plain  0 to  00 is very near what  000 l is to  0000 l as follows     times  0 is   0 members and    times  000 l is   000 l whereas one is  000 l over in the money so the other is  0 under in the representative  i will not say this was the most equal judgment that ever was made of this kind as to scotland but i may be allowed to say that with respect to england it was certainly the most equal distribution of elections that ever was and much beyond our present method for in this scheme the disproportion of numbers was taken away and the election of members to represent ruined heaps decayed castles and depopulated towns was let fall but of this by the way  the present calculation was not very remote from this in effect though not built upon the same foot and it was very rationally argued here that the proportion could not be taken barely from the share of taxes paid which was the scheme which most of the politicians of that time pretended to go upon but that the proportion must be doubly calculated which if it be examined and were to be applied in holland and other parts of the world must have been done  for instance the share in taxes  and the number of the people  if on one hand the share of taxes may be low yet the number of people great or on the other hand the share of taxes high and the people few the extremes are to bear their weight in the proportion  thus though the scots by this union paid but   000 l for scotland to     000 l english which was about   0 part forty times   000 l being    0000 l to have argued from thence that they should have but    members which to the house of commons is         part of     this would appear ridiculous again if you take an estimate of the people of both nations we shall find scotland esteemed to contain two millions and england at the highest calculation under six and this brings scotland to a third part of the members which would be extravagant the other way and oblige them to send     members to the house but if you set these extremes against one another it will appear that a tenth of the representative answered as nigh to an equality as such a thing could well be reduced to and on this foot the scots commissioners were supposed to be near the matter when they desired  0 members might be the representative for scotland   however this was the english commissioners having proposed    as by the minutes a conference was agreed to  and here the commissioners sincerely and heartily applied themselves to one another debating not only the reasons and proportions on either hand but the temper and circumstances of either nation so if possible to accommodate themselves to both and to consider not only what was equal but also what was likely to take place in the minds of the respective parliaments which were to debate it after them of which none knew the difficulties better than themselves neither were these things fit to have been the subject of minutes which in time were to be supposed would be made public and be canvassd on either side by the most critical heads of two nations and particularly by those in both the nations whose study it would be to oppose and obstruct the union  and indeed in this prudence of the commissioners consisted the best prospect of bringing this treaty to a happy conclusion  the conference was happy in its success the english commissioners were convinced by the reasons given on the other side they saw the difficulties which the scots commissioners represented lay before them and regarding the end of their meeting which was to contribute as much as in them lay to unite the two kingdoms they advanced their number to    and gave their reasons and difficulties on the other hand positively determining the point that they could go no further upon which the scots commissioners from the same zeal for bringing the treaty which was now in so happy a forwardness to a conclusion acquiesced  as for the number of the peers there was no room to debate since the number proposed which was    was a full proportion to the other and had more of an equality in it a great deal than any other part of the treaty especially considering that several of the scots peers then were peers of england and hereafter might become peers of great britain by creation  and thus this great difficulty was also happily got over and now the union began to show it self and people on every hand began to expect it should be completed in a few days

appropriated for payment of the debts of england the lords commissioners for scotland do understand that whenever the duties upon salt shall take place in scotland the sums thence arising will be applicable to the payment of the debts of england and thereby there will be an equivalent due to scotland for the whole duties to be levied on salt there  the earl of mar did also in name of the lords

ships belonging to her majestys subjects of scotland at the time of signing this treaty of the union of the two kingdoms tho foreign built shall be deemed and pass as ships of the built of great britain the owner or where there are more owners one or more of them within twelve months after the union making oath that the same did belong to him or them or to some other subject or subjects of

and from thence to be sent to the port of london to be there entered in the general register of all trading ships belonging to great britain  observation xi the debates about the    peers are so clear and the questions and answers in themselves so direct that they require no explanation nor was there any thing considerable passed upon those heads which is not expressed in the minute  the settling the different privileges between the sitting peers for the time being and the other peers seemed to be the main difficulty and was quickly regulated  i know it was alleged in scotland that the privilege of peerage being by this treaty extended to the nobility of scotland i mean as to protection of their persons and estates was both a dishonor and a disadvantage to them a dishonor as if they were stooping to accept of an exemption from an honest discharge of their debts and a disadvantage since now they being not liable to prosecutions for debt would obtain no personal credit whatever their occasions might be  and that a private gentlemans bond would now be more valuable than a noblemans since it could be sued and made heretable whereby his estate should become liable as well after his death as in his lifetime whereas a noblemans bond could no way be put in suit  however this was there was no making a distinction at a time when a treaty was transacting to bring all if possible to an equality of circumstances unless the english nobility should have laid themselves and their estates open to the common process of the law which had been inconsistent with their constitution and much more with their convenience  i have not meddled with the frequent proposals answers and replies about the salt tax as a thing i shall speak more at large to when i shall observe upon the minutes of parliament where that matter received a new turn and all these scruples were effectually settled under one head of limitation and so are needless to be repeated here  it may be needful to explain something here of the debate and restriction about shipping the english commissioners had in their view the act of navigation which in england obliges all the ships employed to and from england except only such ships as import any thing of the growth or manufacture of their own country to which those ships belong to be english built ships and the mariners or sailers navigating the same to be two thirds at least natural born subjects of england  now as scotland of late years wanting timber or other materials for building had but very few ships of their own building they carried on the greatest part of their foreign trade in ships built in holland hamburgh the baltic or other foreign parts wherefore the english commissioners in order to set bounds to the introducing of foreign bottoms into our trade as free ships offered the clause as in the minute  it was moved in the scots behalf to give a certain time for the clearing up this point and that a ship should be deemed free at the time of the union if part of her was owned by scots men at the time of the union because as the scots traded much to holland so the merchants of amsterdam camphere etc were in part owners in company with the scots merchants of many of their ships and therefore it was thought hard that if the major part of the owners were scots men yet the ship should be deemed foreign which would either oblige the scots merchant to buy the remainder at what price the foreign owner pleased to exact or oblige him to sell and cast off the ship which he could not carry on his trade without  but as this would have clashed directly with the act of navigation and created innumerable inconveniences in trade it was left out for then foreigners had had no more to do but to interest scots men in a moiety of their ships and so have made great numbers of foreign built bottoms have passed for free ships in britain to an inexpressible damage of the english trade  this point therefore being given up it remained only to dispute the time at which any vessel belonging entirely to scots owners should be deemed free the english commissioners put it to be at the time of signing the treaty the scots commissioners insisted on the time of the commencement of the union but the reasons given against that latitude were so convincing that the scots commissioners complied with it  the principal reason was that in that interval of time the merchants of either kingdom might furnish themselves with great numbers of foreign ships which being built cheaper than the english and becoming free by this clause would be a great prejudice to trade and seeing it was the known interest of both kingdoms to encourage the building of merchants ships among themselves it could not but be the interest of both to prevent the crowding in of foreign ships among them  this was debated again in the parliament of scotland and after long discourses obtained to pass with this small alteration the time of ratifying instead of the time of signing the union as shall appear in its place  the affairs of the standards weights and measures were things admitted no debate in either kingdom so need no observation i shall give a scale of the differences hereafter because it may be useful in matters of trade  the affair of the coin made some noise abroad among the people but the answering the loss of private persons out of the equivalent put a stop to it and it was also adjusted without any hesitation  neither was there any difficulty before them about the affair of the greatseal of britain or of any regulations with respect to a seal in scotland for the passing such acts either relating to private rights or public justice but it appeared so equal that it made no difficulties even at the time of the parliament in scotland when most of the other heads admitted such strong debates  but the next thing proceeded upon was the calculation of the equivalent which a committee had been busy in settling with clerks appointed to examine the calculations and state them for the commissioners the result of which was now before them  the lord treasurer in name of the lords commissioners for england delivered to the board the following proposal which was read  the lords commissioners of the two kingdoms having appointed a committee consisting of a like number of each commission for adjusting the equivalent to be allowed to scotland for what that kingdom should become liable to answer toward payment of the debts of england by reason of their having agreed to bear the same duties of customs and excises upon all exciseable liquors and the said committee having frequently met and after a full enquiry having agreed amongst themselves and severally reported to their respective commissions that the sum of lib    0    0 sh was the equivalent to be answered to scotland according to the proportion which the present customs and excises in scotland do bear to the customs and excises upon exciseable liquors in england and the lords commissioners for england having considered and examined the said report do agree to the said sum  the lords commissioners for scotland having also insisted that after the union the kindgom of scotland becoming liable to the english duties of customs and excises upon exciseable liquors as well upon that account as upon the account of the increase of trade and people which will be the happy consequence of the said union the said two revenues will much improve of which no present valuation can be made yet nevertheless for the reasons aforesaid there ought to be a proportionable equivalent allowed to scotland the lords commissioners for england do agree that after the union there shall be an account kept of the said duties arising in scotland to the end it may appear what ought to be allowed to scotland as a proportionable equivalent for such proportion of the said increase according to the calculation aforesaid as shall be applicable to the payment of the debts of england  the lords commissioners for scotland having also by their paper delivered the    st instant proposed that the rights and privileges of the company in scotland trading to africa and the indies do continue after the union or if the privileges of that company be judged inconvenient for the trade of the united kingdom that the private rights of the said company in scotland be purchased from the said proprietors the lords commissioners for england in answer thereto say they are of opinion that the continuance of that company is inconsistent with the good of trade in the united kingdom and consequently against the interest of great britain and therefore they insist that it ought to be determined but the lords commissioners for england being sensible that the misfortunes of that company have been the occasion of misunderstandings and unkindnesses between the two kingdoms and thinking it to be above all things desirable that upon the union of the kingdoms the subjects of both may be entirely united in affection do therefore wish that regard may be had to the expenses and losses of the particular members of the said company in the manner hereaftermentioned and they hope when the lords commissioners for scotland have considered how generally that undertaking was entered upon in scotland and consequently how universal that loss was they will readily agree to the proposal  the lords commissioners for england do also think it of much consequence to england that it should be agreed in this treaty after what manner the equivalent which will amount to a great sum payable upon and after the union is to be paid and applied and being extremely desirous to bring the treaty to a speedy conclusion and in order to that as soon as may be to settle and fix the matter of the equivalent and the application thereof do agree as follows and do also make the following proposals to the lords commissioners for scotland  the lords commissioners for england do agree that upon completing the union the said sum of lib    0    0 sh being agreed upon as the equivalent for scotland shall be granted to her majesty for that use  the lords commissioners for england do also agree that upon the account to be kept as aforesaid of the improvement of the revenue of customs and excises upon exciseable liquors in scotland after the union there shall be answered to scotland an equivalent in proportion to such part of the said increase as shall be applicable to the payment of the debts of england  the lords commissioners for england do also agree that an equivalent shall be answered to scotland for such other parts of the english debts as that kingdom may hereafter become liable to pay by reason of the union  the lords commissioners for england do propose for the further and more effectual answering the several ends hereafter mentioned and proposed that from and after the union the whole increase of the revenue of customs and excises upon exciseable liquors in scotland over and above what the said revenues do now yield shall go and be applied for the term of seven years to the uses hereafter mentioned  and upon the said agreements and proposal the lords commissioners for england do further propose that her majesty be empowered to appoint commissioners who shall be accomptable to the parliament of great britain for disposing the said sum of    0   lib  0 to be granted as af resaid and also of all other moneys which shall arise upon the agreements and proposal aforesaid to the purposes following   that out of the said sum of    0   lib  0 all the public debts of the kingdom of scotland and also the capital stock or fund of the african and indian company of scotland together with the interest for the said capital stock after the rate of   p cent p annum from the respective times of payment thereof shall be paid and that immediately upon such payment of the said capital stock and interest the said company shall be dissolved and shall cease provided nevertheless that from the time of passing the act for raising the said sum of    0   lib  0 the said company shall neither trade nor give license to trade  the lords commissioners for england do further propose that after payment of the said public debts and refounding the said capital stock in manner aforesaid the overplus of the said sum of   0   lib  0 sh and also the whole improvement of the revenue of customs and excises upon exciseable liquors above the present value which shall arise during the term of seven years from the commencement of the union as aforesaid together with the equivalent which shall become due upon account of the improvement of the customs and excises on liquors in scotland after the said seven years and all other sums which according to the agreement aforesaid may become payable to scotland by way of equivalent for what that kingdom shall hereafter become liable to answer for the debts of england may be applied in the manner following  that out of the same what consideration shall be found necessary to be had for any losses which private persons may sustain in reduceing the coin of scotland to the standard of england mention whereof is made in another paper delivered by the lords commissioners for scotland the    st instant may be made good and afterward the same shall be wholly employed toward encouraging and promoting the fisherys and such other manufacturys and improvements in that part of britain called scotland as may most conduce to the general good of the united kingdom  adjourned to wednesday the   th instant   in the evening  observation xii in making observations on the affair of the african company it may be necessary to state that part of the african affair as belongs to this immediate debate  the african company having as has been related in the beginning of this work met with several disasters and misfortunes in some of which the national interests of england and scotland had but too much clashed and which had been the occasion of a great deal of ill blood between them it was absolutely necessary in the bringing to pass an union between the kingdoms to remove every occasion of discontent and particularly every interfereing interest being inconsistent with a complete entire union the thing now aimed at there was therefore an absolute necessity to remove or reconcile every thing of that nature as far as possible before such an union could be made  the scots commissioners were in the right to propose that their african company should be supported and defended as a private right all rights and privileges of corporations and companies being to be reserved and this having been a national concern in which they had but made an essay and miscarrying in their first attempt had let it rest for a while but had various prospects of future projects and attempts it could not be equal to oblige them to quit these prospects and their legal right to a trade to the indies which was so valuable in other countries and which might in time restore their losses and therefore they proposed the reserving to themselves the charters rights and privileges of their african and indian company  on the other hand the case of england made this impracticable for whereas there was already a company established in england formed and with great difficulty united into one from two contending and powerful companies and that these were entirely supported and depended upon their exclusive charters by which no other persons could trade to the indies but themselves or by their permission if this company established in scotland had continued after the union the article for a free intercourse of trade between the nations had immediately opened to them all the ports of england for their ships and goods and it had been in event a perfect laying open the east india trade or at least erecting a new east india company in britain which whoever knows the difficulty of uniting the last contending companies and the injury they did both their trade in particular and the whole nation of england in general before they could be brought together will acknowledge is not to be born within britain  this the scots commissioners foresaw and therefore very frankly proposed the alternative viz that if the privileges of that company shall be judged inconvenient for the trade of the rest of the united kingdom that the private rights of the said company in scotland be purchased from the proprietors  this was the least that could be demanded for if england found it impracticable to suffer or intolerable to their two companies to bear it was but reasonable that the company who was to quit its right should have satisfaction for parting with that right and the next question was therefore what must this purchase be and who must pay it and this was no small point  england was so clear and fair in all their offers as to the equivalent that the scots commissioners were in a manner prevented in every thing they had to ask the offers of a full recompense in money advanced for all the money which scotland should be charged to pay toward the english debts and of applying the whole remaining revenue of scotland for the encouraging trade and employing the poor had in it so much evidence of the hearty design of the english commissioners to consider every thing for the good of the community after the union that it could bear but little objection it seemed therefore but reasonable that the scots should at their own charge put themselves in condition of uniting that is that if they had any national obstruction which was inconsistent with the designed union and without removing which it could not be made that then the removing that difficulty should ly at their door  it was this kind of reasoning which directed the purchase of the private rights of the african company in scotland to be made out of the equivalent money and to which after very little debate as you may see both parties agreed  then the question was what price should these private rights be purchased at and this would have met with great difficulties some magnifying the prospects of their company in trade as a thing not to be valued and which alone was able to enrich their nation others lessening it in the most contemptible manner as a thing that not only had now but never had any prospect or possibility of success as it had been managed of which by it self   but the method proposed appeared so fair that it left no room for objection it being a valuation from the true original viz that every private adventurer should be put in the same condition as he was in at first supposing his money put out to interest  so that every man was to receive his full original capital stock which he had at first advanced and   per cent interest to the time of payment  nor can i forbear saying that the surprise of this offer had various effects upon the people for this stock was a dead weight upon a great many families who wanted very much the return of so much money it had not only been long disbursd but it was generally speaking abandoned to despair and the money given over for lost nay so entirely had people given up all hopes that a man might even after this conclusion of the treaty have bought the stock at  0 pound for an hundred and after all this to find the whole money should come in again with interest for the time was a happy surprise to a great many families and took off the edge of the opposition which some people would otherwise have made to the union in general  wednesday the    th june   0  her majesty came to the meeting and being seated in her chair spoke to the lords commissioners as follows my lords  i am come hither once more to see what further progress you have made in this treaty and to press a speedy conclusion of it in regard my servants of scotland cannot without great inconveniency be much longer absent from that kingdom    after which her majesty was

england delivered to the board the following paper which was read  the lords commissioners who are on the part of england of the committee of lords of both kingdoms nominated the first of may last to consider matters to them referred having reported to us the lords commissioners for england that the said committee had referred to six persons the stating in what proportion the present customs of scotland as now let do bear to the several branches of that revenue in england and also in what proportion the present excise upon liquors in scotland as now let do bear to the several branches of that revenue in england in order to the stating of the equivalent that would become due to scotland for so much of the said two revenues as should be applied toward the payment of the debts of england which was accordingly done as in no   and that the said six persons had also by their lordships directions prepared a calculation what so much of the said two revenues of scotland as should be applied toward payment of the debts of england would produce of ready money as in no   the said six persons had also calculated that in case the said two revenues should increase above what they are now let for  000 lib on the customs and  000 lib on the excise how much thereof would contribute toward the payment of the debts of england and for which scotland is to have an equivalent as in no   all which papers their lordships having now laid before us we the lords commissioners for england do agree to the same and that all the said papers be entered by the respective secretarys in the journals of this treaty  adjourned to tuesday the   th instant   in the evening  observation xiii i might make observations here upon the manner of stating the equivalent for in a matter of that moment it is not to be doubted but there were various judgments past projects founded and proposals made on every side for the bringing this ifficult thing to bear in which every body spoke according to their several judgments and as i noted before every man supposed this such an insuperable difficulty that it would never have been mastered in the treaty and therefore various schemes were made  the main difficulty as i have hinted already was the proposal it self of an equivalent and indeed without this it had been impossible to bring this union to a conclusion nor was the way ever seen clear toward a union till the project of an equivalent was thought of the manner of it therefore might consequently be supposed to introduce equal difficulty some proposed it in an annual payment of interest to scotland of lib  0000 per annum or  00000 lib in money to be stated at   lib per cent  but the people that made these proposals built upon the supposition of the scots revenues paying a far greater share of the english debt than upon a further search into the several articles appeared probable and at best built upon imaginary increases on one side and imaginary expenses on the other as will appear by the following schemes of the improved taxes of scotland after the union  an estimate of what the revenue of scotland may produce after the union when upon the foot of the english taxes customs  0000 excise  0000 malt and salt taxes  0000 crown lands  000 stamped paper etc  0000 land tax  0000    000 l p an  i should not record this imaginary and erroneous scheme but to illustrate and show the necessity and original of the true perhaps the author of this scheme had as near a view as any body at that time of day could come at  but when the commissioners on both sides came to form themselves into a committee to state this so as that neither kingdom might object they found themselves under a necessity of keeping a medium between two dangerous extremes that the scots on one hand might not plead a disparity of allowance and consequently deny its being an equivalent which would overthro the foundation and the english might not complain they were wronged in the calculation and paid more for the proportion than it was worth  to bring this therefore to a head they went back to the principles which was an infallible rule to judge by and taking the customs and excises of scotland which were the only taxes which could be appropriated to the payment of english debts and stating them at the present produce as they were then farmed out they advance to the scots as much money as the annual produce of those sums appropriated as above comes to  this was capable of a most exact calculation to the least fraction and was exactly cast up as in the tables annexed to the minutes which i have also printed that posterity may see how exactly this matter was carried between both and may for ever be satisfied with the justice which was done them in either nation  the calculation being made exactly for the present revenue of scotland it was not for the commissioners to attempt a real advance upon imaginary increases which might or might not come to pass as trade might or might not be enlarged by the union but to remove all possible objections they first state how much shall be appropriate to the payment of the english debts upon every thousand pound that any of the revenues of scotland shall thereafter advance and then appointing an exact account to be kept of such advance agree that scotland shall be reimbursed by way of equivalent as much as shall be paid out of such advanced revenues and that commissioners be appointed both to see the calculations made and accounts kept and also to pay the said equivalent as it becomes due  this was so clear so just and so unexceptiond a method that it could admit of no dispute and brought the most intricate part of the whole treaty to a happy conclusion  the question about the manner of payment was now all that remained and the proposal for an annual interest found no room for this had been but the same thing with letting the revenues of scotland pay themselves as it came in nor could it enable scotland to answer the encumbrances which were then upon her and which it behoved her to clear her self of to make way for the union such as the paying of or purchasing the capital stock of the african company etc making good the deficiency of the coin paying the public debts etc  to solve this the calculation being made they proposed to estimate the value of the proportions which scotland would so pay of the english debts and reduce them to a rate in present money according to the common estimates then current for advanced payment to the government and that then england should pay the full sum down in ready money the payment to become due upon the signing the union  this was thought not only just but advantageous to scotland and indeed necessary to her to supply the stagnation which might be upon the current cash of that kingdom on the alteration of the coin and to cause money to circulate among them which was then much wanted  this part of the calculation i have therefore caused to be printed here as it stands in the books of the commissioners to clear up the particulars and to convince the nicest objectors with what exactness and equal proportion every part of this transaction was carried on  an account of the value of the annual sums contributed out of the customs of scotland according to the present produce thereof toward the anticipated funds of the customs of england viz l   0  per annum from the    th march   0  until the    th june    0 estimated in present money      l       per annum from    th march   0  to the first of august    0 estimated at    0  l      per annum from    th march   0  to the  0 th september    0 estimated at       l    0 per annum from the    th march   0  for    years commencing the   th of march   0  at the rate of fifteen years and three months purchase comes to       l       per annum from the customs l        a computation of the value of the annual sums contributed out of the scotch excise estimated at    00 lib per annum toward the anticipated excise funds in england viz   0  lib per annum out of the excise in scotland toward payment of annuities for    years which are charged on the   00 lib a week arising out of the hereditary and temporary excise in england at    years three months purchase comes to  0   0  0      lib per annum contributed out of the excise in scotland toward payment of annuities amounting to        lib per annum charged on ix d per barrel excise in england whereof        lib per annum is for the remainder of a term of    years commencing    th january      and      lib per annum for lives with the advantage of survivorship so that      lib of the      lib per annum will be for the remainder of the said term of    years and     lib thereof for lives with the advantage of survivorship and so much thereof as is for the remainder of a term of    years being rated at    years and   months purchase comes to       lib    sh and the remainder being deemed of equal value with a term of  0 years comes to      lib in the whole   00        0 lib per annum contributed out of the excise in scotland toward payment of      0 l per ann charged on another   d per barrel excise in england part in perpetuity part for    years part for   lives and part for   lives whereof      l of the said    0 l per ann will be in perpetuity     l for    years    l for   lives and  0  lib for   lives so much as is in perpetuity and for    years being rated at    years and   months purchase so much as is for   lives being rated at    years purchase and so much as is for   lives at    years purchase amount in the whole at those rates to  0     0      lib per annum contributed out of the excise in scotland for payment of annuities charged on another ix d per barrel excise in england for    years at    years and three months purchase comes to    0         lib per annum contributed out of the excise in scotland for   years and   months commencing    th march   0  applicable as the duty on low wines in england for that time is computed to be worth      lib  0  0   0 from the customs       total sum being the same as the equivalent    0    0  from this calculation it also appears that every  000 l increase on the excise will pay toward the debts of england lib     ditto  on the customs      tuesday the  th july   0  the lords commissioners of both kingdoms agreed to revive the committee of eight who

this treaty thus far purely from a conviction that we have done therein to god your majesty and our countries good service yet we are far from thinking that what we have done will or ought to be of any weight or authority elsewhere but do most entirely submit these our labors to the high wisdom of your majesty and both your parliaments to stand or fall by the reason justice and public utility on which they are founded  your majestys royal presence and seasonable admonitions to us at the fittest junctures were we most thankfully acknowledge a very great encouragement and assistance to us in

graciously pleased to recomend it has enabled us to bring this treaty to a happy and speedy conclusion to the mutual satisfaction of the commissioners on both sides and we shall esteem it our greatest happiness if what we have prepared be acceptable to your majesty and ratified by the parliaments of both kingdoms without which what we have done can be of no authority  an union of the two kingdoms

treaty in scotland and thus the treaty at london ended which though it seemed very perfect in all its parts and as abundance of people thought could not want any corrections yet as by the sequel appeared the most difficult work was yet to do  i know some were of the opinion that this treaty could admit of no additions amendments or alterations and that the words in the respective acts of parliament previous to it which said provided that nothing in this treaty should be binding to either nation unless it shall be ratified in the respective parliament of both kingdoms employed that the respective parliaments had no power to enter into the articles separately and apart but only debating on the whole to approve or disapprove ratify or reject it as a treaty  i shall not trouble the reader with any of the reasons given for this notion nor make any other remark upon it than this  that the people who were for this opinion were of two sorts and both such as the nations on either side were very little beholding to    they were such who having no great concern for the essential part of the treaty viz the good of their country were for taking all upon trust and concerned not themselves either with the event or with the circumstances and therefore without any difficulty were willing to put all upon a mere plurality of voices not much regarding whether it went this way or that i shall be kinder to these gentlemen than to record their names or leave them so eminent in folly to be known by posterity lest their children should be told hereafter how little their country was obliged to them    the other sort whose follies ought equally to be concealed i mean as to naming them were such who were willing to have them put to the question in gross presuming   that either their being so voted would hand them down clogged with so many inconveniences as would in time force the nations to break the articles or bringing them to the necessity of falling to pieces the treaty should dissolve of course or   that being voted in general with so many apparent difficulties as they pretended to see in them they would infallibly be lost in this parliament and so as formerly the whole treaty come to nothing   that these people aimed not at shortning the labor but at cutting off the union it self is manifest and it was but too apparent afterward since debates and that in every article by which they plainly made it appear that they did not argue so much to rectify and amend as to destroy not so much to make the articles more perfect or more explicit more advantageous or more satisfying but to annihilate them as articles and dissolve the very life and being of the treaty and this appeared in that through all the debates that happened afterward they showed themselves equally against every article and at the same time that they objected against things very seldom concerned themselves to propose the alternatives but rather pusht at overthrowing the substance of the thing and if possible to urge the most necessary articles as impracticable and inconsistent  as on the one hand this discovered the design of the persons to be not amending but destroying the articles so it manifestly exposed their ignorance either of their own strength in scotland or of the strength of their friends in the south in both which parts had their weak politics prevailed to have put the treaty in general to a vote they would have lost it by a majority of voices the generality of both nations being fully convinced of the absolute necessity of a union and would rather have voted it without the amendments than have lost it  if i am asked how i prove this i think i have a very good foundation for it   in the motions first made in the parliament house in scotland november     0  when the strength of the house as they call it was effectually tried   it was moved that the parliament now proceed to the farther and more particular consideration of the articles of the union in order to approve them or not nota the articles had been read and discoursed on severally in the house and had taken up sixteen days barely reading them one by one to hear what one another could say and to give the members light into the particulars viz from the fifteenth of october to the first of november    upon this first motion another followed viz that the farther consideration of the union be yet delayed for some considerable time that the sentiments of the parliament of england thereanent be known and that the members of parliament may consult those they represent  vide the minutes of parliament numb    but neither of these attempts could be carried in the house nor could they bring the motion to a vote in the terms the proposal was made viz of consulting constituents or waiting till the english parliament should sit  to both which i shall speak in their turn  i only mention it here to show that it was apparent these motions proceeded only from a desire to gain time which they thought might furnish a variety of accidents to disappoint the whole  and the many weak attempts and low steps some gentlemen took if possible to delay the proceedings plainly showed the very juncture of time when this was doing was one of the greatest unhappinesses as they thought it which befell the party   but i prove this further by the unanimity of the english parliament in passing the treaty and ratifying without any amendment what they thought they had clogged with so many inequalities on the other side that it could never go down with them   i shall further convince the reader of the manifest design of the party against the union as such  from their frequent attempts to clog the articles with such things as they knew it was impossible the parliament of england could grant  as a liberty to export wool etc different drawbacks and different prohibitions in trade differing and disproportioned excises customs and taxes etc of which i shall take the freedom to speak in their turn  but being disappointed in these they found the parliament of england so unanimous that they past all their amendments some of which were such as the party having merely clamoured the house into were really past not so much for any respect to their true signification as for the sake of giving some satisfaction to uneasy people  how much more then the parliament of england would have past the whole treaty unaltered is very evident and consequently it is as plain that these people had taken no aim in their offering to vote the articles in the gross upon a presumption that it would be a mean to make the whole miscarry  the treaty being concluded in england and the commissioners separated the next thing was the meeting of the respective parliaments of the two kingdoms for ratification of the articles  the parliament of scotland was first being to meet the third of october   0   the queen was represented in this parliament by the duke of queensberry  i know it is not the part of a historian to make panegericks and i think i have given demonstrations to the world as to my self that i will flatter no man  but i cannot but give this testimony here that the prudence calmness temper and moderation of this noble person had these two visible effects   it gave a wonderful testimony to the queens judgment and the right notions she had entertained of the true state not of her affairs only but of her people that her majesty knew this work must be carried on not by too much fire or too much water neither by want of zeal or too much zeal that here was an insolent party to deal with who must be born with not exasperated calmed not enraged that here would be as much difficulty required to deal with friends as with enemies to reconcile jarring interests clashing parties and keep all in temper  here was a strong party for the union but they were made up of several parties just come together as for the occasion they were like epicuruss attoms by a strange fortuitous chance of concurring circumstances brought to join in this who were perfect antipodes in all their former measures and could never agree to act together before it was not a matter of the least consequence to bring together and keep together strong and differing parties who acted even in this very thing from different views and some with directly contrary designs  and it was all the way as fatiguing to keep some gentlemen in suited temper for this great work as to oppose the fire and fury of those that set themselves against it  under the solid consideration of all this and with a full view of the difficulties at least in general her majesty pitches upon the duke of queensberry as a person of temper prudence and moderation unexceptionable in knowledge of what was before him resolute in pursuing it through all difficulties and of a calm courage in all the passive part of it of which i shall speak more at large hereafter   it had this particular advantage that it was in a great measure the only thing that carried this difficult work on that the duke in all the heats and animosities of the party in all the convulsions of the kingdom carried on the treaty with easiness temper and extraordinary conduct not taking advantages of the rashness and rudeness of the people pitying rather than apprehending danger from their folly he kept his hand upon the work his eye upon the principals of the opposite party he disappointed all their measures he let himself into the darkest of their counsels  he pursued the main and great work in hand  and with a contempt above my power to express received all their insults laughed at their threatenings treated them courteously and calmly under the most intolerable carriage  and this under the supreme conduct was the only step by which this great work could have been brought to pass   had warmer heads been listened to had resentment been prevailing had provocations almost beyond the power of flesh and blood to bear been prevailing  and i must own who was an eye witness to it all that i often wondered how it was possible to bear such things i say had the gentlemen of warmer heads been listened to nay even with strong reasonings and from men of sound judgments too  all had been undone and the nation had been in a flame we had been destroyed not delivered the government had been dissolved not united and britain had by this time been the seat of blood not an united and prospering nation  but this by the way the parliament being to meet her majestys high commissioner hastened down to scotland and the queen on all occasions expressing her hopes that this treaty would come to a happy issue  it was generally expected it would be received with the same cheerfulness and alacrity in scotland and all our eyes were bent upon the meeting of the approaching parliament  in this general expectation i cannot forbear hinting here that my curiosity pressed me to take a journey thither and being by all my friends to whom i communicated my design encouraged to think i might be useful there to prompt a work that i was fully convinced was for the general good of the whole island and particularly necessary for the strengthening the protestant interest i was moved purely on these accounts to undertake a long winter a chargeable and as it proved a hazardous journey   i contemn as not worth mentioning the suggestions of some people of my being employed thither to carry on the interest of a party  i have never loved any parties but with my utmost zeal have sincerely espoused the great and original interest of this nation and of all nations i mean truth and liberty  and who ever are of that party i desire to be with them  however by this journey i had the opportunity of seeing and hearing all the particulars of the following transactions and of using my best endeavors to answer the many many and i must say of some of them the most frivolous and ridiculous objections formed and improved there with great industry against every article of the union and this is my reason for mentioning it here that i may acquaint posterity how i came to the knowledge of what i write and for no ostentation at all and as i had the honor to be frequently sent for into the several committees of parliament which were appointed to state some difficult points relating to equalities taxes prohibitions etc it is for those gentlemen to say whether i was useful or not that is none of my business here but by this means i have the greater assurance to relate the circumstances and fact as it stood before them and can not be afraid of being detected in any material mistake  and as this is the reason of my making any mention of my self so the reader cannot but be content to know from what foundation this relation is handed down to posterity and what assurance he has that the author he reads was capable of giving him a right state of the matter  i have hinted already with what freedom the scriblers of the age if i may give them that title took upon them in the beginning of this affair to determine what sort of union was proper to be treated of and every one having vented his politics this way and that way as his interest or party or particular imployer dictated we thought that storm had been over when the parliament first sat down in scotland the generality of people seemed very easy and forward for a union in general as what had long indeed been the desire of the whole nation and therefore the strange alienation of the humors of the people on the general part of it was the more wonderful and the more unexpected of which and its causes i am now to speak of the effects i shall be more particular hereafter  on the third of october the parliament met his grace her majestys high commissioner opened the session according to the usual forms  first her majestys letter to the parliament was presented to the house by the high commissioner and being received was read by the lord clerk register and is as follows  anne r my lords and gentlemen since your last meeting we did nominat commissioners to treat of an union betwixt our two kingdoms of scotland and england and by their great care and diligence a treaty is happily concluded and laid before us  we have called you together as soon as our affairs could permit that the treaty may be under your consideration in pursuance of the act made in the last session of our parliament there and we hope the terms will be acceptable to you  the union has been long desired by both nations and we shall esteem it as the greatest glory of our reign to have it now perfected being fully persuaded that it must prove the greatest happiness of our people  an entire and perfect union will be the solid foundation of lasting peace it will secure your religion liberty and property remove the animosities amongst your selves and the jealousies and differences betwixt our two kingdoms it must increase your strength riches and trade and by this union the whole island being joined in affection and free from all apprehension of different interests will be enabled to resist all its enemies support the protestant interest every where and maintain the liberties of europe  we do upon this occasion renew the assurances we have formerly given you of our resolution to maintain the government of the church as by law established in scotland and the acts of both parliaments upon which this treaty proceeded having reserved their respective governments of the church in each kingdom the commissioners have left that matter entire and you have now an opportunity for doing what may be necessary for security of your present church government after the union within the limits of scotland  the support of our government and your own safety does require that you do make necessary provision for maintaining the forces ships and garrisons until the parliament of great britain shall provide for these ends in the united kingdom  we have made choice of our right trusty and right entirely beloved cousin and counselor james duke of queensberry to be our commissioner and represent our royal person being well satisfied with his fitness for that trust from the experience we have of his capacity zeal and fidelity to our service and the good of his country which as it has determined us in the choice we doubt not but will make him acceptable to you  we have fully instructed him in all things we think may fall under your consideration and seems to be necessary at present therefore we desire that you may give entire trust and credit to him  my lords and gentlemen  it cannot but be an encouragement to you to finish the union at this time that god almighty has blessed our arms and those of our allies with so great success which gives us the nearer prospect of a happy peace and with it you will have the full possession of all the advantages of this union and you have no reason to doubt but the parliament of england will do what is necessary on their part after the readiness they have shown to remove what might obstruct the entering on the treaty we most earnestly recommend to you calmness and unanimity in this great and weighty affair that the union may be brought to a happy conclusion being the only effectual way to secure your present and future happiness and to disappoint the designs of our and your enemies who will doubtless on this occasion use their outmost endeavors to prevent or delay this union which must so much contribute to our glory and the happiness of our people and so we bid you heartily farewell given at our court at windsor castle the thirty first day of july   0  and of our reign the fifth year  by her majestys command mar  this letter having been twice read the duke of queensberry seconded the queens letter with the following speech my lords and gentlemen  her majesty by her gracious letter has acquainted you that the treaty of union between the kingdoms of scotland and england pursuant to an act made in your last session has been happily agreed on which is now in my lord registers hands ready to be laid before you  the lords commissioners for this kingdom have been diligent and zealous in concerting just and reasonable terms and it must be acknowledged we met with a very fair and friendly disposition in the lords commissioners on the other part  the treaty has with all humility been presented to the queen and was most graciously received and though no reign was ever so truly great for wise and steady councils and so many important successes as that of her majesty yet you see she is pleased to esteem the perfecting of this union as the greatest glory of her reign being the most solid foundation of a lasting security to the protestant religion and the liberties of europe and of peace and happiness to her people  these reasons i doubt not will make the treaty acceptable to you and i persuade my self that you will proceed with such calmness and impartiality as the weight of the subject requires and as becomes so great an assembly  the lords commissioners for both kingdoms were limited in the matter of church government for the security of presbyterian government in this church you have the laws already made for its establishment the queens repeated assurances to preserve it and i am empowered to consent to what may be further necessary after the union  her majesty has been pleased to recommend to you to make provision for the forces ships and garrisons which is very necessary the subsidies granted at your last meeting being run out so i doubt not you will speedily renew them  my lords and gentlemen  i am not insensible of the difficulties that attend the weighty character it has pleased her majesty to honor me with but with your favorable assistance upon which i very much rely i hope by my zeal and fidelity for her majestys service and the good of my country which are inseparable to discharge my duty on this extraordinary occasion    and this was followed with another speech by the earl of seafield lord chancellor of scotland which i have also inserted here as follows my lords and gentlemen  it has been and is the great happiness of this nation that the queen our sovereign has always made it the chief design of her reign to protect her subjects in the enjoyment of all their rights and privileges to promove their good and to establish their peace and prosperity upon sure and lasting foundations  for these ends her majesty in her most gracious letter does with great earnestness recommend to you the concluding of the union of the two kingdoms and has plainly and fully laid before you the great advantages that this union must bring with it to all britain and in particular to this kingdom  the lords commissioners named by her majesty for this kingdom to treat of this union have endeavored to discharge this great trust with all fidelity and have agreed to such terms and conditions as i hope shall be found just honorable and advantageous the treaty has been already received very graciously by her majesty and is now ready to be reported to you for your consideration  i do not think it proper at this time to descend into the particular articles of the treaty i shall only beg leave to say in general that it must be of great advantage to have this whole island unite under one government and conjoined entirely in interest and affection having equality of all rights and privileges with a free communication and intercourse of trade which must certainly establish our security augment our strength and increase our trade and riches  we can never expect a more favorable juncture for completing this union than at present when her majesty has not only recommended it but declared that she will esteem it the greatest glory of her reign to have it perfected and when the parliament of england has shown their inclinations for it by removing all these obstacles that did ly in the way of the treaty and it must also be acknowledged that the lords commissioners for england did testify their good disposition all along in this affair and the great and glorious successes wherewith god has blessed her majestys arms and those of her allies give us the hope of a near and advantageous peace whereby we will be put in the possession and attain to the full enjoyment of all the liberties and privileges of trade now offered by the treaty  the commissioners of both sides have only treated of such things as concern the civil government liberties privileges trade and taxes but found themselves limited as to the church government that being reserved to each kingdom by the respective acts of parliament upon which the treaty proceeded and you have now not only the laws already made with her majestys most gracious repeated assurances for maintaining and continuing presbyterian church government within this kingdom but this further opportunity of making such conditions and provisions as shall be found necessary for its security after the conclusion of this union within the limits of scotland  her majesty recommends to you to provide the necessary supplies for the troops garrisons and ships the funds formerly given are expired and therefore i doubt not but you will easily comply with what is so plainly necessary for the preservation of the public safety and preventing the designs of enemies now in time of war  my lords and gentlemen  since we have now the opportunity of establishing for our selves and our posterity by this union with england all that concerns our religion and liberties together with the most valuable privileges of trade i am hopeful that you will proceed to the consideration of the articles of the treaty in such manner as shall bring it to the desired conclusion and it cannot but tend to the lasting honor of this session of parliament to have so happily finished this most important and weighty matter    i choose to place these speeches here rather than in the appendix because they so immediately relate to the story and to the continuance of the thread of the story which now comes to be discoursed of that i thought they could not be so properly transposed  i shall not enter here into the particular vote of every day having abstracted those things by way of journal in another part of the work with notes upon them drawn from my own observation and from the generous assistance of many honorable gentlemen present in the very occurrences of every day and of impartial unbyassed judgment in the affair it self  but one thing i must remark here viz  the first thing the house did after the speeches above was to call for the treaty of the union as it was drawn up and signed by the commissioners  and having caused it to be read in the house  upon some general debate which lasted not long it was ordered to be printed and copies to be delivered to the members of parliament which was accordingly done  till this very day all things had gone on well and the people in general were very well pleased with the thoughts of the union  they had not yet had subject for the turbulent spirits to work upon and having in general only discoursed upon the advantages of both sides which were indeed in themselves visible enough  the clamorous party which followed had not concerted their measures from what topics to work upon the humors of the people  no sooner then were the articles printed and put into the hands of the people  but the gentlemen who set themselves up against them began to preach upon the general heads as their humor and talent instructed them in order to possess the people against the particulars  i cannot but distinguish here between the several parties that now opposed the union in my observation there were four several sorts of people who were against this treaty and who either within doors or without either in parliament in commission or in conversation joined to oppose clamor at or object against the union and it is really necessary here to distinguish of them that when i talk as i shall have frequent occasion in the process of this story of the opposers and the parties opposing it may by the manner of their opposing be distinguished who is meant for i shall not name persons in my discourse of those things not thinking it necessary to make this history a satyr upon any one family or record to posterity the steps they took in particular or their reasons for it in this affair  where particular actions more than ordinary public have distinguished persons that is their own act and deed and lies not at my door but to come to the heads of parties    there was the professed jacobite party who opposed the treaty purely on the account of the succession which they saw evidently was struck at and would be effectually fixed contrary to their principles and eternally exclusive of the family they adhered to and these declared their aversion to the union upon all occasions publicly and fairly and for ought i know were some of the honestest of the enemies to the treaty    there was the diffenters from the church or the episcopal party these opposed the union also publicly as it tended in its consequences entirely to settle the presbyterian establishment for ever to foreclose them and bar the door against all possibility of their recovering the government of the church in the manner they desired since they saw but too plainly however blind others were to it that this treaty would so settle the presbyterian establishment in scotland and so fortify it by law that if ever they should attempt to recover the hierarchy of episcopacy here even the very episcopal church their own brethren in england would be obliged to oppose and suppress them  and these so far as they acted fairly were honest and open enemies also to the union    there was a mistaken people i hope i may say so much of my own opinion without offense for truly i think them mistaken who tho this union was calculated entirely for their safety and tended to their indissoluble establishment as by the alarm of their enemies was very visibly demonstrated yet were drawn in by their fears and i doubt those fears too much inflamed by the policy and wicked artifice of whisperers and disguised enemies to oppose the union as dangerous to the church and as interfereing with the several public engagements the nation had entered into  these or most of them were honest wellmeaning and some of them most pious and valuable people however some of them might sin against moderation in the manner of their dissenting and a little too warmly push on their private opinions  of these people i shall be far from saying any thing severe for indeed i cannot think any thing ill of them i mean as to intentional evil the weakness any of them might discover in forwarding countenancing or giving a name to the disorders of the times was rather the artifice of a party who eneavoured to inflame the nation and put the appearance of it upon them writing their names upon every action and intituling every tumult to their protection  but descending to particulars we shall find that however forward and if their enemies desire it i will venture to say indiscreet some of them might be in discovering their sentiments with warmth in conversation yet upon all public occasions their whole opposition of the treaty was confined to legal applications and peaceable endeavors the tumult at dumfries only excepted for as to that of glasgow it was wholly jacobite mere rabble and tumult of that party and the poor blinded commonality deluded and imposed upon by them contrary to the opinions and without the assistance of the people i am speaking of as will appear hereafter    but lastly there was a party who vigorously and violently by all manner of artifice trick and underhand dealing opposed this union merely upon politic enigmas reasons of party founded upon state principles ambition emulation partypick prejudices and a vast variety of unhappy conjunctions as served to inflame and agitate their spirits against it  and as these were many of them gentlemen of the first rank and some of them otherwise even well enough affected to both the succession and to the church so i shall show more respect to their persons than to record them in a case which i promise my self they will some time or other reckon it their misfortune to have opposed and perhaps be as zealous now its finished to preserve as they were before it was finished to prevent  yet i must confess it was to these gentlemen we owe the amusing the nation with so many unhappy prejudices the alarming them with such ungrounded apprehensions and the embarking the common people against it merely on the appearing of such men in it on whose judgments and on whose quality they had so much dependence  these were the fatal people against this treaty these struggled within doors and without these brought to pass that monstrous conjunction of opposite and discording parties and brought the jacobites to cry out for the succession the episcopal people to want security for the presbyterian church the tory to cry out breach of covenant and the well minded presbyterian ignorantly excite the people to a rabble  these went about preaching opposition in every shape just as it suited the people they had to do with they undertook to join cameronian and persecutor presbyterian and papist protestant succession and jacobitism parties as opposite as the elements as distant as the poles and these are the people i desire to be understood of when in this book i talk in general of the opposers of this union i name no body whoever the coat fits they are welcome to wear it  having thus described the parties it would be endless to enter into their several methods by which they concurred together i do not say confederated for that was impracticable their several aims considered but all concurred nevertheless to put the management of this affair into the following confusions  till the printing of these articles as i have already noted the people were generally very desirous of the union as a thing which tended to the putting an end to all former animosities burying the ancient feuds between the nations and removing the apprehensions good people on both sides had justly entertained of a new rupture in case of the queens demise  but no sooner were these articles printed and dispersed but as if every body had set themselves to raise objections form scruples and find faults in them the whole nation fell into a general kind of labor in canvassing banding and cavilling at the conditions    the poor people were terrifyed with the apprehensions of insupportable taxes loss of employment want of all things and large payments upon their salt and malt  they were again filled with strange stories of being sold to the english their parliament crown scepter and even their name as a nation to be lost and all carried to england    the merchants were frighted with printed schemes of excessive customs and impositions and the strangest projects of trade were spread about the kingdom that ever were seen which being gotten into the heads of those people who yet by their concern in trade one would have thought in common charity should have known better were so managed that it is hardly possible to believe such preposterous notions could prevail upon people otherwise knowing enough such as   the profitableness of a trade to france tho all the returns from thence was in perishable goods such as wines brandy and trifles for consumption at home    the unprofitableness of a trade to england whither their export of cattle and linen amounting to above two hundred thousand pound sterling per annum brought back very little but ready money  those were strange things but so popularly pushed on that they amused the whole nation and the poor people were told the union would beggar the country and starve the nation and this talked up to an extravagant height made the poor perfectly distracted  taxes were calculated without allowing for the advantages of the customs in other cases taken off without considering the taxes on malt and salt were remote and probable never to be laid without considering proportions equalities and the reasons nature or necessity of things that the poor people were exasperated to the highest degree and filled with apprehensions that they should have neither food to eat nor beer to drink that they were just to be sacrificed to the english be subdued ruined and destroyed    those articles which left some things contingent to the parliamentary jurisdiction were improved to persuade the people that all their laws liberties estates and whatever was near and dear to them was left entirely to the determination and absolute disposal of the british parliament in which they being to have but a small representation supposing their own members to be always unbiased and impartial they should always be overruled outvoted oppressed and subjected to talk to them in this case of the words unalterable and perpetual was to say nothing to say the british parliament could make no alterations was to say nothing these things had so filled the heads of the people that nothing could pacify them    but above all this and which was yet most unhappy as it tended to an universal alarm and to embark a great many sober and well affected people against it it was carefully represented to be dangerous to the church government that all the establishment would be subjected to a vote of parliament and a parliament where the prelates had a voice against them that if the bishops should please to vote episcopacy into scotland they getting a majority in the parliament it would be done that the church would be ruined that if she obtained a tolleration it was the most that could be expected in this case and that was precarious and uncertain and what they must come a begging to the bishops for this made an unspeakable disorder in the minds of the people and all the methods taken to convince them that the parliament could not encroach upon the church or any ways concern themselves about it were to no purpose they declared the act of security to be insufficient railed at the scots parliaments consenting in blank to the establishment of the church of england and inveighed against a tolleration of episcopacy here which they said would be the consequence    and last of all came an universal cry that this was a plain breach of the national covenant and solemn league by which the nation had bound themselves by oath to god almighty among other things to endeavor the pulling down the episcopal hierarchy and to reform to the utmost of their power the church of england also  all these things were not only brought as arguments but pushed with so much heat so much want of charity and courtesy that really it began to break all good neighborhood it sowred all societies and the national quarrel broke into families who were ever jangling divided and opposite one among another  nor was there any offering the expositions no not of their own divines who had declared that the obligations of the covenant entitled them to no other endeavor of reforming the church of england but such as consisted in prayers exhortations christian arguments and examples vide doctor rules vindication of the church of scotland p    however there was no talking to the people at this time nothing but patience and time could be expected to remedy it  in this juncture and if possible to complete the distractions of the people one gentleman by name mr hodges and who had formerly been supposed to write for the common good of scotland and was rewarded for it by parliament by what fate party passion or prejudice remains to this day a doubt  writes a large book against an incorporate union in which he abuses and reproaches england as a faithless wicked treacherous and abominable nation and that to unite with her was to entail gods judgment on scotland for her national sins a sad instance of the temper of these times  in this book he sets down two and thirty interfereing interests between the nations which he pretends it is impossible to reconcile it is writ with infinite scandal and falsity and among the rest and as a test of the sincerity of the party he affirms these palpable untruths   st that in commerce the english trade to the west indies is carried on in exclusive companies by which the letting the scots into that trade was an english cheat   that all the ecclesiastical state of the church was left at the mercy of a british parliament   that the members of parliament in england were obliged to take the sacrament of the church of england before they were admitted to sit in the house   this is not a place to confute these things they did not want their answer in their season and the people in time did begin to see their error and how this author had by manifest forgery imposed upon them  but still this did the mischief it was calculated for before any answer could take place for this book was eagerly espoused by the party and there was no room to question it was writ at their private appointment it was industriously spread over all the kingdom in a few days and no body of any consideration but had a sight of it nay it was handed about among the poor people to stir them up and inflame them and it had all the success the wickedest creature could wish for it confounded and amazed the people the dark side of every thing was shown them and the true sense of things concealed and who can but think the people thus abused should run out into extravagancies  it is not so much that a book fraught with absurdities falsities and contradictions merits a note in this work but i think it is absolutely necessary to show where the general disaffection at the union began since it was manifest that till this time the people were in general very well satisfied and the prospect of an union was very grateful to them  it cannot but be some satisfaction to all those who have heartily espoused this union that the opposition had such a beginning that its foundation was laid in the partyprejudices of a few whose refuge and support was the mere assistance of falsities and unparalled forgeries by which the poor ignorant people were amused imposed upon and led blindly on even to the brink of their own destruction from whence the the good providence of god rescued them yet they were so possessed that they flew in the face of every body that attempted to open their eyes and insulted their deliverers  it was at least a fortnight that the heats of the people on account of these articles continued before they produced any extravagant effects and this time was generally spent in the parliament in reading over discoursing upon and preparing to debate the articles  for it may be noted as will appear by the minutes that the articles were read over one by one in the house before the main reading of them and the members were admitted to speak freely their opinions on every head but to put nothing to the vote  during this work which was from the third of october to the first of november the ferment increased and the whole kingdom seemed to be in a disorder some accounts of which may be very proper here  there had always been a strong oppoition in this country to the present settlement both ecclesiastical and civil and the revolution was not established without a civil war which tho it was but short came to a decisive battle which had this particular seeming contradiction in it that the kings army lost the battle and got the victory  the viscount of dundee formerly graham of claverhouse headed the malecontent party the kings forces were routed but dundee unhappily for his party was found among the slain his victorious party by his death not only lost the advantage of their victory but having lost the chief of their army they soon dispersed for want of a head and the present establishment prevailed  but still they left the north highlands full of disaffection to the present government never submitting but as it were by mere force even to this day  all the remains of this party called particularly the jacobite were unanimously against the union as they were against the successon    the episcopal party were against it as before because they foresaw that the presbyterian church would strengthen their settlement by the addition of england who by this treaty would on all occasions be obliged to support and defeud them and so the party would of course be finally excluded  these two parties saw themselves abandoned by those who formerly opposed the succession on different reasons and that those gentlemen had fallen into the union as is before hinted and tho i will not say that they and the papists and jacobite party were all in an interest before yet it was manifest they fell in together now unanimously to oppose the union  what opposition they had formerly made was under hand partly by solicitation of friends and clashing of parties they always looked on it as a thing remote and impracticable and a thing which the constant jarrs they industriously promoted among the people and particularly the national antipathy would always prevent  but when contrary to their expectation they found that the union was brought to a head in england that the court pushed heartily to bring it to a conclusion and to their great surprise found the several opposing parties joined together and that every one from what different prospects soever concurred in the union and seemed to make their court to the times on the foot of the zeal they should show for this new prospect of settlement  this exceedingly alarmed them and they found that now or never was the time to oppose it that if it obtained now upon the humor of the people it was certain to be finished and they and their cause effectually foreclosed from all hopes of ever retrieving their interest  no sooner therefore was the parliament met and the eyes of all the nation fixed upon the event of this great affair but all the engines of the several parties were set to work some to expose some to defend both the proceedings that were already perfected in england and those that were now entering upon  innumerable pamphlets were printed and dispersed over the whole kingdom and industriously harrangud upon by the engines of the respective parties as their interests led them  the next step was to find out popular arguments to gratify the humors of the several orders or divisions of the people and to alarm them with those things in particular which their several tempers parties or designs led them most to apprehend  thus they spread all possible scandals and satyrs against the treaty in general as well in print as in discourse  as that it was dishonorable to scotland surrendering her sovereignity and constitution subjecting her to her ancient and implacable enemies  that it was depressing the honor and dignity of a kingdom that had defended her liberty against england with such gallantry and bravery for so many hundred years as if she was less able to fight now than ever her sons less bold her gentry less daring or less willing to die for their country that now they were to be slaves and must run to westminster to vote with a handful of members who would never be able to carry a question or to make any weight there but just for forms sake sit in the house and be laughed at  that the figure scotland would make in the british parliament would not be like a kingdom but like a province that one county in england viz of cornwall sent up as many members one excepted as the whole kingdom and that this was an eternal badge of their subjection and the like  this was a general cry and began to be very popular the people cried out they were scots men and they would be scots men still they contemned the name of britains fit for the welsh men who were made the scoff of the english after they had reduced them  scotland had always had a name and a fame in foreign courts they were naturalized in france enjoyed for many years great privileges there and honors bought with the blood of their ancestors and they would never give away their birthright tho some of their nation had been driving a bargain for themselves at the price of selling their country  thus they filled the mouths of the common people who would go about the street crying no union and call the treaters traitors and soon after began to threaten them openly to their faces  the success the party obtained here to incense the common people was too much not to encourage them to proceed and the next step was to infuse like prejudices into the heads of the several parties and persuasions of people and this was divided into two   to persuade the honest presbyterian that the church would be subjected to the votes the power and the oppression of the episcopal hierarchy in england   i will not positively assert that this was a mere jacobite chimera or had its pure original in plot and design the fears and apprehensions of honest people might at first lead them a great way in that case but i believe no body will take offense if i say those fears and apprehensions were soon made a handle by this party who sat ready to take all occasions and they immediately raised a cry that the church was betrayed that episcopacy was coming in upon them that in the british parliament they should be subjected to the plurality of voices in which the english bishops beside their influence on the nobility and gentry had also their own voices and that if the union ever went forward they should be certainly suppressed by the prelates and reduced to a tolleration at best if perhaps that should be obtained  i cannot be censured by any body in this conclusion of mine if it be remembered what strange advocats the church had at this time  when those that never came to the church never owned the jurisdiction of the church but on the contrary were always known to maltreat her reject her establishment and never joined with her either in doctrine or discipline worship or government went up and down exclaiming at the designs of the english bishops to overthrow the established church  nor will it be remote to the purpose to observe that when the act for the security of the church came to be debated in parliament those very gentlemen appeared zealous to obtain larger conditions and voted the overture insufficient for the churches safety who were never supposed to owe the church so much good will or ever before were observed to make her security any part of their concern nay nor were ever known so much as to join with the church own her discipline or call themselves members  but this ceased to be a mystery when some of those gentlemen honestly declared this was only done to strengthen their interest against the union and openly began to draw their arguments into a chain of successive necessities that from the very papist to the jacobite the prelatist the presbyterian the cameronian every one might find reasons to act together against the union as a common and a national evil but of this i shall find occasion to speak again presently  the early spreading these prejudices had but too much success the party applied themselves as they found it suit the genius and tempers of the people  to some it was fatal to the church and they would be subjected to prelacy and the plurality of votes in the british parliament  to others it was dangerous to the state and the independency honor and sovereignity of the kingdom was betrayed and given up  nay to the very children and most ignorant people they had their arguments such as that the honors as they call them the crown of scotland sword and scepter should be carried away to england and the boys and mob were invited by a great person in a melancholy tone to go in and see the ancient crown of scotland for that it would soon be carried away and they might never see it any more  to others they had a more subtle argument which tho it was perhaps begun among those that had no ill in their design as is said of the first yet they carefully improved this as they did all other things to the general confusion of the times and this was a notion that it was absolutely against the national covenant in which the people had sworn to two things which this treaty directly would contraveen and render impossible   st  that scotland had sworn in the national covenant to support the sovereignity of the kingdom which they said was now to be given up   that scotland had engaged to pull down episcopacy in england to the utmost of their power   the starting these two things had two fatal prospects which indeed had they not been both overruled by that secret hand which had singularly appeared in the carrying this treaty on through so many seemingly insuperable difficulties might have involved both nations in confusion  from the first of these they pretended to be bound to preserve the state in its immediate separate condition as if confederating with and joining to a more powerful nation on terms honorable and tending to support the sovereignity and power of the whole was not consisting with that part of the covenant which could no otherwise be understood there than to signify the supporting and defending the constitution of scotland as it was or should be legally established  as to the other suggestion it was effectually answered by one of the most learned divines of the church of scotland doctor rule where he explains the meaning of the covenant to be in that case no attempt by force to reduce the church of england etc but what we are bound to by the covenant is not to reform them but to concur with them when lawfully called to advance reformation either there or any where else and it is far from our thoughts to go beyond that boundary vindication of the church of scotland page     but this clamor had another effect which might have been as fatal in its consequence had not the scene of affairs been very much changed in england for this very pretense which the episcopal party prompted as much as in them lay here and drew abundance of good and well meaning people into in scotland as an objection against the union they immediately turned upon them in england and set some of the church of england clergy especially those warm gentlemen who were against the union they set them i say upon raising of the old alarm again of the danger of the church arising from the union even from this very argument that the presbyterians in scotland were sworn by the covenant to do their utmost to pull down episcopacy in england  i shall as little as possible concern this history with debates of any of our party quarrels but the contradiction which these people fell into was remarkable and could it have been considered might have very much exposed them  for if it was true that the church of scotland had sworn to dethrone episcopacy and that the presbyterians were against the union because it would deprive them of that power and for ever ty their hands from that work  then they were but ill friends to the church of england among her own clergy who were for that reason against the union  and it was an argument of the strongest nature to prove that the church of england should have been with all her heart for the union if she had the least knowledge of her own interest  it is plain from doctor rule that the obligation of the covenant extended no further than to oblige them to concur with england when lawfully called to a general reformation  but the party in england run these things a great deal higher and plied the warm addresses of the people and especially one of the cameronians and of their leader mr john hepburn against the union calling what those weak people put into their addresses the act and deed of the whole presbyterian church of scotland when it is known first that mr hepburns address had but seven hands to it   those people tho in other things many of them are good people yet do neither own the church nor the state neither the civil government nor the ecclesiastic of which i shall be larger hereafter  by these artifices it is hardly credible what aversions they raised in the people against the union in general even before the articles were made public or at all debated in the house  but when the articles were printed and every one began to read lectures upon them according as their several fancies guided them or their interest seemed to clash with them i want words to express what a clamor was raised on all hands and what feuds began to appear in every corner of the nation  parties and people whose interests and principles differed as much as light and darkness who were as contrary in opinion and as far asunder in every thing as the poles seemed to draw together here  twas the most monstrous sight in the world to see the jacobite and the presbyterian the persecuting prelatic nonjuror and the cameronian the papist and the reformed protestant parle together join interest and concert measures together  to see the jacobites at glasgow huzzaing the mob and encouraging them to have a care of the church the highflying episcopal dissenter crying out the overture was not a sufficient security for the church  such convulsions as these agitated the whole kingdom and it was the unaccountablest thing that ever was known to find a nation that but a few months before were earnestly crying out for an union and the nearer the better and that were fully convinced of the necessity they had of this union now fly in the face of their masters and upbraid the gentlemen who managed it with selling and betraying their country and surrendering their constitution sovereignity and independency to the english  and such was the clamor against the treaters that i verily believe and i assure you i do not give my private opinion in it  had the articles of the treaty been published before the treaters came home and the feuds been the same against them as were afterward there was not many of them would dared to have gone home without a guard to protect them  the merchants the burghs the country people all cried out of oppression and of ruin and destruction in trade  and yet the amendments that were offered by that party to the articles in the time of their debate were so small and so trifling tho they had a free debate on every head that their own friends cried out upon them for demanding so little and used this as an argument against them afterward that they might have had more if they had asked it  nor is it to be forgotten that those very gentlemen who raised most noise at the general of the treaty had least to say to the particulars had fewest objections to make and least of all concerned themselves in the amendments  the reason was plain the design was not to amend the treaty but to destroy it they were not sollicitous to have a good treaty but to have no treaty the drift was to confound it with infinite objections and to clamor the people out of their wits that they might if possible clamor the parliament out of the house and of this such evident proofs will appear in the process of this story as no body i believe will make any doubt but that there is reason for such an objection  the parliament was now met and the party who opposed the treaty diligently made up their greatest strength within doors in order to it  i will not say that several took the oath of parliament on purpose to be able to do service against it who never took the said oath before  but i know it was so understood of several gentlemen  and they were reported to be advised by their friends to do so  the first step they took without doors for the matters within door i refer to the abstract i shall make of the minutes in the end of this work but the first step they took without doors as to particulars was to set on foot a notion that the members of parliament had no right to alter the constitution without the particular consent of their constituents and that therefore the parliament ought to have an adjournment for some time that the members might go down into the several and respective countries which they represented and know the mind of their constituents  and tho this seemed to be many ways confuted by strength of argument wherein it was alleged that this was not an altering or giving up the constitution and therefore suppose it were true that the members were not empowered to act without the consent of their constituents in giving up the constitution yet this did not reach here    it was alleged that this parliament was summoned by her majesty with an express signification in the proclamation that it was to treat of consult about and conclude an union with england and being sent up for that declared purpose by their constituents there remained no occasion to demand any further or other instructions from them but they became plenipotentiaries from that particular circumstance    that by the constitution it was not required that the constituents should be consulted on any such occasion that the convention of estates transposed the crown altered the succession and settled the revolution which in all circumstances was as essential to the constitution as this and that they never consulted their constituents in that case at all nor did the opposers of the revolution demand it but protested and went out of the house  and in this case their champion mr hodges also was against them who owned that their commissioners to the parliament had full power to act for them in this case  however as things began to run very high and the people prompted by these popular arguments assumed every thing they thought fit to call their right several burghs wrote letters to their representatives in their own names and by their own authorities requiring them not to give their votes or assents to an incorporating union  or in short not to the union as now coming on in the terms of the treaty  but this was not all for finding that this was not much regardded by the members and that precedents in like cases would not support the practice they turned their private letters into public addresses and those introduced mobs tumults insultings of magistrates flight of gentlemen from their houses and all manner of popular disorders till at last it came to downright insurrection and rebellion which had not circumstances and the season particularly prevented had risen up to blood civil war and all the terrible consequences of an enraged and divided nation as shall more at large be related in its course  but to return to the party who opposed the treaty at first they strove to carry on their opposition by wiser methods and by their force of arguments to possess the peoples minds with such aversions as might convince the parliament they were acting against the general current of the nation  and having not at first appeared against the thing in general it behoved them to descend to particular objections for to say they would have no union at all would have been impolitick and have formed too great a party against them it was necessary therefore to form themselves into a body of objectors that had some reason on their side and could descend to particulars to enforce their opinion  nor could they in good manners to the queen object against an union in general who in her letters to the parliament had so earnestly recommended upon all occasions the union of her people as what her majesty esteemed so much for their mutual good that she would count it her singular happiness to have it completed in her reign on this score i say should they have rejected all manner of union or treaty of union it would have been so directly flying in the face of the queens recommendation that it would have not only appeared rude but have lost them a considerable party whose assistance they found very great occasion for  this brought all the several parties who were against the treaty as well those that were against it on the account of the succession as those that were against it in general to fall in with those who only objected against the circumstances of it i mean the conditions and stipulations published in the articles  thus the great variety of objectors to make themselves perfectly formidable however different in notion or design made up one body and turned their arguments from being pointed against the union in general to be pointed against the terms of it an incorporating union  this brought them back to the several schemes of foreign unions of nations such as switzerland the united provinces and the like and some proposed one thing some another not foreseeing that had even any of their proposals come to have been the real treaty yet this party who were against the union as such would have been as much against that as they were against this and so at last they must have divided broke their interest and lost the whole which was the main thing aimed at  and thus now stood the debate  no incorporating union was the word  let us have an union with england with all our hearts  but no incorporation let us keep our parliament keep our sovereignity keep our independency keep our constitution and for all the rest we are ready to unite with you as firmly as you can devise  this was thought by most to be just reviving the former notions of a federal union  with so many inconsistent nounsubstantives in their government that had upon all occasions been found impracticable and which would so entirely have left both nations exposed to the possibility of a relapsing into a divided condition that it could not be expected england whose considerations for uniting were peace strength and shutting a back door of continual war and confusion from the north should communicate trade freedom of customs in all her ports and plantations with the egress and regress of manufactures etc and leave the main things yet precarious and uncertain  it would be endless to trouble the reader here with the arguments on both sides  which came resolved at last to this short head  in the beginning of the treaty at london the english commissioners had refused to treat but upon an entire and incorporating union  and had given such reasons why all other proposals would not only be insufficient but impracticable that the scots commissioners were convinced of it and satisfied to enter upon a treaty of an entire union as the only way to establish the lasting peace and prosperity of both nations  to talk then of a federal union at this time seemed only to put the question whether the parliament should take the articles into consideration or no  and this run all the opposers back to the schemes of those that were against the union in general and by this they lost ground for tho they made a strong opposition against the very reading the articles at all and would gladly have rejected them in the gross yet there several of their friends left them and so they lost the first question whether the articles should be read which was carried in the affirmative october   d the first day of the meeting of the parliament as will appear by the minutes  this was the first strait they were brought to and therefore to back these two principles they set to work to procure a throng of addresses from the several towns  and which it is visible they attempted to back with force to awe the parliament into a compliance as will hereafter appear  most of these addresses were worded to the same purpose and in substance contained a claim of the constituents right to limit and instruct their commissioners  and a direction to avoid an incorporating union some of them were decently prefacd with expressions of courtesy to england and willingness to confederate or unite with them on other terms but protested against an incorporation of government as contrary to their liberties and destructive to their sovereignity and independency the glory of their ancestors the honor of the ancient kingdom and a great many such plausible allegations in order to make the ground of their addressing seem the more specious and to please the people others less courteous spoke higher words and rougher language talked of their defending their constitution against the invasion of strangers reflected on their treaters and their being wheedled and drawn in to give up their country their liberties etc we shall come to them presently  as the parliament was now sitting so was the commission  this is a deputation from the general assembly being a certain number of ministers empowered by an act of the assembly to meet in the intervals of their session to take care of the affairs of the church  the transactions within the parliament i refer to the abstract of the minutes with observations immediately following this account folio but that this account which contains things done without doors may run hand in hand with the said abstract it is necessary to give an account what was transacting in the commission at the same time at least so far as it relates to the present affair  it is observed in the minutes of the    th of october that a motion was made in parliament for a public fast which however was opposed by those that some thought had more inclination to the work of a public fast than those that proposed it however as the commission had been several days met the gentlemen in parliament who were against the having a public fast appointed by parliament seemed to refer it to the commission  it was indeed opposed in the commission of the assembly for the same reasons that it was in parliament viz not for any dislike of fasting and praying but to prevent the alarming and amusing the people which was the principal work on foot at that time however not to neglect the work or be found opposing such a thing as praying to god on whatsoever account it was moved in the commission that they should set apart a time for themselves to fast and pray as ministers assembled on so great an occasion and that a circular letter should be sent to the several presbyteries to do the same in their several districts  the act of the commission for this day of prayer neither confined them to a day or prescribed the manner the act it self is to be found in the appendix n a x as copied from the original in the register  there had been strong rumors spread abroad that the commission would not act in this case without the general assembly but that they should protest against the unions being concluded till a general assembly was called and address the parliament to adjourn the debate of it till the assembly should meet which was not to be till april  or that the lords of her majestys council should procure from her majesty that the assembly might be called sooner  but as this was the contrivance of a party only to gain time and of a piece with the delays offered at in the house at the same time so it met with no encouragement in the commission not but that there was too strong a party willing to have befriended it at that time even in the commission it self  however a very moderate and well tempered address was drawn up in the commission it was agreed to in the commission the    th but not presented till the    th in which they recommend to the parliament the security of the presbyterian church of scotland and its doctrine discipline worship and government to be secured by the treaty as you may see by the address it self which is printed in the appendix n b x  after this the commission was again pressed about the fast and more ministers being come to town than were at the first and coming with the sense of the country people fresh in their minds who were by this time every where rendered very uneasy the motion of a fast was renewed and tho some were against a fast as national yet as no body was against praying to god on so solemn occasion so the commission began with themselves as follows  october    th it was agreed that the members of the commission with such as pleased to join with them should conveen in the high church of edinburgh for prayer the day following that the moderator should begin with a short discourse from the pulpit concerning the occasion and reason of that meeting and the ministers to pray and the orders of the exercise were settled by the commission  accordingly on the    th there was a very great congregation where was present many members of parliament and the work continued till two of the clock very public and solemn but without any of the excesses which some people flattered themselves to find there  however after this the motion for a fast was brought on again and carried in the commission on the    st of october as from the register follows  there having formerly been a motion made for application to the parliament for a public national fast the matter was this day resumed and much debate about it the commission being pretty full it took longer time some were for applying to the parliament for their civil sanction to it others that presbyteries should be wrote to to appoint a fast without applying to the parliament because it was feared the parliament might not be unanimous in that matter and the mentioning of a fast there might perhaps in the present circumstances be occasion of strife and after long deliberation it was unanimously agreed unto that application should not be made to the parliament and a committee was named to bring in a draught of the paper about that fast which committee brought in the same in form of an act upon the    d of october and after some few amendments the same was unanimously approven  this fast was observed in edinburgh very solemnly his grace her majestys commissioner the lord chancellor the great officers of state and many members of parliament appeared at church and joined in it tho the appointment had not the sanction of the civil authority to support it  a clear proof by the way of the parliaments owning the power of appointing fasts to be in the church  yet was not this such a general national fast as some people desired hoping to obtain upon the people by the solemnity of the thing and by the warmth of the ministers who they vainly expected would in the pulpit run out against the treaty bring the people to a general aversion against it and by consequence to some violent measures for preventing it  but the prudence of the ministers prevented all this designed mischief  and tho the day was as i have said observed with great solemnity and affection yet it was to their great disappointment that the ministers generally as well those who were against the union as those who were for it in their respective parishes applied themselves only summarily to the substance nay to the very words of the assemblies act viz that all the determinations of the estates of parliament with respect to an union with england might be influenced and directed by divine wisdom to the glory of god the good of religion and particularly of the church of scotland  thus the thing was carried through except as hereafter without the mischievous effect which some expected from it who now begun to turn their expectations another way viz to the people who they had by various arts screwed up to an unexpected fermentation as in the ensuing tumults appeared  i am sorry that in the process of this story especially in this which i count the fowlest and blackest part of it that could have been acted i shall be obliged to mention some persons of great honor and ancient families who were pleased for reasons of their own to act against the union and to appear so publicly in the opposition of it that the people i do not say by their own approbation i hope not singled them out as the patriots of their country against this transaction and by their shouts and huzzas after them as they went and came to and from the parliament made them as it were the heads of the party who opposed the union  the dukes of hamilton and athole were the chief of these and were almost every day in parliament strenuously arguing against the articles and pressing for other measures as by the observations on the minutes will appear  the duke of hamilton being indisposed by some lameness i cannot describe the occasion was generally carried to and from the house in his chair  the common people now screwed up to a pitch and ripe for the mischief designed and prompted by the particular agents of a wicked party began to be very insolent it had been whispered about several days that the rabble would rise and come up to the parliament house and cry out no union that they would take away the honors as they call them viz the crown etc and carry them to the castle and a long variety of foolish reports of this kind  but the first appearance of any thing mobish was that every day when the duke went up but principally as he came down in his chair from the house the mob followed him shouting and crying out god bless his grace for standing up against the union and appearing for his country and the like  and as extremes are generally accompanied with their contraries so while his grace the duke of hamilton had these fancied honors paid him the queens representative the high commissioner had all the insults reproaches and indignities offered him that they durst for fear of public justice show him as will by and by appear  far be it from me to say the duke of hamilton desired or encouraged this tumultuary kind of congratulation that sort of popularity must be too much below a person of his character and his grace knows the world too well and is too wise a man not to know that such things always tend to confusion and to the destruction of civil peace in the world  nor do i doubt but his grace did what he could to prevent their singling him out to show their mob courtesy to but there was no crushing a rabble that had so many wheels to set it in motion and the seeming causes of which increased every day as the union began to draw forward and as the members appeared resolved to go forward with it seriously in order to a conclusion  on the    d of october they followed the dukes chair quite through the city down to the abbey gate the guards prevented their going further but all the way as they came back they were heard to threaten what they would do the next day that then they would be a thousand times as many that they would pull the traitors so they called the treaters of the union at london out of their houses and they would soon put an end to the union  on the    d they made part of their words good indeed for as the parliament sat something late the people gathered in the streets and about the doors of the parliament house and particularly the parliament closs was almost full that the members could not go in or out without difficulty when duke hamilton coming out of the house the mob huzzad as formerly and followed his chair in a very great number the duke instead of going down to the abbey as usual went up the high street to the landmarket as they call it and so to the lodgings of the duke of athole some said he went to avoid the mob others maliciously said he went to point them to their work  while he went in to the duke of atholes lodgings the rabble attended at the door and by shouting and noise having increased their numbers to several thousands they began with sir patrick johnston who was one of the treaters and the year before had been lord provost first they assaulted his lodgings with stones and sticks and curses not a few but his windows being too high they came up the stairs to his door and fell to work at it with sledges or great hammers and had they broke it open in their first fury he had without doubt been torn in pieces without mercy and thus only because he was a treater in the commission to england for before that no man was so well beloved as he over the whole city  his lady in the utmost despair with this fright comes to the window with two candles in her hand that she might be known and cried out for gods sake to call the guards an honest apothecary in the town who knew her voice and saw the distress she was in and to whom the family under god is obliged for their deliverance ran immediately down to the town guard but they would not stir without the lord provosts order  but that being soon obtained one captain richardson who commanded taking about thirty men with him marched bravely up to them and making his way with great resolution through the crowd they flying but throwing stones and hallowing at him and his men he seized the foot of the stair case and then boldly went up cleared the stair and took six of the rabble in the very act and so delivered the gentleman and his family   but this did not put a stop to the general tumult tho it delivered this particular family for the rabble by this time were prodigiously increased and went roving up and down the town breaking the windows of the members of parliament and insulting them in their coaches in the streets they put out all the lights that they might not be discovered and the author of this had one great stone thrown at him for but looking out of a window for they suffered no body to look out especially with any lights lest they should know faces and inform against them afterward  by this time it was about eight or nine a clock at night and now they were absolute masters of the city and it was reported they were going to shut up all the ports  the lord commissioner being informed of that sent a party of the foot guards and took possession of the netherbow which is a gate in the middle of the high street as temple bar between the city of london and the court  the city was now in a terrible fright and every body was under concern for their friends the rabble went raving about the streets till midnight frequently beating drums and raising more people when my lord commissioner being informed there were a thousand of the seamen and rabble come up from leith and apprehending if it were suffered to go on it might come to a dangerous head and be out of his power to suppress  he sent for the lord provost and demanded that the guards should march into the city  the lord provost after some difficulty yielded tho it was alleged that it was what was never known in edinburgh before  about one a clock in the morning a battallion of the guards entered the town marched up to the parliament closs and took post in all the avenues of the city which prevented the resolutions taken to insult the houses of the rest of the treaters  the rabble were entirely reduced by this and gradually dispersed and so the tumult ended  it is not easy to describe here the consternation all good people were in at the rising of this tumult and had not such resolutions been at last taken as is abovementioned which the other party did not expect it had been the fatalest rabble the nation had ever seen  in this case my lord commissioner greatly disappointed the party who having insulted his graces lenity before as a faintness of resolution had spread about scandalous reports that the government durst not look the rabble in the face that the high commissioner was afraid of being rabbled in his palace and that if they once rose in a mob all would fly before them that the parliament would run away and dissolve themselves or fly to the castle and another worse thing than all viz that the soldiers were on their side and would not fight against their country as they called it  but the resolution of the lord commissioner disappointed them all who now showed them he had as much cheerful bravery in the action as he had calmness and temper in the parliament this broke all their measures and when they saw the guards led by brave and faithful officers stand firm to their duty and show themselves resolutely forward to defend the government they lost all their courage it defeated all their expectations and they began to lay aside that sort of violent proceedings and apply themselves to the artifice of words and the managry of parties in the house  it is to be observed also that this rabble was a mine sprung before its time which blew backwards and destroyed the engineers rather than the enemies the plot being otherwise laid viz that it should not have broken out till some days following when as was said all would have been in readiness to have finished the work at one blow viz to have blown up the government at once  they had been tampering with the soldiery in order to debauch them from their duty and some people talked of retiring from the parliament and of some great men heading the people which had their patience been more and their conduct a little more secret they had without doubt effectually brought it to pass but they blew their own project up by their precipitation and so saved their country by their very attempt to destroy it  the author of this had his share of the danger in this tumult and tho unknown to him was watched and set by the mob in order to know where to find him had his chamber windows insulted and the windows below him broken by mistake  but by the prudence of his friends the shortness of its continuance and gods providence he escaped  several of the rabble were seized upon and apprehended and there was a discourse of making examples of some of them but the mercy of the high commissioner however provoked and abused prevailed to compassionate rather than punish their follies they were only kept some time in prison and afterward let go without any other punishment  and thus ended the most dangerous juncture of the whole treaty and a tumult which ended to the advantage of the government and the disheartning the party who before that carried it with such an unheard of insolence that had they not been as they thought sure of their cause they would never have answered it to their own discretion to have acted in so open and insulting a manner  the foot guards and two other regiments of foot did now constant duty in the city viz the regiments of strathnaver and grant the horse guards attended the commissioner the other battallion of guards at the palace and the garrison at the castle  and all was little enough for the regiments were thin and few and all the forces then in the kingdom some independent companies in the highlands excepted did not exceed three thousand men and great endeavors were used as i have said to debauch the soldiers tho in vain they appearing faithful and forward to do their duty on all occasions  the next day the parliament did not sit but a great council was assembled where the measures the lord commissioner had taken as to bringing the guards into the city was ratified and approved and a proclamation published for suppressing the rabble which being something particular is inserted in the appendix no c x  i have printed this proclamation tho this work could very ill spare room for it both because it recites the acts of parliament in scotland in force against rabbles as also for that the method is particular to that place and very good to prevent tumults viz   of obliging the deacons of crafts that is as in london the masters of companies to summon the inhabitants and make them give security for the behavior of their servants apprentices etc   giving an indemnity to the soldiers either of the regiments or townguards in case they should wound or kill any person after a command given for all to retire from the streets   indeed there was occasion enough for such a proclamation and had not the party been broken as before all would have been little enough to have suppressed the fury of this enraged multitude  no body would undertake to justify the rabble especially after they had been defeated in the design  every body cried out it was a dangerous thing and the whole city might have been exposed to plunder riot and all manner of disorder  but as the party could not justify the rabble so they began a new clamor and now they exclaimed that the privileges of the city of edinburgh were invaded and soldiers brought in to awe and oppress the inhabitants  that this had not been done in sixty years before nor ever but in the time of war and tyrannick government and that it was a forerunner of the slavery of the nation  then they cried out this was an invasion of the freedoms of parliament and an awe upon the members etc see the minutes of the    th of october where that matter was urged very warmly  it is true it had been to be wished the affair could have been carried on without any jealousies and insults but on the other side it was alleged that the force put on the government by the rabble was an invasion of the public peace and that the mob were the aggressors and the parliament was much more likely to be awed by the ungoverned rabbles of the streets if they had gotten a head than by the forces brought in for their security who being at their command did nothing but secure them from the insults of the mob and keep that peace which the civil authority had not power to preserve  that the military power is always supposed to be assisting to the civil when oppressed by rabbles and tumults and while in subservience to the civil peace and subordinate to the civil powers the proper safeguard of a state  and as the force of these arguments carried all things before them in the house all the legal pretenses were overthrown by the reason and nature of the thing and the parliament approved of all that had been done  nor did they approve it only but ordered the guards to be continued or recommended it to the lord high commissioner and the privy council to continue their care for the safety and security of the parliament vide the minutes of october    th  however by this method the appearance of the rabbles and the fury of the streets were in some measure abated yet the people appeared exasperated to the last degree the huzzaing and crouding about duke hamilton continued notwithstanding all his endeavors to prevent it and unusual threatenings and dark speeches were heard among the people  the lords and others who opposed the placing guards in the streets made protests against it as infringing the liberties of the parliament tho it was very plain that there was nothing imposed in parliament nothing offered to be carried but by reasoning and fair voting  from this time they began to talk of country tumults and that since the commissioner had suppressed the mob in the town the whole country should rise and come up to edinburgh and remove the guards by force from imprisoning the parliament  the pretense was specious they pretended the guards were a force upon the members of parliament that this was craming the union down their throats that the country was unanimously against it and would not bear that a few people in the house because they had the majority within doors and a band of soldiers to back them should impose a conjunction with england upon them whether they would or no  any body may judge what a time this was when every day the town was alarmed to day the north was up in arms to morrow the west to day such a shire to morrow another the next day a third glasgow dumfries hamilton perth all the places which the imagination of the people dictated and the fears of others apprehended  it is impossible to express the consternation of the people those that wished well to the public peace and who saw that a commotion at this time must immediately involve the nation in war and blood not with england only but with one another these trembled for fear of the desolation of their country the blood and ruin that always attends a civil war and the danger of the lives of themselves and their relations  those who looked seriously into the drift of some of that party who most eagerly pushed on these divisions who saw how the interest of a popish a jacobite and a persecuting bloody generation lately extinguished and now full of hopes was twisted and all joined in antiunion principles could not but be heartily concerned for the established religion and protestant church which they must have been wilfully blind who could not see was plainly struck at by the opposers of this treaty  to see others whose designs could not be suspected of any thing to the detriment of either religion or their native country yet joining blindly with a wicked and degenerate race and seeming to approve the steps which were taken to the ruin and destruction of both to see these shut their eyes against the plain discoveries of a stated resolution against both liberty and religion and encourage nay in too much join with them who were known enemies both to the national church and protestant succession these i say were very melancholy things when the prospect of them was so near to those who were sincerely concerned for the peace of the country and the safety of the reformed religion  and people went up and down wandering and amazed expecting every day strange events afraid of peace and afraid of war many knew not which way to fix their resolutions they could not be clear for the union yet they saw death at the door in its breaking off death to their liberty to their religion and to their country  here were good people of all opinions as well as others some were against the union on a principle of justice and honesty as earnestly as others were against it on a principle of treachery to their country some were firmly possessed that they were under national engagements which in the nature of them clashd with the union and that therefore however it might be necessary for the safety and peace of either church or nation they could not get over those obligations or consent to this evil that the other good might come  and however these might in the consequence of the thing countenance the wicked foundation on which the other acted yet i cannot but do them that justice that i believe they were far from the least intention to encourage the strengthening a party whose principle was french government and a popish sovereign i will not answer for indiscretion or errors in temper in some neither will i be so unjust as to call every wrong step an error of principle and every mistaken man a plotter against his country  this was the unhappy divided condition of this people at the beginning of the treaty the division was so general that it spread through every part the gentry were divided the common people divided nay the very ministers were divided parliament assembly court city counties towns nay almost every family were divided and as the event began to be feared on every side people stood strangely doubtful of one another  the commission of the assembly hitherto carried as before noted with a great deal of prudence and moderation and tho there were some unhappy struggles there which perhaps were pointed by the same party at making a breach yet as they came to no head and were soon crushed by the wisdom and conduct of the rest i shall not preserve the memory of them to posterity the general proceedings of that reverend body being always tempered with modesty calmness and discretion at the same time that they were anxiously concerned for the security of the foundation on which they stood and had the whole weight of the church of scotlands safety upon their hands  they had addressed the parliament that care might be taken of the church in the treaty and had been assured they should have their expectation fully answered  and i cannot but remark here that the foundation of this treaty herein appeared to have been wisely laid the understandings and well poised judgments of its first contrivers was very conspicuous in leaving the respective parliaments a full liberty so to establish the several churches as that all the security they could demand one against the other should be granted them that every root of jealousy might be pulled up and there might be no room for the sowers of discord to begin here where they always used to begin and from whence all the mischiefs of former dissension used to flow  the parliament had also been encouraged by the queen in her majestys letter vide folio   d of this part at the opening this session to form such security for the church government as might fully establish the national church of scotland  for the queen having by long experience and the former contention on both sides seen that an union of principles was no more to be expected  but plainly seeing also that with the assistance of mutual charity that difference in principle might be consisting with an union of interests and affection among her people saw at the same time that the only way to establish this peace was to form such securities to both churches as might for ever reremove all just ground of jealousies from among them take away the suspicions and shut all the doors against the fears which either had entertained of each other and which wicked men daily took hold of as handles of contention to keep open an eternal breach and keep us always divided ephraim against judah and judah against ephraim ever vexing and envying one another  in this posture i say stood the affairs of the church when in the interval of time between the first address to the parliament and the second reading of the articles vide minutes folio an overture or draught of an act for the church was conceived and on the of was presented to the house  i shall not enter into a long debate which arose here both without doors and within   as to the sufficiency and insufficiency of the overture which in some part may be answered by saying it received some amendments or additions afterward at the passing into an act or   as to any act of parliament being a sufficient security for the church that objection being raised at first not by such as designed a better security but by such as really designed no security at all for the ecclesiastical establishment in this nation it is hard that we must be forced to distinguish the disputes in this case by distinguishing the persons for there being several parties here and of several principles who all seemed to make but one party against the union it was absolutely necessary to examine who was for this or that argument and by the man the reason of his argument was to be distinguished  this untiddled the mystery which appeared in the debates of this time when those that had really least kindness for the church were the loudest and appeared the most zealous for her security nay those that never owned or acknowledged either her discipline or government never submitted to her judicatories or joined with her worship were now every day crying out of want of security exposing the church to the votes of the bishops in the british parliament and giving the episcopal church of england the ascendant over the presbyterian church of scotland  this language could be no otherwise understood but by distinguishing the people that spoke it the very party were hieroglyphics to the dialect and he must be blinder than most people are in this intelligent age that could imagine these people spoke this from a true design to obtain for the church a farther or better security so much as to embarras the church and the state embroil the parliament with the commission and either prevent its being finished at all or obtain what they generally drove at in all their managements now in the affair and which was the only thing they could hope in i mean a delay  but to leave this matter a while the parliament was all this time reading over the articles and discoursing or reasoning upon them but had not yet come to any vote the tumult at edinburgh was blown over without the expected event we shall now see that it was not in edinburgh alone that a tumult was designed but steps were taken and indeed politickly enough to have the general sense of the kingdom to run in the same channel  to this end addresses were set on foot in several parts of the kingdom against the union i shall not pretend to crowd this book with the particular addresses tho some of them are remarkable enough however i shall give specimens of some of them to judge from and to make the matter as i go along the plainer  and among them i cannot omit one from the convention of the royal burghs because some gentlemen especially in england having valued their opinion from thence as if it were the sense of the whole nation it is a little necessary toward clearing up this point that tho the people were screwed up to a most unexpected and indeed unaccountable aversion yet that in the whole the main body of the nation did not run the length which some of their leaders desired of them and which they would have had passed as their act and deed  the royal burghs have a custom in scotland that they act in a body and have a convention or representative of their own which meets upon occasion at edinburgh and are conveened by the lord provost of edinburgh to this convention every burgh sends one member and the burgh of edinburgh two their whole representative is sixty six in number  now the calculation which was observable here was in the number and quality of the burghs which voted in the convention the address was carried by four voices indeed but the state of the case is thus of sixty six burghs twenty voted against addressing and twenty four for it the rest were absent but take the quality of the burghs to make the calculation by and there the thing will discover it self as follows  take the burghs that refused to address and these that did not think it worth while to appear and the majority against the addressers is by the proportion of their cess as eighty six to fourteen nay suppose all those that did not appear to be affirmatives tho that be altogether improbable and that they would have been for the address yet the proportion had been as thirty one to sixty nine   but if the rate of the cess be not a just estimate of the value of the burghs tho i can prove it was the original of their right of being burghs then i refer to any man to calculate the inhabitants and number of freemen in each burgh and he will find the twenty burghs that refused to address have more inhabitants in them than both the twenty four that addressed and the twenty two that were absent the city of edinburgh excepted  so that upon the foot of this calcul tho the address may legally be called the address of the burrows yet it did not follow that the trading part of the nation had addressed or were against the union for that in an arithmetical calculation or a calculation upon value and payment of taxes the far greater number opposed the very addressing at all  this is observed here in order to clear up a point hereafter which will require a like kind of calculating on the foot of the whole nation  the burghs however by this seeming majority did address and because the said address is very particular and contains in it all the popular arguments which the enemies of the treaty had blinded the people with as before particularly of the surrendering the sovereignity and independency of the nation and subjecting their religion church government claim of right laws liberties and trade to be altered or subverted by the english in a british parliament for this reason i have given you the address it self at large in the appendix no d x  i cannot i confess but wonder how it was possible to impose things so absurd upon a whole nation and how so great a people so clear sighted and wary in all other cases came at this time to run so apparently upon a plain mistake since as nothing is more plain than that the articles of the treaty and consequently the great heads mentioned in the above address cannot be touched by the parliament of britain and that the moment they attempt it they dissolve their own constitution so it is an union upon no other terms and is expressly stipulate what shall and what shall not be alterable by the subsequent parliaments  and as the parliaments of britain are founded not upon the original right of the people as the separate parliaments of england and scotland were before but upon the treaty which is prior to the said parliament and consequently superior  so for that reason it cannot have power to alter its own foundation or act against the power which formed it since all constituted power is subordinate and inferior to the power constituting  this is so clear and has been so often inculcated in this very case and is so unanswerably stated in the very acts of parliament themselves ratifying the treaty that i need say no more to it here  but it was a strange time now and there was no making the least impression upon the minds of the people already prepossessed  nothing was to be heard now but of slavery to the english running away with the crown taking away their nation and the like  and it was impossible to stem this tide of distraction for a time  it is true that the generality of the people came off from this delusion at last and the unalterableness of the union if finished began to obtain a little upon the senses of the people  the truth is the demonstration of the thing was so visible that it could not but prevail and the best and most judicious beginning to see into it the rest of the people began to sink under the power of the conviction and so by degrees the scruple began to wear off  nay the same people who first argued against this truth viz of the parliament of britains not being able to invade the treaty took it up themselves afterward when it served their turn and strongly urged it against consenting to the church establishment on the english side since it was a confirming the episcopal power and setting it up above the power of a parliament to pull down so freely will men accept of an argument when it serves their occasion which they will reject while it seems to oppose their interest  in the ruins of this suggestion another started up which as it was capable of being embarassd with greater doubts and with some had insuperable difficulties so had not the moderation of the ministers interposed it might have been of far worse consequence in this case and this was a scruple against the union in gross as being directly against and inconsistent with the covenant and that therefore it could not be entered into without incurring the guilt of national perjury  this brought the church into the general appearance against the treaty  nor will i say but that great means were used if possible to bring the commission then sitting to declare against the union upon this account  this was a great trial of skill and i say this rose out of the ruins of the other scruple because it was forcibly enough alleged that if the constitution of this treaty was such that no alteration could be suffered and that not the parliament of britain could infringe one article of it then this for ever shut the door against the possibility of their assisting to reform the church of england which they alleged by their covenant they were bound to use all lawful endeavors to perform  this and submitting to the jurisdiction of the bishops in england and who were to sit still in the british parliament and thereby owning the agency of spiritual men in civil employments they also alleged was against the covenant and consequently if the nation went into this union they incurred directly the guilt of national perjury and i allow that a great many good and valuable people were very melancholy upon this head and some are not easy in it to this hour  i cannot pass this thing here without speaking to it because i foresee daily disputes do still arise upon this head and are like to do so every day and i shall not interrupt the thread of the story by it at all rather it will seem necessary to be considered in order to carry on the course of the story some of which particularly at this very juncture very much depends upon it  i am not at all entering here upon the obligation of the several convenants engaged in by the people of scotland it is necessary here for argument sake to allow them to be obligatory in as large a sense as can be desired  as to the being obliged to reform the church of christ in the whole island  it is granted here by the most severe assertors of the covenants obligation    that as is expressed they are to use all lawful means only and that they are not to use any such thing as force  and the reverend doctor rule a divine of great candor and learning and principal of the college of edinburgh has stated this obligation very distiuctly as follows what we are bound to by the covenant is not to reform them but to concur with them when lawfully called to advance reformation and it is far from our thought to go beyond that boundary in being concerned in their affairs we wish their reformation but leave the managing of it to themselves doctor rules second vindication of the church of scotland p     now i think nothing is more clear than that there is all the room in the world for the church of scotland to concur in a national reformation notwithstanding the union nay they will be better qualifyed for it now than ever in so far as they will i hope always have the assistance of all good men in the south both dissenters and church men to encourage them  as to the civil power of church men or in english the bishops voting in the parliament and its being declared against in the covenant i will not dispute the suggestion whether it be against the covenant or no the discord lies here  one party says it is expressly against the covenant and that the yielding to it and yielding to have the church of england established by the treaty is setting up that very power they were sworn to reform to the utmost of their power in all lawful means and these are the particulars in which they say the union is a breach upon the covenant and has brought the nation into the dreadful sin of public perjury  the other say    they are not guilty of national perjury for that they conceive the union does no way oblige them further than as before in the sense of doctor rule to concur with all lawful methods for reformation and to close with all opportunities which shall be put into their hands for the purpose and this they are yet as free to do as before    as to their consenting to the act for the security etc of the church of england it is not against the covenant since it is not an erecting a church nay it is not in the least a recognizing or acknowledging them that are erected  but it is a letting that be which was before and which they had no lawful call the thing expressly mentioned in the covenant to concern themselves in altering they were not legally called to it for they were legally at this time excluded on either side from meddling in the respective settlements of the church by the queens power  and at last they allege that in so far as the covenant engages them against the civil power of church men they did exonerate themselves fairly in their public protest against the votes of the bishops viz the representation and petition rejecting as far as in them lies all submission to their said power and that they conceive being not called to any other opposition they have fully discharged their duty as a nation and have to the utmost of their power opposed it  i think this is a clear though a short state of the question and some of the most conscientious and pious of both ministers and people on one side thought the case of the covenant clear in this point  i know there are others dissatisfied still of whom i have only this to say if they are certain it is a national crime i wish they would apply themselves to national humiliation and be found of them that stand in the gap to prevent gods judgments rather than forgetting that part fill the days with their complaint of the sin  and only apply it to make the people uneasy at the occasion  the union is finished even breaking it again if that were in their power would not undo the crime if it be one and would at the same time involve their country in a thousand calamities blood and distresses  i cannot be so uncharitable as to think any man that raises the scruple we are now upon would be willing to be thought to be moving the nation to break this new and most solemn conjunction and fall all to pieces again i would then ask to what end are public exclamations and excursions of the tongue about it they can tend to nothing but to keep the people in a continual alarm keep their minds in a constant perturbation and uneasiness and it is a sad work for any man to be employed in merely to disturb and distract his country  while these things were debating at edinburgh the affair grew still darker and darker all over the kingdom and they were far from carrying it with equal temper and moderation in other places  in the west the people called cameronians began to be apprehended as dangerous and that cloud was diligently represented as very black that according to the rash wishes of some people whose endeavors too had not been wanting they would fall into some desperate action or other on this account  the prejudices against the union had reached them very early nor was it to be supposed that those people who were so diligent to alarm the country every where against the union and possessed them with fears and jealousies of their liberties trade crown and religion would fail to fall to work in these parts where they must needs know the general character of the people was to be tenacious of their opinions and far from being always prescribed by the most prudent and moderate councils  as to other places the arguments were suited to the people as to some the loss of trade to others taxes to these the liberty to those the sovereignty of the nation so to these the great pretense used was religion the danger of not the church for that many of them did not submit to or acknowledge  but religion in general and these two heads in particular the return of prelacy and the breach of the covenant however they had all the very same things in their allegations  in carrying on the design of enslaving these poor people great artifice was used  and as if they had been prepared for the design before hand  they waited till the articles were printed which were formed by the treaters in england and the several minutes of the treaty  when these were seen a number of these people got together and tho they were not the number by far as was diligently reported in order to make them formidable yet the beginning might have been dangerous enough if it had been pushed on farther what number they might really be in other places i could never learn so particularly as to venture asserting it but about two hundred men in a tumultuous manner came to the town of dumfreis a seaport on the west side of scotland about twenty eight miles from carlisle  they came into the town in the middle of the day on the twentieth of november made a fire in the market place burnt the articles of the union and burnt a paper with the names of the commissioners of the treaty and fixed another paper of their own upon the cross and having done thus they marched off and dispersed themselves peaceably  this paper indeed was no less seditious in its nature than the attempt was insolent and daring  when the report came to edinburgh of this tumult the concern of those who wished well to their country was very great and wise men began to give the design of the treaty for lost they knew the unhappy temper of those honest people for such however i must call them because i believe their intention is religious and honest tho they may be mistaken and no doubt are mistaken in their principles about government and obedience but as they knew i say the temper of these people how tenacious of their own sentiments and how precipitant in their prosecution it bred no small concern in the minds of all people who were inclined to peace concluding that the party who opposed the union from worse principles had gained their point viz to employ the hands of protestants one against another in this dispute and make the honest meaning but warm people the tools to ruin both themselves and their country  there were not wanting at the same time people who diligently spread extravagant rumors of the numbers of these people some said that there were six thousand men in arms at the place others that two thousand horse only came into the town and that five thousand footstood ready in the hill country to march with them as occasion should require others that the whole body of them were up and that the whole west was in arms and at least twelve thousand of them were to march for edinburgh to raise the parliament and that they had publicly declared they would sacrifice the treaters as betrayers of their country and sellers of her liberty and sovereignty  to back these reports the paper they fixed up at dumfreis was officiously printed and at the end of it a postscript signifying that this paper was publicly read from the market cross at dumfreis about one of the clock afternoon on the twentieth of november one thousand seven hundred and six with great solemnity in the audience of many thousands the fire being surrounded with double squadrons of horse and foot in martial order  the printing of this paper was resented by the government and the printer fled from their hands for the present but this as all other insults of this nature were no farther prosecuted the government choosing rather to pity and overlook the follies of the people on this occasion as what they saw was politickly enflamed by a party who only sought to embroil the nation and bring the best of the people to fall out with one another that the game might be made up out of the destruction of both  by this postscript above may appear to any unbiased person the artifice made use of to magnify every story to increase the terror of the people and if possible to encourage the like confusions in other places for as to the fact it is true there were a rabble of country people to the number as above of about two hundred i could never find that they deserved to be called more  that there was any such thing as squadrons or companies either of horse or foot or any martial order such as officers or commanders or any thing like troops was a manifest forgery on purpose to amuse the nation and make the people believe what they really had some ground to fear  i must also do those people in the west this justice that tho great endeavors had been used to exasperate them and they were heartily against the union as appeared upon all occasions  but when they came to see a little into the hands that were at work against it and with whom they were like to join even the hottest among them came to themselves and to give them their due they behaved with great calmness and discretion nor could they be brought into any precipitations or extravagancies as was daily threatened  mr john hepburn their chief leader and minister had been reflected on as one that had inflamed and animated them to rise and take arms and that had been said to threaten the parliament  when he was discoursed with by some who were under concern for the public peace it discovered the frauds and falsities of those suggestions and how they were spread about to serve the great end of the public disorders and only amuse the world for he declared himself readily that indeed they had apprehensions that the union would be prejudicial to them that they did not like the articles and thought the treaters had not done their duty and the like but that as to their having any design to disturb the government or to appear in arms it was an abuse upon them they had no such thought nor should they do any thing but in a national way much less would they adhere to or encourage the designs of a jacobite french party whom he declared they abhorred and would never join with  i think this is a plain demonstration of the truth of what i have alleged all along this story viz that there was a busy party who run through the whole country by all possible artifice to agitate and disturb the minds of the peaceable people and if possible to bring them first to mistaken notions about and aversions to the union in general and then to pursue those aversions by all possible methods of distraction and confusion and that this might bring the honest and wellmeaning people of the nation either by their numbers and interest to overthrow the treaty or by their folly and miscarriage to overthrow themselves and so to weaken both  but gods goodness to this innocent people disappointed them here and we never found the least tumult or disorder on this side afterward to the particular mortification of the party that hoped for worse things from them  the declaration therefore or protest which they posted up at dumfries and which the party handed about at edinburgh as a great instance of what they hoped for from them is rather published here as an example of the notions they had poisoned the minds of the people with than as the sense of the nation in the case of the union and a sketch of what they endeavored to obtain from all the rest appendix n e x  we are now in the process of this affair come on to the middle of november  i must desire the reader to go back a little to the parliament they had begun to read the articles the second time in order to vote on them the beginning was a remarkable debate and held for several days as will appear in the minutes  the first article was like putting the previous question viz whether there should be an union with england in the sense of the present articles or no that is whether there should be an incorporate union of the nation into one kingdom to have but one name head signature constitution and parliament yea or no  the manner of this question and the difficulty with which it was carried in the house i refer to the minutes folio but i cannot but observe one significant omen of the future good success of this treaty and which i must own very much encouraged me to think it would go on notwithstanding all the vigorous opposition it met with was that it was voted on the most remarkable day for public deliverance that ever happened to this island i am as far from laying any stress on such insignificant circumstances as any man and i know they can have no efficiency in the bringing to pass the mighty events which may be ushered so into the world and therefore i bespeak the reader to note this not as a thing i lay any real weight upon  and yet it was impossible to observe without some emotion of the mind and without some presage of the good issue of this matter that the first article being the great and essential part of the union was voted and approved on that remarkable   th day of november which was made happy to britain first by the birth of the great and immortal king william to whom these nations owe so much that they cannot look on their church restored the bloody persecuting race of tyrants abdicated and fled cruelty and prelacy dethroned and all the mischiefs of a ruined nation vanished and not bless the memory of that great agent of gods goodness to them without remarkable ingratitude both to god himself the original and to that glorious instrument of our felicity the king  nor was it this alone which rendered this day remarkable to us but also that the great and remarkable revolution of britain formed in and founded upon the expedition of the same king william bears date from this time being the day which he first landed on at torbay in the west of england  it could not but be a pleasant reflection to those who remembered the particulars of these things to find that without any previous calculation or direction of men the concurrence of causes should so effectually jump for the bringing to pass the most remarkable transactions of britains establishment on the same day that her deliverance from tyranny and the many many oppressions of a most cruel and barbarous generation that aimed at suppressing the foundations of liberty and overthrowing the constitution of both kingdoms  and her deliverance from private antipathies the peace of her inhabitants and the great conjunction we hope of the hearts and affections of two nations which for many years had been filled with the most fatal and inveterat aversions should take their rise together and date their beginning both on the same fourth of november and both on that very day when the great instrument of her deliverance by whom she was put in a condition to bring all the rest to pass was born into the world happy day happy to britain happy to all europe since the events of this birth the actions of heaven in the hand of this prince have been the foundation of all the glorious things which have since happened in europe and of the humbling the great thunderer of this age who had established his kingdom in the destruction of the liberties of europe and in a view of the subverversion of the protestant religion  it was on this happy day that the first article of the union was passed in the parliament after infinite struggles clamor railing and tumult of a party who however they endeavored to engage the honest scrupulous part of the people with them yet gave this eminent discovery of the principles of their own actings in that there was an entire conjunction of the jacobite the prelatick and the popish interest in this particular and the very discovery of this opened the eyes of a great many people who in the simplicity of their hearts had joined in the general opposition to the union but when they saw the tendency of things and whither it all led when they saw the society they were going to embark with when they saw the enemies of the protestant settlement all engaged and these very people who had filled the land with the groans of oppression and the cries of blood  coming to join hands with them against an union with england when they saw that to shun an union with christians they were of necessity to come into an union with devils men that had transformed themselves into the very infernal nature and visibly acted from principles in this particular diabolical in that they tended to erect the absolute subjection of nations to the lust and unbounded appetites of lawless tyrants when they saw these things so plainly we then found an alteration and the best the most thinking and most judicious people began first to stop and consider and afterward wholly to withdraw from the party and the clamor of the people as if come to a crisis began not to be so universal but to abate and the more it did so the more the secret party who lay at the bottom of all the rest began to appear and distinguish themselves  the first article being past the hopes of the party depended upon debating the matters of taxes excises customs and as far as possible setting up the popular arguments of care for the poor  the impossibility of paying duties the incapacity of the trade to support excises and customs and the like and here they had recourse from one shift to another and like true soldiers tho in a bad cause they fought their ground by inches  from article to article they disputed every word every clause casting difficulties and doubts in the way of every argument twisting and turning every question and continually starting objections to gain time and if possible to throw some unsurmountable obstacle in the way  the consequence of this was making amendments to the articles nor was it a small disappointment to them when they saw the parliament willing to come into amendments and when by the prudence of the committee appointed to make calculations and examine those already made it appeared that their objections were either answered and confuted or the clauses so rectified and amended as that they had no more room to fasten any of their cavils they were entirely defeated and the disaster was particular in this that it showed still the more plainly to the world that their design was not to be satisfied in the amendment and alteration of what they objected against but in having something to demand that would not or could not have been reconciled  this caused a great many trifling emendations to pass which in themselves had not signification enough either to deserve the name of objections or to need any disputing  it is evident the design was to load the treaty with a multitude of amendments among which it was to be hoped somemight be found which the parliament of england would scruple or at least that it would be a precedent for the parliament of england to consider the treaty and make more amendments which being to come down to scotland again to be considered here would bring another sitting on of course when by delays the time fixed to the first of may might be elapsed the season of the year advance which hitherto had not favored them for the riots and tumults of the country and in this delay they might find further advantages  how their future actions conformed to this suggestion and how they were in every step disappointed is the next thing to be discoursed on  but i must adjourn it a little and return to the affairs of the church which were at this time in equal agitation proportionably considered and the party who opposed the union used all possible artifice to bring things into confusion there in which they discovered a double mischief in their design   to bring to pass the grand design of obstructing the treaty and   if possible to make the disorders they aimed at take their rise in the churches dissatisfactions by which last thing two other ends would have been obtained   they would have fixed the scandal of all the consequences even of their own rashest actions upon the church   they would have drawn in multitudes of zealous but innocent people to have pushed on their designs blindly imagining they had been acting for the church   but as before so even now the prudence and steadiness of the ministers in the commission of the assembly defeated all the wicked designs of this party  for tho there were in the commission a great many ministers who were sincerely and heartily against the union  yet they were not to be drawn in to act with so much imprudence as the projects of that party designed and therefore what ever of heat or unhappy warmth at several times happened there and which at one time was feared would have gone higher yet the temper and sincerity of the main body both ministers and elders always overruled and in good time suppressed it  i have already given you the address which the commission of the assembly gave in to the parliament in order to obtain a security for the church  this address effectually answered the end of the ministers in that it obtained a vote in parliament november   d viz that immediately after the first article of the union was voted the parliament will proceed to an act for the security of the doctrine discipline worship and government of the church as now by law established within this kingdom  all this time an overture or a draught of an act entitled an act for security of the true protestant religion and the government of the church as by law established within this kingdom was read and ordered to be printed  while this overture was preparing in the parliament and after it was printed there was no small endeavors used to possess the minds of the people that it was not a sufficient security for the church  there had been some suggestions spread that the parliament would put them off without effectually securing the church and all possible care was taken to improve this notion and the people were agitated on that head as much as possible some said the overture ought to have been drawn up by the commission not by the parliament and that it was leading them on in the dark with a general vote that an act should be passed without letting the church judge what was sufficient for her security and what not  it was urged against this that the commission had mentioned in their address the heads in which they ought to be secured and there was no doubt but the parliament would make that address the foundation of the act of security that if there was any thing wanting they would have time enough to renew their address for the adding such things as they judged reasonable and that therefore they ought to stay and not interfere with the proceedings of the parliament whose proper work it was to prepare their own acts  but this did not satisfy some people who insisting on the commissions concerning themselves in it the committee for public affairs moved october    in the commission that some members might be appointed to see what the parliament men had prepared for the security of the church  this was the time in which the debates in the commission run highest and when some of the elders taking offense at the warmth of some of the ministers withdrew themselves from the commission  but wiser and more moderate heads interposed and prevented the ill consequences of these things as will afterward appear  upon inspecting the overture for security of the church and viewing the provision made there for such security the members of the commission who were appointed as above reported that there were some difficulties remaining which they desired might be considered  these difficulties began a warm debate in the committee of the commission which were reported as considered by the committee and are as follows    st that it would seem that the sovereign of great britain in the coronation oath is to be sworn to maintain the rights and privileges of the church of england as by law established without any respect to the church of scotland   ly that by the oath of abjuration taken in england obliging to maintain the limitations of the succession and qualification of the successor to the crown the taker seems to be obliged to endeavor to the outmost the seclusion even of such protestants from the crown of great britain who are not of the communion of the church of england as now by law established there   ly several difficulties being proposed with relation to oaths it was discoursed how a bar may be put to the british parliaments imposing oaths upon the ministry and people of scotland inconsistent with the principles of this church   ly that the people of scotland may be exempted from the sacramental test in use in england which secludes all from any office in britain or benefit from the crown thereof who are of the communion of the church of scotland and some other things which was thought might be uneasy and of dangerous consequence to this church if not provided against in the conclusion of the union and these things being discoursed upon at great length were again referred to the committee for the public affairs of the church to be further considered and they to report  the committee to whom this affair was referred reported that they have had several meetings and discoursed at great length upon the four particulars relating to the union and heard several ministers and others upon their scruples thereanent and likeways upon a fifth particular that the constitution of the british parliament where twenty six bishops do sit as members seems to be inconsistent both with the principles of presbyterians and the covenants and engagements of this church and nation  it would be too long to set down here how the commission was daily besieged with clamours and cries raised upon the jealousics of the people  and how they were urged to all manner of improper resentment upon the allegation now raised against the security of the church as it was offered in the overture this debate rising so high i think it not improper to print the overture it self as it was first drawn up as well as when it was with amendments engrossed the first draught therefore you will find in the appendix no f x  i shall forbear entering here into any of the heats and indecencies which passed upon this debate since they came to no extraordinary height and the wisdom and forbearance on both sides prevented the evil consequences which some hoped for from them  the second address of the commission had its birth in these disputes and tho the enemies of the union expected great things from it yet as it came out quite another thing than they designed having been reduced to shape and stripped of all its monstrous figure in which it was expected to come into the world it had two consequences which served to assist even against the party that promised themselves so much good from it    st it convinced the world that however it was spread abroad that the commission would violently oppose the passing the act of security as a thing of no consequence and so put a full stop to the work it was evident the commission was not to be blinded by outsides nor screwed up by parties but that calm and clear sighted they would go on in all cases with the same gravity consideration and temper which they had shown from the beginning    ly it obviated the great debate about the church here submitting to the episcopal jurisdiction of the church of england or to the votes and suffrages of the bishops in the british parliament in that tho they did not interfere or prescribe to the parliament yet they exonerated their consciences and the whole church of scotland by making as it were a protest against it as what they would not be understood to comply with either now or by any action in time coming which should be the consequence of the union  thus the difficulties tho resolved to be presented to the parliament yet came out in a modest and humble dress suitable to the dignity as well as distance of the assembly to which and from which it was presented and yet it came out in a dress which some gentlemen of the commission particularly of the ruling elders did not approve of  some would have had this address been called a protest but the moderation of that reverend assembly crushed that motion and after some debate it obtained the title of the representation and petition  and was resolved on in the commission the   th of november and the same day presented to the parliament the exact copy of this paper you will find in the appendix no g x  when this paper was agreed on in the commission the earls of rothes and marchmont lords polwarth and forglen sir james campbell the lairds of jerviswood and ardkinlass younger and several other of the gentlemen who sat there as ruling elders declared their dissent and entered their protest against it taking instruments in the hands of the clerk of the commission and promised to give in the reasons of their dissenting which accordingly they gave in on the    th of november  upon the giving in these reasons by the elders the commission appointed a committee to wait upon the elders and to know if they insisted upon having their reasons for protesting recorded and to signify to them that if they did the commission would be obliged to draw up their answer to those reasons and to record the same likewise  the committee never obtained an answer from the gentlemen in a body but as many as they met with gave for answer that they did not insist positively on it but left it to the commission either to record it and form answers to it or not as they saw most proper  the committee having reported this the commission did at last think fit to record the protests and the reasons annexed and drew up their answers to them tho they waited two months before they entered it which because they are very material to a right understanding of the present debate i have annexed to this work in the appendix no h x i x  i think the reasons and answer are a sufficient comment upon this text and whoever pleases to peruse them will see that tho the designs of wicked men pointed much farther yet the commission both ministers and elders were wholly influenced by principles of peace honor conscience and the good of the church  i know some thought the church went too far in this affair and especially in the matter of the sacramental test which seemed a thing perfectly remote to them and what they could have no concern at all in and the gentlemen in particular were yet more willing than the ministers to have let both that and the matter of the civil power of the bishops quite alone  but if we shall consider how the ministers were daily besieged as before with the importunate violences of the people how many among them really thought this part in particular directly against the covenant and how by false reports many had been so imposed upon as to believe the sacramental test in england extended even to the members of parliament which should be sent from scotland  when i say they consider the fears and jealousies which overspread all sorts of people and how far the artifices of a wicked party were at this time in their meridian and had inexpressible influences on all sorts of people they will with me admire that the commission was able to maintain their steady resolution how they workt through those floods and kept the middle way with temper and moderation to preserve themselves from the snares laid for them  all these things considered it was in most peoples opinion a victory gained and the party received a manifest disappointment even in this representation in that the commission could be brought to no precipitations as some people flattered themselves they should  however this may be the general opinion i know some people took ill the length they went in this affair and thought they exceeded their proper sphere  but i believe those gentlemen are very well satisfied with the unanswerable arguments drawn from hence against those who not content with this length thought to upbraid them with forgetting the national obligation of the covenant which they fairly quitted themselves of by that article in which they declare civil places of church men to be not submitted to by them but against both their covenant and consciences and so have fairly exonerated the church from that affair which stuck so near her  the representation was presented to the house just when the overture for the security of the church was under their consideration and however it did not at present meet with a very favorable reception even by those who were the churches very good friends who thought as before they run it too high and also ill timed it yet neither did the gentlemen wholly omit the things requested therein tho they seemed to sleep for some time but particularly the clause about the valuation of teinds and plantation of kirks which they passed an act for by it self the matter of oaths seems also settled in the amendments to the overture the other as the matter of the sacramental test and the suffrages of bishops in the british parliament was silently let fall as things they could by no means meddle with in the treaty  here the opposers of the union met with another disappointment for had these two articles been insisted on they knew the event would have been a rupture of the treaty and their great end had been answered viz to obtain the parliament to demand something which they knew england could never grant  thus this storm blew over the act of security for the church was voted and laid by to be annexed to the articles and made part of the union as shall afterward appear  as this had made a great noise in the assembly so it had been no less canvassed all over the nation some condemned the assembly in the main and pretended to censure them publicly for engaging themselves in matters that had so plain a tendency to breaking up the union and desiring the parliament to concern themselves in those affairs in england which could really admit of no debate in this case  but as if the commission wanted the authority of their constituents to back them in their proceedings and to justify their conduct the respective presbyteries in the country began to come in with letters or a sort of addresses testifying their approbation of what the commission had done etc but the commission diligently avoiding every thing that was tumultuary or popular gave a cold answer to them as particularly to that of dumfermling who subjoyning to their approbation of the petition their desire about fasts public and private as in a time of impending dangers the commission resolved that their act about fasts past before did sufficiently answer the presbyteries desire and so took no notice of the rest which prudent way of proceeding stopped that design which seemed to be only to make the representation as popular as they could that it might on the one hand encourage further petitions and secondly oblige the parliament to come into their measures  while this was thus carrying on in the commission the country began to be very uneasy and threatenings came in every day of coming up in armies and rabbles to raise the parliament and to desire that the church might be secured  the presbyteries of glasgow and of stirling sent letters to the commission containing heads of grievances and representing several things which they desired the commission to demand of the parliament for the churches security  to this the commission of the assembly answered that they had done or were now doing all that was desired in their letters  an ill natured motion was made in the commission also to send circular letters to all the presbyteries to send up their members to the commission and a committee was appointed to consider of it  but this occasioned such variety of debates that the committee could come to no resolution but referred it back to the commission and there it dropped  this was a plain design to renew the debates and if possible to bring the commission to protest or declare themselves against the union  the representation was now before the parliament but as yet they took no notice of it and it was apparent that they pursued their treaty for some time without any respect to the said representation and indeed it was foreseen they would do so the gentlemen easily seeing that if these things were insisted it was just a resolution to break off the union  the other party eagerly reported about town that it was a disrespect to the church not to regard her solemn representation and then the consequences of the bishops voting in parliament were laid forth and the danger of the church was now their general discourse some were alarmed with this chimera that the parliament had not a sincere respect for the churches safety that the gentlemen had no great concern about the matter and so the church would be exposed to her enemies by the negligence of her friends  but the commission saw through all this and having done what they thought their duty both for the churches security and for the exonerating their consciences in the cases they could not comply with they resolved to stand still and leave the consequences of things todivine providence without pushing at things impracticable or such things as tended only to division  this steadiness of the ministers broke all the measures of the party their hopes to embroil the ministers with the parliament vanished  and the discourse of the representation or petition began to grow old and die  the commission had their hands full of their representations of another sort about the growth of popery the ill practices of some of the deposed ministers and the like and so it wore off by degrees  i mention in this account the prudence and moderation of the ministers so often not that i design to write panegyricks here much less to flatter the persons of the ministers but who ever knew the management of that time and reflects back on the particulars will easily join with me in this  that there were several parts of management practiced upon the ministers in order to ruin their counsels besides what the open debates of the commission discovered and particularly such as follows    there was a design if possible to bring the ministers into a general declaration against the union as dangerous to their liberties inconsistent with their principles and contrary to the obligation of the national covenant of this i have spoken in the course of the story    there was a manifest design to bring them to a rupture among themselves and that if possible supposing the union should proceed or not proceed the disagreeing party might be brought to a breaking off or dividing from the rest and so form a settled stated dissent or breach in the church  nor was this a thing of small consequence for it was really big with a large variety of mischiefs and very cunningly contrived snares were laid for the whole body not of the assembled ministers only but the constitution of the church of scotland whose destruction was almost visible in the project had it met with success  had the union been completed without the concurrence of the ministers in commission  either the church affair must have been left out or the enemies of it would have always said it had been settled without her approbation and consequently the settlement been both imperfect and illegal  had one party declared for the union and another against it and had both those parties adhered to their respective declaration by any public separation as a party the house had been divided against it self and the consequence would have been hoped for with but too much probability  in this very case the prudence of the ministers i say was remarkable and next to the wisdom of providence directing was the only means of preventing the mischief contrived it is not to be doubted but in the commission of the assembly and among the ministers without there were men of various sentiments some against and some for the union but their wisdom was particularly seen in this that however they differed in the debating things they always concurred in every public act of the commission and made no division for nor against it  we find but one protest in the whole affair which was in the case of the representation and petition and this began among the ruling elders and continued there for none of the ministers ever adhered to that protest but even those that were against some parts of the representation yet seeing themselves outvoted acquiescd nor was all the representation objected against by any body  it was a paper i doubt nor some hoped to draw mischief from yet that mischief had its disappointment effectually tho the paper had its success in being carried on for it appeased the minds of many who being satisfied of having exonerated their conscience acquiesed in other cases with the more freedom nor was the representation in general without its particular reasons to be assigned for it as is further expressed in the sequel of the story as to the ministers in all other cases how warmly soever they debated and with whatsoever firmness the several ministers adhered to their opinions yet they submitted their votes to the plurality and all things were carried in a regular and orderly way to the great disappointment of their enemies and to the great ease and satisfaction of all good men of every opinion  nor should i do justice here to particular persons if i did not acknowledge and record it to his honor that much of this is justly due to the prudence patience and temper of the reverend moderator mr william wishart then minister of leith who was moderator of the assmbly and also of the commission and who acted the true moderator in all these disputes wisely calming tempering and with difficulty enough reducing the warmest debates to a method of conclusion  and i must own he had a task of no small difficulty tho he had no doubt the concurrence and assistance of the men of most candor temper and judgment on either side since it could not but be visible to every thinking man who had any concern for the good of the church that to run any differences up to a head could issue in nothing but the utmost confusion gratify the enemy grieve all good christians and in the end ruin the peace of the church  and this remark of mine is the more just in that i could not but observe that the debates on these affairs had sometimes that unhappy warmth that they seemed to tend necessarily to a breach and to come to the very point and lookers on of whom i was one with a sad heart expected something fatal not to the union only but to the whole church must unavoidably have followed every debate  and yet we always found cooler thoughts prevailed and wise men yielding this way and that continually maintained a harmony in concluding what ever there was in debating  another piece of conduct was very instrumental to preserving the public tranquillity viz that the ministers generally speaking kept these debates out of the pulpit for tho all manner of society was taken up with disputes of the grand affair the pulpit was very free of it i say generally speaking what indiscretions there were had not influence enough on the rest to recommend the example  particularly i think it was a very great wisdom in those ministers who were for the union and who had many prompters to it had the government to countenance them in it and enemies enough to catch at it if they had i say it was their wisdom that they forbore it  and i think these happy consequences followed to prove it so    it took away all pretense from those people who designed in this unhappy game to play one part of the church against the other and set up one side against the other more effectually    it took away the ground of pulpit clamor and kept those people silent who had it once begun there would have been loudest by far in the exclamation  for had one party first preached for it the other would of course have preached against it and so the pulpit been made a mere stage of contention  but on both sides the ministers as well on private as public days let it generally alone they prayed for direction and blessing on the parliament and on the meeting of the ministers as transacting difficult and doubtful cases but avoided entering into debates  i think i do them nothing but justice therefore in hinting that the temper and calmness with which the generality of the ministers behaved in this nice occasion was very great and contributed very much to the quiet carrying on the great work  soon after this the country tumults came upon the stage and as it was a peculiar to this treaty that the very methods taken to ruin it concurred to press it forward so these tumults served to open the eyes and calm the spirits of abundance of those honest people who were prejudiced before who tho they were willing to oppose the union as what did not correspond with their opinions and as they thought with the public good yet when they saw it going to arms rebellion and blood and when they saw this farther that in order to oppose this national conjunction they were to join in a civil war against their governors with their and the nations known enemies their eyes began to open and they slackned very much from that time their appearance against the treaty  this manifestly showed the difference between the men who in the singleness of their hearts opposed it as apprehending it unsafe for the established church and inconsistent with their national engagements and those on the other hand who opposed it as contrary and fatal to the popish succession of james viii as they called him and the episcopal hierarchy  and these differed just as the two harlots in solomons time  the true mother of the child chose to lose her possession of him rather than that the child should be murdered so these faithful friends to their country however possessed against the union by the public clamor yet they would choose to suffer the inconveniences they feared rather than see their country involved in blood a civil war breaking out in the bowels of the kingdom and foreign popish or tyrannical powers invading their privileges and pulling down all before them  this will appear to be the case in the farther pursuit of the story and the sight of this affected the hearts of a great many of those who had any compassion for their country and from this time forward the commission met with less disturbance from the hot people on these heads but went on calmly and with all the temper and moderation that could be expected  the letter from the presbytery of hamilton gave them some little disturbance but it was soon over and their circular letter to presbyteries to endeavor to preserve the public peace not only showed their own resolution to keep all quiet and peaceable but discouraged all endeavors afterward to disorder them of which by it self   but things were now grown to a strange height and the same engines who so boasted of the effects of the representation and petition above said showed themselves not idle in their management of affairs abroad for they carried on the discontents of the people to all possible height  and indeed the case of the poor common people of scotland was very hard in respect to their share in these matters they are not the only common people in the world who take things by whole sale and who being inflamed with the clamours and arguments of the more knowing sort their landlords leaders heads of families and as they too properly call them masters and alarmed with outcries of dangers and distresses which were to come upon them by the union things which they could not answer nor had any reason to question the truth of seeing their great men possessed with the belief of them it is no wonder they were exasperated to the highest degree and ready to attempt any thing to save themselves from the destruction at hand  again they were not altogether the people that were disagreeable to them neither from whom these discontents began had they been only the episcopal or jacobite or popish party that had started these things a short answer would have opened the eyes of the common people and it had sufficed to tell them from whom their objections came  but when by the subtilty and artifice of these men they had drawn in a great many of the honest wellmeaning people of the country who were known to be well affected to the present civil establishment of the nation and zealous for its religious establishment when these were seen among the number of the warm opposers of the union shaking their heads at the articles and frighted at the terrible consequences which were talked of  who can wonder that the rest of the people began to be uneasy and that those uneasinesses at last broke out into excesses madness and distraction  the people of scotland i say are not the first instance how easily it is to be imposed upon and how readily a mob is raised by a rumor how soon did the jews of asia put all jerusalem in an uproar when they made them believe their worship was in danger by pauls preaching and that he not only invaded their worship but had actually defiled the temple how readily did they lay hold of the blessed apostle and had certainly murdered him if the civil authority had not assisted by the military rescued him out of the hands of the mob and put the case in the way of a fair hearing  it was not for the poor people to distinguish the original of causes and things nor who was at the bottom of these rumors it was not for them to distinguish the hand of joab in all this whether jacobite or papist was the original of this matter was not for them to examine they saw their superiors joining in the same complaint and every party saw some of their respective chiefs embarked  the common people could look no further the episcopal poor saw their curates tooth and nail against it the ignorant and indifferent poor saw their jacobite landlords and masters railing at it and which was worse still the honest presbyterian poor people saw some of their gentlemen and such as they had remarked and noticed to be hearty presbyterians yet appearing against it  who then can censure the poor depending uninformed and abused people  and how but by these concurring accidents was it possible the poor deluded people of glasgow and the west could be drawn into mobs and tumults in gratification of that very party to whom they have been the very antipodes the reverse even in all the ages of the reformation by whom they had been plundered rifled butchered and persecuted in the most barbarous manner with cruelties and extravagancies innumerable will any man say the men of glasgow famous for their zeal in religion and the liberties of their country even from the very infancy of the reformation were now turned enemies to the church of scotland and ready to fight against her in the quarrel of their bloody and inveterate enemies the papists and jacobites it could not be  will any man suggest that glasgow had forgotten her self so much that the blood of her citizens and inhabitants shed in the old articles of pentland and bothwell and the ravages made upon her and the countries round her after those unhappy times even to the confines of the revolution were forgotten  will any body think the glasgow men had so far forgot the history of twenty years ago only that they could now join with the murderers of their brethren and fathers and take up arms in favor of their mortal enemies no no nothing less it was all delusion and mere artifice the party played the presbyterian against the presbyterian the williamite against the williamite and having subtly possessed a few honest but deluded people with the frenzy of the time made them the tools of their projects if possible to bring them to pull down one another that they might afterward with the more ease devour them both   and this leads me of course into the story of the glasgow rabble which now came upon the stage and which in its turn tho raised with a differing design was one of the proofs of gods providence working every thing howsoever pointed at the union to act for it and further its conclusion  they had had in edinburgh continual alarms of the rising of the people in the west and north parts in order by force to put an end to the treaty tho the people themselves knew nothing of it nor had any such design to day it was in angus to morrow in galloway now at stirling then at lanerk then at hamilton then at glasgow but nothing yet appeared and some began to mock these fears as groundless  the party made their different uses of the reports to day enlarge them to terrify and amuse to morrow lessen them again as mere rumors to lessen the watchfulness of the government and make them secure but the design was manifestly to procure the tumults they expected by reporting they were begun  that these fears were not groundless or those alarms mere chimeras may be seen by the commission of the kirks circular letters to the several presbyteries to desire them to keep the peace and to be earnest to prevent such tumults to which the presbytery of hamilton gave an answer which seemed to object against those fears as unjust tho it did not afterward appear so vide the appendix n m  and now tho in the story of the glasgow rabble i shall be obliged to mention the unhappy slip in those prudentials which as i have observed the ministers generally speaking behaved with  i shall not however offend any person of common charity since i shall be far from saying the gentleman here did this with a design to raise the tumult that followed much less would i so much as suspect that he could in the least have it in his thoughts to gratify the folly and projected destruction of the kirk of scotland which in all these things was apparent enough in the secret party that pushed on these things  as to the rashness and intemperate zeal or whatever other mistaken foundation it had producing the heat and warmth of the expression i have the charity to believe he is convinced of the error of that and so while i am obliged to repeat the circumstance i shall as little as possible reflect upon the person being desirous in all cases rather to cover than expose the undesigning failures of all honest men as what they may be led into by mistake but never prosecute when their judgments are better informed  but to come to the particulars of this unhappy story at glasgow which i shall relate with all the impartiality possible and without respect of persons both for the sake of the history which it is necessary to transmit faithfully to posterity as also for setting things in a true light and placing the guilt where it is justly due which at present is understood to the prejudice of that city in general and of those honest gentlemen among the inhabitants who had no concern in it unless it were to be insulted and made uneasy by it  the first uneasiness that i meet with among the people here i mean that was particular for the general vneasinesses about the treaty were visible every where as i have hinted already was about addressing  great had been the endeavors of a party of men all over the kingdom to bring in numerous addresses to the parliament against the treaty in order to fortify that argument which was now brought in as a strong bar against the immediate proceeding viz that it was against the general inclination of the people which you will find moved in the house upon the second reading of the first article as per the minutes  the party at glasgow had been very busy to persuade the magistrates to address as the other royal burghs had many of them done but the magistrates showing no inclination to it they found there was no way to bring it about but by the common people  nor could all their credit with the common people bring it to pass the instruments being chiefly jacobites papists and episcopal people whose reputation and interest in the city of glasgow and parts adjacent had always been but very low and now lower than ever so that to effect their design they had recourse to the policy of the times viz deluding and imposing upon others and this did their work for had they not made use of some weaker brethren who had more influence upon the people they had never brought it to pass  to bring in some of these all the popular arguments mentioned before were improved among others the danger of the kirk of scotland i believe i may say in their favor was not the least  drawn in by these specious pretenses the jacobite party had the pleasure to ly by and see their work done to their hand and the people being sufficiently enflamed they waited the issue when one unhappy indiscretion to say no worse of it finished all their hopes and brought to pass the mischief they designed in the best manner for them they could have wished for  some of the elders of the church had privately waited on the provost whether moved by their minister or by the common people or of their own heads i shall not determine tho it is not very difficult to trace it to its beginning but it is apparent the minister we are to mention as well as some others in the town were very earnest for the thing their business was it seems to move the provost that an address might be pretented to the parliament against the union they might have commanded a popular address among themselves but that was not what they desired but an address in the name of the city by the provost baillies etc  the provost answered to this purpose that he did not think it would be prudent for them to address at this time that he had been at edinburgh and had consulted the lord advocat and some of the city of glasgows best friends and all unanimously advised them against it and gave it as their opinion it was not their interest to do it particularly he reminded them the parliament had but the last session granted them the tax of two pennies the pint and if they should now appear as a town in this address it might urge them to repeal their grant and the city might be a great sufferer  this was a very good reason why he should decline the address if the gentlemen had been in a condition to hearken to reason for if the magistrates had addressed they must also have followed it with reasons and arguments openly as a body which in such case would have been in all probability ill taken by the parliament if as is very likely those reasons had been such as came in from other places peremptorily inhibiting their proceedings and impeaching their power to act without leave from their constituents which indeed was the thing now insisted upon and generally aimed at in the project of addressing  the provost having thus tho very calmly and respectfully declined the matter the people appeared very uneasy and some hot expressions had been let fall in discourse about the town that they would have an address one way or other but one unhappy accident soon discovered the meaning of the whole  on thursday the day of the fast appointed by the commission of the assembly was kept in glasgow mr c  k minister of the trone kirk preached from the words in ezra      and i proclaimed a fast at the river of ahava that we might afflict our selves before our god to seek of him a right way for us and for our little ones and for all our substance  i shall convince the gentleman concerned that this account is not made for a satyr upon him it is too serious a subject and when both he and those who heard him reflects on how much more his unhappy temper at that time forced from him than i set down here all which i have by me verbatim as he spoke it he will i say be convinced that i talk no more than in the obligation of a historian to truth of fact i am bound to do  in the conclusion of his sermon after telling his hearers the sad condition they were brought to and how forward glasgow used to be in the honest cause he added to this purpose addresses would not do and prayers would not do there must be other methods it is true prayer was a duty but we must not rest there  and closed it with these words wherefore up and be valiant for the city of our god  i am not at all apprehensive of having the truth of these words questioned having received them from the mouths of more than two or three of the principal inhabitants of glasgow who heard them spoken and if the misplacing a word should be snatched at i venture to say that this was the full purport of the expression without the least variation as to the weak good man that spoke them i will not suggest that he foresaw the consequence of them or had any such thing in his design tho it calls for some charity to guess his meaning the kindest thing i can say of them is that he did not mean at all what followed but spoke in his haste for god forbid i should suggest he meand to raise a rebellion and to bring his country into all that blood and confusion which if gods goodness had not prevented it had certainly followed  the sermon ended about eleven a clock and the people were so enflamed before that by one of the clock the mob were gotten together their drum was beat in the backstreets and all the confusions we are now to speak of followed  the next day the deacons of the trades which is the same as in london the masters of the companies followed with a meddling number of by tradesmen in scotland is understood none but the meaner sort of people such as shoemakers smiths butchers weavers and the like as in england are called handycrafts the shopkeepers such as mercers drapers grocers etc are all called merchants tradesmen came to a chamber in the tolbooth where the magistrates sit and where the city council assembles and where the provost generally is every morning the councilhouse and leaving the people below the deacons of trades and some few went up to the provost and demanded of him very rudely if he would address  the provost tho surprised with their manner composed himself and according to his known calmness and steadiness of temper told them that he was not satisfied to address and an eminent inhabitant of the town viz the lord of blackhouse used a great many arguments with them civilly to persuade them to be easy and satisfied and not to promote any disorders in the city  while they were thus discoursing in the townhouse the number of the people increased without and began to be tumultuous but as soon as the deacons came out and reported to them in short that the provost had refused to address the people fell a shouting and raging and throwing stones and raised a very great uproar  and here the deacons deservedly obtain the title of the raisers of this rabble for had they related the calmness the reasonings and the manner with which the provost very discreetly answered them the people might very easily have been quietly dismissed but now it was too late the answer as it was given to them was only in gross that the provost was resolute and would not address  enraged thus they slung stones at the windows and as much as they could insulted the provost but he found means to withdraw so that they could not hurt him for that time  in this rage they went directly to the provosts house got into it took away all his arms which were about twenty five muskets etc some few things were stolen in the throng but that was not much from thence they went to the lord of blackhouses dwelling broke his windows and showed their teeth and thus the first tumult ended  the provost retired for a while out of town and the lord of blackhouse also not knowing what the issue of these things might be  i pay no complement at all here but a debt to truth in noting that the provost of glasgow for that time aird esquire was an honest sober discreet gentleman one that had always been exceedingly beloved even by the common people particularly for his care of and charity to the poor of the town and at another time would have been the last man in the town they would have insulted  i mention this to obviate the supposition that the rabble took this occasion to insult him upon former resentments as has been usual in like cases  the provost being withdrawn and the address they designed thus balked  they set it on foot without him and indeed they effectually answered the magistrates desire who resolved if there was an address it should be a mere mob address  many a mean step they took to get hands by threatening affrighting and hurrying people into it taking youths and mere childrens hands to it  every man that refused to sign it was threatened to be rabbled and have his house plundered which made a great many timorous people sign it that did not approve of it  this being the method it may easily be imagined the address was not many days a finishing and such as it was they sent it away by four of the townsmen whereof the first two robert scot deacon of the tailors stevenson deacon of the shoemakers john bowman dean of guild and john hamilton gentleman were the four that went up to the parliament with the address were the deacon of the tailors and the deacon of the shoemakers the other two that went with it were gentlemen too well known to be suspected of desiring any such kind of tumultuous proceedings but complied with their desire in order to prevent worse consequences  if the multitude of addresses which have been boasted of as a declaration of the aversion of the people to the union may be guessed at by this those gentlemen who bring this as an argument have small reason to boast and need not be very forward to have the particulars examined into  the address having thus been signed and sent away the people begun to be quiet again and the tumults seemed to have an end the provost who had fled to edinburgh came home again and every one went quietly about their business till a little while after a new occasion set all in a flame again worse than it was before and made it appear who was at the bottom of it all  and here the warm gentleman who from the pulpit put the match to this gun powder may see who laid the train  the triffle of addressing was the least thing they sought for tho that served a purpose also  and these good people who were drawn in to begin it saw no farther but now it appeared to be all jacobite and papist at the bottom that blood and confusion was the thing they drove at and king james prelacy tyranny popery and all the mischiefs this nation has to fear from them lay hid in the design as will presently appear and the poor thoughtless multitude were only hurryed into it by a conjunction of mistakes  the second rabble had a beginning as small as the first tho not so soon laid because the first had only the address in view and was managed by a few that the contrivers of those disorders had imposed upon and deluded but this part was under the more immediate conduct of the very party themselves and was introduced as follows  one of the magistrates it was baillie hamilton of the city had committed a the fellows name was parker a loose vagabond profligate fellow of a very ill character a spinner of tobacco by employment but a very scandalous person fellow to the tolbooth for theft  he had it seems been taken offering to sale a musket or some other things which it was made appear belonged to the provost of the city and which was taken out of his house in the time of the rabble abovementioned  this fellow lay in the tolbooth for some time but it was observed that in an evening there would be several of the common people at the window talking to him through the grates of the prison  the provost apprehending that the imprisonment of this fellow might be a pretense for a new disturbance resolved to discharge him but that it might not seem to be done for fear took a this is called there a bond of presentation and is all one with a simple recognizance without bail bond of him to appear again when called for and among the rest of the people who came to talk with him at the grate was one finlay a loose sort of a fellow who had formerly been a sergeant in dumbartons regiment in flanders and who openly professed himself a jacobite a fellow that followed no employ but his mother kept a little the common name for an ale house or inn in that country change house at the remotest part of the town on the edinburgh side  the fellow had given his comrades an account that the magistrates had taken a bond of him and the next morning this finlay and a rabble with him comes up to the clerks chamber another office in the the town house in which is their offices and also the prison for the city it is generally like the guild hall of a city or the town house in england saving that the prison is generally in the same house in scotland tolbooth where the magistrates meet and there they demand this bond of the clerk it being put into his hands  the magistrates willing to take away all occasions of tumult and to leave them no excuse ordered the bond to be delivered up for the gentlemen rabble had now the full command of the town  but to let it be seen that these were but seeking occasions notwithstanding the provost had told them they should have the bond delivered up and they had now no reason but to be satisfied the clerk having orders to deliver it they continued together resolving to insult the provost at his coming out  the provost not imagining any danger having granted their request comes innocently out of the tolbooth and went toward his own house the rabble immediately gathered about him thrusting and abusing him and not with villainous language only but with stones and dirt and such like thrown at him  he would have made to his own house but the multitude increasing and growing furious he took sanctuary in a house and running up a stair case lost the rabble for some time they pursuing him into a wrong house however they searched every apartment to the top of the stair and came into the very room where he was but the same hand that smote the men of sodom with blindness when they would have rabbled the angels protected him from this many headed monster and so blinded them that they could not find him it is the opinion of many of the soberest and most judicious of the citizens that if they had found him their fury was at that time so past all government that they would have murdered him and that in a manner barbarous enough and if they had as we say of a bull dog once but tasted blood who knows where they would have ended  the provost was hid in a bed which folded up against the wall and which they never thought of taking down  having escaped this eminent danger he was conveyed out of town the next day by his friends and went for the second time to edinburgh  the rabble was now fully master of the town they ranged the streets and did what they pleased no magistrate durst show his face to them they challenged people as they walked the streets with this question are you for the union and no man durst own it but at their extremest hazard  the next thing they did was to search for arms in all the houses of those that had appeared for the union and first they went to the dean of guild and upon his refusing to give them his arms they took them away by force they stopped here a little but having given out that they would search the houses of all that were for the union the magistrates assembled and considering that if the citizens were disarmed and the rabble possessed of their weapons they might in the next place possess their houses wives and wealth at their command and that it was better to defend themselves now than be murdered and plundered in cold blood they resolved therefore to raise some strength to oppose this violence and accordingly ordered the town guards to be doubled that night and removed the place of arms from the usual guard house to the tolbooth  and that this guard should be of select persons such as they knew  accordingly orders were sent to all the captains of the city militia that each of them should bring twelve men with them such as they could depend upon would stand by them to secure the peace of the city and this was besides the ordinary guard  this was done readily and with great secrecy and celerity the captains of the militia being faithful honest gentlemen brought their men without any noise beat of drum or the like and leaving the ordinary guard at the usual the usual place for the guard of the town is in the tronegate street place and were that night increased to a whole company and this select guard was placed in the in the tolbooth one pair of stairs high council chamger  the rabble who had resolved to be as good as their words were now gotten together and whether they thought the magistrates were met in the council chamger and so they resolved to begin with them or whether they had intelligence that they were upon their guard is not certain but about nine a clock at night they gathered about the tolbooth and seeing a sentinel placed at the top of the the stone steps on the out side where the iron rails are and where the officers stand to read proclamations or any public acts stair finlay of whom before is ordered to go up and see what they were a doing as he called it  when he came to the top of the stair the sentinel challenged him and thrust him back but he comes on again and thrusts in with the sentinel and gets by him  at this juncture one of the citizens who was privately appointed to meet as above was just coming up and having passed as privately as he could through the mob who were at the stair foot to the number of about  00 being a select party only for the rest were not then got together was going up the stairs this gentleman seeing a fellow assault the sentinel boldly stepped up to him and knocked him down on the stair head with the butt end of his musket and immediately calls the guard  the guard immediately took to their arms and headed by one lieutenant lindsay an old soldier of king williams but now a burgess and inhabitant of the city they came down and drew up at the foot of the stair  some pieces were fired in the street but whether at the guard or no was not known the multitude was great by this time and being late at night it could not well be discerned but as they had all the reason in the world to expect it they fell resolutely to work with them and sallying upon the rabble they immediately fled and dispersed  having thus broke the first body of them it was observed that they only fled from the immediate shock but stood in throngs under the the new buildings at the cross have small piazzas of stone on both sides under which the shops are and the people may walk in wet weather piazzas and in the heads of closses closses are the same with bylanes or alleys  to see what the guard would do and that with one hallow they could all be together again in a moment whereupon a party was ordered down there are but four principal streets which all meet at the cross and lead to the four gates of the city every street to clear the piazzas and closses and see the rabble effectually dispersed which they did but were all the way assaulted from the houses and out of the closses with curses and stones the former did not much hurt except to the givers but the latter wounded several of the inhabitants and some were very much hurt  had they been able to have renewed this guard the public peace had been maintained and the whole design of this rabble disappointed but it is to be noted these gentlemen were all citizens heads of families and of the principal inhabitants the commonalty was universally debauched and not to be trusted and the gentlemen could not do duty every night neither had all that were zealous enough against the tumults either bodies to bear the fatigue of soldiers or hearts to adventure and those that were forwardest could not be always in arms  this first piece of work was on saturday night the next night they relieved the guard by the like select number and all was quiet for while these men appeared the rabble durst not stir  on monday the magistrates summoned the town council and sending for the deacons of the tradesmen the thing proposed was what course should be taken to secure the peace of the city and keep the magistrates and inhabitants from plunder and insult  the deacons of trades subtly and as appeared designedly at least such of them as were in the design proposed that this select guard should be omitted and pretended to promise that if any tumult happened they would come to the town guard with their men to defend the city which whoever observes how well they performed will think it no breach of charity to say they never designed it  however for this week there was no more tumult but the mob reigned masters and finlay who now had made himself one of their leaders set up a guard at the upper end of the town near the cathedral as it were in opposition to the town guard  this whole week was spent in amusements and raising reports of the rising of the people at stirling at hamilton and in angus and that a great army of them was to rendezvous at hamilton from whence they were to march to edinburgh to raise the parliament finlay gives out that he will march with all the men of glasgow to meet their brethren at hamilton on the same design  by whose assistance all this was done the government was too merciful to make a narrow enquiry and so i must leave it as they did in the dark having brought the folly and madness of the poor people to such a height finlay actually gets together about    men or that was the most of the great army he raised and on the friday following this contemptible wretch having made himself their general marches out of the city with them for hamilton they were armed with muskets and swords such as they had taken out of the magistrates houses and wherever he procured it for every one knows he had it not of his own he distributed to every man a dollar  and thus in arms against their native country and the protestant religion these poor deluded people marched away under the command of an abject scondrel wretch that openly professed himself a jacobite and that with his good will would have seen all the presbyterians in scotland ruined  but to such a pass were things now come and who can account for some critical junctures in which men may be brought to ruin themselves with their own hands and never suffer themselves to listen to the cautions of their friends  the town though rid of finlay and his vanguard enjoyed not the more peace or were in less danger for the mob that remained kept up their guard threatened yet worse things than had been done and were afterward as good as their words to a title  the government it may be supposed were constantly acquainted with those things and their forbearance had not a little heartened up the party that pushed these mischiefs on however being loath to come to extremities they tried gentler methods first and the lord high commissioner having laid it before the parliament they immediately passed an act discharging the mustering of troops in the country during this session and a proclamation was published against tumults and both these were sent to glasgow to be published  it should be noted here that by the act of security any of the nobility gentry or towns might meet in arms muster and exercise their fencible men and the like upon any occasion of which they were judges which was done in order to make the militia of scotland more serviceable or as some think in terrorem to serve a cause but be that as it will it may remain undetermined but at this juncture the parliament foresaw it might be a handle for the drawing together any number of men at such a time as this and might be dangerous to the peace wherefore they caused an act to be brought in to repeal that part of the act of security for so long only as the present parliament was sitting  when this act of parliament and proclamation came to town which was on the monday after finlays march the magistrates assembled about ten in the morning and caused the messenger that brought it to read it at the cross accordingly the messenger goes up to the the head of the stone stair on the outside of the tolbooth just fronting the cross the same mentioned before where the sentinel stood usual place and read first the act of parliament the magistrates were below and the officers attending as usual and a vast multitude of people were got together to hear what it was before the officer had done the people began to make a noise and throw stones at him but however the man went on and read out the act and began the proclamation against tumults but he had hardly read the title of the proclamation when the stones came so thick there was no standing it and the poor fellow not a little bruised was driven off the stair  upon this the magistrates ordered one of the town officers to go up and read which he did as far as he could but was in like manner driven off by the fury of the stoning in the interim of this the magistrates had sent for the town guard to protect the second officer in reading the officer of the guard seeing the other officer abused thus before their faces commands his men to fall upon the rabble with the clubs of their muskets which they did and knocked down some of them but the tradesmen that were upon the guard in the very action deserted and refused to obey the command of their officers which so encouraged the rabble that they came on again with shouts and huzzas and with volleys of stones they fell upon the few of the guard that were faithful and drove them off from the street  the officer that commanded them retreated them into the guard house but this was not a place to be defended against such a multitude so in short they broke in upon them and disarmed them and well it was they came off without blood  some of them were very much bruised with stones  the rabble now flusht with victory were in a terrible fury and this was the most outrageous part of the whole transaction having disarmed the guard the next thing was to storm the tolbooth immediately they get ladders to the windows and breaking in they seize upon   0 halberts which are the towns arms with these upon their shoulders in rank and file they roved about the streets and made their rendezvous at the old castle where their guard was kept here they gave out that in the afternoon they would come down and plunder the merchants houses nay and threatened their lives too which put the whole city in an unspeakable consternation  nor were they wanting in some part of their threatened execution for about three in the afternoon they detached a party of about twenty men armed some with muskets some with halberts these with a drum before them came to the cross and from thence took their march down the high streets breaking open the doors and houses of who ever they pleased pretending to search for arms but stole and plundered whatever came in their way and thus they continued till ten a clock at night  they got not above thirty muskets with some pistols and swords but the terror of the inhabitants is not to be expressed who were obliged to bear this violence without complaint this small party was followed by a vast throng of boys and idle fellows like themselves which increased the fright of the citizens   having thus ranged the city at pleasure till about ten a clock at night they marched away with the spoil of their masters up to their main guard from thence they beat their tatoo round the town like a garrison and indeed they were no less for they had the city in their full possession and every bodies life and goods at their mercy  their rudeness in this pretended search for arms is not to be described and had they met with any opposition no doubt it would have been worse they came into the rooms where persons that lay sick were just dying and put all things into inexpressible confusion they came into chambers where women were lying in and barbarously made them rise pretending to search under their beds for arms in short except that there was no blood shed they acted the exact part of an enraged ungoverned multitude  but to return to their army of forty five which was all this while on its march and were advanced as far as kilsyth on their way to edinburgh  the government who had an exact account of all these things and who had tried all the gentle methods of proclamations acts of parliament etc finding to what height things were brought and that nothing but force could remedy them prepared to be beforehand with these forward gentlemen and having an account both of their march and number the lord commissioner ordered a detachment of dragoons joined with some horse granadeers of the guard under the command of colonel campbell uncle to the duke of argyll to march with all expedition for glasgow  finlay in the mean time being at kilsyth has notice of the march of these dragoons within a few hours after his arrival there and hearing no news of the great parties of   and  000 which he had persuaded his men would meet him there and being alarmed at the news of the dragoons he sends back  campbell another of the ringleaders of his rabble to bring up the second body which was to be ready to follow and which were reported to be  00 but they thanked him and stayed at home and with the rest he marched to hamilton where he arrived on sunday about noon the third day after his march from glasgow  here he quartered his army that night and finding as before none of the friends that were to assemble from all parts nor no news of them he bestowed a volley of curses upon them and marches directly back to glasgow where he arrived to the no small mortification of his fellows on wednesday the next day but one after the plunderings i have related before they had halted at rugland a burgh about two miles from glasgow where as i suppose they called a council of war among themselves but being all voters they agreed upon nothing but to march home which accordingly they did and in order of battle entered the city and marched directly up to their main guard aforesaid here they made says my author their rendezvous having not thought fit to keep the field any longer  and now they began to think a little for i cannot allow my self to say they had done it before their danger began now to show it self and to stare in their faces a little they began to consider what they had been doing with others and what was now like to be doing with them they had no more protection from the act about mustering and the proclamation began to work with them and now they did the only rational act of their whole management and which indeed saved all their lives  on thursday morning having maturely weighed their affairs they resolved to separate and lay down their arms which accordingly they did very quietly and calmly and carried their arms not to the magistrates where they had them but to the deacons of their trades who they knew were their friends  how it came to pass that providence whom they had so far provoked inspired them with this prudence so seasonably for their own safety none but that infinite goodness that punishes less than crimes deserve can say it is most certain they had no particular intelligence of the march of the queens troops for the city it self knew nothing of them more than in general but it was not full two hours after they had separated delivered their arms and all was quiet but the dragoons entered the town not a magistrate nor an inhabitant knew of them till they saw them upon the street to their no small satisfaction  the whole party was about   0 men they had marched with great secrecy all night and suffered no body to pass by them to carry notice before of their coming  when they came near the city colonel campbell detached an advanced party of twenty five dragoons under the command of lieutenant pollock who knew the town and knew where finlay lived the whole body following at a small distance  the lieutenant entering the town stopped and allighted just at finlays door and rushing immediately in with two or three dragoons they find finlay and one montgomery another of the knot but famous for nothing that ever i heard of but his being taken with him sitting by the fire they seized them immediately and by this time the whole body was entered the city marched down to the cross and drew up there on the street where they sat still upon their horses it raining very hard all the time which was about three hours  the mob of the city were in no small consternation as may well be supposed at this appearance and several whose guilt gave them ground to think of the gallows made the best of their way out of the town there was no appearance of any rescue and the dragoons commanded the people off of the street and to keep their houses  two fellows had the boldness to beat a drum in two several parts of the city but the gentlemen they called for had more wit than to come and the drummers with very much difficulty narrowly escaped being killed  the dragoons having secured their prisoners and mounted them on horseback with their legs tied under the horses bellys never so much as allighted or baited their horses but marched away the same afternoon to kilsyth  as they were going away they had some stones thrown at them from the tops of houses and some that were straggling behind had like to have been knocked off of their horses but six or seven dragoons coming back they were setched off without hurt  no sooner were they gone out of the town but the drums beat again in all the streets and the rabble got together with all the rage and venom imaginable and coming to the magistrates they told them in so many words that they should send some of their number to edinburgh immediately for that if they had not their two men delivered to them they would pull their houses down about their ears some have blamed the magistrates for sending to edinburgh but if such would consider circumstances how the dragoons were gone they had an enraged mob to deal with and no strength to defend themselves it can not but be thought the gentlemen were in the right to comply with the juncture of the time and gratify rather than exasperate them when they were absolutely in their power  the magistrates however according to the command of their masters the mobb for such at this time they were sent away two of the baillies of the town and some of the deacons of trades went with them but they soon came back again as wise as they went having received a severe check from the council by the mouth of the lord chancellor and it was once within a little of their being committed to prison with the other  thus ended this petty war being the only violence we meet with in the whole transaction i had not been so large in the relation of so triffling an affair but that it serves to clear up several other cases to the world which otherwise there are several mistakes about    and principally indeed for the sake of the city of glasgow a city which in all ages since the reformation and in the very reformation it self has been particularly famous for honesty zeal and bravery in a constant opposition to the enemies either of the religion or liberties of their country  a city eminent for the true and sincere profession of the reformed religion and forward upon all occasions to spend their blood and treasure in defense of it and as nothing can be more untrue than to suggest this tumult was the act and deed of the city of glasgow so to clear her of that scandal i thought my self obliged to do her justice by setting the case in its true light nothing clears up the innocence of a person or party like bare matter of fact and therefore i have impartially related this story just as i received it upon the spot from several of the principal inhabitants of the city whose integrity in the relation i have no reason to question  nothing is more certain than that the tumult at glasgow had its rise and beginning among the jacobite party in all the rabble and riots they were secured as they past the streets they were carrest by the mob they huzzad them to the work their houses were never searched for arms nor the least insult offered to their persons the very leaders of the rabble were of their party and indeed their friends mixed themselves with the rabbles on all occasions to prompt them to insult the citizens  the rabblers themselves on the other hand were a sort of people ignorantly inflamed by this party and unhappily set on fire by an accident which had its beginning rather in an ignorance of the plot of that party than design to serve them in it  but for the city of glasgow it is clear not a citizen of any note not a magistrate not a merchant not any thing that can be called denominating to a place but what abhorred it and as far as they durst opposed it and i think it is hard they should first fall under the misfortune and then under the scandal of it too and for that reason i have been thus particular in the story  again here may be seen a small scetch of the petitioners and addressers against the union and of their original who they are that were moved and who moved them not a papist not a jacobite not a prelatist in scotland but what declared themselves against the union and those honest men that unhappily approve them in that may see what blessed company they were yoked with which is a hint i cannot avoid leaving upon record for their instruction  i should have told you that the sunday after being the    th of december the dragoons returned to glasgow and in stead of returning the two prisoners they had taken carried away three more and had directions for others but it seems they were fled  they went to hamilton also and seized two gentlemen and a lady who belonged to the duchess  and who they said finlay accused but both these and all the rest were after the union was finished discharged without punishment the merciful government of her majesty rather delighting to pity than to punish the follies of the poor deluded people showing them the difference between the legally established power which they blindly opposed and the past implacable and merciless tyrrany which they as blindly espoused  and thus happily ended the tumult at glasgow which put the honest people of both nations in no small apprehensions and which if the party had obtained their design in getting the poor people into arms in other places might have been fatal enough  mean time the queen was not unconcerned at these disorders and troops were sent from england to the borders to be ready to assist the scots forces and to support the government if there had been occasion having orders given them to quarter in the most northerly towns of england and to take their farther orders from the lord high commissioner of scotland as there should be occasion but the success of things beginning to change a little after these hurreys there was no occasion for them  the parliament was now entered upon the closs debate of the articles and the first and chief points being past in the house it was plain to every body that the house was resolved to go through the work and it is no wonder if the last struggles of all the parties opposing it were now seen  all the attempts to raise tumults and to rabble the parliament out of it had proved abortive and it was found impossible to bring the common people into any thing extraordinary while few or none of the gentry thought fit to appear with them all that had hitherto been done was by an underhand kind of management of the jacobite party as they called them to see if possible they could push the presbyterians or the mere rabble of the common people upon making some disturbance that so they might pull down their enemies by the hands of one another and see their work done for them this was apparent from the manner of proceedings which was by dropping papers and sending about private messages from no particular person but as from their brethren in this or that shire inviting directing and encouraging the people to meet and assemble to furnish themselves with arms and ammunition and nameing place and day where to meet and assemble in order to march to edinburgh and to raise the parliament and prevent the ruin such they then called the union of their country and their being given up to the english  they took all these courses to raise and excite the people but still they found it ineffectual as to meetings and rendezvouzes except as you have seen however the parliament took some notice of it the lord commissioner laid it before them on the    november and they immediately caused a proclamation to be published to prevent tumultary and irregular convocations of the liedges this was the same which was read in glasgow at the time of the tumult as aforesaid when the people stoned the messenger that read it off from the head of the stairs of the town hall or tolbooth  it had been considered that there was a clause in the act of security which empowered the people to meet or conveen in arms under pretense of exercising the fencible men  the clause was as follows and for a further security to this realm her majesty with advice and consent aforesaid statutes and enacts that the whole protestant heretors and all the burghs within the same shall forthwith provide themselves with fire arms for all the fencible men who are protestants within their respective bounds and those of the bore proportioned to a bullet of    drop weight running and the said heretors and burghs are hereby empowered and ordained to discipline and exercise their fencible men once in the month at least  now the first rumors of country tumults had been pretended to be founded upon this clause and that under pretense of this exercising and disciplining the fencible men any number of men might appear together in arms without breach of the law  this was indeed a wide gap in the public peace at which there was room for a whole army to enter for any of the gentry nobility or heretors who were disaffected to the affair now in hand under the protection of this clause pretending only exercising and disciplining the fencible men might assemble together and keep together without any limitation of number or time till they had formed a sufficient force and then marched to the destruction of the government the laws and all the defenses of the public peace  it was time now to stop this breach and therefore an act was past in the house to repeal the abovesaid clause so far forth as it extended to the meeting mustering and conveening together of the people during the sitting of the parliament which act being a very plain evidence to the truth of what i am upon i have added here as being not long enough to interrupt the thread of this discourse our sovereign lady considering that by the   d act of the   d session of this parliament entitled act for security of the kingdom it is statute and enacted that the whole protestant heretors and all the burghs within the same shall furthwith provide themselves with fire arms for all the fencible men who are protestants within their respective bounds and the said heretors and burghs are thereby empowered and ordained to discipline and exercise their fencible men once in the month at least and also considering that the disorderly and seditious meetings and tumults in some places in the country do make it necessary at this occasion to suspend the effect of the foresaid clause during this session of parliament allennarly therefore her majesty with advice and consent of the estates of parliament does hereby suspend the effect of the foresaid clause and that during this session of parliament allennarly and further her majesty with advice and consent foresaid discharges and strictly prohibites the subjects of this kingdom to meet and assemble together in arms after the publication hereof upon any pretense whatsoever during the space foresaid without her majestys special command or express license had or obtained thereto and requires and commands all the subjects of this kingdom to retire to their own habitations and lawful employments certifying such as shall do in the contrary that they shall be liable to the pains of high treason conform to the laws and acts of parliament made against unlawful convocations and rising in arms  this was a most effectual step to check the riots and tumults of the people for after this no man of any consideration durst show himself and finding the government resolved to punish whoever should make any attempt of that nature they began to give over the thought of taking arms  thus the affair without doors seemed to attend the debates of the parliament and all we meet from abroad amounted to no more than addresses without number from the towns and countries and some from the presbyteries against the union in the terms of the articles with disputes about amendments to the several articles as they came before them the particular cases of which will come of course in the observations on the minutes of parliament   mean time it may be noted the parliament entered upon the debate of the articles stating the duties settling the equivalent that was to be paid to scotland in consideration of the english debts proportioning the excise etc  this affair of the english debts has been such an occasion of clamor in scotland that i cannot but think it very necessary to give a state of it in short as it lay before the parliament  the treaters in england as has been noted in the observations on the minutes of the treaty in london had been convinced of the necessity of having the customs and excises of scotland when they came to an union run in the same channel with the excises and customs in england and this by consequence engaged them in the same appropriations and incumberances that the same duties in england were liable to  this created an objection viz that scotland was under no incumberance of debt at least none that those duties were appropriated to and therefore to bring her into taxes of any sort other than such as were to bear the burden of the war was not consistent with the equalities of burdens which were allowed to be the only foundation of an union  the equity of this was not to be withstood and therefore the english commissioners readily agreed there was no reason the revenue of scotland should be applied to the english debt without conditions  but as the circumstances of the nations required an equality of taxes and those taxes in scotland must run in the channel of the taxes of the same kinds in england the english must pay to scotland an equivalent in money this was settled by the treaty as in the minutes appears at large  now the equivalent being determined the parliament was for a long while employed in debating what taxes what customs and what excises should be paid by scotland  it is needless to enter upon the particular reasonings on the several heads as they were debated in the parliament since the minutes of the parliament will particularly discuss those points but it may be needful to note a little the reasons of all those disputes  i have often noted that there was a party who were busy not so much in arguing for regulating as destroying the articles that argued against the union in general not against the articles in particular these having in vain struggled against the main articles of the treaty such as union in general succession communication of trade and the like began now to labor at the particular heads and first they would have it that scotland should not pay any of the customs or excises in use in england but when convinced of the injustice of those pretenses they could no longer object against an equality of taxes then they began new debates upon the circumstances of the said customs and excises and pushed at all sorts of exemptions inequalities of payments restrictions and latitudes they could imagine if possible to bring on some amendments upon the articles which they knew would perplex the union in the english parliament such were the liberty of exporting wool the exemption from the duties on salt for ever the reducing their ale to the excise of small beer in england and the like and this makes it appear that i have not wronged them in saying that their design was at the union in general  it would be too much to enter upon the discourse here of the several objections against the equivalent the taxes the excises etc and innumerable cavils at the several duties on export or import  these things occupied the whole town and all the people as their several fancies and informers led them spent the time in canvassing and disputing the articles of commerce impost etc what could be paid and what not  nor is it to be wondered that these debates were warm for as the prospect of tumult began to abate the people took the more liberty in speech and the government being very backward to punish the exorbitances of the tongue at a time when they were inviting all the people to unite all the gall and ill humor of the party vented it self at the mouth this filled the country with innumerable railry and reproach all companies were divided nay even families relations and the nearest in affection divided upon this subject  the scruples of religion also revived now and a great many finding the treaty was like to go on began to set up their foundations for opposition and revive the scruples of the union interfeiring with the national covenant the danger of the church of scotland from the suffrages of the english bishops etc  all these things helped to raise heats among the people and some went up to a strange height of jealousy and discontent and what they could do they did as for tumults and rebellions that time began to be over with them but parties and feuds increased every day and so they went on till the parliament went through the whole treaty and how they behaved then will follow to be spoken to in its course  an abstract of the proceedings on the treaty of union within the parliament of scotland as also so much of the minutes of the said parliament as contain things necessary to be known on the account of the treaty with several things not printed in the said minutes with observations thereon minute i the parliament met on the   d of october   0  her mejesties commission to his grace james duke of queensberry for representing her royal person in this session of parliament read by the lord clerk register and ordered to be recorded  her majestys gift and commission in favors of james marquess of montrose to be president of her most honorable privy council read and ordered to be recorded  her majestys gift and commission in favors of john earl of mar to be one of the principal secretaries of state for this kingdom read and ordered to be recorded  the earl of abercorn swore the oath of allegiance subscribed the same with the assurance and took the oath of parliament  patent creating lord henry scot earl of deloraine read and ordered to be recorded whereupon he swore the oath of allegiance subscribed the same with the assurance and took the oath of parliament  the viscount of kilsyth swore the oath of allegiance subscribed the same with the assurance and took the oath of parliament  moved that the lord banff who was sometime papist being now protestant and willing to sign the formula subjoyned to the act of parliament in november   00 for preventing the growth of popery may be admitted and accordingly he having taken and signed the formula he thereafter swore the oath of allegiance subscribed the same with the assurance and took the oath of parliament  petition lady mary bruce and william cochran younger of ochiltrie her husband for his interest against admitting of sir alexander bruce to sit in parliament in the rank and dignity of earl of kincardin read sir alexander bruce in answer to the said petition craved that the patent in favors of earl edward bruce of kincardin might be also read which being accordingly read after some debate upon the case it was put to the vote hear the parties further upon the matter or admit sir alexander and it carried hear and the next sederunt appointed for a hearing  her majestys letter to the parliament presented by her majestys high commissioner was read first by the lord clerk register and thereafter read again by one of the ordinary clerks  her majestys high commissioner made his speech to the parliament as also my lord chancellor made his speech  and her majestys letter and the said speeches were ordered to be printed  articles of union agreed on by the commissioners nominated on behalf of the kingdom of scotland and the commissioners nominated on behalf of the kingdom of england presented and read and ordered to be printed and copies to be delivered to the members of parliament  thereafter ordered that the minutes of the proceedings of the commissioners of both nations for the treaty of union be likewise printed  adjourned to thursday  0 october   0   observation   st it might be noticed here that several gentlemen take the oath of parliament who had nor done the same before i observe it because it was said that some did so particularly to qualify themselves to be serviceable in this cause to the respective interests they espoused i do not say it was so nor do i care to distinguish persons so much as to put any mark upon names from common fame every one is to judge of that as they think fit  the party against the union finding the articles as they were concluded at london were concealed or at least not made public gave out in scotland that the scots commissioners having had it in their power to obtain most advantageous conditions from england but having been brought basely to submit to the arbitrary designs of some leading men employed in the treaty in england they had been very superficial in their demands and therefore durst not publish their proceedings till the parliament of scotland met and then the whole treaty would be rejected which would be agreeable to others of the commissioners of both nations this groundless opinion being diffused and believed by many of their party of best sense made them easy and unactive till too late they perceived the queen her ministers and all persons concerned in adjusting that treaty to be in earnest and then they turned the same notion to another use viz to calumniate and reproach the commissioners  the printing the articles also which the opposers of the union afterward boasted of as their act and deed was introduced against their design for at the private meetings of those against the union the question was how to delay the printing of the articles or any thing else whereby to gain time till the parliament of england should meet which was then prorogued to the twenty third of october so that both parliaments sitting together they expected to confound the measures for carrying on the treaty by mutual proposals doubts etc but this project of delaying the printing of the articles was prevented for the articles being presented and read after a long silence in the house mr seton of pitmedden rose up and told the lord chancellor that he found himself obliged to propose the printing the articles which had been read in the house to the end the curiosity and judgment of all sorts of people might be satisfied and that the not printing might be no argument in time coming for a delay to the ratifying of the treaty which proposal was resumed by the lord chancellor and no member opposing or seconding it he looked upon it as acquiesced to and ordered the articles to be printed  nota the minutes of the treaty at london and the articles agreed on there should have been inserted here but they are already brought in at large and need not be repeated the speech of the lord commissioner also and the lord chancellor together with the queens letter are inserted in the part immediately preceding this to which i refer and therefore and to avoid repetition they are left out here though they properly belong to this days minute  minute ii thursday  0 october   0  the earl of sutherland protested against the calling any earl before him in the rolls of parliament  alexander abercrombie of glassoch commissioner for the shire of banff in place of alexander duff of bracco deceast swore the oath of allegiance subscribed the same with the assurance and took the oath of parliament  act for settling the orders of the parliament house read and copies thereof ordained to be affixed on the doors and other places according to custom  the case lady mary bruce and her husband for his interest against sir alexander bruce of broomhall called and their procurators being heard and the parliament having considered the debate it was put to the vote admit sir alexander bruce or no and carried admit reserving to lady mary bruce and her husband for his interest their right and declarator before the lords of session as accords and he did take his place as earl of kincardin accordingly swore the oath of allegiance subscribed the same with the assurance and took the oath of parliament  adjourned till saturday next at ten a clock  observation ii the earls of sutherland and crawford in the process of this protest against each other for precedence produced the noblest documents for the antiquity of their families such as very few families in the world can imitate  minute iii saturday    october   0  the lord oliphant swore the oath of allegiance subscribed the same with the assurance and took the oath of parliament  moved that the articles of union agreed on by the commissioners nominated on behalf of the kingdom of scotland and england be again read and also moved that the minutes of the proceedings of the said commissioners be likeways read and after some reasoning it was agreed that the said articles of union should be read and ordered that all records relating to former treaties betwixt the two kingdoms be laid on the table and in the intervals of parliament they be to be seen in the laigh parliament house where some of my lord registers servants are to attend  and the articles of union being accordingly again read it was agreed that the parliament should proceed to the consideration of the said articles of union the next sederunt  adjourned till tuesday next at  0 a clock  observation iii great opposition was made in parliament this day against reading the articles  and several arguments brought by the gentlemen on that side for delays  among which this was one and this the first time it was started in the house viz the consulting principals or constituents and some gentlemen went so far as to acknowledge the power of a member of parliament was limited by their constituents and that the parliament could not lawfully debate much less determine an affair of such a nature as this viz of destroying the constitution without as aforesaid consulting and obtaining the consent of their constituents  it was replied that   this was not a destroying the constitution   the parliament was particularly called by her majesty for this end and the work expressed in the proclamation for their election and that therefore they were particularly elected by their constituents for this work and thereby empowered to debate and conclude it without farther powers   others argued the positive and affirmed the parliament had full power to act on this matter though there had been no such expression in the proclamation   the debate was long and warm enough and began to inform us what was to be expected but on the whole it was carried to read the articles by a great majority the other being taken as an attempt to gain time  a proposal was made this day for a general fast  which occasioned some debates but was adjourned  and here it was very publicly observed from what hands the motion of a fast came some maliciously enough though merrily noted that the motion of a fast came first from those who were very rarely observed either to fast or pray and that now began to talk so religiously that it was taken for a mere banter  on the other hand it was observed that the most sober and religious members both of the nobility and gentry opposed this motion in the house but the reason was evident  the great project just then carrying on in the kingdom was to amuse the people possess them with fears of some strange thing then transacting and of impending dangers dreadful to the kingdom and which they had no remedy to prevent but as in great distress to fly to their prayers as mariners in a storm  this they thought would of course be made the more terrible by the ministers in general exciting the people to extraordinary humiliations which whether ill designed or no might be ill enough improved and the people thereby made the more uneasy  perhaps also they might hope for some indiscretion and undue warmth in the pulpit especially from some men which they were willing to think they could influence to so much weakness but in this also they were disappointed  for the same reasons those gentlemen who were of the most religious conversation and known to be well affected to the church and to any thing that had but an aspect of sincere piety were nevertheless against this fast as unseasonable and dangerous and as a thing they foresaw was designed particularly to make the people uneasy with these prospects the debate was urged warmly enough on both sides but at last was adjourned and so the designed fast was put off for the present though it was afterward introduced piece meal and all the use made of it that could be to raise the spirits of the people if possible to the disorders aimed at as we shall see in the sequel of this history  minute iv tuesday    october   0  warrant granted to the barons and freeholders of the shire of fife to meet on tuesday the twenty ninth instant to elect a commissioner in place of sir archibald hope of rankeillor deceast  moved that according to the last minutes the parliament should now proceed to the consideration of the articles of the union  moved that the members of parliament may yet be allowed eight days further to consider more deliberatly the articles and minutes and after some reasoning it was put to the vote proceed presently to the consideration of the articles of union or continue the consideration thereof till the first sederunt next week and it carried proceed  whereupon the first article of union was read as also the minutes of the proceedings of the commissioners for the treaty relative thereto and her majestys commission to the commissioners for the treaty on behalf of this kingdom were likeways read and after some reasoning and discoursing thereupon the further consideration thereof was delayed till the next sederunt of parliament  adjourned till thursday next at ten of the clock  observation iv here the gentlemen who appeared against the union finding they could not carry the point as debated the last day moved for a delay of but eight days and several arguments were offered to obtain so short a delay  but in this they lost several of those who voted with them before and who seeing the vote of consulting constituents rejected could not be convinced of the advantage of eight days delay and this made it seem more particularly a design only to delay  whereupon the question being put it was carried by a great majority and this was the first trial of the strength of the parties and the first encouraging proof that the union would go on the majority on this vote was sixty four but the names having not yet been ordered to be made public it was not known who were on one side or the other  before this vote was put it was also debated whether this reading of the articles should be in order to proceed upon them to a vote and here again the gentlemen had their turn of advantage nor was there any great opposition for those who were for the union were yet willing to have it fully debated and all things for its better explanation understood and were content to have it as thoroughly examined as they pleased and therefore gave their votes freely for a general reading  the other gentlemen who were only pushing at delays and striving to gain time thought they gained a great point in this and therefore with all their interest they pushed at a general reading only which was presently agreed to viz that the articles should be read and discoursed of in this parliament but that none of them should be voted till all was read over and considered  upon the above debate and concluding only to read and discourse the first article of the treaty was read publicly but the reading of the commissions and minutes taking up a great deal of time there was not much discourse in the house at that time for the great affair now in agitation was to stir up the people without doors and bring them either by clamor tumult or tumultuous addresses to declare a general dislike both of the union in general and of the articles in particular and at this time they began to threaten from without doors  the streets and doors were exceedingly througd this day in expectation of the event the people expecting ignorantly to hear whether the first article was voted and approved or rejected and when some body came out and said unwarrily the first article was not voted it run through the town that it was rejected and the mob who appeared now to be managed by some gentlemen began to shout and people apprehended the union had been voted against in the general but they were discovered too soon by this and it was presently understood that the article was only discoursed of and the discourse adjourned too  the next day the minutes being printed the minds of the people were a little cooled when they saw the house went on so deliberately and that nothing was to be voted while all the articles were read over and considered  minute v thursday    october   0  address of the commission of the late general assembly of the church of this kingdom for establishing and confirming the true protestant religion and government of the church as by law established therein read and thereupon the parliament declared that before concluding the union they would take the said address to their consideration and would do every thing necessary for securing the true protestant religion and church government presently by law established in this kingdom  dispensation granted to inferior courts to sit notwithstanding of the sitting of the parliament  the parliament proceeded to the further consideration of the articles of union and the second article thereof was read as also the minutes of the treaty relative thereto and the act of the parliament of england in the first year of the reign of their late majestys king william and queen mary entitled an act declaring the rights and privileges of the subjects and settling the succession of the crown were likeways read and were thereafter reasoned and discoursed upon  the third article read  and thereafter the fourth fifth sixth seventh and eighth articles were all severally read with the minutes relative thereto and were all reasoned and discoursed upon  adjourned till saturday next at ten a clock  observation v the commission of the general assembly having sat from the   th instant had been in several warm debates about the matter in what manner they should behave themselves in this juncture some hot gentlemen had given them disturbance enough about the matter of the fast and without doors it was reported they would protest against the union  but the generality being governed by more temper and moderation than some people hoped for all things went on there peaceably i mean as to their public resolutions and the address to the parliament was conceived in as moderate terms as could be expected and is at large printed in the appendix n b  the answer to it was also satisfactory enough  in that they declared they would go upon the address before any thing was concluded it was however warmly pressed in the parliament that the said address should be immediately entered upon before they went on upon the union  but this as another advantage designed for delay was checked and the answer in the minute agreed upon  great pains was taken also at this time to make the commission of the assembly uneasy at this answer as not satisfactory jealousies were fomented and suggestions whispered about from one to another as if the parliament designed to postpone the affairs of the church to the last and so perhaps drop them at once this obtained but too much and being put forward by warm and uneasy people grew higher and higher and helped on the inflammations which unhappily followed  the subject of the first article though not named in the minutes was also reassumed in the discourses of this day and several arguments against the union it self as an incorporating union were brought in order to prove it impracticable inconvenient and disadvantageous to scotland and therefore that they ought rather to proceed upon the consideration of the general before they went on to the particular articles  this however was only discoursed and the reading the several articles having been already approven they proceeded to the reading the rest of the articles as in the minutes  in the reading the second article the english act of parliament for limiting the succession etc was discoursed on and much was said about the english limitations and some people that had been of another mind formerly seemed to discover an inclination of coming into the succession with limitations and began to enter into the matter of limitations but this being remote to the work was dropped for the present and we shall meet with it again in its place  the third article also relating to uniting the parliaments of both kingdoms was read and some took the liberty to jest with it as a chytherical calculation and that they had no power to alter the representative of the nation that scotland could not consent to be governed by any other representative than they were now and that if the parliaments were to be made one scotlands whole parliament ought to be joined to the english parliament and that scotland ought no more to abridge her representative than england and the like  but the unreasonableness of this was urged from the disparity in extent of the country number of people and proportion of taxes of which hereafter  the five ensuing articles being all upon privileges of trade excises and customs the discourses were very general on both sides and those things seemed referred to more debates afterward all that was said of those things now seemed rather to tend if possible to persuade the people in general that the union was impracticable that scotland could not come into the taxes and that the equalities talked of would ruin their trade and starve their poor  without doors strange use was made of these articles of taxes and the people were made to believe their salt their malt their beer their fish would all be loaded with insupportable taxes and their whole trade should be ruined their houses plundered for taxes and their people starved and no man that shall see with what frightful apprehensions the poor people were possessed will any more wonder they were so easily brought into tumults and disorders   nota this day there were strong rumors about the town of the mob coming up to the parliament to demand that the crown and scepter of scotland should not be given up and carried away to england  this was the effect of some popular speeches let fall by those gentlemen who opposed the treaty and industriously spread about the town a report that the sovereignty of scotland was to be subjected to the english and the poorer sort that understood less had the same thing in other words viz that the crown of scotland was betrayed that it was to be carried to england and never to be seen here more of which see at large in its place  the house however took no notice of this yet as being a rumor only though the members were not without apprehensions that it might rise to a greater height and that they might come to be insulted even in the house as indeed was afterward very probable  minute vi saturday    october   0  minutes of the last sederunt read  the parliament proceeded to the further consideration of the articles of union and the ninth tenth eleventh twelfth thirteenth and fourteenth articles were all severally read with the minutes of treaty relating thereto and were all discoursed on  the fifteenth article of union was likeways twice read and discoursed and reasoned on as also the minutes relative thereto and after some reasoning thereon there arose a debate about the calculation of the equivalent of three hundred ninety eight thousand eighty five pounds ten shillings thereinmentioned which was adjourned till the next sederunt of parliament  adjourned till tuesday next at ten a clock  observation vi the calculations of the ninth article were a little examined but appeared so just and the equalities so well stated that there was no room to object for the cess being but the same upon scotland as before there could nothing be said why they should not go into measures for carrying on any joint expense which in time to come the united body should see cause to put the whole to  and this was the first visible explication of the doctrine of equalities and a proof that equalities consisted in proportions of which more hereafter some people to serve the designs now on foot had made the ignorant people believe that by equalities would be understood a numerical equality and that scotland should pay in every thing just as the english did  this did therefore a little serve to open the eyes of considering people and let them see that the treaty had been founded upon something of justice for by this time it had been represented as a strange manyheaded monster that had nothing but mouths and teeth and unfathomable gulphs to devour and destroy the people  the five articles between the ninth and fifteenth required little debate since they consisted only of negatives and provision made for scotland against payment of any of the duties then levied in england by the stampoffice tax glasswindow tax and the several duties on coals and malt together with exemption from any of the proportions of cess as above for the first year  only from these articles some gentlemen took occasion to remind them of the necessary care taken by the treaters to exempt scotland in all cases from such burdens as they found them unable to bear and which absolute necessity did not oblige them to subject her to and in such cases to receive equivalents for what ever they were obliged to come into by the necessity of trade  but the ferment was now grown high and these discourses had little signification the people being unhappily prepossessst beyond the power of convictions  the    th article occasioned long discourses both within doors and without and a great many ill natured things were said on both sides the matter of an equivalent had not yet been examined much into and the reason nature and necessity of it had gone but a very little way into the understandings even of the gentlemen themselves the treaters also here met with some indecencies and the reflections made on them had such an effect in public as had they not met with some check might have been personally mischievous to them as to the partacted abroad see fol    of the next precedent part within doors they met with some very unkind reproaches as if they had not made due provisions for their countries necessities had consented to intolerable and unjust burdens and had mocked them with the notion of an equivalent which did not lessen the burdens upon the nation their payment being to be levied where it could not be paid and then repaid again where it was not levied  to make good these charges they pretended to make calculations upon the proportions of the said equivalent and some indeed brought in their own rough draughts of disproportions whereupon it was moved that the house should enter upon more exact calculations and examine the matters of fact of which see the next minute  minute vii tuesday    october   0  the debate anent the calculation of the equivalent of three hundred ninety eight thousand eighty five pounds ten shillings mentioned in the fifteenth article of union resumed and after some time spent thereupon it was agreed to nominate a committee of three persons of each state to proceed and examine the calculation of the said three hundred ninety eight thousand eighty five pounds ten shillings and to report to the parliament and the next sederunt of parliament appointed for nominating the said ommittee  thereafter several paragraphs of the said fifteenth article were again read and further reasoned and discoursed on  the sixteenth and seventeenth articles were also read and the minutes relative thereto and were reasoned upon  the eighteenth article and the minutes relative thereto were likeways read and after some discourse and reasoning thereon the further consideration of the said article was delayed till next sederunt of parliament  adjourned till wednesday    october   0   observation vii the debate of the equivalent grew higher this day than before and the fifteenth article was the subject of a great deal of ill natured discourse in the house from without there was a very terrible clamor and the humors of the people being brought as it were to a pitch but too much appeared to correspond with some thing visible within doors several very unkind reflections were made upon the treaters not upon their judgments only but upon their integrity as if they had been less just to their country than consisted with the trust reposed in them  the gentlemen on the other hand defended themselves as calmly as they could and endeavored to clear up the objections made to the justice of their proceedings offered to examine the calculations and answer any thing that could be objected but the house grew too much out of temper to talk much of it then and the prudence of the high commissioner in order to calm things and keep them as easy as possible prevented its running higher at that time  the former proposal was reassumed viz to refer it to the examination of a committee and the house was moved to name the committee  upon this motion it was again moved that none of the treaters should be capable of being named to the said committee  this though it looked as if the committee were to be a jury upon the treaters to examine their conduct yet the gentlemen unanimously agreed to and the choosing a committee was approven who went through the calculations and gave in such exact accounts of things as abundantly cleared up the reputation of the commissioners  it was also moved that to assist the said committee two very able accomptants or arithmeticians should be found to examine the calculations one of which was dr james gregory professor of the mathematics in the college of edinburgh the other was dr thomas bowar professor of the mathematics in the college of aberdeen  the sixteenth and seventeenth articles about the coin and about weights and measures occasioned little or no debate  the eighteenth article had indeed some discourse upon it as what should or should not be alterable by the parliament of great britain and some gentlemen were for establishing all the present laws without alteration a thing no nation in the world practices since circumstances of nations altering may always make it necessary to alter amend renew or repeal the laws and usages of a nation  and the distinction in the article it self was such as few could object viz that no alteration should be made in the laws respecting private rights except for the evident vtility of the subject within scotland this therefore seemed to explain the true meaning of the article in that point yet the other part of the article about the laws of public right policy and civil government being made the same through out the whole united kingdom this occasioned long discourses and held the house so late that they thought fit to adjourn it till the next sederunt  minute viii wednesday    october   0  the parliament conform to the minute of the last sederunt proceeded to elect the committee for examination of the calculation of the equivalent of three hundred ninety eight thousand eighty five pounds ten shillings and the three estates separated to their usual places returned and reported their respective elections and the list of the committee is as follows of the nobility the marquess of montrose lord president of the privy council the duke of argyle and the marquess of tweeddale of the commissioners for shires sir alexander campbell of cesnock george baillie of jerviswood and john hadden of glenagies of the commissioners for burghs robert inglis lieutenant colonel john areskine and hugh montgomery and the committee was appointed to meet in the innersession house the first interval day of parliament at ten of the clock in the forenoon  thereafter the eighteenth article of union was again read and upon reasoning thereon it was moved that the enlish laws concerning regulation of trade customs and such excises to which this kingdom by virtue of the treaty is to be liable be printed for information moved likeways that it be remitted to a committee to consider the several branches of our trade as to export and import with the english laws and book of rates in relation thereto with the customs and excises thereof for the satisfaction of the members of parliament thereanent and to cause print such of the acts of the english parliament concerning the same as they find expedient or to report to the parliament and after some debate on these motions the further consideration thereof was delayed till the next sederunt of parliament  adjourned till friday    october   0   observation viii this was the fatal day of the tumult in the streets and the house was no less warm within proportionably speaking than the gentlemen were without all which had its share in agitating the public confusions i am far from saying that the arguments used within doors occasioned the rabbles but the improvement a party without doors made of them and the manner in which things now said in the parliament were represented without concurred to increase the ferment of the nation  the discourses on the eighteenth article were now carried on with great warmth many long speeches were made this day too long to be set down here but tending all to this that scotland ought not to subject themselves to duties of any sort before it should be known what such duties were that no laws of customs or excises should take place and that it could not be proper to allow the several laws of excise or customs in england till it was first calculated and agreed what customs and excises scotland was to pay  then the discourses on the paying equalities of taxes being reassumed some took occasion to make reflections again on the treaters for subjecting their country to taxes which first they alleged they did not understand and secondly they were not able to pay  the reproaches cast upon the treaters the ill behavior of some members and the indecencies shown in these cases were so universal that even her majestys high commissioner did not escape but was very ill used which nevertheless his grace with a great deal of temper suffered without any disorder preferring the public peace to all his private resentments and by this prudence prevented those who desired to have things exasperated and hoped to see the resentment of the government run up first that they might have something to pretend for the irregularities which followed  it may also be observed here that the printing the english laws books of rates excises and customs which it was very certain would not be understood here and from which a thousand false suggestions would every day be raised whence few people could answer was a design calculated for a great many ends which were to be answered in the future proceedings and of which we shall hear more hereafter  a committee was nominated also for this work and thousands of difficulties were continually raised in the mouths of the people to expose the treaty and exasperate the people such as that the tax upon salt was intolerable and that it would destroy the fishery and the poor were represented to subsist so much upon salt as if it had been one of the greatest parts of their food  the excise on beer ale etc was represented as insupportable and great pains were taken to prove that the english paid   sh   d per barrel upon their table beer and that the scots small ale must pay equal excise to the english strong beer and this was publicly printed in the streets on purpose to enrage the people  it was in vain to offer calculations on these heads  and though it was by the author of this work proved by direct and positive demonstration that the excise of their ale could in proportion pay no more than it did now even by the calculation of the english excises and that the expense of salt in any house in the kingdom could not rise to above  0 d per head per annum yet it was in vain all calculations of this sort were ridiculed and exposed as false and partial and the author maltreated in print for his essays on those things as an enemy to the country and in order to expose him to the fury of the rabble which had particularly marked him out for destruction in the general commotions which followed  but all these calculations appeared afterward to be right as in their place will more particularly appear  however the whole debate of this day could not bring them over the eighteenth article the farther discourse of which was as per the minute adjourned and what interrupted it further you will see in the next days work  the salt was an argument people stuck very closs to and strove to make it popular for the poor seemed to be concerned in it and those that espoused it whatever their ends were in espousing it they always made the relief and ease of the poor the main argument this was taking and engaging with the common people and as much use was made of it as if the salt had been a principal part of their food and the duty so great that the poor must have been starved if they had paid it  the debate however had this effect that it brought the parliament to enter into the consideration of amendments and exemptions which they particularly settled in this affair and which the parliament of england easily came into as will appear in its place  minute ix friday    october   0  the lord high chancellor represented to the parliament that he was directed by the lords of her majestys privy council to acquaint the parliament that upon occasion of a rabble and tumult that happened in edinburgh upon wednesday night last by which several members of parliament were threatened and insulted the privy council had for the security of the members of parliament and peace of the town brought in a part of the foot guards to the town of edinburgh and had issued forth a proclamation against such tumultary meetings in the terms of several acts of parliament  whereupon and after some reasoning a proposition was made in their terms that the estates of parliament being sensible of the care and concern of the lords of privy council to suppress the late tumult and mob and to secure the safety and quiet of the parliament that therefore they should return to their lordships the thanks of the parliament and should recommend to my lord high commissioner and the privy council to continue their care for the safety and security of the parliament and the peace and quiet of the town which being read  after some discourse thereupon it was moved that the proclamation of privy council should be read and the samen being accordingly read the earl of errol lord high constable gave in a protestation in the following terms that he for himself and in name of such as should adhere to his protestation protested that the continuing of standing forces within the town of edinburgh and keeping guard with them in the parliament closs and other places within the town the time of parliament as at present is done is contrary to the right of his office as high constable by which he has the only privilege of guarding the parliament without doors as the earl of marischal has within doors and is an incroachment on the rights and privileges of parliament and on the particular rights and privileges of the town of edinburgh and if any vote shall pass contrair to his said right or the right of the earl marischal or rights and privileges of parliament or the town of edinburgh that it shall not in any time hereafter prejudge the same or be any ways drawn in consequence and he desired the said protestation to be insert in the minutes and recorded in the books of parliament which protestation being read the said earl of errol did take instruments thereupon and the duke of hamiltoun duke of athol marquess of annandale earl marischal earl of wigtoun earl of strathmore earl of selkirk earl of kincardin viscount of stormount viscount of kilsyth the lord semple the lord oliphant the lord balmerinoch the lord blantyre the lord bargany the lord beilhaven the lord colvil and the lord kinnaird george lockhart of carnwath sir james foulis of collingtoun andrew fletcher of saltoun john brisban of bishoptoun mr william cochran of kilmaronock john steuart of kinwhinlick john grahame of killearn james grahame of bucklyvie robert rollo of powhouse sir patrick murray of auchtertyre john murray or strowan sir thomas burnet of leys alexander gordon of pitlurg james more of stoniewood mr patrick lion of auchterhouse david grahame of fintry james ogilvie younger of boyn alexander mgie of palgown mr james dumbar younger of hemprigs george mackenzie of inchcoulter alexander robertson alexander edgar alexander duff francis mollison robert kellie mr william sutherland archibald shiells mr john lion mr john caruthers george home mr james bethun john bayne and mr robert frazer adhered thereto  and after some further debate upon the said proposition a vote was stated approve thereof or not but it being objected that the same consisted of two distinct articles the one approving what was done and the other recommending to the privy council to continue their care which ought to be separately considered and voted the vote was thereupon stated whether the proposition should be voted jointly or separately  but before voting upon a motion made by the commissioners for the town of edinburgh it was agreed to that it should be but prejudice of the said town of edinburghs rights and privileges by their charters  then the vote was put jointly or separatly and it carried jointly  thereafter the vote was put approve of the proposition or not and it carried approve  adjourned till monday    october   0   observation ix this whole day was a mere interruption to the reading of the articles and the house was employed wholly on the affair of the rabbles  the lord commissioner having found the increase of the mob come to such a degree as that the whole city was in danger and indeed the whole constitution would otherwise have been exposed his grace ordered the guards to enter the city about one of the clock in the morning to assist the magistrates by which means the tumult was appeased and the rabble dispersed some of the rioters had been seized and secured and the soldiers kept post in the city all that night the ensuing day and the night and part of this day without being relieved tho the weather was exceeding cold  the council had the day before ratified what the lord commissioner had done and it was not doubted but the parliament would do the same the absolute necessity of such a proceeding being as was thought enough to satisfy any body who was not for having the civil authority subjected to the insolences of the rabble  but people were strangely surprised when they saw this strenuously opposed in the parliament and had it not been carried by a majority in the house the consequences must have terminated in a second rabble more fatal and furious than the first  the marquess of a  le was the first man who made objection against it and pleaded that it was an encroachment upon the liberty of parliament and taking away their freedom of speech that it was awing the house with soldiers and bringing upon them arbitrary government and several speeches were made to this purpose in which one noble person said he could perceive the difference already in the votes of the house and that the influence of the soldiers had altered the matter  these were hard sayings indeed and it was thought a hard point that people should call the being subjected to an ungoverned rabble liberty of parliament and the clamours of the mob freedom of speech it was plain if the guards were not brought up the members of parliament would be awed and the treaters massacred by the mob and to place guards to suppress tumults and restrain the headstrong multitude was very far from awing the parliament it being also apparent that this guard was entirely subordinate to the commands of the parliament and were placed to maintain not infringe the liberty of speech they spoke of that no man could be influenced by men set only to keep the peace and disperse rabbles and in a case when it was apparent to all the world the necessity was such that unless those rabbles were suppressed the parliament could not sit at all nor the business they were assembled for be debated  the opposers however maintained the dispute a long time but when they came to the question it was apparent a great many of their friends in other cases yet were so convinced of the necessity of this that they voted against them and so the actings of the lord commissioner and also of the council were approved and the thanks of the house ordered as in the vote  the protesters are named in the minute as above and this i think was the first protest made in parliament upon the affair of the union  this debate of course put off the further consideration of the eighteenth article of the union which was the work of the day  there was great struggling in the house on pretense of the infringing the privileges of the city of edinburgh but the magistrates having declared themselves satisfied in the necessity of the case and the impossibility of keeping the peace without this method that debate was also couched in the protest as above and every body acquiescd the guards continued in their posts and the respective regiments relieved one another with beat of drum as is usual but the effect was only keeping the peace no violence was offered to the parliament neither were any soldiers placed at the door to awe the members much less was any denied entrance or any other person access to them as on other occasions  but the parliament was perfectly free open and uninterrupted the soldiers were a guard to them but not a guard against them and it was not in the power of any person to say he received the least affront from them indeed the soldiers appeared wholly unconcerned in any part of the affair they only executed the office of a guard to preserve the peace and keep the government from being insulted  and in this peaceable behavior of the soldiery consisted a great deal of the success of the treaty for this took away all pretense from a party of men who aimed at and sought for some such irregularity to complain of in order to have protested against the parliament as under restraint and so having a legal objection against the proceedings as not acted in a free parliament  this was a disappointment to a certain great person who proposed a protest against this very thing as an act of violence and so leaving the house as a body pretending they were under the power of the army but the soldiers being so ordered as to behave themselves quietly and only taking post as a guard to the city to preserve the public peace the doors of parliament being always free and uninterrupted those people were defeated and even their own friends whom they proposed it to refused them acknowledging they could not sustain the allegation  i think it is very necessary to be particular in this case because i know great clamours were made as well in england as in scotland as if the soldiers who upon this extraordinary occasion were brought into the city and who did indeed keep guard in the parliament closs were an awe and a terror to the parliament and that consequently it was not a free parliament  minute x monday    october   0  minutes of the last sederunt read  thereafter the parliament proceeded to the consideration of the articles of union and the eighteenth article was again read and further discoursed on  thereafter the nineteenth twentieth and twenty first articles were read and the minutes relative thereto and the further consideration of these articles delayed till the next sederunt of parliament  adjourned till the morrow at ten a clock  observation x the debate of the eighteenth article came now on but the disturbance and hurry was such upon all mens minds that there was very little discourse but what ran all into the public matters as of the tumults the guards etc  about this time the rumors of the uneasiness of the people in the country began also to increase and the parliament was daily threatened with insurrections and mobs from abroad but nothing appeared publicly yet  minute xi tuesday    october   0  the nineteenth article of union was again read as also the twentieth and twenty first articles and were severally reasoned on  thereafter the twenty second and twenty third articles were likeways read and the minutes relative thereto and after some reasoning thereupon the further consideration of these articles was delayed till the next sederunt of parliament  adjourned till the morrow at ten a clock  observation xi nothing material was offered in the reasoning upon these articles there was some debate upon the proportions of members for the parliament of britain and some suggestions that scotland ought to retain her whole parliament but those that opposed it did not think fit to enter much into the dispute of that point till the second reading of that article  minute xii wednesday  0 october   0  the twenty second and twenty third articles of union were again read and further discoursed on  thereafter the twenty fourth and twenty fifth articles of union and the minutes relative thereto were also read and severally reasoned on  act adjourning the session till the first day of december next read and a first reading ordered to be marked thereon  adjourned till friday next at ten a clock  observation xii this day ended the first or general reading of the articles and these last articles being such as would be necessary or not necessary as the general treaty succeeded or not there remained no occasion of debate on this reading since they were not now to be approved or voted  minute xiii friday   november   0  moved that the parliament now proceed to the further and more particular consideration of the articles of union in order to approve them or not and to begin with and read the first article  moved also that the further consideration of the articles of union be yet delayed for some considerable time that the sentiments of the parliament of england thereanent be known and that the members of parliament may consult these whom they represent and after some debate on these motions the following petitions and addresses were presented viz one by some of the barons freeholders and others subscribing the same within the shire of midlothian another by some of the barons freeholders and others subscribing the same within the shire of linlithgow and three by some of the barons and freeholders of perth shire subscribing the same all against allowing of an incorporate union with england and all read and discoursed on and thereafter the debate for delay on account of consulting of those whom the members represent and of knowing the sentiments of the nation and the procedure of the parliament of england was let fall and agreed that the first article of union should be read but that it should be entire next sederunt of parliament to debate whether or not the first article be concluded by approving thereof or not or if the parliament may not before concluding thereof begin with and conclude any other of the articles and accordingly the first article was read  adjourned till the morrow at ten a clock  observation xiii the great question came now to be determined  whether they should go upon the treaty or no  those that opposed it would not directly argue against reading the articles at all and so at once reject the treaty but they began to start a new scruple viz why should it be put upon the parliament of scotland to determine first upon the treaty why should not england where the treaty had been formed and where their parliament was now to sit in a few days why should not they first signify their consent to the treaty and then the parliament of scotland might consider whether they could join with them upon the terms yea or no  this occasioned great disputes and many speeches were made endeavoring to show the reasonableness of having this matter first determined in england  it was among other things offered as a sufficient argument that as it was the queens prerogative to call parliaments to appoint and limit their sittings and to propose to them any matters as the subject of their meeting which they should consult about not exclusive of what they should think fit to debate themselves her majesty had determined which parliament should begin upon the articles by appointing this parliament for that end and had particularly recommended this matter to them and that therefore they ought to go about it  that the priority was a dispute of no consequence at all and that they had all the liberty in the world to pass or not pass approve or not approve of the treaty now as they should have then that if there was any difference the honor was done to scotland in putting the treaty first into their hands as the principal persons who were supposed to have objections to make and that they might be made entirely easy in every thing that was material to their satisfaction  notwithstanding all this they renewed the debate and brought it to a motion in the parliament as appears by the vote in which they also added the former suggestion of consulting their constituents and some members alleged they had express directions from their principals and the countries they represented restraining and positively obliging them not to enter upon the treaty  this brought things to a great height and some members as was said began to talk of protesting and leaving the parliament but they had more wisdom than that came to  they indeed very earnestly pressed this motion which was in short to obtain a delay and that made them fly from one argument to another  together with their arguments and to second their proposal of consulting principals they brought in addresses from the several places mentioned above and vehemently urged that it appeared by them that it was the sense of the people that the whole nation was against it and that they ought not to poceed without their assent  here it was noted that the address from midlothian was signed by not above twelve of the gentlemen or thereabout though there were above two hundred gentlemen in that county and that therefore it seemed the argument of its being the sense of the nation must be very ill grounded  at length they dropped the debate and obtained the previous question viz that the parliament should immediately proceed to reading the articles  but then a new project was set on foot and it was an odd thing to see that after a long debate whether the articles should be read at all or no it occasioned another question and no small debate upon it which end of them they should begin at  when they had gotten over the question as before for reading they fell out which article they should read first the party which had at first opposed reading them all now struggled to begin in the middle of the treaty the reason was as they alleged they were for examining the particulars before they voted the general the first article contained that from and after the first day of may the two kingdoms should be united etc this they would have delayed and then followed the conditions which they would have be agreed first of all  others alleged that it would be needless to enter into the particulars till it was agreed whether they should be united or no and therefore it was necessary to examine the first article in its order not only because it was the first but because it was most rational to determine whether there should be an union or no before they descended to the particulars because if all the articles were agreed to yet if it should be so precarious as to state the question afterward whether there should be a union or no it might at once render all their labor fruitless  upon this debate they resolved it was first necessary to get over the main article whether there should be a union or not before they entered into the merits of the particulars or examined the conditions and they only read the article to finish the debate and prevent any more difficulty  minute xiv saturday   november   0  the first article of union was again read and thereupon a motion was offered in their terms that it be agreed to in the first place to proceed to take the first article of the union to consideration with this provision that if the other articles of union be not adjusted by the parliament then the agreeing to and approving of the first shall be of no effect and that immediately after the said first article the parliament will proceed to an act for security of the doctrine discipline worship and government of the church as now by law established within this kingdom and after some debate thereon there was a state of a vote offered approve of the motion yea or no  whereupon there was a resolve offered in their terms that before this house proceed to vote any of the articles of the treaty they will hear what security the commission of the church is to offer for the church government and that before any incorporating union be voted and after some further debate upon the said motion and resolve a second state of a vote was offered that the church government be taken into consideration before the articles of treaty yea or no  and after some debate which of the two should be the state of the vote it was put to the vote whether the first or second should be the state of the vote and it carried the first thereafter it was put to the vote approve of the motion or not and it carried approve  whereupon the first article of union was again read and after some reasoning thereon it being objected that an incorporating union of the two kingdoms was contrair to and inconsistent with the the claim of right the claim of right and the third act of the first parliament of her majesty queen anne entitled act for approving the turning the meeting of the estates into a parliament and the letter of the meeting of the estates to king william the twenty fourth of april one thousand six hundred eighty nine were all read  and an address by the barons freeholders heretors and other gentlemen in the shire of forfar subscribers of the same against allowing of an incorporating union with england being given in was also read  and after long reasoning and debate on the said first article of union and objection it was of consent agreed that the same should be delayed till the next sederunt of parliament  adjourned till monday next at ten a clock  observation xiv the first article was now read and all the opposition hitherto made had been over but two plausible things remained one was to debate whether it should be so settled that if all the articles were not concluded none of them which were considered should be of any force this was so plausible no body could withstand it  then they objected in the name of the church on the occasion brought before them formerly viz the act of security unhappy was the condition at this time of the church of scotland if what seemed to appear had been her real case viz to have her greatest enemies be her best solicitors as if she had been so desperate that even those that formerly assisted to pull her down were the only seeming advocates for her present establishment  or else surely her case was very happy on the other hand that her establishment was so visibly necessary at this time that even her apparent enemies were careful to support her  i shall enter no further into the mystery of it here the parliament had voted to consider the address of the commission before any thing was concluded and whether that word concluded was to signify before they voted any article or before the whole union was concluded was now immaterial and though it was expressly said in the vote of october    that it should be before the union was concluded yet it was moved now and the parliament was so willing to do every thing for the satisfaction of the nation that they resolved to go upon it immediately after the passing the first article  the party that still opposed were for going on the affair of the church before any of the articles were concluded on alleging that if the security of the church could not be agreed on the union could not be entered upon but it was returned to that that just on the contrary it was necessary first to vote the general whether there should be a union or no in the terms of the treaty which general was included in the first article and it was easy to be seen that if that article was voted against the union was rejected and if the union was rejected there was then no need for discoursing on the act of security for the church  this was too strong a way of reasoning to be resisted and therefore when it came to the question it past as per the minute that it be agreed to in the first place to proceed to take the first article of union to consideration with this provision that if the other articles of union be not adjusted by the parliament then the agreeing to and approving of the first shall be of no effect and that immediately after the said first article the parliament will proceed to an act for security of the doctrine discipline worship and government of the church as now by law established within this kingdom  and now the first article came upon the stage and the first brush it met with was that it was against the claim of right as per the minute  this was a surprising blow indeed and made the house immediately call for the claim of right but that which was remarkable upon reading the claim of right was it became necessary to read the letter of the convention at that time sent to king william in which the estates then met humbly desired his majesty to set on foot an union in the very sense and meaning of this incorporation of the kingdoms as the only happiness the kingdom desired we are most sensible of your majestys kindness and fatherly care to both your kingdoms in promoving their union which we hope has been reserved to be accomplished by you that as both kingdoms are united in one head and sovereign so they may become one body politic one nation to be represented in one parliament and to testify our readiness to comply with your majesty in that matter we have nominated commissioners to treat the terms of an entire and perpetual union betwixt the two kingdoms with reservation to us of our church government as it shall be established at the time of the union these commissioners do wait your majestys approbation and call that they may meet and treat with the commissioners to be appointed for england at what time and place your majesty shall appoint and if any difficulty shall arise in the treaty we do upon our part refer the determination thereof to your majesty and we do assure our selves from your majestys prudence and goodness of a happy conclusion to that important affair so as the same may be agreed to and ratified by your majesty in your first parliament  this indeed occasioned a long debate and much warmth on both sides which held the house very late and after reading all the papers the inconsistency of the union with the claim of right was thoroughly examined where it could not but be very remarkable to observe some gentlemen giving a sanction to the claim of right who never before acknowlegd it owning it now as a sacred foundation in order to oppose it to the scheme of union now drawn which being of more fatal consequence to their real design as well as party they were brought to the necessity of closing with the first to confront the last so playing one against another recognizing the revolution as the lesser evil to repulse the union which they saw plainly aimed at the foundation struck at the root and must for ever foreclose jacobitism and prelacy the two columes which supported their cause  the reasonings here in the house began with much calmness immediately after reading the article mr seton of pitmedden took the opportunity to say that having had the honor to be one of the commissioners for the treaty he thought it his duty to give some reasons which moved him to approve that article at london that he was persuaded there were several members so prejudiced against all the articles that he could not hope from them a favorable audience and that what he had to say to the present subject of debate had been thought upon when he signed the treaty therefore he would presume to make use of his papers hoping though his reasons could not convince any member yet they might serve to vindicate his conduct to posterity then he proceeded and the second of november   0  made the following speech my lord chancellor  this honorable house has heard the several articles of the treaty of union twice read has spent a considerable time in discoursing to each of them and after much debate is come to examine and determine upon the first notwithstanding all the arguments offered against it i cannot find the least motive for altering the opinion i had at signing this article having had the honor to be one of the commissioners appointed by her majesty for that end but that i may give all satisfaction to every member i shall humbly offer in a plain manner my thoughts in relation to it  my lord this article is the foundation of the whole treaty and the approving or rejecting of it must determine union or no union betwixt both kingdoms  how far the approving this article conduces to our happiness appears evidently by considering the three different ways proposed for retriving the languishing condition of this nation which are that we continue under the same sovereign with england with limitations on his prerogative as king of scotland that the two kingdoms be incorporated into one or that they be entirely separated  that the union of crowns with limitations on the successor is not sufficient to rectify the bad state of this nation appears from these positions founded on reason and experience  two kingdoms subject to one sovereign having different interests the nearer these are one to another the greater jealousy and emulation will be betwixt em  every monarch having two or more kingdoms will be obliged to prefer the counsel and interest of the stronger to that of the weaker and the greater disparity of power and riches there is betwixt these kingdoms the greater influence the more powerful nation will have on the sovereign notwithstanding these positions i shall suppose the parliament of scotland is vested with the power of making peace and war of rewarding and punishing persons of all ranks of levying troops and of the negative it self  i could show the inconveniences that must attend such a state of government in disposal of places and managing public affairs i could likewise show the improbability of attaining such conditions or keeping em if attained but laying aside such considerations my humble opinion is that we cannot reap any benefit from these conditions of government without the assistance of england and the people thereof will never be convinced to promote the interest of scotland till both kingdoms are incorporated into one so that i conceive such a state of limitations to be no better for scotland than if it were entirely separated from england in which state there is little appearance of procuring any remedy to our present circumstances which appears from these uncontraverted positions  the people and government of scotland must be richer or poorer as they have plenty or scarcity of money the common measure of trade  no money or things of value can be purchased in the course of commerce but where there is a force to protect it  this nation is behind all other nations of europe for many years with respect to the effects of an extended trade  this nation being poor and without force to protect it is commerce cannot reap great advantages by it till it partake of the trade and protection of some powerful neighbor nation that can communicate both these  to illustrate this last position i shall give a short view of the state of commerce we must needs be in with respect to our neighbor nations supposing an entire separation from england  the ordinary mean whereby we can flourish in wealth is that balance which arises from the exchange of our natural or artificial product with other places but we have no valuable branch of export which does not interfere with the like commodity in some more powerful neighbor nation who is interest it is to suppress or discourage our commodity for raising the value of its own so that there is no demonstrable security for the vent and encouragement of any branch of our export  can it be expected that holland will suffer us to improve our fishery which is to them a nursery for seamen a livelihood to many families and an immense treasure to the public  if we traffic with england our linen cloth cattle and coals will be discouraged at least after the same manner that we discourage export from thence if we traffic with muscovy sweden denmark poland germany france spain portugal and italy the sale of our commodities will be of small value in these places seeing the dutch or english by their increase of trade are capable to serve them with most of the like goods cheaper and better than we  let us look to any other part of the world for vent to our product and well find other nations have prevented us  if we attempt the eastindiatrade that is already enhansed by the dutch english french spaniards or portuguese from whom we must expect opposition they themselves opposing one another daily and we of no force to debate the same with the most inconsiderable of them  the trade of africae is for the most part of small value and every province of america is claimed as property by some powerful european nation  if it be said that scotland may make alliance with one of its neighbor nations for protection that alliance must be with holland england or france other countries being so remote or poor that their friendships can be of little use to us  with holland we can have no advantageous alliance because its chief branch of trade is the same with ours with the english we can expect no profitable friendship for they being our near neighbors will be jealous of our increase in power and from france few advantages can be reaped till the old offensive and defensive league be revived betwixt france and scotland which would give umbrage to the english and occasion a war betwixt them and us and allowing the scots in such a juncture with the assistance of france to conquer england scotland by that conquest could not hope to better its present state for it is more than probable the conqueror would make his residence in england as formerly the northern people used to do in their southern expeditions  from these considerations i conceive that this nation by an entire separation from england cannot extend it is trade so as to raise its power in proportion to other trafficking nations in europe but that hereby we may be in danger of returning to that gothic constitution of government wherein our forefathers were which was frequently attended with feuds murders depredations and rebellions  my lord i am sorry that in place of things we amuse our selves with words for my part i comprehend no durable union betwixt scotland and england but that expressed in this article by one kingdom that is to say one people one civil government and one interest  it is true the words federal union are become very fashionable and may be handsomely fitted to delude unthinking people but if any member of this house will give himself the trouble to examine what conditions or articles are understood by these words and reduce them into any kind of federal compacts whereby distinct nations have been united i will presume to say these will be found impracticable or of very little use to us  but to put that matter in a clear light these queries ought to be duly examined whether a federal union be practicable betwixt two nations accustomed to a monarchical government whether there can be any sure guaranty projected for the observance of the articles of a federal compact stipulated betwixt two nations whereof the one is much superior to the other in riches numbers of people and an extended commerce whether the advantages of a federal union do balance its disadvantages whether the english will accept a federal union supposing it to be for the true interest of both nations whether any federal compact betwixt scotland and england is sufficient to secure the peace of this island or fortify it against the intrigues and invasions of its foreign enemies and whether england in prudence ought to communicate its trade and protection to this nation till both kingdoms are incorporated in one  to clear this last querie i shall offer a remark from history  of two independent and distinct kingdoms united by a federal compact under one sovereign the weaker to preserve its interest has some times separated from the stronger unless prevented by open force or secret influence on its government  spain and portugal were subject to the same sovereign philip ii and notwithstanding the portuguese got most advantageous conditions from spain they no sooner found a favorable opportunity in the reign of philip iv than they revolted from their allegiance and elected the duke of braganza for their king  sweden and denmark were united by a federal compact under one monarch but the swedes judging a separation more for their interest broke off and chose gustavus the   for their king  my lord i should now consider an incorporating union as it is expressed in this article by one kingdom but that i may not take up the time of the house i shall only give one historical remark with relation to it  two or more distinct kingdoms or states by incorporating into one kingdom have continued under the same sovereign enjoying equally the protection of his government and every part of the body politic tho never so far removed from the seat of government has flourished in wealth in proportion to the value of it is natural product or the industry of its inhabitants to prove this remark there are many examples  spain was formerly divided into several kingdoms ten whereof are incorporated into the one kingdom of spain  france was formerly divided into    states which are incorporated into the one kingdom of france  england was formerly divided into seven kingdoms which are incorporated into the one kingdom of england scotland it self was formerly divided into two kingdoms which at present are incorporated into the one kingdom of scotland  i could give some account of the particular advantages well obtain by an incorporating union with england but there will be occasions to discourse of these as the other articles fall under the consideration of this parliament in general i may assert that by this union well have access to all the advantages in commerce the english enjoy well be capable by a good government to improve our national product for the benefit of the whole island and well have our liberty property and religion secured under the protection of one sovereign and one parliament of great britain  now my lord if limitations on the successor can be of little or no use to us if an entire separation from england brings no advantage to this nation and if all federal compacts as we are stated have insuperable difficulties which in some measure i have cleared there is but one of two left to our choice to wit that both kingdoms be united into one or that we continue under the same sovereign with england as we have done these  00 years past this last i conceive to be a very ill state for by it if experience be convincing we cannot expect any of the advantages of an incorporating union but on the contrair our sovereignty and independency will be eclipsed the number of our nobility will increase our commons will be oppressed our parliaments will be influenced by england the execution of our laws will be neglected our peace will be interrupted by factions for places and pensions luxury together with poverty though strange will invade us numbers of scots will withdraw themselves to foreign countries and all the other effects of bad government must necessarily attend us  let us therefore my lord after all these considerations approve this article and when the whole treaty shall be duly examined and ratified i am hopeful this parliament will return their most dutiful acknowledgments to her majesty for her royal endeavors in promoting a lasting union betwixt both nations    next spoke the lord beilhaven but without answering what had been said by m seton he made a long premeditate speech the nature of which will be best understood by reading it at length which being so much talked of in the world i have also inserted here though i shall not trouble the reader with many more speeches in this whole history my lord chancellor  when i consider this affair of an union betwixt the two nations as it is expressed in the several articles thereof and now the subject of our deliberation at this time i find my mind crowded with variety of very melancholy thoughts and i think it my duty to disburden my self of some of them by laying them before and exposing them to the serious consideration of this honorable house  i think i see a free and independent kingdom delivering up that which all the world has been fighting for since the days of nimrod yea that for which most of all the empires kingdoms states principalities and dukedoms of europe are at this very time engaged in the most bloody and cruel wars that ever were to wit a power to manage their own affairs by themselves without the assistance and counsel of any other  i think i see a national church founded upon a rock secured by a claim of right hedged and fenced about by the strictest and pointedest legal sanction that sovereignty could contrive voluntarily descending into a plain upon an equal level with jews papists socinians arminians anabaptists and other sectaries etc  i think i see the noble and honorable peerage of scotland whose valiant predecessors led armies against their enemies upon their own proper charges and expenses now divested of their followers and vassalages and put upon such an equal foot with their vassals that i think i see a petty english exciseman receive more homage and respect than what was paid formerly to their quondam maccallanmores  i think i see the present peers of scotland whose noble ancestors conquered provinces overrun countries reduced and subjected towns and fortified places exacted tribute through the greatest part of england now walking in the court of requests like so many english attorneys laying aside their walking swords when in company with the english peers lest their selfdefence should be found murder  i think i see the honorable estate of barons the bold asserters of the nations rights and liberties in the worst of times now setting a watch upon their lips and a guard upon their tongues lest they be found guilty of scandalum magnatum  i think i see the royal state of burrows walking their desolate streets hanging down their heads under disappointments wormed out of all the branches of their old trade uncertain what hand to turn to necessitate to become prentices to their unkind neighbors and yet after all finding their trade so fortified by companies and secured by prescriptions that they despair of any success therein  i think i see our learned judges laying aside their practiques and decisions studying the common law of england gravelled with certioraries nisi priuss writs of error verdicts indovar ejectione firmae injunctions demurrs etc and frighted with appeals and avocations because of the new regulations and rectifications they may meet with  i think i see the valiant and gallant soldiery either sent to learn the plantation trade abroad or at home petitioning for a small subsistence as the reward of their honorable exploits while their old cores are broken the common soldiers left to beg and the youngest english corpse kept standing  i think i see the honest industrious tradesman loaded with new taxes and impositions disappointed of the equivalents drinking water in place of ale eating his satless pottage petitioning for encouragement to his manufacturies and answered by counter petitions  in short i think i see the laborious plewman with his corns spoiling upon his hands for want of sale cursing the day of his birth dreading the expense of his burial and uncertain whether to marry or do worse  i think i see the incureable difficulties of the landedmen fettered under the golden chain of equivalents their pretty daughters petitioning for want of husbands and their sons for want of employments  i think i see our mariners delivering up their ships to their dutch partners and what through presses and necessity earning their bread as underlings in the royal english navy  but above all my lord i think i see our ancient mother caledonia like caesar sitting in the midst of our senate rufully looking round about her covering her self with her royal garment attending the fatal blow and breathing out her last with a et tu quoque mi fili  are not these my lord very afflicting thoughts and yet they are but the least part suggested to me by these dishonorable articles should not the consideration of these things vivifie these dry bones of ours should not the memory of our noble predecessors valor and constancy rouse up our drouping spirits are our noble predecessors souls got so far into the english cabbagestock and colliflowers that we should show the least inclination that way are our eyes so blinded are our ears so deafned are our hearts so hardened are our tongues so faltered are our hands so fettered that in this our day i say my lord that in this our day that we should not mind the things that concern the very being and wellbeing of our ancient kingdom before the day be hid from our eyes  no my lord god forbid mans extremity is gods opportunity he is a present help in time of need and a deliverer and that right early some unforeseen providence will fall out that may cast the balance some joseph or other will say why do ye strive together since you are brethren none can destroy scotland save scotlands self hold your hands from the pen you are secure some judah or other will say let not our hands be upon the lad he is our brother there will be a jehovahjireh and some ram will be caught in the thicket when the bloody knife is at our mothers throat let us up then my lord and let our noble patriots behave themselves like men and we know not how soon a blessing may come  my lord i wish from my heart that this my vision prove not as true as my reasons for it are probable i design not at this time to enter into the merits of any one particular article i intend this discourse as an introduction to what i may afterward say upon the whole debate as it falls in before this honorable house and therefore in the further prosecution of what i have to say i shall insist upon some few particulars very necessary to be understood before we enter unto the detail of so important a matter  i shall therefore in the first place endeavor to encourage a free and full deliberation without animosities and heats in the next place i shall endeavor to make an enquiry into the nature and source of the unnatural and dangerous divisions that are now on foot within this isle with some motives showing that it is our interest to lay them aside at this time then i shall enquire into the reasons which have induced the two nations to enter into a treaty of union at this time with some considerations and meditations with relation to the behavior of the lords commissioners of the two kingdoms in the management of this great concern and lastly i shall propose a method by which we shall most distinctly and without confufusion go through the several articles of this treaty without unnecessary repetitions or loss of time and all this with all deference and under the correction of this honorable house  my lord chancellor the greatest honor that was done unto a roman was to allow him the glory of a triumph the greatest and most dishonorable punishment was that of paricide he that was guilty of paricide was beaten with rods upon his naked body till the blood gusht out of all the veins of his body then he was sowed up in a leathern sack called a culeus with a cock a viper and an ape and thrown headlong into the sea  my lord patricide is a greater crime than paricide all the world over  in a triumph my lord when the conqueror was riding in his triumphal chariot crowned with laurels adorned with trophies and applauded with huzzas there was a monitor appointed to stand behind him to warn not to be highminded nor puffed up with overveening thoughts of himself and to his chariot were tied a whip and a bell to mind him that for all his glory and grandeur he was accountable to the people for his administration and would be punished as other men if found guilty  the greatest honor amongst us my lord is to represent the sovereigns sacred person in parliament and in one particular it appears to be greater than that of a triumph because the whole legislative power seems to be wholly entrusted with him if he give the royal assent to an act of the estates it becomes a law obligatory upon the subject though contrary or without any instructions from the sovereign if he refuse the royal assent to a vote in parliament it cannot be a law though he has the sovereigns particular and positive instructions for it  his grace the duke of queensberry who now represents her majesty in this session of parliament has had the honor of that great trust as often if not more than any scots man ever had he has been the favorite of two successive sovereigns and i cannot but commend his constancy and perseverance that notwithstanding his former difficulties and unsuccessful attempts and maugre some other specialities not yet determined that his grace has yet had the resolution to undertake the most unpopular measures last if his grace succeed in this affair of an union and that it prove for the happiness and welfare of the nation then he justly merits to have a statue of gold erected for himself but if it shall tend to the entire destruction and abolition of our nation and that we the nations trustees shall go into it then i must say that a whip and a bell a cock a viper and an ape are but too small punishments for any such bold unnatural undertaking and complaisance  that i may path a way my lord to a full calm and free reasoning upon this affair which is of the last consequence unto this nation i shall mind this honorable house that we are the successors of our noble predecessors who founded our monarchy framed our laws amended altered and corrected them from time to time as the affairs and circumstances of the nation did require without the assistance or advice of any foreign power or potentate and who during the time of  000 years have handed them down to us a free independent nation with the hazard of their lives and fortunes shall not we then argue for that which our progenitors have purchased for us at so dear a rate and with so much immortal honor and glory god forbid shall the hazard of a father unbind the ligaments of a dumb sons tongue and shall we hold our peace when our patria is in danger i speak this my lord that i may encourage every individual member of this house to speak their mind freely there are many wise and prudent men amongst us who think it not worth their while to open their mouths there are others who can speak very well and to good purpose who shelter themselves under the shameful cloak of silence from a fear of the frowns of great men and parties i have observed my lord by my experience the greatest number of speakers in the most trivial affairs and it will always prove so while we come not to the right understanding of our oath de fideli whereby we are bound not only to give our vote but our faithful advice in parliament as we should answer to god and in our ancient laws the representatives of the honorable barons and the royal burrows are termed spokesmen it lies upon your lordships therefore particularly to take notice of such whose modesty makes them bashful to speak therefore i shall leave it upon you and conclude this point with a very memorable saying of an honest private gentleman to a great queen upon occasion of a state project contrived by an able statesman and the favorite to a great king against a peaceable obedient people because of the diversity of their laws and constitutions if at this time thou hold thy peace salvation shall come to the people from another place but thou and thy house shall perish i leave the application to each particular member of this house  my lord i come now to consider our divisions we are under the happy reign blessed be god of the best of queens who has no evil design against the meanest of her subjects who loves all her people and is equally beloved by them again and yet that under the happy influence of our most excellent queen there should be such divisions and factions more dangerous and threatening to her dominions than if we were under an arbitrary government is most strange and unaccountable under an arbitrary prince all are willing to serve because all are under a necessity to obey whether they will or not he chooses therefore whom he will without respect to either parties or factions and if he think fit to take the advices of his councils or parliaments every man speaks his mind freely and the prince receives the faithful advice of his people without the mixture of selfdesigns if he prove a good prince the government is easy if bad either death or a revolution brings a deliverance whereas here my lord there appears no end of our misery if not prevented in time factions are now become independent and have got footing in councils in parliaments in treaties in armies in incorporations in families among kindred yea man and wife are not free from their political jarrs  it remains therefore my lord that i enquire into the nature of these things and since the names give us not the right idea of the thing i am afraid i will have difficulty to make my self well understood  the names generally used to denote the factions are whig and torie as obscure as that of the guelfs and gibelins yea my lord they have different significations as they are applied to factions in each kingdom a whig in england is a heterogeneous creature in scotland he is all of a piece a tory in england is all of a piece and a statesman in scotland he is quite otherways an anticourteour and antistatesman  a whig in england appears to be somewhat like nebuchadnezzars image of different metals different classes different principles and different designs yet take them all together they are like a piece of fine mixed droggat of different threeds some finer some courser which after all make a comely appearance and an agreeable suit a tory is like a piece of loyalmade english cloth the true staple of the nation all of a thread yet if we look narrowly into it we shall perceive diversity of colors which according to the various situations and positions makes various appearances sometimes tory is like the moon in its full as appeared in the affair of the bill of the occasional conformity upon other occasions it appears to be under cloud and as if it were eclipsed by a greater body as it did in the design of the calling over the illustrious princess sophia however by this we may see their designs are to outshoot whig in his own bow  whig in scotland is a true blew presbyterian who without considering time or power will venture their all for the kirk but something less for the state the greatest difficulty is how to describe a scots tory of old when i knew them first tory was an honest hearted comradish fellow who provided he were maintained and protected in his benefices titles and dignities by the state he was the less anxious who had the government and management of the church but now what he is since juredivinity came in fashon and that christianity and by consequence salvation comes to depend upon episcopal ordination i profess i know not what to make of him only this i must say for him that he endeavors to do by opposition that which his brother in england endeavors by a more prudent and less scrupulous method  now my lord from these divisions there has got up a kind of aristocracy something like the famous triumvirate at rome they are a kind of undertakers and pragmatick statesmen who finding their four and strength great and answerable to their designs will make bargains with our gracious sovereign they will serve her faithfully but upon their own terms they must have their own instruments their own measures this man must be turned out and that man put in and then they will make her the most glorious queen in europe  where will this end my lord is not her majesty in danger by such a method is not the monarchy in danger is not the nations peace and tranquillity in danger will a change of parties make the nation more happy no my lord the seed is sown that is like to afford us a perpetual increase it is not an annual herb it takes deep root it seeds and breeds and if not timeously prevented by her majestys royal endeavors will split the whole island in two  my lord i think considering our present circumstances at this time the almighty god has reserved this great work for us we may bruise this hydra of division and crush this cockatrices egg our neighbors in england are not yet fitted for any such thing they are not under the afflicting hand of providence as we are their circumstances are great and glorious their treaties are prudently managed both at home and abroad their generals brave and valorous their armies successful and victorious their trophies and laurels memorable and surprising their enemies subdued and routed their strong holds besieged and taken sieges relieved marishals killed and taken prisoners provinces and kingdoms are the results of their victories the royal navy is the terror of europe their trade and commerce extended through the universe incircling the whole habitable world and rendering their own capital city the emporium for the whole inhabitants of the earth and which is yet more than all these things the subjects freely bestowing their treasury upon their sovereign and above all these vast riches the sinews of war and without which all the glorious success had proven abortive these treasures are managed with such faithfulness and nicety that they answer seasonably all their demands tho at never so great a distance upon these considerations my lord how hard and difficult a thing will it prove to persuade our neighbors to a selfdenial bill  it is quite otherways with us my lord we are an obscure poor people though formerly of better account removed to a remote corner of the world without name and without alliances our posts mean and precarious so that i profess i dont think any one post of the kingdom worth the briguing after save that of being commissioner to a long session of a factious scots parliament with an antedated commission and that yet renders the rest of the ministers more miserable what hinders us then my lord to lay aside our divisions to unite cordially and heartily together in our present circumstances when our all is at the stake hannibal my lord is at our gates hannibal is come within our gates hannibal is come the length of this table he is at the foot of this throne he will demolish this throne if we take not notice he will seize upon these regalia he will take them as our spolia opima and whip us out of this house never to return again  for the love of god then my lord for the safety and welfare of our ancient kingdom whose sad circumstances i hope we shall yet convert unto prosperity and happiness we want no means if we unite god blesses the peacemakers we want neither men nor sufficiency of all manner of things necessary to make a nation happy all depends upon management concordia res parvae crescunt i fear not these articles tho they were ten times worse than they are if we once cordially forgive one another and that according to our proverb bygones be bygones and fair play to come for my part in the sight of god and in the presence of this honorable house i heartily forgive every man and beggs that they may do the same to me and i do most humbly propose that his grace my lord commissioner may appoint an agape may order a lovefeast for this honorable house that we may lay aside all self designs and after our fasts and humiliations may have a day of rejoicing and thankfulness may eat our meat with gladness and our bread with a merry heart then shall we sit each man under his own fig tree and the voice of the turtle shall be heard in our land a bird famous for constancy and fidelity  my lord i shall make a pause here and stop going on further in my discourse till i see further if his grace my lord commissioner receive any humble proposals for removing misunderstandings among us and putting an end to our fatal divisions upon honor i have no other design and i am content to beg the favor upon my bended knees  no answer my lord chancellor i am sorry that i must pursue the thread of my sad and melancholy story what remains i am afraid prove as afflicting as what i have said i shall therefore consider the motives which have engaged the two nations to enter upon a treaty of union at this time in general my lord i think both of them had in their view to better themselves by the treaty but before i enter upon the particular motives of each nation i must inform this honorable house that since i can remember the two nations have altered their sentiments upon that affair even almost to downright contradiction they have changed headbands as we say for england till of late never thought it worth their pains of treating with us the good bargain they made at the beginning they resolve to keep and that which we call an incorporating union was not so much as in their thoughts the first notice they seemed to take of us was in our affair of caledonia when they had most effectually broke off that design in a manner very well known to the world and unnecessary to be repeated here they kept themselves quiet during the time of our complaints upon that head in which time our sovereign to satisfy the nation and allay their heats did condescend to give us some good laws and amongst others that of personal liberties and of peace and war but england having declared their succession and extended their intail without ever taking notice of us our gracious sovereign queen anne was graciously pleased to give the royal assent to our act of security and to give us a hedge to all our sacred and civil interests by declaring it high treason to endeavor the alteration of them as they were then established thereupon did follow the threatening and minatory laws against us by the parliament of england and the unjust and unequal character of what her majesty had so graciously condescended to in our favors now my lord whether the desire they had to have us engaged in the same succession with them or whether that they found us like a free and independent people breathing after more liberty than what formerly was looked after or whether they were afraid of our act of security in case of her majestys decease which of all these motives has induced them to a treaty i leave it to themselves this i must say only they have made a good bargain this time also  for the particular motives that induced us i think they are obvious to be known we found by sad experience that every man has advanced in power and riches as they have done in trade and at the same time considering that no where through the world slaves are found to be rich though they should be adorned with chains of gold we thereupon changed our notion of an incorporating union to that of a federal one and being resolved to take this opportunity to make demands upon them before we enter into the succession we were content to empower her majesty to authorize and appoint commissioners to treat with the commissioners of england with as ample powers as the lords commissioners from england had from their constituents that we might not appear to have less confidence in her majesty nor more narrow hearted in our act than our neighbors of england and thereupon last parliament after her majestys gracious letter was read desiring us to declare the succession in the first place and afterward to appoint commissioners to treat we found it necessary to renew our former resolve which i shall read to this honorable house resolve presented by the duke of hamilton last session of parliament that this parliament will not proceed to the nomination of a successor till we have had a previous treaty with england in relation to our commerce and other concerns with that nation and further it is resolved that this parliament will proceed to make such limitations and conditions of government for the rectification of our constitution as may secure the liberty religion and independency of this kingdom before they proceed to the said nomination    now my lord the last session of parliament having before they would enter upon any treaty with england by a vote of the house past both an act for limitations and an act for rectification of our constitution what mortal man has reason to doubt the design of this treaty was only federal  my lord chancellor it remains now that we consider the behavior of the lords commissioners at the opening of this treaty and before i enter upon that allow me to make this meditation that if our posterity after we are all dead and gone shall find themselves under an ill made bargain and shall have a recourse unto our records and see who have been the managers of that treaty by which they have suffered so much when they read the names they will certainly conclude and say ah our nation has been reduced to the last extremity at the time of this treaty all our great chieftains all our great peers and considerable men who used formerly to defend the rights and liberties of the nation have been all killed and dead in the bed of honor before ever the nation was necessitate to condescend to such mean and contemptible terms where are the names of the chief men of the noble families of stewarts hamiltons grahams campbells gordons johnstons homes murrays kers etc where are the two great officers of the crown the constable and the marischal of scotland they have certainly all been extinguished and now we are slaves for ever  whereas the english records will make their posterity reverence the memory of the honorable names who have brought under their fierce warlike and troublesome neighbors who had struggled so long for independency shed the best blood of their nation and reduced a considerable part of their country to become waste and desolate  i am informed my lord that our commissioners did indeed frankly tell the lords commissioners for england that the inclination of the people of scotland were much altered of late in relation to an incorporating union and that therefore since the entail was to end with her majestys life whom god long preserve it was proper to begin the treaty upon the foot of the treaty the   0  year of god the time when we came first under one sovereign but this the english commissioners would not agree to and our commissioners that they might not seem obstinate were willing to treat and conclude in the terms laid before this honorable house and subjected to their determination  if the lords commissioners for england had been as civil and complaisant they should certainly have finished a federal treaty likeways that both nations might have the choice which of them to have gone into as they thought fit but they would hear of nothing but of an entire and complete union a name which comprehends an union either by incorporation surrender or conquest whereas our commissioners thought of nothing but a fair equal incorporating union whether this be so or no i leave it to every mans judgment but as for my self i must beg liberty to think it no such thing for i take an incorporating union to be where there is a change both in the material and formal points of government as if two pieces of metal were melted down into one mass it can neither be said to retain its former form or substance as it did before the mixture but now when i consider this treaty as it has been explained and spoke to before us these three weeks by past i see the english constitution remaining firm the same two houses of parliament the same taxes the same customs the same excises the same trade in companies the same municipal laws and courts of judicature and all ours either subject to regulations or annihilations only we have the honor to pay their old debts and to have some few persons present for witnesses to the validity of the deed when they are pleased to contract more  good god what is this an entire surrender  my lord i find my heart so full of grief and indignation that i must beg pardon not to finish the last part of my discourse that i may drop a tear as the prelude to so sad a story  after having sit down and some discourses by other members interveening he continued his discourse thus my lord chancellor what i am now to say relates to the method of proceeding in this weighty affair i hear it proposed by a noble member of the other side that we should proceed in the same order as the lords commissioners treaters did in my humble opinion my lord it is neither the natural method nor can it be done without great confusion and repetition to say you will agree to the union of the two kingdoms before you agree in the terms upon which they are to be united seems like driving the plough before the oxen the articles which narrate the conditions seem to be the premises upon which the conclusion is inferred and according as they are found good or bad the success will follow when a man is married to a fortune in england as they call it i suppose he is satisfied with the thing before he determines himself to marry and the proposal i have heard of agreeing to the first article with a proviso that if the rest of the articles shall be found satisfactory and no otherwise is of a piece with the rest and looks like beating the air and noways consistent with fair and square dealings besides my lord if we were to go upon the first article are not all the rest of the articles besides many others not contained in the articles valid arguments either pro or con against concluding or not concluding the first article and no vote in this house can hinder a man from making use of what arguments he thinks fit moreover the searching the records and the revising the statute books comparing the books of rates customs excise taxes of both nations with one another must all be previously considered ere we determine our selves in one single article add to this that the prohibitory clause with relation to the trade of both nations must be adjusted lest like esops dog we lose the old in grasping at the new the state of the english companies must also be exposed how far we shall have liberty into them and what advantage we may propose to our selves by trading to these places where they are secured and above all my lord the security of our national church and of all that is dear unto us must be previously established to us if practicable before we conclude the first article therefore my lord tho my particular opinion be tho we had a cart blanch from england yet the delivery up of our sovereignty gives back with one hand what we receive with the other and that there can be no security without the guarrantee of a distinct independency betwixt the parties treating yet my lord for further satisfaction to this honorable house that every member may fully satisfy himself i humbly propose that passing by the first three articles which appear to be much of a piece we begin at the fourth article of the treaty and if i be seconded in this i desire it may be put to the question    i shall make no remarks upon this last and famous speech the noble person that spoke it however he happened to mistake in some things was a person of extraordinary parts and capacity and as he was very warm against the union it made that opposition the more considerable  this speech the reader may see was pointed directly against the union and in the first part of it argues against the whole in the last against the parts  but concludes to move against the immediate proceedings  the first speech was from a person no less capable in the matter of the treaty and that had been a commissioner in the treaty at london the speeches are directly opposite and are left thus upon record to argue against one another  the time had been taken up with their length and the house as well as the nation was at this time in an unusual ferment so not many replies were made mr seton who made the first speech stood up to answer the lord beilhaven but as he had already spoken the orders of the house viz that the same member could not speak twice in the same cause were urged against his speaking and the earl of ma  mont standing up to speak at the same time the lord chancellor gave place to him who indeed made a very short return to so long a speech and which answer occasioned some laughter in the house the earl of ma  monts speech was to this purpose viz he had heard a long speech and a very terrible one but he was of opinion it required a short answer which he gave in these words behold he dreamed but lo when he awoke he found it was a dream this answer some said was as satisfactory to the members who understood the design of that speech as if it had been answered vision by vision  after these two speeches several members spoke pro and con but the debate in close of the day turned so warm that at the desire of the house it was adjourned to the next sederunt  minute xv monday   november   0  prayers said  rolls called  then the following addresses were presented viz address of barons freeholders and others within the shire of stirling subscribers of the same address of barons freeholders and others within the shire of dumbartoun subscribers of the same address of the magistrates towncouncil deacons of crafts and burgesses within the burgh of linlithgow subscribers of the same address of heretors and others inhabitants of the town and paroch of dunkeld alias caledonia subscribers of the same and an address of the town and paroch of dysert subscribers of the same all against an incorporating union with england and were read  thereafter the first article of union was again read as also the motion mentioned in the last minute relating thereto viz that it be agreed to in the first place to proceed to take the first article of the union to consideration with this provision that if the other articles of union be not adjusted by the parliament then the agreeing to and approving of the first shall be of no effect and that immediately after the said first article the parliament will proceed to an act for security of the doctrine discipline worship and government of the church as now by law established within this kingdom and after some further debate upon the said article a resolve was offered in their terms viz whereas it evidently appears since the printing publishing and considering of the articles of treaty now before this house this nation seems generally averse to this incorporating union in the terms now before us as subversive of the sovereignty fundamental constitution and claim of right of this kingdom and as threatening ruin to this church as by law established  and since it is plain that if an union were agreed to in these terms by this parliament and accepted of by the parliament of england it would in no sort answer the peaceable and friendly ends proposed by an union but would on the contrair create such dismal distractions and animosities amongst our selves and such jealousies and mistakes betwixt us and our neighbors as would involve these nations into fatal breaches and confusions  therefore resolved that we are willing to enter into such an union with our neighbors of england as shall unite us entirely and after the most strict manner in all their and our interests of succession wars alliances and trade reserving to us the sovereignty and independency of our crown and monarchy and immunities of the kingdom and the constitution and frame of the government both of church and state as they stand now established by our fundamental constitution by our claim of right and by the laws following thereupon or resolved that we will proceed to settle the same succession with england upon such conditions and regulations of government within our selves as shall effectually secure the sovereignty and independency of this crown and kingdom and the indissolvable society of the same with the fundamental rights and constitutions of the government both of church and state as the same stands established by the claim of right and other laws and statutes of this kingdom  which being read and after debate thereon the vote was stated approve of the first article of union in the terms of the motion yea or not  but before voting the duke of athole gave in the following protest viz that he for himself and all others who shall adhere protested that an incorporating union of the crown and kingdom of scotland with the crown and kingdom of england and that both nations should be represented by one and the same parliament as contained in the articles of the treaty of union is contrair to the honor interest fundamental laws and constitution of this kingdom the birthright of the peers the rights and privileges of the barons and burrows and is contrair to the claim of right property and liberty of the subjects and third act of her majestys parliament one thousand seven hundred and three by which it is declared high treason in any of the subjects of this kingdom to quarrel or endeavor by writing malicious and advised speaking or other open act or deed to alter or innovat the claim of right or any article thereof and reserving liberty to him and his adherents to renew their protestation against further proceedings in the said matter and to adjoin their reasons for the same and desired this his protestation be marked in the records of parliament which being read the said duke of athole took instruments thereon and the duke of hamilton marquess of annandale earl of errol earl marischal earl of wigtoun earl of strathmore earl of selkirk earl of kincardin viscount of stormount viscount of kilsyth the lord semple the lord oliphant the lord balmerino the lord blantyre the lord bargany the

archibald shiels mr john lion george spence mr william johnstoun mr john carruthers george home john baine and mr robert frazer adhered thereto  then the vote was put approve of the said first article of union in the terms of the motion yea or not and it carried approve  moved that the list of the hail members of parliament as they voted pro or con be printed and it was agreed to  thereafter an overture for an act for security of the true protestant religion and government of the church as by law established within this kingdom was read and ordered to be printed  adjourned till wednesday next at ten a clock  observation xv it is very remarkable that the addresses now began to throng upon the house and we find them at the beginning of every vote the debates of this day visibly discovered the reason and design of procuring these addresses viz that they might form an argument from the general aversions of the nation and from thence and the bringing the soldiers into the city it was called a cramming the union down their throats  at the same time it was visible there were such methods made use of to procure addresses such want of hands such kinds of people who signed such a paucity of gentry where the counties were full of gentlemen and such varieties of circumstances concurring to make it appear that it was the labored performance of a party that it was thought they met with the less regard  there were indeed in several places addresses prepared from the gentry of the country for the encouragement of the treaty but it was concluded to be needless since that would have been a kind of telling noses without doors and the party would have been pleased to have had it past for a sort of polling the nation in which they having before dissatisfied and alarmed the common people they had the most hopes of success  this therefore was laid aside as a step that would be of no use and would put the union upon a trial altogether inconsistent with the constitution and as it were debate it alamob  and therefore none of the addresses on the other side were presented tho i have the originals of some by me which were actually signed by the country gentlemen and which were highly expressive of their assent to the treaty and of their reasons for it some of which were particularly the danger of popery and of introducing the old tyranny in the prince of wales  nor can it but be reasonably supposed that had the noblemen and gentlemen of scotland as well in the parliament as without who were hearty in the business of the union gone home and raised their tenants vassals and dependencies to have appeared for the union either in the addresses or in the field they would taking it at first as much have overpowered the other party without doors as they outvoted them within since it was known that except the duke of at  le the principal number of the opposers were not men of the greatest interest in their country i mean as to the command of their vassals and attendants  but they never brought it to the extremity of that trial and therefore the motions of the party as to general aversions being laid aside they found themselves under a necessity of struggling in parliament only  the endeavors of mobbing the parliament were suppressed and the addresses obtained only a reading but had no direct answer given them other than the proceedings of the house of course made out the thing now to be carried on within doors was to load the treaty with impracticable amendments while the party without doors endeavored on the one hand to raise tumults in the country bring up popular addresses and at last downright rebellion as in its place will appear and on the other hand to displease and dissatisfie the ministers and bring them to appear publicly uneasy of which we shall see further in its place  the debates of this day were very warm and several long speeches were made but it was impossible to obtain abstracts of speeches which we could but just hear and i shall not venture to injure either the speaker or hearer by imposing my language upon them to express what others said  long debates were offered to the second part of the vote above viz that the union was impracticable that the joining of nations could not be would tend to confusion and be necessarily broken as in the vote this was raised upon the aforesaid book of mr hodges and proved evidently that it was not his hypothesis but a concert of heads  and his interfeiring interests were here discoursed of  i am not willing to examine into the inconsistencies of some peoples notions started here in matters of interests and how they raised objections which were not grounded on fact especially in matters of trade i bury them in silence in respect to the gentlemen but it was next to miraculous to hear men of sense allege that england got nothing by her west india trade that most of her foreign trade was engrossed by exclusive companies that scotland got nothing by trading with england that scotland could gain by any foreign trade but england and the like these things will more evidently be detected hereafter  in short a federal union was offered that was understood any thing but the right any thing but the treaty now begun beanduse could they have obtained a vote against the present teaty the gaining time for another parliament had followed and the design of putting off or delaying time had taken effect  some gentlemen with extraordinary reason and force of argument endeavored to explain them the absurdities and inconsistencies of that project and put the house in mind that it was not a federal union or a better union that those gentlemen desired but really no union at all and that the design was to defeat the endeavors of the union only in order to bring in french bondage and king james viii upon them  upon the whole the other party soon saw in the house it would go against them and therefore before it was put to the vote the duke of a  ole gave in his protest as in the vote together with the whole party of opposets on whatsoever principle they opposed which protest they had ready concerted before expecting as was supposed things would go as they did and that they should be overpowered in the house  i can not but note here that this great debate and on which the whole weight of the matter depended happened on that famous day to britain i mean the very day on which the prince of orange afterward king william came to england and was also the birthday of that glorious monarch  on the same day now a second time the fate of britain had a new turn and the success of that gave a pleasant presage to many observing people of the future happy issue of the thing now in hand  the gentlemen who let slip no occasion to puzzle the debates of this matter had now conceived great hopes of a broil among the ministers and were exceeding busy to fill the heads of some of the gentlemen of the clergy with jealousies and dissatisfactions  and yet i can not say they brought in the overture at this time though they were always forward to push on that side too  i can not say neither that they met with no encouragement here or that there were no warmheads to be found in the commission who apter to take fire than was to be wished were more easily gained but if there were any such the prudence and moderation of the rest of the commission so overruled them as kept them from any precipitations and contributed greatly to the general safety of which i have spoken more largely in its place  minute xvi wednesday   november   0  prayers said  rolls called  the lord chancellor moved that albeit he had no opportunity to vote for approving of the first article of union yet he desired his name to be recorded and to be printed with those who voted approve and the same was agreed to  address of the commissioners to the general convention of the royal burrows subscribed by the preses of the convention against concluding such an incorporating union as is contained in the articles proposed given in and read  then the following addresses were given in viz address by barons freeholders and others within the shire of renfrew subscribing the same address by barons freeholders and others within the shire of fife subscribing the same and an address by the magistrates of the burgh of falkland counselors and inhabitants therein and of heretors within the paroch thereof subscribing the same all against allowing of an incorporating union in the terms contained in the articles with england and were all read  and an address by heretors elders and masters of families within the paroch of hamiltoun subscribers of the same that no union be hastily entered into with england also given in and read  act for security of the true protestant religion and government of the church as by law established within this kingdom again read and a first reading ordered to be marked thereon  adjourned till friday next at ten of the clock  observation xvi the fatigue of the last day was so great that both sides seemed as it were to take breath and little was done to day except reading the church act  my lord chancellor like the speaker of the house of commons having no vote in the house unless on an equal division his lordships name could not be printed in the list of names but his lordships zeal was always remarkable in carrying on this union and in this in particular his lordship was resolved to let the world know he was not ashamed of the part he had taken in this affair and therefore moved very honorably to have his name printed with the rest of the gentlemen who voted for the union the list of whom i have put into the appendix to this work because the vote upon this article being the main trial of skill in the house upon the union in general and the house having ordered them to be made public with the minutes it may not be amiss to let posterity see who and who were for or against  there were several other lists printed upon the occasion of the following votes as per the respective minutes will appear which i have for want of room omitted the present list will be found marked  n f x x  minute xvii friday   november   0  prayers said  rolls called  representation and petition of the commission of the general assembly of this church representing several difficulties in relation to some of the articles of union and craving suitable remedies read  then the following addresses were given in and read viz address of the inhabitants of the paroch of tulliallan subscribing the same address of the magistrates towncouncil merchants deacons of crafts and other tradesmen and inhabitants within the burgh of dumferling subscribers of the same and an address by heretors merchants masters of ships mariners and other inhabitants in the town of borrowstounness subscribing the same all against allowing of an incorporating union with england upon the terms contained in the articles  as also an address of the inhabitants of the paroch of blantyre subscribers of the same and an address of heretors and commoners in the paroch of avendale subscribing the same that no union be hastily entered into with england were likeways given in and read  thereafter an act for security of the true protestant religion and government of the church as by law established within this kingdom was again read  moved that the consideration of the said act be delayed till next sederunt  moved also that the parliament proceed to the consideration of the act for a supply  and after some reasonings on these motions it was agreed to lay aside the act for security of the protestant religion and church government for this sederunt and to proceed to the act for a supply and accordingly the act for a supply was again read  and it was agreed that a supply of eight months cess should be granted to her majesty for the ends and uses mentioned in the act extending to five hundred and seventy seven thousand sixty six pounds thirteen shilling four pennies and that it should be payable at the terms following viz one months supply the tenth of december for martinmass next one month and a half months supply at candlesmass one thousand seven hundred and seven one month and a half at whitsunday one month and a half at lambmass one month and a half at martinmass the said year and one months supply at candlemass one thousand seven hundred and eight  moved that in place of the retention of a twelfth part of annualrents allowed by the above act for a supply there be an allowance granted for retention of a sixth part of annualrents and after some reasoning thereupon it was put to the vote approve of the article anent the retention or amend and it carried approve  and after some amendments the act was voted and approven  adjourned till the morrow at ten a clock  observation xvii i have already given an account of the birth of this paper called the representation and petition and the several difficulties it met with in the commission of the assembly and which some have said was a reason why it met with less encouragement in the parliament than was expected but it may be worth notice that notwithstanding it did not meet with a very kind reception some of the gentlemen having been disobliged in the case of their protest yet the house did not wholly omit the things desired in it  some of the gentlemen who as ruling elders had protested in the commission had it seems met with some personal reflections from the rashness of some members that was disobliging enough and upon which they had withdrawn themselves from the commission and seldom if at all came there any more during the whole sitting and though the rashness of the persons who gave those reflections was not approved by the commission yet it stuck a little too closs with some people and it was thought made them less careful of the application made by the ministers in this case  upon the receiving the representation or petition into the house there were no debates of any consequence it was only read and the act of security being as per the minutes adjourned the other lay by of course  the money bill now came on and as the other party thought the speeding of it might be a step to put an end to the session they all came into it and gave it all the dispatch possible  it was apparent that in order to break up this treaty the gentlemen studied all possible methods to raise the parliament  this they could never have done while the funds remained unsettled because it being a thing of such consequence to the kingdom the whole country would have laid it at their door and the queen would have had the highest affront put upon both her person and government imaginable and therefore this was one of the first things they pusht at and that made it pass immediately with no opposition at all those gentlemen complying with it as it was removing an obstruction to their general design  minute xviii saturday   november   0  prayers said  rolls called  the act for supply was touched with the scepter by her majestys high commissioner in the usual manner  thereafter the following addresses were given in and read viz address by the provost baillies towncouncil and burgesses of the burgh of forfar subscribing the same address of heretors and commons in the paroch of cambusnethan subscribing the same address of the heretors elders and heads of families of the paroch of cambuslang subscribers of the same address by heretors session and inhabitants of the paroch of kilbryde subscribing the same address of the heretors elders and masters of families in the paroch of bothwel subscribing the same and an address by heretors and commons in the paroch of old munkland subscribing the same all against entering into an union with england in the terms of the articles  thereafter the act for security of the true protestant religion and government of the church as by law established within this kingdom was again read and upon reading the first clause thereof it was moved that there should be a particular enumeration made of all the acts in favors of the kirk and after some reasoning thereon the vote was stated approve of the clause as it stands or amend and enumerat the acts and it carried approve  then the second clause of the said act was read and agreed to  and upon reading the third clause it was moved that an additional clause be added for securing the continuance of the universities and colleges of this kingdom and thereupon an amendment being made in their terms that the universities and colleges of this kingdom viz of st andrews glasgow aberdeen and edinburgh as now established by law shall continue within this kingdom for ever after some debate thereupon the vote was put approve of the clause as amended or not and it carried approve  adjourned till tuesday next at ten of the clock  observation xviii the amendments here made to the act for security of the church make it evident that the parliament did not slightly pass over that affair as some people pretended they would do though they did not enter into the debate of the insufficiency which some offered as things which tended not to amendments of the act as it was offered but to a rupture of the debate for the people who offered at the insufficiency of the act went upon this foot not that this overture or act was an insufficient security but that really the union with england as an episcopal nation was inconsistent with the safety of the church of scotland and that not this act only was but any other act that could be made would be insufficient to secure the church of scotland  this appeared to be the plain design in that as i have already noted the gentlemen that spoke loudest for the insufficiency of the act of security were not of those people who really were most concerned for the safety of the church of scotland the objections also were not calculated for amendments or additions but for destroying the bill it self as built on the supposition of a union which they said was a foundation that would not bear such a superstructure  and though some well meaning men too were of opinion that the church of scotland could not really be safe in a union within england yet these gentlemen as is noted applied it purely as an obstacle to the union and as a thing by which means they hoped to render the union universally odious and terrible to the people  and this will be more apparent from the protest entered into after all the clauses were read and after all amendments that could be reasonably desired were agreed to as will appear in the next days minute  minute xix tuesday    november   0  prayers said  rolls called  the following addresses were given in and read viz address of the magistrates towncouncil merchants deacons of crafts and other inhabitants within the burgh of crail subscribing the same address of heretors and commons in the paroch of eastermunkland subscribers of the same address of heretors and commoners in the paroch of shotts subscribing the same address of heretors and commoners of the paroch of dalserf subscribing the same address of heretors and commoners in the paroch of stenhouse subscribers of the same address of a body of people in the south and western shires subscribed by mr john hepburn and other seven persons and an address of the magistrates towncouncil and other inhabitants of the burgh of kircudbright subscribers of the same all against allowing an union with england in the terms of the articles  thereafter the parliament proceeded to the further consideration of the act for security of the true protestant religion and government of the church as by law established within this kingdom and the fourth clause thereof again read whereupon it was moved that a clause should be added in their terms and that they shall be capable of any office civil or military and to receive any grant gift or right and to have command or place of trust from and under the sovereign within any part of great britain and after debate thereupon it was put to the vote add the above clause or not and it carried not and the clause as it stood in the draught of the act agreed to  then the fifth clause of the act was also read and agreed to with some amendments  and the next clause being again read and amended was likewise agreed to  whereupon the whole act was again read as also the last representation and petition of the commission of the general assembly of the church and a vote was thereupon stated approve the act or not  but before voting the lord beilhaven gave in a protestation in their terms that he did protest in his own name and in name of all those who shall adhere to him that this act is no valid security to the church of scotland as it is now established by law in case of an incorporating union and that the church of scotland can have no real and solid security by any manner of union by which the claim of rights is unhinged our parliament incorporated and our distinct sovereignty and independency abolished which being read he took instruments thereupon and the duke of hamilton the duke of athole the marquess of annandale the earl of errol the earl marischal the earl of wigtoun the earl of selkirk the earl of kincardine the viscounts of stormount and kilsyth the lord oliphant the lord blantyre the lord colvil the lord kinnaird andrew fletcher of saltoun john brisbane younger of bishoptoun mr william cochran of kilmaronock sir humphray colquhoun of luss robert rollo of powhouse john murray of strowan francis molison mr john carruthers and george home adhered thereto  moved that all the members should be marked as they should approve the act or not and also as they should adhere to the protest and that the list of the members as they shall vote pro or con shall be printed and agreed to  then the vote was put approve or not and it carried approve  adjourned till thursday next at ten of the clock  observation xix the reading of the act of security having been begun last day several amendments were offered such as first the enumerating the acts of parliament upon which it was grounded this admitted no long debates if it had had any signification it would have been granted but it was generally esteemed a thing of no value merely unnecessary and trifling and as such was rejected the reason given was because one act is particularly specified to be ratified by this treaty to wit the   th act of the   st parliament of king william and queen mary entitled an act ratifying the confession of faith and settling presbyterian church government and then it mentions with the hail other acts relating thereunto which was thought sufficient and full enough  the next amendment was for the colleges which was found reasonable and was hinted by some who had not without just cause observed how much the schools of the dissenters in england are regretted by some people who envy the increase of their number and this therefore as a most reasonable demand was immediately agreed to by the the parliament and is made part of the act as will appear by the draught of the bill  the fourth clause had an objection of greater moment depending on it which caused long debates and was built on a foundation however plausible and just in it self had yet such a known impossibility before it morally speaking as that no small hopes were conceived from it that it would shock the whole treaty  all men know that in england by the test act as it is called all persons that obtain any office civil or military etc are obliged to take the sacrament according to the usage of the church of england and to bring certificates etc of the same under pain of incapacity among other penalties now it was a most plausible argument that if the subjects of both kingdoms were to enjoy equal privileges the subjects of scotland taking the sacrament in the national church of scotland ought to be as capable of places or offices etc as the subjects of england taking the sacrament in the national church of england  nor was this matter carried a little way but became the subject of infinite discontents without doors and of long disputes within  it was suggested and printed too by the same author of whom mention is already made as writing against the union that all the members of parliament in england were obliged to take the sacrament before they could sit in the house but this as false in fact was crushed at first several accounts being given of its being quite otherways  but then this clause coming in upon the neck of that surmise it was thought a popular argument and indeed was so and the people began to be very uneasy about it said the parliament would give up all to the english that this was so fair a thing it could not be argued against and indeed a great many people looked upon the thing viz taking of the english test as what they wished earnestly enough to have done but the more penetrating judgments saw further into the depth of this and finding it a design purely strikeing at the root of the union they were the rather inclined to drop it though they at the same time desired it  the difficulty lying in this that the sacramental test being a thing the english parliament have been very tenacious of upon all occasions this would be to ask something which they knew would not be granted and consequently put the treaty to a stop  others again proposed a reciprocal test to be placed in scotland to secure or exclude all such of the english nation as would not acknowledge this church etc the tenor of this was according to the following copy which they called a formula  i a b do swear and declare that the presbyterian government of this church is a lawful government and that i shall neither directly nor indirectly do any thing to the alteration thereof  but this also dropped of it self for some people that were nevertheless against the union yet were against this sort of reciprocal oath as a thing they did not approve on any account one or other  there were some small amendments to the fifth and sixth clause but not of consequence and thus this difficult matter was past into a law  there were some who clamoured very much on this head and a great many personal reflections were made i will not say altogether without cause viz that the church was abandoned by her own friends or at least by those who pretended to be so that if they had asked more it might have been obtained and that the demands the ministers made were not duly weighed much less answered but yet it seems on the whole that the main foundation article viz the establishment of the church government unalterable was effectually secured and though some particulars might be omitted the church has no open place left at which her enemies can wound her constitution  there were great clamours raised both within and without the house about the insufficiency of this act of security as that it was lessening the security the church already had by the claim of right and not providing an equivalent security in the room of it that the very treating of it employed a further security was needful and yet no further security was provided than alone confirming the claim of right  this was the foundation of the proposal of the reciprocal test or an oath to secure the church of scotland in like manner as the test act is for the security of the church of england of which above  another objection was that though indeed the act of william and mary was confirmed yet that the act declaring it to be high treason to impugn the claim of right was not confirmed nor the other acts relating thereto specified  nor some ancient obsolete acts taken away which stand unrepealed and which are inconsistent with presbyterian government  this was answered particularly as to enumerating the acts as above and as to repealing the acts the twenty fifth article of the union declares all acts contraveening this treaty to be so far as they do so contraveen this treaty ipso facto repealed etc  again it was objected that here was no provision made for prevention of mischief to the church for want of a commission or court for plantation of kirks and valuation of teinds which is what the church will be in great want of  this was effectually answered by settling an act of parliament previous to the union for the plantation of kirks and valuation of teinds impowering the lords of council and session to judge cognosce and determine in all affairs and causes whatsoever which by the laws and acts of parliament of this kingdom were formerly referred to and did pertain and belong to the jurisdiction and cognizance of the commissioners formerly appointed for that effect as fully and freely in all respects as the said lords do or may in other civil causes  the great and main objections were against the possibility of either church or state being secured so by this treaty as that a british parliament might not overwhelm it again by plurality of voices which is a supposed consent  this as the same with the general objection against the union was answered in the general terms of the union viz that this was to remain unalterable for ever and therefore could not be supposed to be temporary  upon the debate of these things its plain what i have so often alleged on these gentlemen and which therefore is not putting it as my opinion which i am not at all forward to offer to the world but it appears that the objection of the gentlemen did not so much ly against particular clauses though they thought fit to dispute their ground by inches there too but this objection lay against the general head the union and they brought every head as they went through them to shock directly with the whole treaty  thus in the protest given in here by the lords dissenting it is expressly said that the church of scotland can have no real and solid security by any manner of union etc  as per the minute  also it is to be noted here that the gentlemen of that side were the first who moved to print the names of all those that voted to the first article pro and con which was thought at that time a day an exposing the persons to the popular resentment the tumults of the people beginning to be at that time very high  but the other party who had agreed voluntarily to the said printing of names took the advantage now and moved that the same might be done also in the vote about the church by which the episcopal party were brought in protesting in behalf of the church the gentlemen would have avoided it but having been the first in putting the like upon the other they could not shun it this exposed them very much and opened the eyes of many of the people when they saw such people voting for the church who never owned the church in their lives and others voting against the thing who were constant members of the church and had given constant proof of their zeal for the churches advantage  and thus the act of security was past and after engrossed into the body of the articles as will appear by the act

or not and it carried approve  and the lord high chancellor was allowed to have his name printed and recorded as an approver as also to be recorded and printed amongst those who voted proceed to the second article the last sederunt  adjourned till monday next at ten of the clock  observation xxi the debates of this day made yet a larger discovery of the affair and the gentlemen who were against the union struggling on all occasions against the going on of the articles took now a new measure  the marquess of an  dale made this motion for the succession as appeared by the lord beilhavens speech there had been a party of gentlemen as was before observed who were always for the succession with limitations but were opposed by others who were entirely against the succession at all as it respected the house of hannover but as several people differing in their other sentiments yet joined in their opposing the union so here the strongest opposers of the succession came now into the thing they had so long opposed and moved now for the succession with limitations in order to avoid the union  my lord beilhaven seconded this with another speech which was afterward printed in which his lordship moved for settling the succession upon the princess sophia of hannover etc i have printed this speech the rather because it is really the substance or recital of three speeches as will be seen in the particulars of it and shows plainer than i can otherways express how that part was acted my lord chancellor  your lordship may remember the last day when we had under consideration whether to proceed to the fourth or second article that i did witness my concern and resentment to find so many honorable and worthy members of this house so forward to finish the demands of england in this treaty without taking notice of any one article that could be properly said to relate to the demands of scotland  now that we are entered upon the second article i desire to be resolved in one qvestion what are the motives that should engage us to take england s successor upon their own terms is it not strange that no answer should be given to this question save that when you come to consider the rest of the articles you shall be satisfied on that demand this is a new way of arguing my lord a method without precedent ranversing nature and looks more like design than fairdealing i profess i think the huge and prodigious rains that we have had of late have either drowned out or found out another channel for reasoning than what was formerly for by what i can see by this new method the agreeing to the first article shall be found a sufficient reason why we should agree to the second and the agreeing to the second for the third and so for all  if there was ever such a farce acted if ever reason was hudibrasd this is the time consult all the treaties since the beginning of the world to this day and if you can find any one precedent i shall yield the cause  i shall instance my lord one for all and that is the first and worst treaty that ever was set on foot for mankind and yet i am sorry to say it there appears more ingenuity in it than in our procedure when the serpent did deceive our mother eve he proposed three advantages before he presumed to advise her to to eat the forbidden fruit the first was taken from the sight the second from the taste and the third from the advantage following thereupon that from the sight was enforced by a behold how lovely and comely a thing it is it is pleasant to the eye that from the taste from a persuasion that it was good for nourishment it is good for food that from the advantage it will make you wise ye shall be as the gods therefore upon all these considerations eat  allow me my lord to run the parallel of this with relation to our procedure in this treaty  upon the first account that our nation had of the treatys being finished betwixt the two nations people appeared all generally very well satisfied as a thing that would tend to the removal of all jealousies and the settling a good understanding betwixt the two kingdoms but so soon as the articles of the treaty appeared in print the very sight of them made such a change as is almost inconceivable they were so far from being pleasant to the eye my lord that the nation appears to abhor them  one would think my lord that it had been the interest of those who are satisfied with the thing to have gone immediately into the merits of these particular articles which relate to scotland and to have said gentlemen be not affrighted with their ugly shape they are better than they are bonny come taste come make a narrow search and inquiry they are good for scotland the wholesomest food that a decaying nation can take you shall find the advantages you shall find a change of condition you shall become rich immediately you shall be like the english the most flourishing and richest people of the universe  but our procedure my lord has been very far from the prudence of the serpent for all our arguments have run upon this blunt topic eat swallow down this incorporating union tho it please neither eye nor taste it must go over you must believe your physicians and we shall consider the reasons for it afterward  i wish my lord that our loss be not in some small manner proportionable to that of our first parents they thought to have been incorporate with the gods but in place of that they were justly expelled paradise lost their sovereignty over the creatures and were forced to earn their bread with the sweat of their brows  my lord chancellor i have heard a proposal made from the other side by the marquis of annandale that in place of agreeing to this second article wherein the succession is to be declared as a consequence of our being united to england in one kingdom we should immediately go to intail our crown upon the illustrious family of hannover upon such conditions and limitations as are in our own power to make for the security of our sacred and civil concerns i think this is the import of what his lordship gave in by a resolve formerly and has told this honorable house that he thinks he acts consequentially to his former declared principles and that this is now the only measure which can settle and secure the peace and quiet of this nation and fix a firm security for the protestant interest and a perfect understanding betwixt the two nations  i have also heard a discourse by his grace the duke of hamilton showing that ever since his grace had the honor to be a member of this honorable house he had made it his business to serve the sovereign and his nation faithfully and honestly without any byends byviews or selfinterests that before the affair of the succession was tabled in scotland he had endeavored to promote the interest of his nation by good laws and by the best counsels he was capable to give for rectifying things amiss and advancing the solid interest of his country that since the affair of the succession came to be considered he could never give himself the liberty to believe but that previous to any settlement we ought to have had such condescensions with relation to trade and commerce from england as might retrieve the losses the nation has sustained from them ever since the union of the two crowns under one sovereign and that thereupon to prevent all faction and party in the treating of an affair of such importance he had freely left the nomination of the lords commissioners to her majesty and wishes the choice had been answerable to his design but none can accuse him as bargaining for himself since he has no reason to complain of the breach of any stipulation upon that head that now having considered the articles of this treaty lying before us and the fatal consequences that may follow upon the finishing of an incorporating union with england with the general aversation that appears by the addresses from the several shires of the kingdom and particularly from the address of the commission of the general assembly and of the royal burrows of scotland he finds it necessary to alter his thoughts of that matter that he was none of these who loved to keep things loose and in confusion he had an estate in both kingdoms and therefore it was not to be supposed he would make use only of a treaty to throw out the succession one time and of the succession to throw off the treaty another time therefore to prevent worse consequences he is content that in this parliament the succession be declared and settled upon the illustrious princess sophia electoress of hannover and the heirs of her body upon such conditions and limitations as shall be found necessary by this parliament to secure our civil rights and liberties the independency and sovereignty of the nation and the presbyterian government of this church as it is founded upon the claim of right and established by law and whose privileges and settlement he resolves to support with the outmost of his power  and therefore his grace thinks himself obliged with all humility in this present juncture of affairs to address himself particularly to his grace my lord commissioner and to beg of his grace that he would be pleased to acquaint her majesty with the true state of the nation and with the proposal made for allaying the present ferment and settling a solid peace and good understanding betwixt her two kingdoms and that a small recess may be granted in the mean time till her majestys gracious answer come which with all submission he conceives will prevent these bad consequences that the further pushing on of this treaty may occasion i think my lord this is materially what his grace said though not so fully nor so well expressed  now my lord it remains that i give account of my self and of my own opinion of this affair all who know me my lord know that i have been from the beginning on a revolution foot i ventured my life and fortune with the first and i have ever since acted consequentially to my principle it is true i was never a good courtier under any reign because i had a rule for my obedience and never made obedience my rule my reputation was never stained nor had i ever any reproach laid upon me save when i was brought in head over ears in a scots plot a plot very well known designed to blast the reputation of a set of people the best affected to the sovereign and to the true interest of their nation that ever scotland bred what my opinion was with relation to the succession is very well known also i looked upon limitations with another eye than some others were pleased to do i was far from treating them in ridicule because as all human affairs they are liable to alterations and might be taken off that argument proves too much and consequently proves nothing at all should a man refuse to have a good estate settled upon him because he may squander it away and become bankrupt must a good law be refused because it may afterward be repealed no my lord where the power is lodged in our selves we have all human security imaginable for the thing it is not so where the power is lodged in others therefore i shall alwise choose that security which depends upon my self preferable to any other  this my lord has confirmed me that limitations of our own making is the best security tho i alwise thought them not the full of what we merited for the going into the english succession for considering the injuries that we have received from them we ought to have reparation upon this emergent and i think without incorporating with them they might have given us some small encouragement in our trade with them which would have been profitable unto us and no manner of way prejudicial unto them as i can clearly demonstrate if there be occasion for it but since this is not the proper place nor season for such proposals i shall go in with the proposal made by the marquis of annandale and fortified by his grace the duke of hamilton because i think it is the best that we can make of it at this time the fittest measure to prevent civil wars allay the ferment of the nation and far preferable to this incorporating union which as to us in all it is clauses appears to be most unreasonable    this was a politic speech there appeared some ill nature in it and a great deal of satyr upon the union but that was the temper of the times and must be past over on that account nor shall i say any thing to it here the noble person that made it acquiesced in the union freely enough when it was made as shall appear in its place  but i can not pass it over without observing that  this speech gives light into several things first it gives a hint at the suggestion that had been made of d  h  s aiming at his own title in all his former opposition made against the succession as well formerly as now and clears that noble person from all supposition of such a thing by his having offered now to come into the succession  secondly it gives a true sight of the genuine reason of all this sudden compliance with the succession a thing which had something very surprising in it and which some thought must have presently carried abundance of people from the other party the design being as was afterward publicly owned if possible to evade the passing this article as a branch of the union the case was they were content with the succession as an act of the parliament of scotland settled and established in the form necessary in that case but they would not have the succession brought upon them as the consequence of the union  and at last they had this at the bottom of it all that if the succession had been taken as it was now offered it must have been taken in stead of the union and that had answered the present occasion viz diverting the grand affair of the union  but they met with a double disappointment in this first as to offering the succession in stead of the union they came too late since the party who were for the succession formerly with limitations were now come into the union as the best scheme of limitations they could ever hope to attain and would not go back finding the union a better scheme of limitation than their own because it entitled them to all the limitations already settled in england which they could not but allow were more and better than any they had proposed in scotland or than indeed they could expect to obtain  secondly they were disappointed in the way for the jacobites who held with them before in opposing the union broke with them here since they found themselves abandoned by them in the main article for which they opposed the union viz the transposing the crown as they called it from the son of the late king james and if they were obliged to quite the article of the succession the rest was indifferent to them  and therefore you find the protest at the end of the vote of this day was directly against the union though it was put in the usual form of the former article of limitations so these things did but increase the division and weaken the party that opposed the union and by that means gave the more room for those who were for the union to carry it and thus the second article past which concluded the settlement of the protestant succession and it was to be observed that the settling this article was very satisfactory to abundance of people who were otherwise not very well reconciled to the treaty and gave a handle to the friends of the union to bring some people to a clearer sight of their interest since they might see the union was the readiest way and perhaps the only way to obtain the protestant succession and to secure it upon the firmest foundation and on the best limitations a thing which had been long wished and very much struggled for before  minute xxii monday    november   0  prayers said  rolls called  then the following addresses were given in and read viz address of barons freeholders and others within the stewartry of kirkcudbright subscribing the same address of heretors and householders of the paroch of crawford subscribers of the same address of heretors and householders of the paroch of crawfordjohn subscribing the same address of the magistrates dean of guild thesaurer guild council deacons of trades members of the town council of the burgh of couper in fife and others gildry trades and burgesses of the said burgh subscribers of the same address of the presbytery of lanerk subscribing the same and an address of heretors elders and masters of families in the town and out paroch of lanerk subscribers of the same all against an union with england in the terms of the articles  thereafter the third article of union was again read  whereupon it was moved that the agreeing to the third article of the treaty in relation to the parliament of great britain shall not be binding or have any effect unless terms and conditions of an union of the two kingdoms and particularly the constitution of the said parliament be finally adjusted and concluded and an act pass thereupon in this present parliament and that the said terms and conditions be also agreed to and ratified by an act of the parliament of england the constitution of the said parliament of great britain being left entire until the parliament come upon the twenty second article  moved also to proceed to the consideration of the fourth and other articles of union before the third  and after some reasoning thereupon it was put to the vote proceed to the consideration of the third article in the terms of the above motion relating thereto or proceed to the fourth article and it carried proceed to the third  and accordingly the parliament proceeded to the consideration of the third article and after long debate thereupon a vote was stated approve of the third article in the terms of the above motion relating thereto yea or not  but before voting the marquess of annandale gave in a protest upon the foot of his former resolve presented to this house and contained in the minute of the  th of november instant and craved that the narrative thereof might be prefixed thereto and which narrative and protest is as follows viz whereas it evidently appears since the printing publishing and considering of the articles of treaty now before this house this nation seems generally averse to this incorporating union in the terms now before us as subversive of the sovereignty fundamental constitution and claim of right of this kingdom and as threatening ruin to this church as by law established  and since it is plain that if an union were agreed to in those terms by this parliament and accepted of by the parliament of england it would in no sort answer the peaceable and friendly ends proposed by an union but would on the contrair create such dismal distractions and animosities amongst our selves and such jealousies and mistakes betwixt us and our neighbors as would involve these nations into fatal breaches and confusions  therefore i do protest for my self and in name of all those who shall adhere to this my protestation that an incorporating union of the crown and kingdom of scotland with the crown and kingdom of england and that both nations shall be represented by one and the same parliament as contained in the articles of the treaty of union is contrair to the honor interest fundamental laws and constitutions of this kingdom is a giving up of the sovereignty the birthright of the peers the rights and privileges of the barons and burrows as is contrair to the claim of right property and liberty of the subjects and third act of her majestys parliament   0  by which it is declared high treason in any of the subjects of this kingdom to quarrel or endeavor by writting malicious and advised speaking or other open act or deed to alter or innovate the claim of right or any article thereof as also that the subjects of this kingdom by surrendering their parliaments and sovereignty are deprived of all security both with respect to such rights as are by the intended treaty stipulated and agreed and with respect to such other rights both ecclesiastic and civil as are by the same treaty pretended to be reserved to them and therefore i do protest that this shall not prejudge the being of future scots parliaments and conventions within the kingdom of scotland at no time coming  after reading whereof he took instruments thereupon and it was agreed that at calling the rolls the adherers to the above protest should be so marked and also that the hail members be marked as they shall vote approve or not and that a list of their names as they shall vote pro or con shall be printed and the lord chancellor was allowed to have his name printed and recorded as an approver  then the vote was put approve of the third article in the terms of the motion relating thereto or not and it carried approve  and the dukes of hamilton and athole the earls of

carruthers george home john baine and mr robert frazer adhered to the protest given in by the marquess of annandale  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation xxii the parliament were all this while debating the generals of the treaty and therefore the debates were also in general the work of this day was not at all debating what number of members should be the proportion of the parliament or how or in what manner they should be chosen and the like but whether britain as now to be united should be represented by one and the same parliament yea or no  the debates were very long upon this head and as in other cases it had for some days taken up part of their time in reading the long addresses of shires burghs and parishes against the union so on this day there were some very particular ones reserved and which seemed to be calculated for the day in which according to the popular arguments of the time the union was called a surrendering the sovereignty of scotland to the english  i could never indeed see any schemes offered or learn that there was any such proposal in what manner those that were for reserving the parliament of scotland would have formed two separate parliaments in an united kingdom so that the debates of this day were not of what should be but of what should not be and the uniting the parliament was objected against but without offering an alternative of what they would have in the room of it  the principal arguments made use of in this days debate were   that uniting the parliament was actually giving up the constitution of scotland   that it was subjecting scotland to england   that it was dangerous to the church of scotland whose government was to be subjected to a parliament of episcopal members   that it was contrary to the national oath or covenant   it is not my design to make arguments of my own in order to answer them or to make this history a dispute instead of a relation of fact  but there having been such loud clamours against the union in general and such violent struggles against it in parliament it may not be inconsistent with an history to relate the foundation on either side which they acted upon and as much of the argument on both sides either within the house or without as is useful to let the reader into a true understanding of the transactions of this critical time and for this reason i have divided this part into the minutes and observations the one is perfectly historical the other explanatory of the particulars and i hope i need make no more apology for the method   st it was alleged that this conjunction of parliaments was a giving up the constitution or as it was frequently worded in their printed addresses surrendering the sovereignty and independency of scotland it was answered this was from a defect in the common acceptance of the word union as it was now treating of and of its full extent  of the unions being centeral and universal in which it was alleged that the union now treating of was in the utmost possible meaning of the word comprehensive of every good to both exclusive of all manner of preference or disparity of parts abhorring all things injurious or diminishing to either a full coalition a general incorporation of nations of interests of power and of safety  a sameness of circumstances and of sympathies becoming one and the same body with one and the same head life soul nutriment point and period an union of the very soul of the nation all its constitution customs trade and manners must be blended together digested and concocted for the mutual united undistinguished good growth and health of the one whole united body and that all the suggestions of subjecting or surrendering one part to another were owing to the want of a right conception both of the terms and of the thing designed by the term union it was urged further that this extended signification of the union excluded all possibility of a separation of interests or clashing of properties and that mutual protection mutual increase mutual improvements were the consequences to be expected not from this or that circumstance policy or management but from the nature of the thing   one may be sure these things were warmly argued within doors when without the people were in the utmost fermentation and the whole nation seemed as in an agony the enemies of the union went about bemoaning scotland and sighing as they called it for the dying constitution and a noble lord within standing up to make a speech on this occasion but being stopped by the order of the day said mournfully it was hard he could not be allowed to speak one word for their dying country  these and the like speeches had put the people in the last degree of concern  the capital arguments made use of on this occasion and made popular against the uniting the parliaments were such as these   that whatever agreement is now concluded between the two kingdoms will never be binding to the new parliament   that the two kingdoms effectually subject themselves to the new parliament all the conditions stipulated on either side to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding   to this it was answered that the british parliament were absolutely bound up by the stipulations of this reaty that they being a subsequent power to the two respective parliaments of either kingdom had no other or further power to act than was limited them by the stipulations of both kingdoms that all subsequent power is inferior in its extent to the power which it derives from that the parliament of britain being the creature of the union formed by express stipulations between the two separate parliaments of england and scotland cannot but be unalterably bound by the conditions so stipulated and upon which it received its being name and authority the foundation of a british parliament is this treaty to say they will not be bound by it is to say they will pull themselves up by the roots they dye when the union receives any mortal wound they cannot infringe one article of the union they cannot put a question in the house upon any one article  as to the objection that there was a surrender of sovereignty and constitution and delivering scotland bound hand and foot into the absolute dispose of the english  this was answered by way of question and answer among other things thus  q what is it constitutes the parliament of britain  a the union let any man give another answer to it if he can  q how is it constituted  a by treaty between two nations by their heads and representatives viz the queen and parliament of each kingdom  q how do they bring it to pass  a by mutual altering their respective constitutions and forming one general constitution upon a treaty of equalities and equivalents the stipulations of which treaty are agreed to by the constituent parts of the subsequent body  q upon what right does the present respective parliaments depend  a the natural right of the freeholders of both kingdoms which entitles them by the possession of their lands to have the free exercise and power of making the laws by which they are to be governed  q does this new constitution destroy that right  a not at all but reserving that right which indeed it cannot destroy agrees to limit the exercise of it by such and such forms and on such and such conditions which conditions are the limitations of the power of the new parliament as being the act and deed of the old parliaments whose constitution was founded on original right  the next popular argument and which took up much of the debates of this day was that the parliament had not a power to it into this union or as it was worded in the public addresses that it is not in the power of the scots government to conclude such an union without a manifest violation of trust and without doing a manifest act of injustice oppression and usurpation against the fundamental rights and liberties of this free kingdom and this was the substance of most of the addresses presented to the parliament  this was answered by enquiring into the right parliaments had to lessen enlarge or limit the representative of which when the number of members comes to be treated of  the last argument and which indeed was made more use of without doors than within was the danger to the church government of scotland by the uniting the representative in which it was argued   that the british parliament being chiefly composed of persons of another communion might when ever they pleased by a majority of votes overpowering the scots overthrow their church introduce episcopacy and reduce the presbyterians to a toleration or perhaps worse   that there being twenty six english bishops sitting in the house of peers and who were by this treaty to continue sitting there this was subjecting scotland in all its future laws to the suffrage of bishops and by consenting to the treaty in which they were established it was recognizing and establishing episcopacy which was to involve the kingdom of scotland in national perjury they being obliged by the national covenant never to subject themselves to episcopacy but to their power to reform the churches of both kingdoms   these suggestions indeed had but too much success abroad and were the principal subject of the several addresses some of which the reader may see in the appendix as a sample of the rest  the arguments had their particular answers too long to insert here and are touched in another part of this work the general answer is contained in the former paragraphs viz the obligation of the future parliament to the exact observation of the treaty in which the security of the church of scotland was particularly provided for and left unalterable for ever  a security so firm as the church of scotland never enjoyed before from any civil government or humane authority in the world  as to the objection about the covenant it was indeed mentioned in most of the addresses but it was never mentioned in parliament at all or at least not so as to come to any debate or to put any question upon it and therefore i refer it to its proper place  there were several long speeches made on this article some to show that it was not in their power to vote upon it at all without consulting constituents that the parliament was a fundamental of government and could not be so much as altered much less given up  and that this treaty was an entire surrender of the constitution it would take up too much room in this work to repeat all the arguments brought on this head or to insert the speeches that were made much more to collect the arguments brought by way of answer  but as the following speech was made on this day and seems to be a full answer to the main of these objections i could not omit it as it was spoken by a gentleman eminently concerned both in the present debate and in the treaty at london  a speech in parliament spoken by mr seton junior of pitmedden november      0  upon the subject of the third article then being in debate in the house my lord chancellor having heard with much attention the third article debated i find it liable with the other articles of this treaty to be put in a false or true light by the speakers to it in proportion to those notions they have of the nature of this union what i am to say concerning it shall be to remove some objections which in my opinion is the proper method to smooth the way for approving it  the principal objections are that the representatives for shires and burghs cannot legally approve this article without the assent of their constituents and that by the approbation of it the sovereignty and independency of this kingdom will be surrendered to england  my lord to give a distinct and convincing answer to the first objection let us look a little to the nature of our constitution of government  our government is not a polish aristocracy founded on pacta conventa whereby all the gentry are empowered in their particular meetings to prescribe rules to their representatives in a general diet  our government is not a common democracy whereby every subject of scotland may claim a vote in the legislature  our government is and has been many ages past a limited monarchy wherein the sovereign and representative are the only judges of every thing which does contribute to the happiness of the body politic and from whom no appeal can legally be made and this description is agreeable to reason to our law and to our history  reason teaches us that anarchy is destructive to mankind and that no society of people can be well governed without a supreme power whose proceedings are only alterable by it self grotius says l   c     that we call the supreme power whose acts are not subject to the power of another  our law is positive that this supreme court is subject to no humane authority act   0 p   j   and we learn from our history that the greatest alrerations have been made in the constitution of our government without consulting the people out of which i humbly offer a few examples in the reign of kenneth the  d the monarchy that originally was elective became hereditary in the reign of james  th the representation of the clergy in parliament was restored in the reign of charles the  d the prerogative was exalted above its natural level and in the year school the king was dethroned and the clergy expelled this house  my lord i have heard asserted that there are fundamentals of government which cannot be altered by this house without the consent of every scotsman but where were these stipulated where are they recorded were these made by our forefathers at the first institution of their government and have all succeeding parliaments sworn to their observance these questions methinks deserve our consideration before it be asserted what is an unalterable fundamental by this house  as to the arguments of sir george mackenzie and other eminent lawyers brought upon the stage to support this notion of fundamentals i think they require no particular answer because any member who understands the nature of government may see clearly that these arguments are founded on roman laws calculated for people as members of private societies and not for perpetual rules to the supreme power of any nation  in fine i believe there are no fundamentals of government in any nation which are not alterable by its supreme power when the circumstances of times require and whoever is acquainted with history may learn that there are no people at present in europe which in different ages have not suffered variety of changes in government i do indeed acknowledge there are fundamentals in nature to wit liberty and property which this house can never destroy without exceeding its outmost bounds of power that are always limited to the public good nevertheless this honorable house is only capable to judge of the most proper means of securing these fundamentals and for my part i sincerely believe that no judicious man will say there is the least danger of our liberty and property by an union of parliaments when he reflects that the people of england have been in all ages noble asserters of the rights of the subject have spent much blood and treasure in defense of the liberties of their neighbors and that after this union encroachments on the rights of the subjects of any part of great britain must endanger the liberty of the whole  my lord i come now to the next objection that by the approbation of this article we surrender the sovereignty and independency of this kingdom  these words i acknowledge are very long and may sound harmoniously in the ears of the populace for my part i would be sorry just now to have occasion to say that in fact our supremacy and independency were surrendered the day king james got possession of the english throne if at the same time i could not affirm that these are again restored to us by this treaty which was managed with a decorum and equality that became two independent and distinct nations and not after such a clandestine manner as was used by queen mary and the french the  th of april      on which day our sovereignty was indeed surrendered as may be seen in the recueil de traitez etc p   0  but to put this question above controversy i conceive two ways only whereby a free nation loses its sovereignty and independency which are conquest and a voluntar surrender of its rights to another nation without any reservation  i am sure no person in right judgment will allege that this intended union is a conquest nor can it be called a surrender seeing the treaty contains certain and distinct reservations to both kingdoms nor can i comprehend how either of two nations by an entire union surrenders its privileges on the contrair i agree with the learned grotius  l   c      who is opinion is that the rights and privileges of two distinct nations united are consolidated into one by a mutual communication of them  another objection my lord has been moved against this article which belongs more properly to the   d article and that is concerning the number of the representatives from scotland to a parliament of great britain this objection i will endeavor to answer in as few words as the nature of it will allow  if both nations are to be represented by one parliament there must be members from both nations and their numbers must be adjusted by some rule which can be no other than that fundamental in the union of all societies whereby suffrages are computed to wit the proportion each society contributes for the support of the whole now the union of scotland and england is but the union of two great societies of people into one body politic so that we have nothing to direct our forming a true notion about the number of the representative agreed to by this treaty on the part of scotland but the proportion we are able to contribute for the support of the gonment of great britain and that has respect to the numbers of our people to the extent of our taxes or to an arithmetical proportion betwixt these and those of england all which being duly considered i may be bold to affirm that the representative agreed to by the commissioners for scotland is more than falls to our share  several authors who have wrote about the nature of society or the union of two or more societies agree to this fundamental and grotius  l   c      has two examples out of strabo relating to it one is when lybica united with three neighboring cities it was stipulated that each of the three was to have one voice but lybica two because it contributed much more to the common benefit than any of the rest the other example is that there were    cities in licia united whereof some had three voices some two and some but one  my lord by the representative of sixteen for the nobility there is no greater hardship put upon them than was put upon the small barons in the reign of king james the first who then were of the same state with the nobility and submitted to the law for convenience  by the representative of forty five for the commons no prejudice is done to the state of barons in respect of representation for if they be represented from every shire or at least from the most considerable shires it is of no import whether every shire be represented by one or more and as to the state of burrows i will presume to say that the retrenchment of their representation is a piece of justice done to this nation if property or taxes be the rule of representation  my lord so far have i endeavored to answer the material objections against this article not out of any prospect to convince the members against this union as to fortify the judgments of those for it and i wish heartily that the constituents for shires and burghs may have a true confidence in their representatives while they are accomplishing this great and noble work of an union of both kingdoms especially considering that they are bound by oath to give their best advices and suffrages that they were chosen by themselves in a free election that they have their families and estates among em that the same liberty property and religion are common to em both and that the good or bad consequences of this union must equally affect representatives and constituents  this speech was received with great satisfaction and applause and the arguments in it were so clear especially as to the proportions of the representative that it was very useful when that head came to be debated and i cannot but think the reader will think his time well bestowed in reading it in that he will see by it whether the union was carried by strength of reasoning or as some alleged crammed down their throats by mere number of voices  the debates held very long but at length the question being proposed the vote was carried with the usual proviso viz that it be of no force if all be not concluded and the dissenting members protested as you will see in the minutes and so this mighty case was also determined  minute xxiii tuesday    november   0  prayers said  rolls called  the lord chancellor acquainted the parliament that last night his grace her majestys high commissioner in his return to the palace was insulted by a number of people of the meanest degree with stones which was an high affront both to her majestys high commissioner and to the parliament and therefore moved that the parliament may give the necessary orders not only to find out such as have been guilty as actors or abettors therein but to prevent the like in time coming and after some reasoning on the said representation and motion  it was agreed to remit to the committee nominate for examining the calculation of the equivalent to enquire into the matter of this insult and to endeavor to find out the actors and abettors if any be with power to the said committee to promise indemnities and rewards for discoveries and to seize and imprison any person whom they shall have ground to suspect to be guilty as actors or abettors and to call for the magistrates and neighbors of edinburgh for information and to report to the parliament what information and discovery they shall make of the said insult or of any former as also to report their opinion what measures may be proper for preventing the like in time coming and the committee appointed to meet the first interval day of parliament at nine of the clock  the parliament did likeways recommend to the lord high constable to prosecute forthwith these persons who were imprisoned on account of a former tumult and ordained the magistrates of edinburgh to furnish what probation they can to the fiscal of the constables court against such as were so imprisoned  address of the baillies counselors and citizens of st andrews subscribers of the same against an union with england in the terms of the articles given in and read  thereafter it was moved that the parliament proceed to the fourth article of union  moved also that before proceeding to the consideration of the fourth article a clause be added to the third article in their terms and that the said parliament of great britain shall meet and sit once in three years at least in that part of great britain now called scotland  and after some debate thereupon the consideration of the said additional clause delayed till the parliament come to the twenty second article  then the fourth article of union was read and after some discourse thereupon the further consideration thereof was delayed till the next sederunt of parliament and the consideration thereof to be then resumed previous to all other business  adjourned till thursday next at ten of the clock  observation xxiii the affairs of tumult and clamor from the street i have related in its proper place yet as far as it came to be considered in parliament i must take notice of it here but shall be the briefer referring to what is said elsewhere  the first rabble had been crushed for some time as has been observed already and the vigilance of the government had secured the parliament hitherto but the inveterate fury of the poor ignorant people imposed upon by the popular arguments of the times and these enlarged upon by the various pamphlets and speeches against the union which were spread amongst them was very hard to be restrained  the duke of queensberry the queens high commissioner received diverse affronts in his going to and from the parliament though his grace did not think worth his while to trouble the parliament with it while it was any thing tolerable but it was now grown to that height that not only the commissioners life was in danger but the public peace seemed manifestly aimed at and it was very necessary to put a check to such insults lest the whole might be endangered  the high commissioner had received several private intimations of designs to assasinate him and several letters some abusive and threatening others pretending to give him caution to preserve his person others directly pretending to inform of the designs the time when manner how and weapons by which he was to be murdered whether these were real designs or only attempts to amuse and perhaps discourage his grace in the discharge of his duty in so weighty a work was i believe never certainly known but whoever will calmly consider the temper of the people at that time how inflamed by the artifice of a party and how frequently they showed their readiness to have undertaken any thing though never so desperate to have broken off this affair will wonder that no agent of satan was found hardened enough to have committed that or any like sort of villainy  nor did it seem that there was any thing wanting but the mere courage to venture their lives in such a bloody action since in the occasion which was now brought before the house it appeared there were stones thrown at the commissioners coach from the tops of houses sufficient to have murdered him if providence had not more especially protected both his person and the affair in hand which had any such villainy been perpetrated would most certainly have all been lost in the necessary confusions that must have followed  for the readers particular information of the temper and humor of the people at that time some of the threatening letters sent to his grace the high commissioner are printed in the appendix n g xx faithfully transcribed from the original  as to the manner of the present insult offered the commissioner  it was thus opportunity was taken upon the length of the debates that day which keeping the house late  and the lord commissioner being to pass the streets in the night the whole length of the city from the parliament house to the palace the mob took the opportunity of the darkness a time proper for such villainies first they affronted the guards and followed them with curses and opprobrious words and their numbers increasing as they went on they began to throw stones at them which occasioned some little disorder among the horses and this at last increased to the throwing stones at the commissioner himself one of which narrowly missed his person  the coachman and postilion whether frighted themselves or that the horses were unruly drove a little faster than usual down the street which put the guards to a full trot and that heartening the rabble as if the guards had fled from them they shouted and continued pursuing them with dirt stones and such sort of violence till they came to the palace where the foot guards received them and kept off the crowd  every body will allow that considers these circumstances which i was an eye witness to that it was time to put a stop to this violence and to restrain a headstrong multitude thus made bold and furious lest they should as in such cases is not uncommon run on to more violent extremes and therefore the lord commissioner ordered the lord chancellor to represent it to the house as in the vote  the motion for the parliament sitting once in three years was needless for that indeed it was settled in the twenty second article for the first parliament and established in england by other laws made there which were to continue in force by the treaty  minute xxiv thursday    november   0  prayers said  rolls called  address of heretors burgesses minister and other inhabitants in the town of pasley subscribers of the same against an union with england in the terms of the articles given in and read  the fourth article of union again read  whereupon it was moved to take the several branches of trade to be communicate into consideration that it may thereby appear how far the communication of trade shall be advantageous and after reasoning thereupon  the vote was stated approve of the fourth article reserving the consideration of the several branches of trade till the parliament come to the subsequent articles yea or not  and it was agreed that the members shall be marked as they shall vote approve or not and that the list of their names as they shall vote pro or con be recorded and printed  then the vote was put approve or not and it carried approve  thereafter the fifth article of union was read whereupon a proposal was given in for explaining and enlarging the same in these terms that all ships or vessels belonging to her majestys subjects of scotland at the time of ratifying the treaty of union of the two kingdoms in the parliament of scotland though foreign built shall be deemed and pass as ships of the build of great britain the owner or where there are more owners one or more of the owners within twelve months after the union making oath that at the time of ratifying the treaty of union in the parliament of scotland the same did in bail or in part belong to him or them or to some other subject or subjects in scotland to be particularly named with the place of their respective abodes and that the same does then at the time of the said deposition wholly belong to him or them and that no foreigner directly or indirectly has any share part or interest therein  which being read it was moved that six months more time be added to the time allowed by the proposal for purchasing ships or vessels and after some reasoning thereupon the further consideration thereof was delayed till next sederunt of parliament to be then resumed previous to all other business  adjourned till saturday next at ten of the clock  observation xxiv this article being general but containing several particulars it was judged proper to pass it in the gross first with a reserve for such clauses and branches of trade as should come into consideration afterward for otherwise these branches of trade would have been foreclosed by agreeing to this article in the full extent of the words  these branches came all to be considered in the debating other articles as particularly when they came to examine the affairs of drawbacks bounties on exportation prohibitions and restrictions in trade the several customs duties equalities and proportions of trade of which in their course  this reserve however made the article it self pass the more readily at this time for it was the first article after voting the generals that was branched out into particulars and therefore the adjourning these particulars was the more acceptable  the debate of the fifth article lay only here the treaters had debated about the time limited for allowing the ships then in the hands of the scots to be free ships the scots commissioners would have had it been the time of ratifying the union the english commissioners insisted on it that it should be the time of signing the treaty and the reasons were good that otherwise people might buy multitudes of foreign ships and have time to furnish themselves and pass these foreign built ships as free bottoms in the terms of the act of navigation to the infinite damage of the whole island and this had the more force with it in that it could not but be allowed that it was the great advantage of this whole island to encourage the building and consequently the employing our own ships  however many popular arguments were used to lengthen out the time such as that scotland was not yet in a condition to build and that this would check her trade to leave her naked of ships till she could furnish her self with materials for building that for the fishing and eastcountry trade it was absolutely necessary to furnish foreign built ships till scotland could build for her self  it was alleged england could furnish ships and it was so material a thing to encourage the building and increase of our own shipping that england would insist upon it and had reason so to do  however after long debating it was agreed to lengthen the term to the ratifying the treaty and this was the first alteration made in the articles  but it was referred to the next day  minute xxv saturday    november   0  prayers said  rolls called  then the following addresses were given in and read viz address of heretors and several other persons in the barony paroch of glasgow subscribers of the same address of heretors magistrates town council and other inhabitants within the town and paroch of culross in perth shire and heretors elders and other inhabitants within the parochines of saline carnock and torie in fife shire subscribing the same address of the provost baillies town council and other inhabitants of the burgh of stirling subscribing the same address of barons freeholders and others within the stewartry of annandale subscribing the same and address of the magistrates town council guildbrethren deacons of crafts and other burgesses tradesmen and inhabitants within the burgh of innerkeithing subscribers of the same all against an union with england in the terms of the articles  thereafter the fifth article of union again read with the proposal for amending explaining and enlarging the same insert in the former days minutes and altered thus viz that all ships or vessels belonging to her majestys subjects of scotland at the time of ratifying the treaty of union of the two kingdoms in the parliament of scotland tho foreign built be deemed and pass as ships of the build of great britain the owners or where there are more owners one or more of the owners within twelve months after the first day of may next making oath that at the time of ratifying the treaty of union in the parliament of scotland the same did in hail or in part belong to him or them or to some other subject or subjects of scotland to be particularly named with the place of their respective abodes and that the same does then at the time of the said deposition wholly belong to him or them and that no foreigner directly or indirectly has any share part or interest therein  and after some reasoning thereon there was a second proposal given in for the amending the article in these terms that all ships and vessels belonging to her majestys subjects of scotland at the time of ratifying the treaty of union of the two kingdoms in the parliaments of both kingdoms  and after some debate the vote was stated approve of the first paragraph of the fifth article with the first amendment or second and it carried approve with the first amendment  thereafter the rest of the said fifth article of union was read and a proposal given in for adding a clause in these terms that for the space of seven years from and after the concluding the treaty of union in both kingdoms it is expressly agreed that none of the seamen or mariners aboard any of the ships belonging to the subjects of that part of united britain now called scotland shall either at home or abroad be pressed from aboard their said ships to serve in any of her majestys ships of war or friggots and in case after the said seven years it shall happen that there be a levy of seamen in united britain for serving in the british fleet that the said part of united britain now called scotland shall only be burdened with such a proportion as our taxes bear in proportion to that part of united britain now called england but prejudice to the officers of her majestys ships or fleet to engage as many voluntar seamen in their service as they can agree with in this part of united britain and this article to be unalterable by any subsequent british parliament  which being read after some reasoning thereupon it was put to the vote add the second clause or not and it carried not  thereafter the rest of the said fifth article being again read the vote was put approve thereof or not and it carried approve  adjourned till tuesday next at ten of the clock  observation xxv the debate about the admitting the scots ships as free bottoms was now reassumed and the time limited for the properties to be made out was altered from the time of signing the articles to the time of ratifying the treaty  the present dispute was whether it should be the time of ratifying the treaty in scotland or the ratification in both kingdoms  this article was disputed by inches and some thought there was more nicety used here than was of any signification and that therefore it seemed the effect of a general struggle against the union where every thing was laid hold on that either might bring on some alteration they thought england could not comply with or that at least might but cause a dispute in england or that might so gain time as to avoid having the thing completed in the then sitting parliament  it was well known the english would be very tender of their act of navigation which is the security of their trade and the main encourager of their shipping and the longer this liberty of purchasing ships from the dutch was extended the more room there would be for exceptions in england their trade being the more exposed to the bringing in foreign bottoms among them  and if it be true as i have seen a minute made of it in writing  that the party had prepared schemes of objections to be offered in the parliament of england against the very alterations which they themselves had procured to be made in scotland if this be true it will abundantly justify the general supposition i have so often hinted at viz that these objections were rather calculated to delay the treaty and overthrow the union it self than from any particular regard had to the reason and nature of the thing objected  nothing else could be the occasion of such strong struggles for things in themselves not of any great advantage to scotland as in this case of the ships of which it may be noted that after that matter was settled it was hardly known that one ship was bought either in scotland or england with the design of making it free as was suggested  however after long debate the middle course was taken and the time was extended from the time of signing the articles as it was agreed in london to the time of ratification in the parliament of scotland  but not to the time of ratification in both parliaments as was proposed  the last proposal against pressing of seamen was a manifest attempt of the kind above mentioned and a seeking an occasion to interrupt the main treaty since no body could imagine that such a clause could have passed in england all their own seamen having been liable to be pressed into the service of the navy and both nations being to enjoy equal privileges this had been to put such a disadvantage and such inequalities upon the english as would have made just complaints in england and have been a sufficient obstacle to the whole especially when it was remembered that in scotland there was no want of seamen but that on the contrary many thousands of their seamen for want of employment entered themselves on board the men of war in foreign service with the danes swedes and hollanders and it would be hard that they should seek a liberty from the english service which would now be their own and at the same time for want of business seek service among foreigners it being alleged that at this time there were   000 scots sailers in the dutch service  this was so plain a case that the proposal was rejected and the article passed with only the first amendment  and this was the second alteration in the articles of the union  minute xxvi tuesday    november   0  prayers said  rolls called  then the following addresses were given in and read viz address of barons freeholders and others within the sheriffdom of roxburgh subscribers of the same address of the magistrates town council and other inhabitants of the burgh of annan subscribing the same address of the magistrates town council and others inhabitants of the burgh of lochmabben subscribers of the same and an address of the paroch of lesmahago subscribers of the same all against an union with england in the terms of the articles  thereafter an overture for an act for encouraging the exportation of victual read and ordered to be printed  as also another overture for an act for encouraging the export of victual fishes beef and pork was given in and ordered to be printed  thereafter a petition and draught of an act in favors of the burgh of dundee for an imposition of two pennies scots upon the pint of all ale and beer brown and vended within the bounds and for the ends thereinmentioned both read and a first reading ordered to be marked on the act  as also a petition of the magistrates town council and community of the burgh of aberdeen and a draught of an act in their favors for continuing an imposition on wine and ale granted to them by a former act read and a first reading ordered to be marked on the act  as also the following draughts of acts were given in and read viz act in favors of the burgh of kirkaldie act in favors of the town of borrowstounness act in favors of the burgh of dysert act in favors of the burgh of burntisland act in favors of the burgh of st andrews act in favors of the burgh of kinghorn act in favors of the burgh of elgin all for an imposition of two pennies scots upon the pint of all ale and beer to be brown and vended within the respective bounds and for the ends thereinmentioned and a first reading ordered to be marked upon each of the said acts  then the sixth article of union was read and after some reasoning thereon there was a proposal given in for adding the following clause to the end of the sixth article viz except in so far as shall be rectified by this parliament upon the consideration of the subsequent articles  which being read and discoursed upon there was another proposal given in for enlarging and explaining the said sixth article in these terms viz and seeing by the laws of england now standing there are rewards granted upon the exportation of certain kinds of grain wherein oats is not specified that from and after the union when oats shall be at fifteen shillings per quarter or under there shall be paid two shillings and six pence for every quarter of oat meal exported in the terms of the laws whereby rewards are granted for exportation of other grains and in respect there is a duty upon oats imported into england but no duty upon oat meal the importing of which is a prejudice and discouragement to tillage therefore that from and after the union the quarter of oat meal be deemed equal to three quarters of oats and pay duty accordingly when imported to scotland from any place whatever beyond the sea  which being likeways read after some further reasoning it was moved that the observations in relation to the balance of the trade of this nation made by the council of trade should be laid before the parliament  and after debate thereupon the further consideration of the said sixth article and motions was delayed till the next sederunt of parliament to be then resumed previous to all other business and ordered that the observations made by the council of trade be then laid before the parliament  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation xxvi the sixth article of course began the debates about allowances drawbacks prohibitions and restrictions which as has been observed were to be equal to all the subjects  but scotland finding some difference in the value and frequency of import or export of grain they found a necessity to come into some amendments here too the case was thus  england allowed a bounty to the exporter of corn at all times when the plenty of grain kept the price under such a stated rate but it was observed there was no bounty on the exportation of oats the reason was because england rather wanted oats than had them to spare one season with another  on the other hand scotland producing vast quantities of oats and having a large trade for the exporting the same to norway and other parts the scots members insisted that a drawback should be allowed on oats and oat meal exported  another case also required an alteration and this respected ireland which bordering on scotland could and might easily throw in great quantities of oats or oat meal into scotland which being cheap in ireland would lessen the consumption of the growth of scotland there was it seems a prohibition formerly laid on the importation of oats or oat meal but this being taken off by the union it was requisite to make some provision where the english laws was defective which was thus  the english had by act of parliament a duty of five shillings six pence per quarter laid upon all oats imported and that they thought was sufficient but there being no more duty on oat meal than on oats it was alleged that the irish might import the oat meal and afford to pay the duty since it was not above half the value of the duty of oats the value of the meal reducing the duty  this therefore was provided against by this additional clause which doubled the duty upon oat meal imported by reckoning every quarter of oat meal as two quarters of oats  the acts in favors of the respective burghs were in order to continue to them the several impositions on ale and wine customary in scotland or granting them anew being generally granted for the public uses of the towns such as building or maintaining public edifices harbors etc just as has been practiced in england in the duties on coals as at london for building the churches at yarmouth for their pier or on ships as at dover for the repair of their harbor and the like and this being the last parliament to sit in scotland if the union succeeded and all private rights being made perpetual or to continue to the times they were entailed for this made the towns the more solicitous to have acts passed in their favors at this time the excise upon liquors payable to private hands indeed was a novelty in england and seemed to be a very odd request at this time that while on one hand they should be pleading that scotland could not pay more excise on their liquor than they did before at the same time they should on the other hand be seeking an additional duty to be paid to the burghs  but the duty being so small as two pennies scots which is but of a penny on the pint scots which is two quarts english it was generally agreed to and principally forth at it was not extended all over the kingdom but only in the few towns that having public trade to support and chargeable works to maintain seemed to have extraordinary reasons to demand it  minute xxvii wednesday    november   0  prayers said  rolls called  address of barons freeholders and others within the shire of midlothian subscribing the same against an union with england in the terms of the articles given in and read  the sixth article of union again read and a proposal given in for adding the word drawbacks to both clauses of the said article which was agreed to  and the said article as so amended was again read as also the proposal mentioned in the minutes of the last sederunt in relation to oats and oatmeal with the addition of a further clause in these terms and that the beer of scotland have the like rewards and drawbacks as barley  and it was likeways moved that another clause should be added thereto allowing the like proemium or drawback on the exportation of oatmeal as is allowed on the exportation of rye in england and after debate thereupon it was agreed that the sixth article with the proposal for amendments should be remitted to a committee  thereafter there was a clause offered to be added to the said sixth article in these terms viz but scotland for the space of years after the first day of may next shall be free from and no ways subject to the prohibition and restrictions made against exporting of wool skins with wool upon them and woollen yarn which by the oaths of the sellers and buyers shall be made appear to be the proper growth and product of scotland and spun within the same which shall no ways be comprehended under any of the laws already made in england or to be made during the space foresaid  as also a clause in these terms viz excepting and reserving the duties upon export and import of such particular commodities from which any persons the subjects of either kingdom are specially liberated and exempted by their private rights which after the union are to remain safe and entire to them in all respects  and sicklike another clause in these terms viz that after the union all sorts of scots lining or any kind of cloth made of flax or hemp be exported out of the united kingdom free of all customs or other impositions whatsomever  and another in these terms that before the union we may have such a drawback adjusted as may enable us to export beef and pork and butter to the west indies and other foreign parts which will be a considerable branch of our trade after the union  and likeways another clause in these terms that from and after the union all duties or bounty tolls or other exactions upon black cattle or any other product of scotland when carried into england or product of england when carried into scotland payable either to the public or private persons shall in all time coming be void and null  and another clause in these terms that from and after the union the kingdom of scotland shall have liberty for ever to manufacture plaiding fingrams gallowaywhites sarges stockings and all sorts of lining as they have been in use to do conform to the regulations contained in their own laws and to export the same to england or dominions and plantations thereto belonging or to any other place beyond seas free of any duty or imposition whatsomever to be laid thereon but in case any of the subjects of that part of united britain now called scotland shall export any other sort of woollen manufactory than what is abovementioned they are to be liable to the regulations and taxes of england imposed before the union or to be imposed by the british parliament after the union  and it was agreed that all the clauses above insert should be likeways remitted to a committee  whereupon it was moved that the sixth article and proposals and additional clauses relating thereto should be remitted to the committee for examining the calculation of the equivalent which was agreed to  thereafter it was also moved that a further number of the members of each state should be added to the said committee and thereupon a vote was put add or not and it carried add  then it was moved that two of each state be the number to be added and likeways moved that the number of four of each state be added and after some reasoning it was put to the vote two or four and it carried two and the next sederunt of parliament appointed for choising the additional members  then the seventh article of union was read and the reasoning thereupon delayed till the next sederunt of parliament to be then proceeded upon previous to all other business after choising of the additional members for the committee  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation xxvii the observations upon this days minutes will be more properly referred to the time when the committee to whom the sixth article was referred make their report  the amendment of drawbacks was not scrupled it was included before in the word allowances but it was such a triffle that no body would dispute it seeing it contained nothing but what was intended in the article it self  the amendments offered were many and the refering them to a committee was no question the best method to come to a settlement in the several particulars but this may be observed and it was remarkable that such was the ignorance of the objectors in these cases and so much had they been imposed upon in matters of trade that they demanded inconsistent and impracticable things they demanded exemption from imposts which no body paid they demanded liberty where there were no prohibitions and equalities which were already agreed to  for example liberty of exporting wool a thing on which the whole english commerce depended and without a restraint upon which all their manufactures would have been ruined a thing impracticable in the nature of their trade and which it was inconsistent with reason to expect  then they required liberty of exporting linen duty free whereas it was evident had they consulted the english affairs they would have found the english gave that liberty to all the world and if any linen was imported into england whatever duty it paid there was allowed back again upon exportation by certificate  next they demanded liberty to export their woollen goods free of all duties and customs whereas it was known england had long since taken off all duty or custom upon their woollen manufactures for several reasons of trade and for the encouragement of the poor  again they asked freedom of carrying their goods and cattle into england without customs and toll which it was evident without any provision was the consequence of the union and there could no more remain any toll custom or duty on passing and repassing of cattle or goods between england and scotland than there could in either kingdom from one county to another  but this will further appear when the report of the committee comes to be under consideration  minute xxviii thursday    november   0  prayers said  rolls called  then the following addresses were given in and read viz address of heretors and others inhabitants of the paroch of st ninians subscribers of the same and address of the magistrates town council burgesses and other inhabitants of the burgh of dumbar subscribing the same both against an union with england in the terms of the articles  thereafter the parliament conform to the minutes of the last sederunt proceeded to elect the additional members to the committee to whom the sixth article and clauses and proposals relative thereto are remitted and the three estates having separated to their usual places they returned and reported their respective elections of the said additional members as follows viz of the nobility the earls of haddingtoun and cromarty of the commissioners for shires sir gilbert eliot of minto and sir thomas burnet of leyes of the commissioners for burghs sir john areskine and sir peter halket and the committee was appointed to meet in the innersession house to morrow at nine of the clock in the forenoon  then the seventh article of union was again read and after some reasoning a proposal was made for an explanation and addition whereby this nation would be secured against paying more excise for the two penny ale than they now do in these terms that the thirty four gallons english barrel of beer or ale amounting to twelve gallons scots present measure sold in scotland by the brewer at nine shillings six pence sterling excluding all duties and retailed including duties and the retailers profit at two pence the scots pint or eight part of the scots gallon be not after the union liable on account of the present excise upon exciseable liquors in england to any higher imposition than two shillings sterling upon the foresaid thirty four gallons english barrel being twelve gallons the present scots measure  and another clause being likeways offered in these terms and it is hereby specially provided that the two penny ale or beer of scotland shall be only charged with the same excise as the small beer of england  after some debate the vote was stated approve of the seventh article as to the excise of ale and beer with the explanation as contained in the first or second clauses above insert and thereupon the said clauses being read  it was agreed that the members shall be marked as they vote and that a list of their names as they vote first or second shall be printed whereupon the vote was put approve of the seventh article as to the excise of ale and beer with the explanation as contained in the said first or second clauses and it carried first  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation xxviii the debate of this article had made much more noise out of the house than it did within some people had industriously alarmed scotland with an apprehension that according to the words of the article scotland was to pay equal excise with england that is that as the strong beer or ale in england paid four shillings nine pence per barrel so must the common beer then brewed in scotland pay the same price and it was manifest that this was the opinion of several members of parliament by their speeches on this occasion in the house as well as without  on the other hand others pretended to bring all the ale brewed then in scotland down to the denomination of english small beer as being not sold for more than some of the table beer in england was sold for which paid but as small beer after the rate of one shilling three pence per barrel  i shall be very far from offering to make any part of this history officious in giving an account of any mean share the author had in this affair yet i cannot omit relating this part of the concern which casually happened to him in this particular and it may be mentioned for the sake of the jest it made in the town viz that while it was thought well done to have a share in stating the proportions of the excise several persons pretended to the title of being the first contrivers of it but when afterward on some clamor raised upon the inequality of the proportions the contrivers began to be blamed and a little threatened alamob then it was d f made it all and he was to be stoned for it and afterward when those differences appearing but trifles were by the prudence of the commissioner reconciled then they would willingly have reassumed the honor of being the first formers of this affair  it was indeed no small difficulty at first how to state a medium between the two nations it had been laid down as a maxim that scotland could by no means bear the high excises paid for their strong beer in england it was also absolutely necessary to regard doing justice to england who paying four shillings nine pence per barrel excise would have had a great hardship if scotland should have had all their beer as english small beer  again the scots ale which was sold in the public houses and commonly called tippony was in no proportion like the english strong beer either in price or in strength being fold for one penny the chappin which was near the english quart by retail after paying a subsequent excise to the cities or burghs and not one half or above one third as strong as the english ale or strong beer upon this i shall impartially set down the matter of fact  the author of this being sent for by the committee of parliament then sitting the same to whom the sixth article was committed as is above said attended them at their meeting in the lord cesnocks chamber and being called in the committee did him the honor to tell him they were informed he had spent some thoughts on the affair of the excises and that he had made some calculations they told him the parliament were coming upon the debate of the seventh article and the great difficulty before them was to find out a medium between the scots and the english excise so as might make it tolerable to scotland and not give england reason to take umbrage or complain of injustice  he frankly owned he thought it would be very hard and proposed what he had formerly insisted on viz that the scots ale or tippony being sold for no more money than the household or table beer in the city of london which is called eight shilling beer and is often sold for ten shillings per barrel the scots ought also to pay no more  but the lord president of the session objected that the english would never be satisfied with that payment as not being a just proportion that the act of parliament was express that all beer above the price of six shillings per barrel should pay as strong beer that those kinds of beer called eight shilling beer were generally mixtures after the excise was paid and that the denomination in england being but of two kinds it would not be possible to place this on either head and to leave it to the method of the eight shilling beer in london would be to lay all scotland at the mercy of the excise officers which would be unsufferable  this discourse put a thought in the authors head just in the moment upon which he told their lordships he thought a proportion to both sides might be formed taking its rise from the price of the beer and value of the excise in either kingdom and that he thought he could form it for them so as that it should not grieve either party  upon which their lordships desired him to try he took the pen and ink and immediately stated the case thus  there are in england but two denominations of exciseable beer small and strong  the small was supposed in the act at six shillings per barrel and paid one shilling three pence per barrel excise which is excluded out of the six shillings per barrel  the strong was supposed at eighteen or twenty shillings per barrel and paid four shillings nine pence excise which is included in the eighteen or twenty shillings per barrel  there is in scotland but one denomination of exciseable beer which we call as above for use sake tippony  this was sold for about nine shillings six pence sterling per twelve scots gallons to the retailer and paid twenty three pence sterling duty which is not included in the nine shillings six pence  note twelve scots gallons was supposed to hold much about the english ale gauge of thirty four gallons there were some fractions or small differences which the committee did not examine into of which by it self  taking then this english excise from twenty shilling per barrel downward to nine shillings six pence or from six shillings per barrel upward to nine shillings six pence and then calculate the excise from either of these extremes and the middle seemed to be a just excise and this project had two happy circumstances in it which exactly supplied the difficulty  for example  the price of the scots strong beer being nine shillings sixpence per barrel exclusive of the excise and the price of the english beer reckoning it at twenty shillings per barrel inclusive of the excise being fourteen shillings three pence per barrel exclusive of the excise nine shillings sixpence is to fourteen shillings three pence as nineteen to fourteen shillings ninepence  thus    sh   d sterling is pence     the price of the scots strong beer exclusive of the excise     sh   d sterling is pence      ditto of the english  two thirds of     which is    sh   d is     which is   sh   d  two thirds of    pence which is   sh   d is    d which is the medium of excise this way  again if you begin at the lowest rate of the excise and the lowest price of beer and from thence draw the proportion upward then two shillings the present stated excise is the same to twelve as fifteen pence is to six shil or so near it as they sell the beer inclusive so that the difference is of no extraordinary consequence for example  twelve gallons scots paying two shillings excise is sold for twelve shilling sterling including the duty  one barrel english small beer paying one shilling three pence excise is sold at seven shillings six pence per barrel inclusive of the duty  note two shilling is one sixth part of twelve shilling and one shilling three pence is one sixth part of seven shillings six pence  thus the excise of both kingdoms stands upon the same foot and are an exact proportion to one another and having drawn a rough scheme of these proportions the commissioners ordered them to be laid before them finished the next morning which was done and the author had the honor done him to have them accepted which was a full reward to him and completely suited to his expectations and they stand in the treaty of union in his very words  this is put down here not at all to value the merit of the author upon but however to do himself justice against assuming pretenders  as to the mistake between the brewers and the excise office which fell out afterward in edinburgh and which some people industriously strove to blow into a flame it is explained in its place  minute xxix friday    november   0  prayers said  rolls called  moved that the observations made by the council of trade in relation to the export and import of this nation and a balance of our trade be laid before the committee to whom the sixth article of union is remitted and the same was accordingly ordered as also the clerks of the said council of trade were ordered to transmit to the said committee all observations papers and records relating thereto  then the lord chancellor acquainted the parliament that the secret council at their last meeting had under their consideration several accounts of irregular and tumultuary meetings by some people of the common and meanest degree in arms and of abuses committed by them at glasgow stewartry of kirkcudbright and dumfreis and several places of lanerk shire and that there were papers dropped inviting people to take up arms and to provide ammunition and provisions in order to their marching to disturb the parliament all which he was directed by the right honorable the lords of her majestys secret council to lay before the parliament to the effect proper methods might be resolved upon for preventing the evil consequences of such practices and thereafter presented a letter from the magistrates of dumfreis to her majestys advocat bearing an account of the abuses and tumultuary meetings in that place with a declaration emitted by those who met which was affixt on the market cross of dumfreis and both were read  whereupon a draught of a proclamation to be emitted by the parliament against all tumultuary and irregular meetings and convocations of the liedges was preseuted and read and after some discourse thereupon it being objected that it did not appear that there was a particular information of any tumultuary meetings or irregular convocations in any other part of the shire of lenerk than at glasgow  her majestys high commissioner was thereupon pleased to notify to the parliament that he had information not only from glasgow and dumfreis but also from several places in lanerk shire of tumultuary and irregular meetings of men under arms and of their giving out and publishing their design of marching to disturb the parliament  thereafter the draught of the proclamation was again read and after reasoning thereupon and some amendments a vote was stated approve of the proclamation or not  and before voting it was agreed that the members shall be marked as they vote and that the list of their names as they vote pro or con shall be printed and recorded and the lord chancellor allowed to have his name printed and recorded as an approver and the proclamation as amended being again read over  the vote was put approve or not and it carried approve  thereafter the draught of an act suspending the effect of that clause in the act of security for arming and exercising the fencible men past in the second session of this current parliament and that during this session of parliament allannerly read and a first reading ordered to be marked thereon  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation xxix the affair of the rabbles in the country came now before the parliament for things were come to that height in the country that it was no longer to be tampered with the party who opposed the union had so far prevailed upon the people that they began to break all bounds at dumfries the articles of the union were burnt at the market cross by a number of people in arms though they were not near so many as was reported at edinburgh where they industriously enlarged those reports to intimidate the party that was for the union and if possible to set the mob in edinburgh to work again but the guards there did their duty so effectually that there was no more appearance in the street though loud threatenings were made of it  as to the burning the articles it was true that a number of people being got together did publicly burn the articles of the union as concluded at london with the list of the names of the commissioners of the treaty and did affix a paper upon the cross of dumfreis which they called reasons for and designs in burning the articles etc after having read the said paper from the cross  this paper was afterward printed and the printer being ordered to be apprehended fled for it till the first heat was over and then he appeared again and was not questioned for it  the copy of the said paper is added in the appendix to this work no e x  but it is to be noted that whereas the paper mentions squadrons of foot and horse and the report was of  000 and  000 people  000 in arms that entered the town and  000 in the hills to support them  it was all rumor the most that appeared in this action being about  00 and these in no sort of military order or equippage as i have noted before  yet was this disorder improved to a great height and particularly as it was improved to make the government apprehend the western people were resolved to concern themselves in this affair and to take arms against the government the parliament was very sensible of this and being very loath to have any force made use of they tried all the methods possible by proclamations and public repealing the license for mustering to take away all opportunity of assembling together by which the people might be drawn into the snare  it is observable that even in the house there appeared some who were very loath to have these rabbles discouraged and discountenanced and tho i could give more particular instances of it yet this of objecting against the certainty of the accounts viz that it did not appear that there was a particular information of any tumultuary meetings or irregular convocations this i say is a clear proof of it for these objectors were openly against preventing the mustering or assembling the lieges according to the act of security and gave this suggestion viz want of information for a reason whereas the matter of fact was that the lord commissioner had real and direct information of this affair of dumfries and of private emissaries gone abroad to excite the people to take arms and the respective meetings of these agents or emissaries in the county of lanerk and elsewhere more than sufficient to justify the precautions mentioned in the minute  upon this debate the proclamation was voted and the act of security so far as it concerned this case was repealed which had various effects in several parts of the country in some places it really crushed and prevented their assembling at glasgow it irritated and provoked them and made them more furious than before  but generally it had a very good effect for it took away the pretense which any of the lairds or heads of clans might have had before to have appeared with the people in arms and under the pretense whereof they might have been exonered in law while an act of parliament was in force to protect them for no man could say if a gentleman gathered  00 or  00 men together that he had any ill design and though he armed them and trained them and kept them together he could not be accused for any crime because the law allowed him to do so under pretense of arming and disciplining the fencible men as authorized by the act of security  this appeared therefore so necessary at this time that a proposal was immediately brought in to repeal that part of the act of security at least to suspend it for a time there was great opposition made to this proposal and abundance of speeches made applauding the act of security how difficultly it was obtained and how much of the liberty of scotland depended upon it  but the motion being seconded with the necessity of the time and the causes as above and withal the proposal being made to extend it only to the time of the present session of parliament as per the vote it admitted the less opposition  minute xxx saturday  0 november   0  prayers said  rolls called  address of the magistrates and town council of the burgh of air for such rectifications of the articles of union and such eases of duties and public taxes as are most agreeable to the circumstances of this nation given in and read  address of heretors and others inhabitants of the town and paroch of burntisland subscribers of the same against an union with england in the terms of the articles given in and read  thereafter the act suspending the effect of a clause as to arming and exercising the country in the act of security past in the second session of this current parliament again read and after some reasoning thereupon and some amendments the act as amended was again read  then the vote was put aprove of the act or not and it carried approve and was touched with the scepter by her majestys high commissioner in the usual manner under the title of act against all musters and rendezvouzes during the present session of parliament  and the said act and the proclamation mentioned in the minutes of the last sederunt were ordered to be forth with published and printed  thereafter the seventh article of union was again read and after reasoning upon that part thereof not formerly approven it was put to the vote approve of the said seventh article or not and it carried approve  a print was then given in entitled an account of the burning of the articles of union at dumfreis bearing the declaration read and affixt at the market cross thereof by the tumult assembled on that occasion and it being moved that inquiry shall be made who has been the printer and ingiver of the said scurrilcus paper and that the print be burnt by the hand of the hangman  it was remitted to the committee to whom the sixth article of union is remitted to call for the magistrates of edinburgh and to take trial and make inquiry anent the printer and ingiver of the said paper  ordered also that the said scurrilous print be burned by the hand of the common hangman at the market cross of edinburgh upon monday next betwixt eleven and twelve of the clock and the magistrates of edinburgh appointed to see the order punctually executed  then the eight article of union was read and remitted to the committee to whom the sixth article is remitted  act for adjourning the session till the first day of january next read and a clause was offered to be subjoyned thereto in these terms and further her majesty with advice and consent foresaid statutes and ordains that the session which is appointed to rise the last day of february next be continued to sit for administration of justice to the liedges from the said day to the last day of march   0  years inclusive  which being read the consideration of the said clause delayed till the act be again read and a first reading was ordered to be marked on the act  thereafter it was intimate to all such members as gave in any overtures or clauses relating to the sixth article of union to attend the committee next sederunt  adjourned till tuesday next at ten of the clock  observation xxx the debates of this day were principally taken up about repealing the clause of the act of security anent arming and exercising as before and great struggles were made to preserve the clause but it looked so like abetting the tumults which were now in their height that no man could speak heartily to it for all men pretended at least to disowne the design of rabbling the parliament and breaking up their consultations by tumults and violence but yet as far as they could drive it they opposed this vote  at last it was carried and the act was touched and is printed in that part of this work entitled of the carrying on the treaty in scotland folio     the paper about burning the articles at dumfreis was now censured and the printer kept out of the way some time but no proceedings were made on it only that the paper was burnt by the hangman according to the order  the difficulties of the sixth seventh and eighth articles being generally respecting taxes excises salt exportations and importations etc of trade were referred to the committee to settle and shall be spoken to as they came again before the house  it is to be observed among the great crowd of addresses that had been brought into the house one of this day from the burgh of air differed from the generality and was not as others against an union with england in the terms of the articles but was for rectification of the articles and ease of taxes this had some seeming softness in it and appeared more reasonable than the other and the parliament seemed generally inclined to enter upon rectifications and ease of taxes and the references to the committee were with that prospect the difficulty lay how to regulate and so govern the said regulations as to make them equal to both kingdoms reasonable in scotland to ask and reasonable in england to comply with that so the poor might as far as possible be eased the circumstances of both kingdoms be considered and england not be imposed upon for they were not ignorant that there were vigilant endeavors at work to obtain such amendments as england should stick at and as might at least occasion the treaty to be sent back to scotland for further amendments and then they would be able to raise such further difficulties that the time might expire upon their hands and then the whole work had been to do over again  minute xxxi tuesday   december   0  prayers said  rolls called  then the following addresses were given in and read viz address of the merchants deacons trades and other inhabitants of the burgh of dir subscribers of the same address of barons freeholders heretors and others of the four parochins of glenkenns in the shire of galloway subscribing the same and address of the magistrates towncouncil burgesses and inhabitants of the burgh of new galloway subscribers of the same all against an union with england in the terms of the articles  thereafter the act adjourning the session till the first of january next was again read as also the clause continuing the sitting thereof from the last of february till the last day of march next inclusive insert in the minutes of the last sederunt and after debate it was put to the vote add the clause or not and it carried add  and the clause being added the vote was put approve the act or not and it carried approve  ordered that the council of trade do meet and give in their observations as to export and import and balance of trade to the committee to whom the sixth and eighth articles are remitted and that betwixt and the next sederunt of the said committee  then the ninth article of union was read and after reasoning thereon it was moved that six months cess shall be the quota of the tax to be imposed on scotland in place of eight months agreed to by the said article and after debate thereupon  a vote was stated approve of the ninth article or not  and thereupon a second state of a vote was offered viz whether six months cess or eight months cess should be the quota of the tax to be charged on scotland  then the vote was put which of the two should be the state of the vote first or second and it carried first  whereupon it was put to the vote approve of the said ninth article or not and it carried approve  thereafter the tenth eleventh twelfth and thirteenth articles of union were all severally read and were separately voted and approven  the fourteenth article of union read and the consideration thereof delayed till next sederunt to be then proceeded upon previous to all other business  act adjourning the session to the first day of january next and continuing the sitting thereof from the last of february till the last day of march next inclusive touched with the scepter by her majestys high commissioner in the usual manner  adjourned till thursday next at ten of the clock  observation xxxi the ninth of the articles of the union could admit of no debate but whether the eight months cess agreed to be the proportion of scotland to the land tax of four shillings per pound upon rent in england were founded upon a true scale of equalities i have already stated this question in the observations on the minutes of the treaty at london and need not repeat them but observe that the proposal now made of six months cess to the english two million land tax had no arguments at all to support it that could be made good by just proportions neither were there any schemes offered to the house to form any other proportions from or to prove any thing of equalities upon so the making this offer produced no other effect than the bare reciting the several calculates and proportions upon which the other was formed and which had been approved in the treaty at london and upon an easy examination they appeared so just that nothing could be offered of any real weight to move the parliament to alter it so this clause past with small difficulty  the tenth eleventh twelfth thirteenth articles required no debate consisting only of exemptions to scotland from several duties and taxes paid in england which could not be extended to scotland such as stamped paper which in scotland could not consist with the methods of the law nor be born in trade or the window lights which was determined not to be continued in england and the coal and culm which according to the method of that tax in england did not reach to the coal in scotland other than such as should be carried into england or exported into foreign parts which were expressly provided for in the clause in these words that scotland shall be charged with the same duties as in england for all coal culm and cynders not consumed in scotland as to the malt tax in england which was the thirteenth article it was temporary and could not extend to scotland without a new law and that was provided against in the next article  minute xxxii thursday   december   0  prayers said  rolls called  the parliament was then acquainted that the report of the committee anent the calculation of the equivalent remitted to them was ready and in the clerks hands and that all persons concerned may see the same and grounds whereupon it proceeds before the report be brought in to the parliament  thereafter the fourteenth article of union was again read and an amendment and addition thereto was offered in these terms and that the part of the united kingdom now called scotland shall not in all time coming be charged with any malt tax or any other customs excises taxes or any other burdens or duties than these consented to in this treaty  and after some reasoning upon the first part of the said clause in relation to the malttax it was proposed that the amendment should be in these terms with this further provision that any malt to be made and consumed within that part of the united kingdom now called scotland shall not be charged with any imposition on malt during this present war  and after some further debate the vote was stated whether the exemption from any imposition on malt shall be temporary or perpetual  then the vote was put whether the exemption shall be temporary or perpetual and it carried temporary  thereafter it was proposed that the exemption shall be during this present war  it was also proposed that the exemption shall be for a longer time  and after debate thereon the vote was stated whether the exemption from any imposition on malt shall be during this present war or for a longer time and it carried during this present war  then the article as amended was again read and the further consideration thereof delayed till next sederunt of parliament to be then proceeded upon previous to all other business  adjourned till to morrow at ten a clock  observation xxxii the affair of the malttax came upon the stage in the debate of the fourteenth article because it was but a temporary tax in england and therefore was to be considered amongst these things which the parliament of great britain might hereafter lay taxes upon  the treaters had acquiesced in a supposition offered in england in these words that the parliament of great britain could not be supposed to lay any sorts of burdens upon the united kingdom but what they shall find of necessity at that time for the preservation and good of the whole and with due regard to the circumstances and abilities of every part of the united kingdom therefore it is agreed that there be no further exemption insisted upon for any part of the united kingdom but that the consideration of any exemptions beyond what are already agreed on in this treaty shall be left to the determination of the parliament of great britain upon this account they did not insist upon exemptions of duties any further than the said duties were then extended in england but people were now come a greater length and they did not care to trust the british parliament so far  they had encouraged all manner of jealousies of the british parliament the people had received no notions but of scotlands being always oppressed by them both in civil and religious concerns and that therefore nothing was to be left to them that the british parliament was to be fenced against as a declared enemy and the representatives of scotland being like to be but a few viz forty five to five hundred and thirteen they were to be crushed by number outvoted and disregarded in every thing relating to scotland  there is no more wonder to be made that they were for making every thing secure and settling it to points and punctilios who had entertained such notions as these the malttax therefore being acknowledged insupportable in scotland and the treaters having determined it so and exempted scotland from it for as long time as it was now in force in england the parliament building upon that supposition resolve to determine the time of the exemption that they may be sure of it  it was moved very briskly that scotland should for ever be exempt from it but that went not far as appears in the vote some were for a certain term of years some for an exemption during the war others for a certain number of years after the war  the exemption during the war seemed the most rational because it was known that the tax upon malt was a temporary tax given but upon the emergence of the war and as the gentry of england were with difficulty brought to submit to it so they were not easy under it and would never suffer it to continue after the war having for that end given it but from year to year that it might not be entangled with anticipations or appropriated to payments that should continue it and therefore to exempt scotland during the war was a total exemption in its kind and seemed sufficient  this was opposed a little but as being a point gained those who sought the regulation of conditions only came freely into it and so it passed  minute xxxiii friday   december   0  prayers said  rolls called  the fourteenth article of union as amended again read as also the clause offered to be added to the said article insert in the minutes of the last sederunt as to the exemption from any other customs excises taxes or any other burdens or duties than those consented to in this treaty  there were two states of a vote proposed the first in these terms approve of the article as amended or not and the second in these terms approve or amend  and before voting it was agreed that the members shall be marked as they shall vote in both votes and that the list of their names shall be recorded and printed accordingly  then it was put to the vote which of the two shall be the state of the vote first or second and it carried first  thereafter the vote was put approve of the article as amended or not and it carried approve  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation xxxiii the debate of this day run only upon the affair mentioned before viz whether they should depend upon the british parliament maintaining a just and equal regard to the good of the whole united island after the union and that they would have respect to the circumstances of every part in their laying on taxes or whether they should pin them down in all time coming that no other burdens or taxes should be laid on than those already mentioned  the supposition of the parliament of britains being partial against scotland and the representatives of scotland being few being oppressed and outvoted as i have noted already though it was a popular notion and improved to an extravagant height without doors yet it had not obtained so as to be owned in the parliament nor indeed could any man with just reason have supposed such a thing and therefore to offer at a positive limitation on the parliament of britain seemed to have something in it very harsh  again it was alleged that to limit the parliament of britain not to lay on any other customs excises taxes duties or burdens than those consented to in this act was to take away the power from the people of britain to conform their affairs even to their own circumstances since the time might come when some of these duties might become burdensome that now were not so and others which now would be burdensome might be more for the public service but to ty the parliament down absolutely as in this clause would be to limit them from making alterations in the public taxes though apparently for the public advantage and would in effect take from them that power for which they were really constituted viz to dispose the peoples purses and redress their grievances  it was long argued that the parliament ought to be limited in this case because of the danger there was of scotland being burdened with intolerable taxes and of the present circumstances of scotland which were allowed to be unable to bear them that under the pretense of alteration of taxes oppressive duties might be laid upon scotland which though they might be tolerable in england were not so here and they ought to provide against them  but it was resolved at last into this that all future contingencies must be left to a british parliament and the words of the articles contained a sufficient reason for so doing viz it could not be supposed that the parliament of great britain will ever lay any sorts of burdens upon the united kingdom but what they shall find of necessity at that time for the preservation and good of the whole and with due regard to the circumstances and abilities of every part of the united kingdom therefore it is agreed that there be no further exemption insisted upon for any part of the united kingdom but that the consideration of any exemptions beyond what are already agreed on in this treaty shall be left to the determination of the parliament of great britain  and thus with some difficulty the clause was passed without any further amendment  minute xxxiv saturday   december   0  prayers said  rolls called  the fifteenth article of union read and thereafter the first clause or paragraph thereof again read as also the report brought in from the committee for examining the calculation of the equivalent being as follows the committee of parliament to whom the considering of the calculation of the equivalent was remitted having considered the report made to them by doctor james gregory professor of the mathematics in the college of edinburgh and the report made by doctor thomas bowar professor of the mathematics in the college of aberdeen of their several and respective examinations of the calcul and grounds thereof whereupon the commissioners in treating the article for establishing the equivalent did proceed and also having considered the report of the subcommittee thereanent they find that the computation of the equivalent mentioned in the article is just and that the calcul is exact and well founded in the terms and in manner expressed in the said article  whereupon it was proposed to delay the consideration of the said fifteenth article until reports be brought in in relation to the sixth and eighth articles from the committee to whom the said articles are remitted  and after debate thereon it was agreed that the proceeding on the fifteenth article shall not be understood to be any determination of the sixth or eighth articles that stand committed but that the reasoning and voting on the sixth and eighth articles shall be entire  then a state of a vote was offered in these terms approve of the first paragraph of the fifteenth article or not  but it being moved that the parliament first consider whether we shall be concerned in the payment of the english debts a second state was thereupon offered whether we shall engage in the payment of the debts of england yea or not  and after some reasoning thereon it was put to the vote which of the two should be the state of the vote first or second  and before voting it was agreed that the members votes shall be marked and that a list of their names as they shall vote shall be printed and recorded  and the lord beilhaven gave in a protest as follows i do protest in my own name and in the name of all those who do adhere to this my protest that the voting and agreeing to the first clause of the fifteenth article of the treaty of union does no ways infer any manner of consent or agreement that scotland should be liable to the english debt in general but that it may be lawful to object against any branch of the said debt not already determined and he took instruments thereupon and the duke of hamilton the earl of selkirk the lord saltoun andrew fletcher of saltoun sir humphrey colquhoun of luss david bethun of balfour major henry balfour of dunboig mr thomas hope of rankeilor alexander watson and mr robert frazer adhered thereto  then the vote was put first or second and it carried first  thereafter it was put to the vote approve of the first clause or paragraph of the fifteenth article or not and it carried approve  her majestys high commissioner and the estates of parliament did recommend the persons employed in the calculation of the equivalent by the committee to whom the examining thereof was remitted to the lords of her majestys thesaury for a gratification for their pains  adjourned till tuesday next at ten of the clock  observation xxxiv they were now come to the great article of the equivalent it had been offered at in the article and by consent referred to a committee which committee had spent a great deal of time upon it had examined all the calculations made by the clerks employed in london during the treaty had cast up the interests and the valuation of years to reduce every annual payment upon ready money upon equal rebates and allowances and their report was now brought in by which it appears that the calculations made in england were very just so that no objection lay against that part of the work  the first question then was why scotland should concern it self in paying englands debts at all and on this head it is necessary to be something large since the learned debates on this head filled the whole nation and the opposers of the union advanced abundance of objections against the very thing called an equivalent in the first place as needless and impertinent that england should pay its own debts and keep her own money and the like that to make scotland pay taxes and then give her an equivalent was doing nothing as to equalities for that though it might be an equality nationally speaking it had no personal justice or equality at all since the private persons that should pay it would never receive any equivalent for the injury they received  some answers to this i shall set down here as they were argued in the house and after made public by an honorable member of the parliament now baron of the exchequer in scotland mr clark of pennycook   that no communication of the trade of england can be given to the subjects of scotland unless we are satisfied to pay equal customs and duties upon export and import and equal excises the reason is plain for otherwise the merchants residing in scotland would be put in a condition to ruin the whole trade of england   that an equality of excises in both kingdoms is as necessary as an equality of customs for not only all immediate burdens on trade are to be regarded but even these things which affect and influence trade   that though a federal union was practicable between the two kingdoms as i believe it is not yet even by that union we behoved to undergo the burden of equal customs and excises otherwise there could be no communication of trade   that a great part of the english customs and excises is appropriated toward payment of their debts so that the paying of the english debts and the paying of equal customs and excises are almost reciprocal terms to signify one and the same thing or otherwise that these customs and excises paid after the union will be appropriated toward paying our own debts which is the same as shall more fully appear hereafter   that these debts being after the union to be called the debts of great britain are so necessary and inevitable burdens on scotland that neither by an incorporating or federal union with england can scotland be free of em since as is said before they are included and wrapped up in the very notion of equal customs and excises   from these positions it follows that since under all sorts of union whatsomever with a communication of trade we must be subjected to equal customs and excises and that a great part of these is applied toward payment of the debts of england therefore in common justice a provision behoved to be made to scotland for reimbursing what we shall be charged on the score of these debts which by this article of the treaty is called an equivalent  this equivalent is so contrived and adjusted that thereby we cannot properly look on our selves as engaged in the english debts for no man can be properly said to pay a debt for another when the money is either advanced before hand to the payer or at furthest the next moment after it is paid out which will be scotlands case  it was evident that a communication of trade was the interest of scotland and was the clearest advantage on the scots side and most unexceptionable in the whole treaty it was impossible this communication of trade could be established and could be entirely free unless an equality of customs excises and of all sorts of payments were settled at the same time so that these people who were so backward to come into the english debts were leading into a rejecting the only advantage which they themselves acknowledged was to be had by the union  the equality of excises and customs being thus absolutely necessary the english debts came to be concerned because the customs and excises of england being appropriated as funds to pay the interests of annuities and such encumbrances the same duties in scotland would of course run in the same channel come into the same charge and under the same encumbrances as it could not be otherwise without running things into all manner of confusion  the treaters in london had been convinced of this and therefore readily came into it demanding an equivalent to scotland suited to so much of the scots revenue as should be so appropriated to the payment of the english debts  but it was the hardest thing in the world to make the people in scotland apprehend it  not but that those who were more immediately concerned in the debating it understood it well enough but it served as a handle to rally the union and the thing being rendered as intricate to the common people as possible that they might be the more moved to oppose it these ignorantly running away with a notion that scotland was to pay the english debts began to rage at the treaters again and cry out they were sold and betrayed to tell them of an equivalent was to say nothing and as many did not understand it so they that did would not seem to understand it the very word became proverbial and was the jest of conversation till the aversion to it renred it in a manner contemptible to bring scotland in to pay the english debts what was not scotland poor enough already was this the advantage of the union it could not be suffered and the treaters had betrayed them such discourse as this was the subject of the common peoples conversation and the answering them with the story of an equivalent to be paid them was to tell them something which they neither understood nor entered into the examination of  it would be very hard to describe how this kind of discourse irritated the poor people and how they were imposed upon in the daily accounts spread of this new wonder called the equivalent of which calculations were made public representing that in a year scotland would repay all the money advanced from england by the increase of customs and excises and so after that rate notwithstanding of the equivalent scotland would be drawn into an entail of taxes for an hundred years to clear off the vast debt of twenty millions which england was now liable to  i shall have occasion to answer this in a subsequent observation but i can not but note that by a due calculation laid before the parliament it was made very plain that england would be so far from being reimburst in a year as above that reckoning the common interest of the money advanced in the equivalent with the medium of years in which great part of the duties the other people had calculated from was to expire the equivalent advanced in money to scotland would not be repayed in ninety years  yet was not all this able to allay the prejudices of the people at the affair of paying the english debt which they run away with so eagerly and so universally raged against that had not the rabbles been in good time crushed before and that so effectually that they could not begin again it was thought this very thing would have influenced them to a more dangerous degree than any thing  but this was offered by degrees the work of this day was only to debate the first clause viz whether scotland should be entirely free from the english debts or whether they should come in to the appropriations of the english duties accepting of an equivalent and after a very warm debate the case was carried as by the minute  minute xxxv tuesday  0 december   0  prayers said  rolls called  address of heretors and commons of the town and paroch of douglass subscribing the same and address of parochioners of carmichael and petinean subscribers of the same both against an union with england in the terms of the articles were given in and read  the sixth article of union again read as also a report of the committee to whom the same was remitted in the terms following viz the committee of parliament appointed for considering the sixth article of the treaty of union and proposals made in parliament relative thereto having considered the clause underwritten anent the preemiums and rewards for exporting of victual are of opinion that the clause aftermentioned be added to the article of union whereof the tenor follows viz and seeing by the laws of england notwithstanding there are rewards granted upon the exportation of certain kinds of grain wherein oats grinded or vngrinded are not specified that from and after the union when oats shall be at fifteen shilling sterling per quarter or under there shall be paid two shilling and six pence sterling for every quarter of the oat meal exported in the terms of the law whereby and so long as rewards are granted for exportation of other grains and that the bear of scotland have the same rewards as barley  and upon a motion that the praemium to be allowed should be higher after a long debate thereon it was put to the vote approve of the report or alter and it carried approve  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation xxxv the commmittee to whom the several articles about trade were referred began now to make their reports and beginning with the sixth article concerning equalities of allowances and encouragements they made their report about the allowances on exporting victual by which is understood corn only which is commonly called victual in scotland  the allowance here offered by the committee was on these considerations it had been used in england to give a bounty or allowance on the exportation of grain to encourage the merchant to export it being a sure rule in trade that all the mere product of the earth which can be spared and exported abroad over and above the necessary consumption of the nation is cleargain to the public stock  but oats in england had no allowance or bounty on the exportation because it was generally supposed that england had never any quantity of oats to spare more than they consumed among themselves but were rather alwise ready to buy oats from abroad than to export them  on the other hand oats being the principal kind of grain sowed in scotland it was equally necessary to encourage the exporting of oats as it was to encourage the exporting wheat in england  but this was answered by telling them that there was no need of proposing a bounty upon the exportation of oats for that england would always take off what ever quantity of oats they would part with and to offer a bounty for exportation of that abroad which was really wanted at home was absurd contrary to the rules of trade and the nature of the thing further it was offered that should a bounty be offered on the exportation of oats the outports in england who now supply london lying ready for the trade to holland and flanders would send all their oats abroad and london would not be supplied but upon dear rates  these arguments prevailed with the committee as to oats but there being a very gainful trade carried on from scotland to norway for oatmeal which it was worth while to encourage as a trade that generally brought into scotland a great deal of bullion and money in specie the committee thought fit to place a bounty upon the exportation of the oatmeal as per the vote and the state of the time when the said bounty should be paid being fixed when oats shall be no higher than fifteen shillings per quarter there could be no danger that the greatness of the export should influence the market at london so as to make oats scarce or dear since after they came to fifteen shillings per quarter no bounty money could be demanded  this was founded upon so just a calculation of equalities in trade that it met with no opposition in the parliament  minute xxxvi wednesday    december   0  prayers said  rolls called  then the following addresses were given in and read viz address of the presbytery of dumblain subscribing the same address of the presbytery of hamilton subscribing the same address of the inhabitants of the parochins of caputh lethendy alyth and kinloch in perthshire subscribers of the same address of the inhabitants of the parochins of errol kilspindie kinnaird inchture longforgan st madoes and kinfauns in perth shire subscribing the same address of heretors the minister elders and heads of families in the paroch of logie subscribers of the same and address of the parochins of airth larbert dunipace and denny subscribing the same all against an union with england in the terms of the articles  thereafter a proposal given in for a further addition to the sixth article in these terms viz and that there be likewise a proemium allowed for the exportation of oats proportionally with the meal compting three bolls of oats to one quarter of meal so that the proemium may be ten shilling scots for every boll of oats exported  which being read after debate thereupon it was put to the vote allow a proemium on the exportation of oats or not and it carried not  then a second report of the committer to whom the sixth article is remitted was brought in and read in these terms the committee of parliament appointed for considering the sixth article of the treaty of union and proposals made in parliament relative thereto having considered the clause under written are of opinion that it should be added to the articles of union as follows and in respect the importation of victual into scotland from any place beyond sea would prove a discouragement to tillage therefore that the prohibition as now in force by the law of scotland against importation of victual from ireland or any other place beyond sea into scotland do after the union remain in the same force as now it is  and after some reasoning it was proposed to add to the above report the subsequent clause viz until more proper and effectual ways be provided by the parliament of great britain for discouraging the importation of the said victual from beyond sea and after some further reasoning the said second report was agreed to and it was put to the vote add the above clause to the said report or not and it carried add  thereafter an overture for an act for additional proemiums on exportation of victual to commence the first of february and to end the last of april both next to come inclusive given in and read and agreed that the same be taken into consideration immediately after the reports relating to the sixth article of union  then a third report brought in from the said committee was read in these terms the committee of parliament appointed for considering the sixth article of the treaty of union and proposals made in parliament relative thereto having considered the clause mentioned in the twenty seventh days minutes anent the making and exporting of plaiding fingrams gallowaywhites sarges stockings and all sorts of linen to england dominions and plantations thereof or any part beyond sea free of any duty or imposition and having considered the english acts of parliament relative thereunto particularly the    act primo gulielmi and mariae and the twenty act gul undecimo and duodecimo in regard there appears to be no restraint at present regulating the way and manner of making english woollen clothes and others to be exported and that all the woollen manufactures are declared to be free of duty and imposition whatsoever at exporting and that by the said sixth article of the treaty of union all parts of the united kingdom are to have the same allowances and encouragements therefore the committee are of opinion that the adding the foresaid clause to the articles of treaty is unnecessary  and after debate the vote was put approve of the said third report or not and it carried approve  thereafter a fourth report was brought in from the said committee and read in these terms viz the committee to whom the consideration of the sixth article of union and proposals made in parliament relative thereto are remitted having considered that clause mentioned in the twenty seventh days minutes that after the union all sorts of scots linen or any kind of cloth made of flax or hemp be exported out of the united kingdom free of all customs or impositions whatsoever after full reasoning on the said clause the committee are of opinion that the adding of the said clause to the articles of the treaty of union is unnecessary the english duty on linen being only sixpence sterling on the forty english elns  and after debate thereon a vote was stated approve of the said fourth report of the committee or alter and it carried approve  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation xxxvi notwithstanding what was argued in the committeee which i have noted above and at which i was present having had the occasion to make several of these calculations for the service of the said committee some gentlemen in the parliament insisted upon the allowing a drawback or bounty money upon exportation of oats but when the same reasons mentioned above which had been argued in the committee came to be offered in full parliament it was so convincing that they soon acquiescd and so it was carried without as per the minute  the subsequent reports of the committee mentioned in this days minutes seemed only to add the authority of the committees examinations to what had before been offered in public viz that after the union the exportation of linen and woollen manufactures would be free and the several manufactures be under no restraint or regulations but that either in transporting them to england or exporting them to foreign parts all was open and free by the union  and this report of the committee was a full proof of what i have all along alleged viz that the common people of scotland were intolerably imposed upon in the accounts spread abroad relating especially to trade and in this in particular viz that the scots woollen and linen manufacture would be subjected to several restrictions and regulations in england which could not be complied with  this was grounded upon an office in england granted by patent some years since which was called the aulnage which amounted to no more than putting a seal and demanding a fee upon every parcel of woollen manufactures brought to london under pretense of viewing if they were marketable  but this duty or fee being a very small trifle and the power of inspecting found deficient it was of no force at all and therefore upon the committees examining this they saw no ground of objection  the next objection was about exportation and here it is observable that the opposers of the union had not only suggested but openly printed and exposed about the streets such absurdities as these that the scots linen would not be admitted into england but a great duty would be laid upon it to gratify the dutch that great duties were to be paid upon both linen and woollen manufactures on their exportation and the like now it was very happy that these things came to be considered and examined by a committee  for now it was evident   that no duty could be laid on the transporting any linen or woollen goods from scotland to england which were the growth or manufacture of scotland the article of communication of trade having effectually taken off all impositions between the counties or shires of all great britain equally to all   as to the duty on woollen goods there never was any duty paid outward but what was called the old subsidy of tonnage and poundage which was five per cent which had been effectually taken off and that act repealed in the act of parliament mentioned in the report and no duty at all was paid on any woollen manufacture whatever exported out of england and by consequence could not be out of scotland   all linen cloth was so free that the duty on cloth imported to england from foreign parts was all drawn back by certificate on the exporting it again in order to encourage the said exportation and for linen exported made in britain it was so small a trifle paid viz sixpence on forty else that it was not worth notice   this report of the committee put a great stop to the clamours that had been so loud upon the article of trade and when this vote was made public the people began to see they were imposed upon and that these things in england were misrepresented  minute xxxvii thursday    december   0  prayers said  rolls called  ordered that a scurrilous print entitled queries to the presbyterian noblemen barons burgesses ministers and commoners in scotland who are for the scheme of an incorporating union with england according to the articles agreed upon by the commissioners of both nations be burnt by the hand of the common hangman at the market cross of edinburgh to morrow betwixt eleven and twelve of the clock and the magistrates of edinburgh appointed to see the same punctually done  and remitted to the committee of parliament to whom the sixth and eighth articles of union are remitted to make enquiry anent the printer author and ingiver of the said scurrilous paper  a fifth report was then brought in from the committee to whom the sixth article of union is remitted and read in these terms the committee of parliament appointed for considering the sixth article of union and proposals made in parliament relative thereto having considered the clause underwritten are of opinion that it should be added to the article of union as follows excepting and reserving the duties upon export and import of such particular commodities from which any persons the subjects of either kingdom are specially liberated and exempted by their private rights which after the union are to remain safe and entire to them in all respects as before the same and after some reasoning it was put to the vote approve of the said fifth report or not and it carried approve  a sixth report brought in from the said committee was read in these terms the committee are also of opinion that there be a clause added to the articles of union in these terms viz that from and after the union no scots cattle carried into england shall be liable to any other duties either on the public or private accounts than these duties to which the cattle of england are or shall be liable within the said kingdom  and a vote was stated approve of the said sixth report or not and it carried approve  a seventh report was brought in from the said committee and was read in these terms the committee having considered the clause mentioned in the twenty seventh days minutes which was desired to be added to the articles of union viz that scotland shall be free from and no ways subject to the prohibitions against exporting of wool sheep and lambs skins with wool upon them and woollen yarn for the space therein mentioned after full reasoning thereanent the committee are of opinion that the foresaid clause ought not to added to the articles of the treaty but that the exporting of wool sheep and lambs skins with wool upon them and woollen yarn ought to be under the same prohibitions as in england  and after reasoning a state of a vote was offered approve of the said seventh report of the committee as to all except mort lambs skins and remit to the said committee to receive overtures for encouragement of wool masters and woollen manufactures yea or not  after some reasoning it was proposed that a proemium be given upon exportation of coarse cloth made of tarrd wool for encouragement of the wool masters  and thereafter a resolve was offered in these terms resolved that there shall be an encouragement provided to the heretors of wool countries in case the report of the committee anent the exportation of wool etc be approven  and after some reasoning a proposal was given in for adding a clause in these terms and for remeiding the loss wool masters may suffer and for encouraging the manufacturing of tarrd wool within the kingdom and to prevent effectually the exporting thereof it is provided and declared that for the space of seven years after the union when the tarrd wool within the shires of roxburgh selkirk and tweeddale is at four pound scots or under for the stone weight fifteen shilling scots shall be paid of proemium for every stone weight of tarrd wool to every woollmaster who within a month after the said tarrd wool is clipped or shorn off the sheep shall by his own oath or the oaths of two habile witnesses before any judge ordinar make appear that the number of stones of tarrd wool specified in the said oaths were truly and really clipped and shorn from sheep in scotland properly belonging to the persons mentioned in the said oaths and which proemium shall be paid the next collector of cess excises or customs upon delivering to them the foresaid depositions signed by the deponents and judge foresaid with a receipt of the money and the said collectors and each of them shall be personally liable for the said proemium upon instruments taken against them in case of refusal and the foresaid depositions and receipts shall be allowed to the said collectors as an exoneration in their accounts pro tanto  and after some further debate that the said seventh report be remmitted back to the committee with the several proposals made thereanent a second state was offered for a vote in these terms approve of the said seventh report of the committee or remit the same and proposals thereanent back to the committee  after debate which of the two should be the state of the vote whether first or second it was put to the vote first or second and it carried first  thereafter the vote was put approve of the seventh report of the committee as to all except mort lambs skins and remit to the said committee to receive overtures for encouragement of the woollmasters and woollenmanufacture or not and it carried approve in the terms of the state  petition of john henry huguetan and his factor craving to be naturalized and also craving a protection read and the consideration thereof delayed till the first sederunt of parliament on private business to be then taken into consideration next after the act in favors of the burgh of dundee  the committee appointed to meet in the usual place to morrow at nine of the clock  adjourned till monday next at ten of the clock  observation xxxvii there was a clause in the treaty for the reserving all private rights etc as per the  0 th article now some of these private rights amounted to exemption from certain customs and excises as particular privileges to this or that place or person as at glasgow for encouragement of their sugarworks they are exempted from paying any excise for the spirits they distill from the melasses bottoms scummings etc and so in several towns they were exempted from such and such customs  these were of necessity to be exempted because by another article as above private rights on both sides were to be preserved  now as this was for scotland on one hand so it was for england on another for the city of carlisle and the family of sir christopher musgrave had an ancient right of taking toll of all the cattle which passed from scotland to england over such passes or bridges as they had the lordship of and these by private rights were actually reserved  but the committee having demanded here the taking away the toll paid as above the private right on the english side ceased so that what seemed solid and confirmed by the union in one part was yet invaded and taken away by another  but to reconcile this matter the parliament of england interposed and when some people thought they had now brought their affair to a head and that now the treaty must break behold a medium was found out in england viz that the parliament in england bought these private rights of the city of carlisle and of the family of sir christopher musgrave and giving them an equivalent for them they acquiesced and all ways were laid open for all manner of scots or english goods to pass and repass without any toll stoppage or interruption whether cattle or corn or any other kind of goods except such as  scotland being exempted from the taxes of in this treaty for a time were not to be carried into england during that limited time or if they were carried in were liable to the english duties as soon as they came into england such as salt coals malt fish cured with scots salt etc as is more particularly explained hereafter  thus the private rights in scotland were preserved entire according to the treaty and in england also for if they were invaded by the treaty the subject had such satisfaction given him in money as that he appeared willing to resign those rights  as the city of carlisle for instance who i think had two thousand five hundred pound sterling given them for parting with the right of toll upon scots cattle etc  in this exact equality the sixth report of the committee about scots cattle became as it were settled but it was objected that the parliament might hereafter lay on a particular tax upon the scots cattle passing into england either in favors of the irish cattle or upon any other subsequent occasion which could not be foreseen and therefore the sending lean cattle from scotland into england being such a considerable article to scotland and on which the estates of the northern gentry did almost wholly depend all their rents being paid them in cattle for which they had no other vent or market but their being sent into england and that any tax or toll being hereafter laid on them might entirely put a stop to it and consequently impair and almost ruin the estates of the gentry and nobility of scotland on this consideration it was thought fit by the committee to secure scotland effectually from so much as a jealousy or uneasiness about it by making it a part of the union that from and after the union no scots cattle carried into england shall be liable to any other duties either public or private than the cattle of england this was again an article of equality for the case was not to exempt the scots cattle entirely from any tax which the united parliament might think fit to lay on cattle in general if ever the article of general excises so much talked of in england should be offered at but to bring the scots cattle upon a level with all the rest of the cattle in england and to provide that scots cattle qua scots cattle should be under no particular national disadvantage  and this was thought reasonable on every side  the seventh report of the committee requires some explication on several accounts  it was true and no question was to be made of it that scotland having then an open trade with france without restriction and that their wool was under no prohibition at all but freely exported to france or any other part of the world and that this liberty being by the union to be absolutely and entirely restrained the prices of wool in scotland would of course very much fall and the gentlemen of the south and west parts of scotland such as in roxburgh shire selkirk tweeddale and galloway whose estates very much consisted in the product of their sheep would receive a very sensible blow by it though it was remarkable that some people was for giving all britain a worse blow to prevent the injury done to those countries viz to allow exporting the wool and some warm debates were upon this head  to explain this it was to be enquired into under what kind of influence and by whose management the trade of scotland was at first laid open and the exporting of wool permitted in general this as it produced no effect but the ripping up old sores and reviving personal and party reflections i shall let fall but this was certain that whoever were the the occasion of it the shipping off the wool from scotland was very injurious to the public advantage of scotland a mortal wound given to the industry of the people discouraging all attempts of manufacturing among them which they were now coming into and which their neighbors of england had so much been enriched by it was apparent that the small exportation they formerly had of coarse woollen manufactures to swedeland and the baltic was now almost brought to a full stop and the swedes on the contrary took their wool from scotland which they had not been used to do by which it was apparent they having the wool made the manufactures themselves and this was a dead loss to scotland just so much as the employment and labor of their poor amounted to  from this part of national ill husbandry no body could be supposed to receive any benefit except the exporter and the wool master so they call the gentlemen of galloway roxburgh shire etc whose estates are very much depending upon sheep  this being the occasion of the rising the prices of their wool and their advantage being thus begun in the error and injury of their country it seemed to be no national affair to make good the loss that was supposed now to happen by the union which was indeed but reducing things to where they were before and taking away that advantage which if the eyes of their representatives in former parliaments had been open they had never had and which it was the great loss of the whole kingdom that they ever had at all  however the parliament who going upon the great scheme of equalities so often mentioned appeared willing to make all people easy were ready and forward enough to have an allowance by way of equivalent given to the gentlemen that were sheep masters and who should be pinched by the falling of the price of their wool but then it was debated in what manner that equivalent should be given for to give to particular persons such and such a sum of money would seem partial and be short of the design as it would be some personal satisfaction indeed but no national satisfaction the money given therefore ought to be for the public good and this could be by no method so exactly stated to the circumstance as by appropriating the money to such gentlemen who being wool masters would apply that money to the manufacturing that wool in their own country thereby both increasing the consumption of the wool and setting the poor of their respective countries to work  this scheme had too much equity in it and too much of the public good in it to be disliked nor did those that opposed it pretend to object much against the reasonableness of it but still it was opposed and the reasons for which it was opposed were manifest  the party who as i have all along noted sought some occasion or other to break off the treaty had now this method only left viz to clog the affair with such amendments or alterations which they knew england either would not or could not grant  nor did they stick in conversation honestly to own that they did not dislike the reasons of several things that they opposed were they consenting to the union in general but they were against the union and therefore they were obliged to oppose the particulars in order to oppose the general  these gentlemen therefore very warmly argued for a freedom of exportation of wool and for having it made a clause in the articles which if they had gained they easily foresaw the union must split upon that rock for that england who have made it felony and always prohibited the export of their wool under the greatest penalties neither would or indeed could come into it  it was urged this liberty of exporting wool might be restrained to scotland only that it was absolutely necessary to scotland for that they could not manufacture all their wool in their own country that their wool was coarse and did not injure the english trade since all their manufactures were of fine wool that if scotland could not manufacture their wool nor should be suffered to export it the wool would be of no use but must perish and be good for nothing that the manufactures now set up in scotland being chiefly fine goods were generally made of english wool and after the union the wool from england being generally brought in thither the wool of scotland would be of no manner of value  but these arguments were answered thus that to allow the exportation of wool from scotland only would oblige the government to keep still on the borders an army of officers to search and examine the passage of all goods passing between the kingdoms and keep up that distinction of kingdoms which as to trade as well as government was to be wholly taken away by the union  that after all it would be impossible to prevent the carrying of wool into scotland and consequently the exportation of english wool with or instead of scots wool  in the next place this would oblige the government of britain to a strict prohibition of the bringing any english wool into scotland after the union lest the same should be exported which after its being in scotland could not be so distinguished as to be prevented and that this prohibition would rob scotland of all that advantage which it is proposed she shall enjoy after the union by her people being employed in the manufacturing of english wool  again that this would destroy all freedom of commerce and communication of trade between the kingdoms that all vessels to and from scotland must be visited and searched equally with strangers and the face of an union be ruffled with continued jealousies of and watchings against clandestine trade  lastly that it was inconsistent with the public good of scotland in its proportion as much as of england and that it would effectually destroy the hopes of scotlands increasing in manufactures and encouraging her trade by the employment of her poor  as to the consumption it was urged that england was always a market for wool where it might be sold without fail at some price or other and if the price was low just then that was but a common calamity the effect of the long war with france and spain in which they had still a share with their neighbors but that the wool of scotland would always sell as well as the wool of england in proportion to its fineness and this led of course to the first proposal that what encouragement was possible to be given to the wool masters by the treaty should be given them on the conditions of setting the poor to work in their respective countries which in that case would have this double advantage   the employment and subsistence of the poor and   the consumption of the wool at home which directly took off the pretended necessity of exporting it to other countries for want of a vent of it at home or their sending it to england to be sold as they called it for little or nothing how well this money was paid after the union or when paid how well applied to the common good of scotland is none of my business here to enquire  i have been the longer in stating this case because it has been often objected to the scots members of parliament that they were too forward to comply with the prohibition of wool and that their country lost a great advantage by it  there was a pretended expedient then offered about the manner of disposing the equivalent to such persons as had such or such certain quantities of tarrd wool but the reasonableness of the above proposal prevailed against any other and therefore it needs not be enquired into  minute xxxviii monday    december   0  prayers said  rolls called  address of barons freeholders and others within the shire of berwick subscribers of the same against an union with england in the terms of the articles given in and read  a scurrilous print asserting the dependency of the crown and kingdom of scotland upon the crown and kingdom of england brought in and several paragraphs thereof being read  ordered that the said scurrilous print be burned by the hand of the common hangman at the market cross of edinburgh to morrow betwixt eleven and twelve of the clock and the magistrates of edinburgh appointed to see the same punctually done  an eighth report from the committee to whom the sixth article of union was remitted brought in and read in these terms viz the committee of parliament to whom the sixth article of the treaty was remitted having considered the remit to them with the books of rates both for scotland and england and the several acts of parliament relating thereto the schemes or abstracts from the customhouse books given in to them from the council of trade and the report thereanent of their subcommittee who on a report from them had compared the customs and duties on export and import settled in england with these settled in scotland and had calculated the duties payable in scotland upon tarr tobacco iron dails single and double trees lint and lintseed and compared the same with the duties payable upon the same goods in england at a medium of the three years whereof they had the said abstracts from the customhouse books they find that as to the customs and duties on export and import in general the customs in scotland belong to the crown and are perpetual whereas those in england terminate at a certain number of years viz about two fifteen parts thereof at  th march   0  years nine fifteen parts thereof at  st august    0 about three fifteen parts thereof continue only during her majestys life and about one fifteen part thereof for ninety five years and that the duties upon exportation which were granted   o car   cap   are easy have never been augmented save upon a very few particulars and terminate the first of august    0 that these goods which contribute to luxury and those that are manufactured or can be had within the island are those that pay high duties when imported but that the whole or most of the customs and duties paid at importation are drawn back upon exportation if exported within a certain time except a moiety of old subsidy which is very small and which is imposed by the foresaid act   o car   cap   and terminates the first of august    0 that the duties upon the beforementioned goods at the above medium payable in scotland by the nearest calculation can be made amounts to        l    sh   d and now payable in england to        l   sh   d and payable in england after    0 to      0 l   sh   d scots and the duties upon our linen cloth and cattle imported into england by the above medium amounts to        l   sh  0 d money foresaid so that it is the opinion of the committee the duties after    0 will be much easier than now they are and even as they stand now payable in england considering the duties that are upon scots goods imported into england and taken off by the treaty the customs of scotland taken together even before the first of august    0 will be easier than now they are  and after some reasoning thereon a state of a vote was offered approve of the sixth article of union as explained and enlarged or not  but it being moved that the vote could not be stated in these terms in respect what concerned the african company fell under the said sixth article which was to be considered  whereupon it was agreed that what concerns the african company shall be entire and be taken into consideration under the fifteenth article and that the approving of the sixth article shall not be prejudicial thereto  and the above state for a vote being again proposed after some debate it was moved that the said article should be further amended and thereupon a second state of a vote was offered in these terms approve or amend  whereupon the said sixth article with the several additions enlargements and explanations aftermentioned contained in several former minutes viz the word drawback to be insert in both clauses of the said article item and seeing by the laws of england notwithstanding there are rewards granted upon exportation of certain kinds of grain wherein oats grinded or ungrinded are not specified that from and after the union when oats shall be at fifteen shillings sterling per quarter or under there shall be paid two shillings and six pence sterling for every quarter of the oat meal exported in the terms of the law whereby and so long as rewards are granted for exportation of other grains and that the bear of scotland have the same rewards as barley item and in respect the importation of victual into scotland from any part beyond sea would prove a discouragement to tillage therefore that the prohibitions as now in force by the law of scotland against importation of victual from ireland or any other place beyond sea into scotland do after the union remain in the same force as now it is until more proper and effectual ways be provided by the parliament of great britain for discouraging the importation of the said victual from beyond sea item excepting and reserving the duties upon export and import of such particular commodities from which any persons the subjects of either kingdom are specially liberated and exempted by their private rights which after the union are to remain safe and entire to them in all respects as before the same item that from and after the union no scots cattle carried into england shall be liable to any other duties either on the public or private accounts than these duties to which the cattle of england are or shall be liable within the said kingdom being all read over it was put to the vote whether the first or second should be the state of the vote and it carried first  then the vote was put approve of the said sixth article enlarged and explained or not and it carried approve  draught of an act for additional proemiums on exportation of victual to commence the first of february and to end the last of april both next to come again read and a first reading ordered to be marked thereon  the eighth article of union read and the first clause or paragraph thereof was also again read  whereupon a report brought in from the committee to whom the said eighth article is remitted was read in these terms the committee to whom the eighth article of union anent duties upon salt was remitted are of opinion that after the first clause of the said article an explanation in the terms following will be necessary  but in regard the duties of great quantities of foreign salt imported may be very heavy upon the merchants importers that therefore all foreign salt imported shall be cellard and locked up under the custody of the merchant importer and officers employed for levying the duties upon salt and that the merchant may have what quantities thereof his occasion may require not under a wey or forty bushel at a time giving security for the duty of what quantity he receives payable in six months  and after some reasoning thereon the further consideration of the said eighth article and report was delayed till the next sederunt of parliament  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation xxxviii the long report of the committee on this point of the customs is very distinct but may require some explanation and in order to that it is necessary to enter into the short history of the reason of this calculation  two great complaints ran through the whole nation upon the subject of taxes and trade   that the english clogged the trade of scotland with intolerable burdens and   that they raised their customs and would gain great sums of money from scotland by doing so for the scots had no notion of the equivalent nor would they for along time after this entertain any notion of it  in order to clear up the objections of the people against the customs the particular heads were referred to this committee to examine  the first were the duties on import which the committee observed very well in england is always laid highest on such goods as contribute to luxury or are manufactured within the island the first esteemed less necessary such as wine brandy foreign linen fruit druggs east india goods coffee tea sugars tobacco deals timber etc things we might live without or might supply in part at home or being willing to have and being generally used by the richer sort of people the payments are less felt the second for the encouragement of our own poor who ought upon all occasions to be employed and if any thing which comes from abroad can be made at home that homepart ought to be encouraged by laying high duties and imposts or perhaps prohibitions on the like from abroad such are the prohibitions of or high duties on wrought silks woollen manufactures bone lace brasil sugar wrought iron hats glass printed callicoes pantiles earthen ware etc  it was now objected in scotland that the customs there would be very grievous that the english duties on tar tobacco iron deals and timber lint and lintseed would be intolerable to the poor and raise the customs of scotland to a very great height  the committee examined the proportions of things and setting the whole upon an equality produced a very well grounded conclusion that the customs of scotland would be less to be paid after the union than before and it gave great satisfaction at that time to those people who were capable of receiving impressions from just calculations when the calculations of this committee really stated the balance of trade for that was easy to draw out of these calculations it had been offered in the parliament with how little foundation or how much assurance i shall not determine   that scotland got nothing by the english trade   that scotland were considerable gainers by the french trade  i shall not censure the people that offered this as aiming at a french union not an english for they did not stick to own that but it is not to the purpose here  i shall only consider the state of the trade of either kingdom as it stood at this time and as it was stated to the parliament  the trade to france stood thus exported to france from scotland wool leather lead and fish imported from france to scotland wine brandy wrought silks hats glass cork rosin fruit and toys    the several quantities of these however uncertain as the trade increased or decreased had nevertheless this general proportion that the wine and brandy imported into scotland did over and above balance all the export out of scotland to france by above one half part the consequence of which was that the french trade must draw away ready money from scotland for the other half besides all the other imports from thence over and above this consideration that all the import from france was mere luxury and unnecessary consumption  as to the state of the trade between scotland and england it stood thus imports to scotland from england house furniture coaches horses etc by the gentry which might be estimated at  0000 lib per annum tobacco in one year from november      to november   00         amounts to about   000 l sterling per an sugars and grocery not in very great quantities being supplied chiefly from holland perhaps in the whole  0000 lib per annum all the english woollen manufacture prohibited exports to england from scotland in the year as per contra linen cloth         else cattle of all sorts   0   linen yarn stockings fingrams and stirling serges quantity uncertain    note the tobaccos and sugars after the union may and it is not questioned will be imported into scotland from the british plantations in return for the growth and produce of their own country so that the whole trade to england after the union would turn to the interest and advantage of scotland  nor can i omit to add the experiment of this to prove that these calculations were not suppositions and remote since in the very first year after the union these consequences in trade visibly appeared and which of my own certain knowledge i can take the freedom to advance   that on the falling of the english duty on scots linen the demand was so great for scots linen for the english markets that it not only swept all the linen away so that two months before the usual time the whole quantity was gone and the english merchants could get no linen for money but the whole manufacture of linen advanced at least two pence an ell upon the finer scots linen and one penny per ell on the coarser sorts which was a great sum in the whole   in the very first year after the union scotland shipped away for england besides several ships laden for portugal and other foreign parts above   0000 boll of corn above  0000 boll of which was carried out of the two small counties of merss or berwick shire and tiviotdale  0000 boll and more out of the single county of fife and the rest from the shires adjoining to the firth and some parts from the north   in the first year after the union the scots fitted out several ships i think seven or eight to the english plantations fraighted with their own produce the return of which being in tobacco or sugars etc have this advantage to scotland that first the said tobacco and sugars supply their own consumption and keep that money at home which used to go to england and holland to purchase their supply and   dly the overplus which they can not expend they export to holland and ireland which returns to the advantage of the public stock   in the very first year after the union scotland had three or four ships returned home from italy and portugal bringing home wines from leghorn and galitia these being the return of fish from scotland could now return with their fraights to their own country where before by reason of the french wines they could have no consumption but were obliged to load to other ports and come home empty   if any man pleases to calculate these things and see the advantages of these foreign trades and particular of the english and the return of money that must by consequence be made to scotland annually by such a trade and again how little of any kind of goods scotland takes from england in the room of it except what they took from holland before the supposition of the comparison between the english trade and the french trade as to an advantage to scotland must fall to the ground and the true state of the balance must have been something like if not exactly thus that in an open trade with france scotland must have paid france  00000 pounds sterling per annum in specie or their balance of trade would have been against scotland  00000 pounds per annum at least that in the trade with england scotland will receive from england at least  00000 pounds per annum in specie or the balance of trade will run on the side of scotland  00000 pounds per annum   and yet this is no loss to england either since the island being now made but one kingdom this wealth while it goes but to scotland circulates in her own bounds and speaking of britain is all contained and preserved within her self  minute xxxix tuesday    december   0  prayers said  rolls called  the first clause or paragraph of the eighth article of union again read with the report of the committee in relation thereto for explanation of the same insert in the former days minutes  and after reasoning thereupon the vote was stated approve of the said first paragraph with the report of the committee for explanation of the same yea or not  and before voting the said paragraph and report of the committee for explanation of the same were again read  then the vote was put approve or not and it carried approve  then that clause of the said eighth article of union anent the salting of the flesh for exportation or victualling of ships read as also a report of the committee relative thereto for altering the same which after some reasoning was amended and again read in these terms and for establishing an equality in trade that all fleshes exported from scotland to england and put on board in scotland to be exported to parts beyond the seas and provisions for ships in scotland and for foreign voyages may be salted with scots salt paying the same duty for what salt is so employed as the like quantity of such salt pays in england and under the same penalties forfeitures and provisions for preventing of frauds mentioned in the english laws  and after further reasoning thereon it was put to the vote approve of the report as amended or not and it carried approve  then the following clause of the said eighth article of union in relation to the continuing in force the laws and acts of parliament in scotland for pining curing and packing of herrings white fish and salmond for exportation with foreign salt only and for preventing of frauds in curing and packing of fish was read as also a report brought in from the committee for adding a clause thereto in these terms but in respect it appears from the books of the royal fisherie company confirmed by practice that the quantity of  0   0    00 of pound weight aver de pois of foreign salt which pays eight shillings and four pence of duty is necessary for the right curing and packing a barrel of white herrings therefore there shall be allowed and paid during the present allowances for other fishes for every barrel of white herrings which shall be exported ten shillings sterling  thereafter a petition of the salt owners fishers of herring and white fish and others who make use of scots salt was given in craving that such amendments might be made to the said eighth article of union as would put them in an equal footing with their neighbors in england with regard to their salt and also the freedom of making salt upon salt  which being read after some debate thereon and upon the above last insert report of the committee the further consideration thereof was delayed till the next sederunt of parliament  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation xxxix the report of the committee on the first paragraph of the eighth article is printed in the precedent minute relating to the duties on salt  the payment of equal duties on foreign salt was not objected but it was argued that the scots merchants being poor and being nevertheless obliged to import large quantities of foreign salt at the proper times which must ly by till the season for using the same and the duties being now very large which were to be paid they might not be able either to advance the money or find sufficient security for the duties as the law in that case provided  and therefore this amendment was made for the ease of the merchant which was both reasonable to the government and easy to the merchant and took off all pretense of quarrel upon the disburse of money or lying out of stock  the second report upon the eight article was founded upon equal reasoning it had been agreed in england in the said eighth article that all flesh salted in scotland and carried to england or flesh salted in scotland for victualling ships or exportation should be forfeited if cured with scots salt  but this was counted a hardship on several accounts and england being allowed to cure all sorts of flesh with their own whether for their own consumption victualling of ships or exportation it ought to be also allowed to scotland by virtue of the subjects enjoying equal allowances and restrictions article vi wherefore the committee made this amendment that the scots might cure flesh with their own salt provided all flesh so cured that was either sent for england or used in victualling ships or exported for sale should be charged with the duty on salt paid in england  the third report upon the eighth article concerned the laws in force in scotland for curing and packing of herring white fish and salmond which by this article were reserved these laws were the   th act   d session   st parliament king william and queen mary appointing all herrings and salmond for export be made pined and cured with french bay or spanish salt or with salt upon salt made of foreign salt the    th act   th session of the same parliament confirming the same and directing the proof of it with a confirmation of the   th act of   d session of the same parliament for drawbacks on herrings and salmond exported  but upon this new treaty respecting the english duty on salt it was calculated as you see in the minute that the salt commonly used in curing a barrel of herring amounted to about nine shillings per barrel and in regard of the wasting of the salt loss in carrying etc they resolved to put it at ten shillings per barrel which fully answered the petition of the fish and salt merchants mentioned in the same minute  minute xl wednesday    december   0  prayers said  rolls called  address of the town and parochin of lawder and chainhilkirk subscribing the same and address of heretors liferenters elders parochioners and remanent indwellers in the paroch of calder subscribers of the same both against an union with england in the terms of the articles given in and read  thereafter another report brought in from the committee to whom the eighth article of union is remitted was read in these terms that white herrings red herring salmond dry or barrelled cod and all fishes cured or packed in order to exportation ought to be cured and packed with foreign salt allennarly and that it does require four bolls of foreign salt to cure and pack a last of white herrings  and after much debate thereupon a motion was made for amending that clause of the said eighth article of union mentioned in the former days minutes in relation to the continuing in force the laws and acts of parliament in scotland for pining curing and packing of herrings white fish and salmond for exportation with foreign salt only by adding these words thereto without any mixture of british or irish salt  and the addition being accordingly made the clause as so amended was read over  and after some further debate the vote was put approve the said clause as amended yea or not and it carried approve  thereafter it was proposed that the parliament should proceed to consider the drawbacks  and it was also proposed that the parliament should proceed to consider how far allowance should be given for importation of foreign salt in order to the making salt upon salt the further consideration whereof was delayed till the next sederunt of parliament  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation xl the report of the committee last day was now only considered with relation to the main part of the question whether their fish should be cured with foreign salt only or not and it was agreed it should be so  it was counted a very great hardship that the fish cured in scotland should not be cured but with foreign salt some people alleging that the salt made in scotland would cure the herring as well as foreign salt  but it had been found by experience that the fish cured with scots salt did not keep nor was it equal in goodness when it came to market which added to the disputes which would arise in the article of the drawbacks now coming on to be debated made the parliament positive in that part viz that all fish cured for exportation should be cured with foreign salt without any mixture of british salt  in giving drawbacks and allowances for the exportation of fish on account of the salt it had here been impossible to come to an equality since no officer could have been sure which had been cured with british salt and which with foreign salt and which with a mixture of either  it was then alleged that the dutch importing their salt from st vbies remake the salt boiling it again when they come to holland which they call salt upon salt and that their herring are cured with the said salt which being of a finer and subtiler quality than the other salt is of advantage to their said trade and that the aforesaid encouragement should be given to the scots to do the same  but this came to nothing  minute xli thursday    december   0  prayers said  rolls called  thereafter the last clause of the eighth article of union in relation to the allowing of proemiums and drawbacks was read as also a report brought in from the committee to whom the said eighth article was remitted insert in the minutes of the   th instant number    in these terms but in respect it appears from the books of the royal fisherie company confirmed by practice that the quantity of  0   0    00 of pound weight aver de pois of foreign salt which pays eight shillings and four pence of duty is necessary for the right curing and packing a barrel of whiteherrings therefore there shall be paid during the present allowances for other fishes for every barrel of white herrings which shall be exported ten shillings sterling  and another report brought in from the said committee was also read in these terms that sixteen shillings and eight pence upon every barrel of salmond six shilling and eight pence upon every barrel of redherrings that two pound ten shillings upon every hundred codfish ling or haick of twenty four inches and upwards from the bone in the finn to the third joint of the tail one pound fifteen shillings sterling for every such fish of the length of eighteen inches and upwards and under twenty four inches and one moiety of the foresaid allowance for every such fish dried commonly called haverdens of the like dimensions being the drawbacks allowed by the english laws upon the exportation of these fishes are sufficient encouragements  and after reasoning on the above several reports it being moved a higher drawback should be allowed upon the exportation of white herring  after some debate thereon the said last clause of the eighth article of union was agreed to with this addition that there shall be allowed and paid to the subjects inhabitants of great britain during the present allowances for other fishes for every barrel of white herrings which shall be exported from scotland ten shillings and five pence sterling  thereafter another report brought in from the said committee was likewise read in these terms that there ought to be no drawback upon the exportation of salted beef and pork and after debate thereupon the further consideration thereof was delayed till the next sederunt of parliament  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation xli the difficulty now lay about settling the drawbacks upon the exportation of fish  and the rule the committee had gone upon seemed the readiest way to determine it viz they laid the english drawbacks before them and examined then the quantity of salt used in curing every respective kind of fish and then comparing the whole tried whether the drawback allowed was adequate and proportioned to the duty paid upon the quantity of salt used in the curing  now though this was exactly calculated and presented to the house yet several motions and speeches were made for a larger drawback some alleged the necessity of encouraging the fishery in scotland and that therefore the government ought to make larger allowances but when they saw that whatever the allowance should be which they should obtain the english would obtain the same they dropped that part of the argument  the herrings indeed they had longer debates about and after some reasonings upon the waste of the salt the carriage and other pretenses they obtained the allowance of ten shillings and five pence to be paid to the exporter for every barrel of herrings cured with foreign salt and exported which was five pence per barrel more than the committee had at first determined  minute xlii friday  0 december   0  prayers said  rolls called  then the debate mentioned in the minutes of the last sederunt in relation to the allowing of drawbacks upon the exportation of beef and pork was resumed and after some further debate thereupon the vote was stated approve of the report of the committee or alter  and before voting it was agreed that the members votes shall be marked and that the list of their names as they shall vote shall be printed and recorded  then the vote was put approve or alter and it carried alter  thereafter moved that the parliament now proceed to the consideration of what drawbacks shall be allowed upon the exportation of beef and pork  moved also that the consideration thereof be delayed till the next sederunt of parliament and after some reasoning  agreed that the consideration of what drawbacks shall be allowed upon exportation of beef and pork be delayed till next sederunt of parliament  observation xlii the drawbacks proposed upon beef and pork to be exported were now the subject of debate it had been examined in the committee and they finding that   the english had no allowance made them on beef and pork cured for exportation and   that the quantity of beef and pork so salted and exported out of england or out of scotland was very inconsiderable had reported that there ought to be no drawbacks upon the exportation of salted beef and pork as in the minute of december   th  but when this came to be debated in the parliament it was all unravelled again some gentlemen would have it that scotland was able to export great quantities of beef salted and cured to foreign parts nay some had before carried it further and in their arguing for a trade with france had advanced what had never before been heard of viz that scotland should supply france with beef as they have formerly been supplied from ireland and proposed infinite advantages from such a trade   but these gentlemen were soon silenced when it was examined a little upon what conditions and in what quantities ireland was able to supply and did supply not france and our island colonies only but were able to supply all the parts of the world where beef was generally exported  that at that time beef in any quantity was to be bought ready cured in ireland including the salt and the cask it was packed in at a halfpenny sterling per pound and that england was so convinced of this that they could export no flesh but sent their ships generally to ireland to load beef for their islands and that france upon all occasions got their beef if possible from ireland for the victualling their navys and merchant ships  again that the cattle in ireland were larger and fatter than in scotland and their quantity so great that england was obliged to prohibit their being brought over thither otherwise they would over run the three kingdoms with the quantity and that scotland having less quantity of feeding grounds and their cattle being generally lesser it was not possible that they could supply the quantity of beef or any thing near the price with the irish and that therefore it could not be supposed the exportation of beef from scotland could be considerable any more than from england and on this foot it was that the committee made their report that it was not needful to allow any drawback upon the exportation of beef england at the same time having no allowances granted in the same case  but a new objection turned the scale  it was offered by some that in the north east parts of scotland viz at aberdeen and the country adjacent there was a new and very advantageous trade lately erected for feeding swine which being made fat with corn in great quantities and that being a consumption of the produce of the land the flesh was cured and salted barrelled and exported to holland for sale  and that this was a trade which ought to be encouraged it was added that this as it was an advantageous trade to scotland so it was a growing trade and might in time increase to a very great degree the dutch demanding every year more quantities than the country had been yet able to supply that there had been several years exported from   00 to  000 barrels of salted pork  from scotland to holland the dutch using the same for victualling their east india ships and other ships that went upon long voyages  this had some appearance of argument in it and being pushed very heartily at in behalf of the aberdeen merchants brought the parliament to alter the report and agree to an allowance upon the exportation of pork and afterward of beef and pork the beef being brought in by the by  it had been said as above that the irish beef was exported cheaper than scotland could afford it  it was therefore argued that scotland ought to have the drawback allowed on their beef to encourage the exportation and if possible to set them upon an equal foot with ireland in the trade of exporting beef which though it was proved was not probable yet as the affirmative carried some possibility and the negative seemed to be of no great consequence the members came in to it and they passed together  minute xliii monday    december   0  prayers said  rolls called  then the parliament proceeded to the consideration of what drawbacks shall be allowed upon the exportation of beef and pork  and after some debate thereon a clause was offered in relation thereto in these terms and that there shall be allowed four shillings seven pence half penny sterling for every barrel of beef or pork salted with foreign salt and exported for sale alterable by the parliament of great britain and after further reasoning  agreed that the drawbacks shall be five shillings sterling for every barrel of beef or pork and the clause was accordingly so amended and read  thereafter it was proposed that the said drawback shall not be alterable by the parliament of great britain during the continuance of the duty upon salt in england  and after some debate there were two states of a vote offered the first in these terms approve of the above clause viz and that there shall be allowed five shillings sterling for every barrel of beef or pork salted with foreign salt and exported for sale alterable by the parliament of great britain yea or not and the second state in these terms continue the proemium of five shillings upon the barrel of beef and pork till the same be altered by the parliament of great britain or during the imposition on salt  and after some reasoning which of the two should be the state of the vote first or second it was put to the vote first or second  and before voting it was agreed that the members votes shall be marked and that the list of their names as they shall vote shall be printed and recorded  then the vote was put first or second and it carried first  thereafter it was put to the vote approve the clause or not and it carried approve  thereafter the clauses of the eighth article of union in relation to scots salt were read and the first clause or paragraph thereof again read and after some reasoning thereon it was moved that the exemption from the duty of scots salt provided by the said clause to be for seven years shall be perpetual and after some further debate the consideration thereof was delayed till next sederunt of parliament to be then resumed previous to all other business  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation xliii the debates about the drawbacks on beef and pork ended now in a short question whether it should be four shillings seven pence per barrel or five shillings  and the difference being of no great consequence the same arguments that carried it before to have any drawback at all carried it now to have that drawback settled at the largest rate of the two so that affair ended  then the house proceeded to the grand affair the exemptions from the salt tax in england  great quarrels were raised at the concessions made by the treaters in this case who had exempted scotland from the duties on salt payable in england for seven years only whereas it was alleged that the salt tax was a burden intolerable for scotland and that they would no more be able to bear that duty in seven years than now and that therefore they ought not to have subjected scotland to it at all that it had been allowed the salt tax was a burden chiefly laid upon the poor the poor people in scotland feeding much upon salt meats and using great quantities of salt  that to lay a tax on their salt was to assist in starving them and the like  this was an argument so pleasing and so much improved without doors that it made the opposers of the union grow popular and seem as if they were but mere advocates for the poor that they were now really defending their country which the commissioners had abandoned and showed that the concern for the burdening scotland with unreasonable exactions had not been part of their business  great hopes therefore were conceived from this debate by some people who had the destruction of the treaty chiefly in their eyes for as the struggle had not been small in england to obtain an exemption from the salt tax to scotland for seven years it was more than probable that if a perpetual exemption was insisted on the english parliament would refuse it and so the union might split upon that rock which being so specious and seeming to be all done in mere concern for the poor of scotland would therefore engage all the people of scotland in defense of it  but this cloud vanished afterward though at first it looked black enough  minute xliv tuesday    december   0  prayers said  rolls called  address of gentlemen and heretors of the parochins of mayboll kirkmichael girvan kirkoswald and bar and of the magistrates and town council of mayboll and other inhabitants of the said parochins within the jurisdiction of carrick subscribes of the same against an union with england in the terms of the articles given in and read  thereafter these clauses of the eighth article of union in relation to scots salt were again read  and after some reasoning thereon a clause was given in to be added thereto in these terms and with proportional drawbacks and allowances as in england with this exception that scotland after the said seven years shall remain exempted from the duty of two shillings and four pence a bushel on home salt imposed by an act made in england in the ninth and tenth of king william the third of england and if the parliament of great britain shall at or before the expiring of the said seven years substitute any other fund in place of the said two shillings and four pence of excise on the bushel of home salt scotland shall after the said seven years bear a proportion of the said fund and have an equivalent in the terms of the treaty  and after further reasoning on the said clause another clause was given in in these terms but scotland shall in all time after the union be exempted from paying of all duty or tax on salt made in scotland in so far allennarly as the said salt shall be made use of within that part of great britain now called scotland but all salt made in scotland from and after the union that shall be exported to that part of great britain now called england or to any other nation in specie or that shall be employed in salting of fish or flesh to be exported or for victualling of ships to go to england or any other nation shall be liable to the same duties as shall be then payable for salt made in england to be levied and secured in the same manner and with the like drawbacks and allowances as in england and that after the union no salt whatsoever be brought from scotland to england by land in any manner under the penalty of  and after further debate on the said two clauses the vote was stated approve of the first clause or second  but before voting it was agreed that the members votes shall be marked and that the list of their names as they shall vote be printed and recorded  and the duke of athole gave in the following protest whereas salt is the most useful and necessary ingredient in all sorts of victuals any duties or excise on the same may prove a most grievous and insupportable burden especially on the commons i do therefore protest for my self and in name of all who shall adhere that the people of this kingdom now called scotland shall be free for ever of any duties and excises on the salt made within this kingdom  which being read he took instruments thereupon  then the vote was put approve of the first clause or the second and it carried first and at calling of the rolls the duke of hamilton the marquess of annandale the earl of errol the earl of marischal the earl of caithness the earl of wigtoun the earl of galloway the earl of selkirk the viscount of stormount the viscount of kilsyth the lord saltoun the lord oliphant the lord balmerino the lord blantyre the

mackenzie of inchcoulter alexander robertson alexander watson alexander edgar john black francis molison robert scot robert kellie archibald sheills mr john lion sir david cuninghame george home and mr robert frazer adhered to the duke of atholes protest  thereafter it was moved to read over the said eighth article of union with the several additions and alterations in order to the approving thereof  but it being moved that the said article with the additions and alterations should be first transcribed the same was delayed till the next sederunt of parliament  adjourned till thursday next at ten of the clock  observation xliv the debate of the last day being renewed occasioned some warmth in the house and great arguings there were about the poor in scotland being unable to pay the tax upon salt at all and that therefore they ought not to be left to the mercy of the british parliament the matters also of the disproportion in the duties to the value in the respective kingdoms was also made a strong motive against the duty being laid upon the scots as a plain inequality since as the duty on salt lay then being taxed by weight the scots should pay sixteen shillings four pence upon what in their country yielded exclusive of the duty but three shillings whereas the english should pay no more on the value of ten shillings six pence which was a great disparity in the taxation by value  but to this it was answered if the bulk or quantity of salt was equal and scotland having their salt made just where it was expended had or could buy as much for three shillings as the english had or could buy for ten shillings six pence the weight of the salt being the same they were so much the better able to pay sixteen shillings four pence on that quantity of salt in scotland by how much it was had cheaper by seven shillings six pence in its first cost than the english were who were obliged to pay seven shillings six pence for the same quantity in its first cost than the scots paid  to this again was objected the poverty of scotland and the difference this made in the price of salt to the poor how necessary the salt was to the subsistence of the poor and how much it would raise the price to the general discouragement and impoverishing the laboring part of the people the english duties being very near one penny per pound sterling upon the salt most of which duty would ly on those who were least able to bear it and this as i noted before made the argument become popular and the opposers of the union began to be counted patriots who strove merely for the securing their country from unreasonable and insupportable taxes  it is necessary to note here in order to let the reader into a true state of this question what the english duties on salt were which were thus strenuously argued against  they were in short thus twelve pence per bushel on salt each bushel to weigh fifty six pound aver du pois weight granted by the english parliament anno  o william and mary appropriated to the year    0 twenty eight pence per bushel weighing as above granted   th king william and appropriated for the payment of annuities redeemable by parliament as may more at large be seen in the appendix  the treaters at london had agreed on both hands to exempt scotland from the whole tax upon salt for seven years as appears in the observations on the minutes of the eighth article in that treaty  but had then left it  with a concession that then scotland should pay as england should pay at that time  only it was supposed the british parliament would consider whether scotland was any better able to pay then than before  according to that clause added in the fourteenth article viz that it could not be supposed that the parliament of great britain would ever lay any sorts of burdens upon the united kingdom but what they should find of necessity at that time for the preservation and good of the whole  and with due regard to the circumstances and abilities of every part of the united kingdom  but it was again alleged that the words in this eighth article viz but from the expiration of the said seven years scotland shall be liable to the same duties for salt made in scotland as shall be then payable for salt made in england vide the treaty at london article viii page   th obliged the scots to the payment and put it out of the power of the parliament of great britain to alter it and that therefore the parliament of scotland ought to take effectual care to prevent it and to secure the people of scotland against it  there were a great many speeches made on this subject and something harsh enough past on both sides which i care not to relate  for the sakes of the gentlemen that showed themselves a little out of temper here  but at length a medium was proposed in the terms of the first clause of the minute which exempted scotland from the two shillings four pence per bushel mentioned above and appropriated to the east india company and let the twelve pence per bushel stand as a thing not of so much consequence   because the sum was not so considerable as to make it insupportable to the poor   it was not appropriated to any payment further than to the year    0 and so might determine in a short time whereas the two shillings four pence per bushel was actually settled as a fund for payment of annuities for ninety nine years and must certainly fall upon scotland at the end of seven years  this seemed a very reasonable proposal though it did not answer the end of these gentlemen whose aim as i hinted before was at the treaty in general  for it was a moderating between both bearing a part which they could bear and yet taking off that part which the poor were said to be pinched by and which they pretended would effectually have raised a national discontent  the gentlemen on the other side were a little silenced with this proposal  they at first indeed positively insisted as in the d of a  ls protest that scotland should be for ever free etc of all duties on salt  but they were subdued by the reasonings of the other gentlemen upon the equity of the above proposal and unless as in general objecting against the whole treaty there was no withstanding it  yet after some debating there was found an exception to this too and that was that though the two shillings four pence was thus provided against it was but a single term and the parliament of great britain might set that duty aside and lay some other tax on in the room of it which might be the same thing or worse and so this exemption might be eluded and this they called without doors a design to trepan scotland or draw her into the snare of the duty under the pretense of an exemption  but this was soon warded against and the latter part of the clause effectually stopped that gap viz that if the parliament of great britain shall at or before the expiring of the said seven years substitute any other fund in the place of the said two shillings four pence of excise on the bushel of home salt  scotland shall after the said seven years bear a proportion of the said fund but shall have an equivalent in the terms of the treaty that is in the terms of the fourteenth article which says that scotland shall have an equivalent for what the subjects thereof shall be charged toward payment of the debts of england in all particulars whatsoever vide treaty at london art    page    this brought the matter of debate to an end and there was nothing left but to put the vote  the other party offered a clause of general and absolute exemption as per the minute  but it was voted not to be the state of the question so the affair ended with the d of a  ls protest as per the minute  yet it must be observed that this step taken by the parliament went a great way to stop the mouths of the people who began to be strangely alarmed at the apprehensions of the salt duty which was cried out upon as insupportable but their being wholly exempted from it for seven years and for ever exempt from all but twelve pence per bushel the burden was both lessened in the main and remote in prospect and so the general clamor wore off  it was indeed a great abatement to that article as stated at london and some people flattered themselves with the hopes that it would occasion some debates in the parliament in england and perhaps suffer some alterations there which might occasion the returning the whole to scotland again  but that view proved fictitious and the gentlemen found themselves disappointed  minute xlv thursday    december   0  prayers said  rolls called  address of parochioners of clackmannan subscribers of the same against an union with england in the terms of the articles given in and read  thereafter the eighth article of union with the several alterations additions and inlargements was twice read over  and the vote being stated approve of the said eighth article as amended or not it carried approve  then the second clause of the fifteenth article of union beginning with these words and in regard that after the union scotland and after some reasoning thereon it was agreed to  the third clause of the said fifteenth article beginning with these words and for the further and more effectual answering was also read and agreed to  the fourth clause beginning with these words and that upon the said account there shall be answered to scotland was likeways read and agreed to  the fifth clause of the said fifteenth article beginning with these words and whereas from the expiration of seven years was also read and ordered to be delete being determined by the eighth article  the sixth clause beginning and generally that an equivalent shall be answered to scotland was read and the words or salt appointed to be delete and after some reasoning on the said clause after deleting these words the vote was put approve of the said clause or not and it carried approve  then the seventh clause of the said fifteenth article beginning thus and as for the uses to which the said sum of three hundred ninety eight thousand was read as also the representation of the council general of the company of scotland trading to africa and the indies and the consideration of both delayed till next sederunt of parliament  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation xlv the eighth article was now passed without any more debates the amendments were all read being put together and as the house had ordered transcribed into form as you will find them in the treaty printed in the appendix  and now we are come to the great article of the equivalent which has of it self made more noise in the world than all the other articles and which though in it self founded upon the highest justice to scotland being the only mean to bring the discording circumstances of the nations to unite and was stated with the greatest exactness and the nicest and most unexceptionable calculations that the wit of man could perform yet it met with the greatest opposition and was treated with the most contempt in scotland of any other part of the union nay to that degree that when the very money it self came to be brought into scotland the common people were excited to that height as to call it the price of their country and to insult the very people that brought it  i must therefore be excused if the observations on this point exceed the bounds of that brevity i at first proposed to my self and that i endeavor to be as particular as possible upon this head  the first clause of this article had been voted and agreed to not without a great struggle in the parliament on the seventh of the same month of december as per the observations upon the minutes of that day appears to which i refer and the remaining part of the article was adjourned till the reports of the committee appointed to consider of the sixth and eighth articles were received and considered which being now ended the house proceeded to the subsequent articles  the first clause of the article was the main preliminary to the rest viz whether scotland should be obliged to come in to the appropriated duties of england and consequently have her revenues appropriated to the payment of the english debts receiving from england an equivalent  what that equivalent should be viz ready money how much it should be viz three hundred ninety eight thousand eighty five pounds ten shillings  and whether that sum was rightly calculated all this was determined as above  the second clause which came now to be debated was thus and in regard that after the union scotland becoming liable to the same customs and duties payable on import and export and to the same excises on all exciseable liquors as in england as well upon that account as upon the account of the increase of trade and people which will be the happy consequence of the union the said revenues will much improve beyond the before mentioned annual values thereof of which no present estimate can be made yet nevertheless for the reasons aforesaid there ought to be a proportionable equivalent answered to scotland it is agreed that after the union there shall be an account kept of the said duties arising in scotland to the end it may appear what ought to be answered to scotland as an equivalent for such proportion of the said increase as shall be applicable to the payment of the debts of england  this was only to oblige the persons appointed by the government to direct the treasury of britain that an exact account might be kept what part of the revenue of scotland was to be appropriate and for which the equivalent was to be raised in order also to come to a certainty in the measures which were to be taken with the remainder  and therefore this needed little debate yet it will occasion a further remark presently  the third clause runs thus and for the further and more effectual answering the several ends hereafter mentioned it is agreed that from and after the union the whole increase of the revenues of customs and duties on import and export and excise upon exciseable liquors in scotland over and above the annual produce of the said respective duties as above stated shall go and be applied for the term of seven years to the uses hereafter mentioned  this was a general referring also to the particulars to which the overplus of the revenue of scotland should be applied and this will also come to be discoursed of in its place being here passed of course  the fourth clause was and that upon the said account there shall be answered to scotland annually from the end of seven years after the union an equivalent in proportion to such part of the said increase as shall be applicable to the debts of england  this clause could admit no debate on the scots side since as they had agreed by the first clause to come into an equality of duties this was capitulating in behalf of scotland that an equivalent should be paid by england for so much of the revenues of scotland as should be applied to the english debts over and above what had been already stated in the equivalent named in the former clause  and here i shall take the freedom to quote what the former gentleman i quoted before gave as his opinion on this very head i mean mr baron clark whose judgment i think i may be allowed to appeal to and who was a witness to and present in parliament at all these debates see his essay on the    th article of the union page    th in these words    that which is most remarkable in this whole article and particularly to be taken notice of is this viz that from the commencement of the union the whole increase of the revenues of customs and duties on import and export and excise upon exciseable liquors over and above the annual produce of the said respective duties as above stated shall be applied for the term of seven years to the use and advantage of scotland the meaning whereof is hereby illustrated  suppose the customs of scotland after the union what upon the account of a greater trade or upon the account of taking upon us the english customs should increase to  0000 pounds sterling which i believe no trading man will doubt of then it is plain that in regard there is an increase of these customs of  0000 pounds above the present extent therefore that increase is by this paragraph allowed to scotland yearly for the foresaid term of seven years which will be a great encouragement to scotland and by consequence an advantage to the whole island since it is not to be doubted but such an annual sum of  0000 pounds will be employed during that time toward such ends and uses as will be most for the honor and advantage of this poor country  upon this concession of the increase of customs and excises for seven years it is likewise to be observed that the sum of       pounds that falls at september    0 abovementioned will likewise go for the remainder of the term of seven years after the union toward the behoof of scotland if so be that the customs and excises that raise that sum are continued and not appropriated for other uses    from the last part of the paragraph it is to be observed that there shall be answered to scotland annually after the expiration of the foresaid term of seven years an equivalent in proportion to such parts of the increase as shall be applied toward payment of the debts of england for explaining of which it may be observed  suppose after the foresaid term of seven years the customs of scotland should rise to   0000 pounds yearly which is an increase of  0000 pounds above what they are new stated at in that case the said increase of  0000 pounds would be disposed of as follows  toward the civil government of britain   00  toward the general expense of the nation 0   0 toward payment of the debts of britain       in full of the said  0000  this last article of the account is very remarkable extending to no less than a sum of       pounds to be applicable toward the debts contracted before the union but this needs not amuse any person for in the first place it was supposed if there be a peace concluded and so an end put to the present war then will the debts of england be in a few years fully paid the consequence of which will be that the customs and excises which after the union will be payable by the subjects of great britain shall then be entirely taken off and let fall in the next place though the said sum of       pounds be applicable yearly toward the payment of english debts yet there shall be an annual equivalent given by england to the extent of that sum which leads us to consider a question whether or not that sum of       pounds will be sent up yearly to england for paying these debts i answer no for if it should then by the nature of the equivalents that very sum behoved to be sent back to us again which is a certain needless trouble and lawyers when they intend to amuse their clients with speaking a sort of latin have this in their mouths applicable enough to this purpose frustra petitur quod mox est restituendum  wherefore any man may see that this sum is not to be sent to england but must remain among us  could it ever have entered into the heads of men in their right wits to burden a poor nation with an annual payment of a great sum for debts they never contracted without at the same time allowing a reimbursement to them and if so can we imagine that matters will be so confounded as that they must send yearly great sums out of scotland to england for no other end than immediately to be returned back again this is so ridiculous that it is scarcely to be spoken of    thus far mr baron clark to which i shall add nothing but that his reasonings were so plain that they needed no explication   the fifth clause was thus and whereas from the expiration of seven years after the union scotland is to be liable to the same duties for salt made in scotland as shall be then payable for salt made in england it is agreed that when such duties take place there an equivalent shall be answered to scotland for such part thereof as shall be applied toward payment of the debts of england of which duties an account shall be kept to the end it may appear what is to be answered to scotland as the said equivalent  this required only to be left out as being useless since the affair of the salt was settled otherways in the precedent days vote so that hitherto these were all negative clauses in the main  the sixth clause was and generally that an equivalent shall be answered to scotland for such parts of the english debts as scotland may hereafter become liable to pay by reason of the union other than such for which appropriations have been made by parliament in england of the customs or other duties on export and import excises on all exciseable liquors or salt in respect of which debts equivalents are herein before provided  the opposition made to this article was on the same foot as the opposition made to the first clause viz that they would not have scotland come into the english debts at all but having consented to come in as far as the equivalent extended they were for making a stop there  but this was found impracticable after the duties which were to be paid by scotland were assented to to have turned them from the channel of appropriation which the like duties in england were appointed to run in by act of parliament could not well be done so after a short dispute about the possibility of this it was passed over also  they now came to the debate of the application of the equivalent but this was too long a subject to enter upon that day so it was adjourned to the next time   minute xlvi friday    december   0  prayers said  rolls called  the lord chancellor acquainted the parliament that notwithstanding the several addresses brought in and presented to the parliament against an incorporating union with england in the terms of the articles have been under due consideration during the whole procedure upon the articles of union yet there is now information that letters are sent through several corners of the kingdom desiring the subscrivers of these addresses to come in and assemble at edinburgh upon pretense of waiting the effect of the said addresses and of knowing what return the parliament will give them all which he was directed by his grace her majestys high commissioner to lay before the parliament to the effect proper measures may be resolved upon for preventing any evil consequences from these practices  and after some discourse thereupon a proclamation was brought in and read against all such mettings and gatherings of the subjects as unwarrantable and contrair to law and after further discourse as to the ground of the information  her majestys high commissioner was pleased to signify to the parliament that he had information from several corners of the kingdom of the great pains and methods which had been used to procure subscriptions to addresses and to call in to edinburgh the subscribers against a precise day to back these addresses  and after debate upon the draught of the proclamation the vote was stated approve of the proclamation or not  but before voting it was agreed to mark the members votes and that the list of their names as they shall vote be printed and recorded  and george lockhart of carnwath gave in the following protestation viz i george lockhart of carnwath protest for my self and all others who shall adhere to this my protestation that this proclamation now offered to be emitted discharging barons freeholders and heretors within this kingdom to come to edinburgh in time of sitting of parliament shall no ways prejudge the rights and privileges of the barons freeholders and heretors of this kingdom competent to them by the laws of this nation  which being read he took instruments thereupon and the adherers were allowed to be marked at calling the rolls  then the vote was put approve the proclamation or not and it carried approve and the duke of hamilton the duke of athole the earl errol the earl marischal the earl of wigtoun the earl of selkirk the viscount of

of inchcoulter alexander watson francis molison mr john lion sir robert anstruther mr john caruthers george home and john bain adhered to the protestation given in by george lockhart of carnwath  adjourned till monday next at ten of the clock  observation xlvi the work of this day explains it self  and needs but little remark this was a new shift if possible to have diverted the parliament from going on with the great work of the union tumults and riots in the country had been tried in vain and the glasgow rabblers were closs in the castle of edinburgh mobs and rabbles in the streets had been suppressed and the guards did constant duty in the city walked the rounds in the night and kept the streets quiet the meeting of the heretors and fencible men had been discharged by proclamation and the clause in the act of security licensing them to do so had been repealed so that now no room was left for violent methods except by open and actual rebellion and that had all possible provision made for it in the laws and the queen had ordered troops to the borders of england as is before noted in order to assist and support the government in case of necessity  the only pretense therefore now was this the addresses as you will read in the minutes had been continually brought in against the union from all parts of the kingdom answers were not given nor expected to be given by the parliament but they lay before the parliament for their consideration and an address lying before the parliament is by the nature of the thing supposed to be under consideration  but the addressers pretending that no regard was had to their addresses pretend now to come all up to edinburgh to wait for or rather to demand answers to their addresses  this was too bare faced a pretense not to discover its own meaning and therefore the parliament immediately agreed to the proclamation to discharge or forbid all such gatherings or meetings of the subjects as unwarrantable and contrair to law see the proclamation in the appendix no b x x  you will observe that on several occasions after the first proposal of printing the names of such as voted on either side the like list of names was ordered to be made public  it would have been too long to have subjoyned these to every vote  and also been troublesome and useless to the reader  but this case being something singular i have put the names of the members as they were printed by order of parliament in the appendix of this work marked with this mark d x x by which some guess may be made who encouraged or discouraged the violences of those times and what encouragement were suggested to those without from the proceedings and conduct of those within  it was expected by some people that these tumults should have had great encouragement on the part of the church and great pains were taken to draw in the ministers in several parts to espouse the quarrel and to appear with the people against the union  but the ministers however they showed themselves against the union in general and against the several particulars as they concerned them yet they showed no inclination to encourage the tumultary methods that the violent tempers of other people seemed to be precipitating the nation into and therefore the letter written by the commission to the several presbyteries was very seasonable not only to prevent the mischiefs threatening the peace of the kingdom at that time but also to vindicate the commission of the assembly from the aspersions raised upon them from the above supposition copy of which i have inserted in the appendix with the answer of the presbytery of hamilton to it no o x p x  it would have been endless to have added here the particular addresses which were presented from the several parts of the kingdom however some of the most significant i have added in the appendix marked as follows address from the presbytery of hamiltoun no n x which was very particular the presbytery of dumblain no l x with the address from kirkcudbright no m x the town of new galloway no q x dumfermling no r  from these addresses the bulk of the rest may be guessed at only it may be noted there were but three presbyteries in the whole kingdom that addressed at all viz lanerk hamiltoun and dumblain there being sixty eight presbyteries in the whole  minute xlvii monday  0 december   0  prayers said  rolls called  thereafter the first part of the seventh and last clause of the fifteenth article of union beginning thus and as for the uses to which the said sum of    0   pounds etc was again read and after reasoning the representation of the council general of the company of scotland trading to africa and the indies was also again read and after further reasoning thereupon and upon the application of the equivalent a proposal was given in for altering and amending the said first part of the above seventh and last clause of the said fifteenth article in these terms viz  it is agreed that in the first place out of the foresaid sum what consideration shall be found necessary to be had for any losses which private persons may sustain by reducing the coin of scotland to the standart and value of the coin of england may be made good in the next place that the capital stock or fund of the african and indian company of scotland advanced together with the interest of the said capital stock after the rate of five per cent per annum from the respective times of the payment thereof shall be paid upon payment of which capital stock and interest it is agreed the said company be dissolved and cease and also that from the time of passing the act of parliament in england for raising the said sum of    0   pounds  0 shillings the said company shall neither trade nor grant license to trade providing that if the said stock and interest shall not be paid in twelve months after the commencement of the union that then the said company may from thence forward trade or give license to trade until the said haill capital stock and interest shall be paid and as to the overplus of the said sum of    0   pounds ten shillings after payment of what consideration shall be had for losses in repairing the coin and paying the said capital stock and interest and also the haill increase of the said revenues of customs duties and excises above the present value which shall arise in scotland during the said term of seven years together with the equivalent which shall become due upon the improvement thereof in scotland after the said term and also as to all other sums which according to the agreements aforesaid may become payable to scotland by way of equivalent for what that kingdom shall hereafter become liable toward payment of the debts of england it is agreed that the same be applied in manner following viz that all the public debts of the kingdom of scotland as shall be adjusted by this present parliament shall be paid and that  000 pounds sterling per annum for the space of seven years shall be applied toward encouraging and promoting the manufacture of course wool within these shires which produce the wool and that the first  000 pounds sterling be paid at martinmass next and so yearly at martinmass during the space foresaid and afterward the same shall be wholly applied toward the encouraging and promoting the fisheries and such other manufactures and improvements in scotland as may most conduce to the general good of the united kingdom  which being read and after reasoning thereon it was moved that the company of scotland trading to africa and the indies be heard by their lawyers upon the rights and privileges of the said company before any further procedure and after debate  the said haill seventh and last clause of the said fifteenth article of union from these words and as for the uses to which the said sum of    0   pounds sterling to the end with the above alteration and amendment was read over  and thereupon there were two states of a vote offered the first in these terms approve of the fifteenth article of the union as altered and amended yea or not and the second in these terms whether this house will dissolve the indian and african company without the consent of the proprietors and hearing the companies lawyers upon the rights and privileges of the said company yea or not and after some reasoning which shall be the state of the vote first or second  it was agreed before voting that the members votes be marked and that the list of their names as they vote be printed and recorded  then the vote was put first or second and it carried first  thereafter it was put to the vote approve of the said fifteenth article as altered and amended or not and it carried approve  then an overture given in in these terms that it be remitted to the committee to consider what consideration shall be had of the losses of the coin as also what the capital stock and interest of the african company may amount to and how and to whom the same shall be paid and likeways to adjust the list of the public debts and to prepare overtures on these several heads and to report to the parliament with power to them to call for papers and persons and accordingly it was remitted to the committee to whom the sixth and eighth articles were remitted  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation xlvii upon this part of the application of the equivalent great stir was made on pretense of preserving the african company and some papers were offered to the parliament  the company made a long representation to the parliament needless to be inserted here   there were a party who pretended to struggle and some motions appeared in the house to that purpose against the dissolving the african company it is confessed the company was a thing the nation had a great concern in almost every considerable family in the kingdom having some share in the stock and consequently in the loss for it was reckoned no better the historical part of that transaction does not relate to this place but it may be proper to say a little to it to introduce the true understanding of the vote  the company had been erected upon a general subscription of  00000 lib sterling most of it subscribed in scotland upon which every subscriber had paid down a certain part of the sum subscribed and was liable at the call of the company to be pursued for the remainder and to pay it all in as by the several acts of parliament settling and confirming the said company will appear  upon the miscarriage of the expedition to daricn and the return of their ships etc the company was so discouraged and disheartened that no new attempt either there or any where else had been so much as talked of nor were any other payments demanded the loss of what was already expended lying very heavy upon the nation and particularly upon some families who could very ill bear it  the design had so effectually miscarried that the stock advanced was not only expended but the company was brought very low and was very far in debt upon the account of their said expedition to darien  and the subscribers were always apprehensive of a call upon them of some further payment to discharge the remainder due on the old voyage or perhaps to form some new expedition and this made some people so uneasy that they sold their stock in the said company for trifles only to be secured against further demands in general the interest in the said stock was come to so low an ebb that people valued themselves little or nothing upon their shares in it and when the first view of the union came on and some thought one way of it some another they either bought or sold as their opinion of the union and its prospect of success either increased or decreased and indeed the public expectation of the success of the union ran very low at this time as may be supposed from the value now put on the stock of the african company which was fallen so low that several people offered to sell their whole interest for  0 per cent on the original stock though at the same time they saw that if the union took place the whole principal money with interest was to be repaid them  there seemed to be abundance of difficulties in the way of the treaty he fury of the rabbles the tumults in the streets the strength of the opposition and the abundance of debates they were yet to go through gave so mean a prospect of the union that though it was an article in the treaty that when it was finished all the stock of the african company should be repaid with interest as above out of the equivalent money yet no body valued themselves upon it then nor were any very fond of buying though the demand was extravagantly low and indeed so low as told every one the sellers looked upon it as a desparate case that they had no dependence upon and very little expectation from  it was expected there should have been a debate upon the previous question whether the african company should be dissolved or no and as per the vote it was proposed to hear lawyers or counsel in behalf of the company but it was apparent this also was a proposal not so much in behalf of the company as in order to put a full stop to the union since it was evident two companies could not be consistent in britain  nor was it alleged that the proprietors of the company had it been put to the question would have desired the company to continue and so have disbursed further sums to carry on their trade in hope of making up and recovering their money and this rather than have received their principal sums with interest back again which was a thing they had no reason to expect  the proposal therefore was rejected not that every mans consent in his own private right was not acknowledged to be needful  but this being a public act granted by parliament the parliament first securing every man his whole principal and interest from the very time of payment had undoubtedly a power to rescind their own act and cause cease all the powers and privileges which derived from them  upon this foot it was thought just to repeal the acts establishing the company even without hearing their lawyers or demanding their assent  again had the assent been demanded it ought to have been not an assent of the directors or council but of every proprietor which as it might have been difficult and perhaps impossible would have effectually answered the end of those gentlemen who sought to bring these matters to a head of debate and so have wrought out of them the wished for delay to the union then in hand  some also alleged this case as parallel to the great case now depending and would have argued the last from the consequence of the first viz that as the company could not be dissolved by the consent of the directors or council or managers of their affairs but by the universal consent of the whole body of subscribers so neither could the constitution of scotland be altered by the act and deed of the representative without the concurrence and assent of the constituents from whom the representatives derived  but this seeming parallel appeared to be imperfect and consequently to be no parallel at all since the company could at any time be legally dissolved and their charters privileges and powers be made to cease by the same power that made them without asking the assent either of the directors or subscribers that is without consulting the representative or constituent parts of that body and the power so dissolving or taking away the said company had no other obligation upon them than in justice to make good all damage or detriment to private persons and this was effectually done  the fate of the african company of scotland being thus determined the further application of the equivalent was the next work  and there seemed only two things to call immediately for help   the coin which of necessity required a new regulation   the public debts of the nation which called loudly to be discharged   the coin was agreed to be the first consideration and as per the minute appears was unanimously agreed to  the state of which was in short thus  by the lowness of the coin in scotland both as to quality and quantity i mean the old money scotland came under this general disadvantage viz that almost every foreign coin past current in scotland to advantage for example  the english shilling past at thirteen pence the french crown which in london goes at four shillings six pence past at five shillings the dutch dollar at fifty eight pence the bank dollar and three other sorts commonly called the wildhorse the wildman and castle being generally imperial or rex dollars were by act of council raised to sixty pence  this indeed had been occasioned by the government in scotland formerly crying up their own money above the usual rate a thing always fatal to the nations that have thought fit to venture upon it and which precipice england narrowly missed splitting upon in the late restoration of her coin at which time some people pushed hard at raising the value of the standart not being aware of the national injury of raising the value of foreign species and subjecting the general credit to a loss on exchange with all nations of the world  by the union the coin of scotland was to be reduced and brought to the english standart the consequence of this was of necessity that there would be a loss upon all the kinds of money both foreign and proper  to cry down the foreign money and bring it to a value could not be because the english money being the standart was to be the only current money and all other money would as in england go by weight only to sink the difference in the hands of particular persons who had such money in possession would have been a great loss upon the poor people and what they could not easily bear   the advance upon the english money which was one penny on every shilling of the silver and two shillings two pence upon every guinea fell by the course of things that money being to go current at the rates as in england and this was no small loss to the people that had english money by them but the foreign and scots money being no more to be current it was but reasonable that the public should defray the charge and make good the loss and therefore this was allotted out of the equivalent  nor was that all but as this was a case which admitted no delay so it obtained the preference of every thing else for till this was settled the circulation of money would have been stopped and a general stagnation of trade would have followed and therefore it was appointed to be made good out of the equivalent before the african company was refunded and this set the mint quickly to work as will appear in its place  the next thing to be paid out of the equivalent was the public debts there were some who struggled heartily to have the debts of the government come in before the affair of the african company but it could not be carried those debts were not all ascertained and the claims were to be remitted to the decision of the law at least many of them and this would have left the african affair to a long uncertainty which neither the nature of the thing nor the occasion that subscribers had for their money could admit of  for it is to be observed by the clause that if the whole was not paid them within twelve months they had privilege to trade or give license to trade as if they were not to dissolve at all  next after the african company therefore the public debts came to be considered and the equivalent was appropriated to the discharge of the said debts and if the present sum fell short it was to be made good out of the growing customs and revenue of scotland which for seven years was to be appropriate for such uses as will hereafter appear  the next in order was to bestow this money for the encouragement of trade and first the wool masters as they are called that is the gentlemen whose estates were in the sheep countries and whose rents were generally paid in wool these made loud complaints that the unions bringing upon them a prohibition or restraint of the exportation of wool and there being no consumption by manufacturing at home and their wool too course for sale in england their estates would be visibly sunk and therefore that they ought to have some equivalent also  to this it was alleged that the exportation of wool however obtained lately in scotland yet was grievous to the whole nation and ought to be restrained by law as it was injurious to trade and that it used in former times to be restrained that therefore if this was a present loss to them it was nothing but a reducing them to what they were before and taking away the advantages they had made for a few years out of the public losses but however that all parties might as far as possible be made sensible of the equity and justice of the union a consideration of  000 pounds sterling per annum was allowed to encourage setting up such manufactures in these places as might employ the poor and help forward the consumption of the wool in the countries where it is grown  how this  000 pounds per annum was disposed and what effect it had on the wool or on the trade i may examine hereafter  a remainder after this is allotted to the fishing etc but the issue of this also being not come to knowledge at writing of this history i can give no further account of it  as to the affair of the coin and of the african company the particulars were referred to the committee and we shall meet with them again in their course the report of the said committee being formed into an act of parliament as will appear in its place   minute xlviii tuesday    december   0  prayers said  rolls called  saturday next appointed for private business  thereafter the sixteenth article of union was read twice over and the following words were added thereto and that the present officers of the mint be continued subject to such alterations etc and the article as amended being again read over after reasoning thereon a memorial was given in in relation to the losses by the coin and remitted to the committee to whom the sixth and eighth articles were remitted  then the vote was put approve of the sixteenth article or not and it carried approve  moved that a proclamation be issued forth lowering the value of the current coin of this kingdom to the true standard and remitted to the above committee to be proceeded on by them prior to all other business  the seventeenth article of union was then read and after some reasoning thereon it was put to the vote approve of the seventeenth article or not and it carried approve  thereafter the eighteenth article of union was read and after reasoning thereon an overture was given in for adding a clause in these terms that all scotsmen be exeemed from the english sacramental test not only in scotland but in all places of the united kingdom and dominions thereunto belonging and that they be declared capable of offices throughout the whole without being obliged to take the said test  and after debate it being moved that it was not now entire to add the said clause in relation to the sacramental test in respect of the vote of parliament of the    th of november last against adding the like clause after some further discourse thereon  it was agreed that the same should be put to the vote and that the members votes be marked and the list of their names as they shall vote be printed and recorded  then the vote was put whether it was entire to add the said clause or not and it carried not  thereafter the vote was put approve the eighteenth article or not and it carried approve  act for adjourning the session to the first day of february next to come given in and read and a first reading ordered to be marked thereon  then the nineteenth article of union was read and delayed till next sederunt of parliament and to be then taken under consideration  the committee appointed to meet to morrow at nine a clock  adjourned till thursday next at ten of the clock  observation xlviii the matter committed to the committee here was not whether the coin should be reduced to the english standart and be alike all over the island for that every one seemed to agree to especially after it had been agreed before that the desiciency should be made good out of the equivalent  but how and in what manner the deficiency of the money should be made good was the thing the committee was to consider  and here contrary almost to the hopes of the people the committee concluded that the deficiency even of the english money viz one penny in each shilling should be made good  but here was a great difficulty and that was this if it should be voted that no consideration should be given for the english money the people would be great losers and the article of making good the losses of the coin would not be made good to them  if the deficiency was voted then the english would bring in vast sums of money upon them to receive the deficiency and have it out in current money and so carry it home again and by this trick as some suggested all the equivalent might be exhausted  but the committee found a cure for both these evils together   they resolved to make good the deficiency of the english money that is the english silver money not the guineas and so all the objections of that sort fell to the ground and to prevent the possibility of bringing in any quantity of silver money from england they appointed all the english money in the nation to be brought in to certain places all in one day where the sums being told sealed up and laid by till no more was left to bring in the money was delivered back again the same day with a certification of the same which entitled the proprietor to the deficiency to be paid out of the equivalent  thus in one day all the english money in the kingdom  viz all the silver money was reduced to the english value and went after that as in england and for no more  and as the rate of exchanges always attends the intrinsic value of the specie so the exchanges which before ran at eleven or twelve per cent to the disadvantage of scotland immediately came to a par and money ran between london and edinburgh at a half per cent or at most one per cent sometimes this way sometimes that way as the demand of remitters and drawers happened to alter the case  however the proclamation mentioned in this vote was concealed till the time that all things were ready for this calling in the money that people might not have notice of the thing and conscquently have room to bring in money from england it was alleged nevertheless that several considerable sums were brought over the borders but i never could understand that it was proved for the particulars the reader is referred to the proclamation which contains the report of the committee and shall come in its place  the seventeenth article required no debate at all being what every body acknowledged to be needful  the eighteenth article was so well worded and every thing that related to scotland so well provided for that there was very little room for objection and what was offered merits not to be remembered  what was said relating to the laws being made alterable by the parliament amounted to nothing but just what had been argued in london at the treaty as for those that would have it out of the power of subsequent parliaments to alter any of the laws when they came to consider that this was to bar scotland from having the advantage of a legislature and from what is essential to all government viz to have a power in being to make such laws as they shall want they presently quitted a notion so wild remembering that laws which are for the public good in one age may be directly otherwise in another and to leave the parliament no power to amend or alter the laws would be to put scotland in a worse condition than any nation in the world that when any part of her law became grievous to her it could not though at her own request receive any amendment the reasonableness therefore of its being always in the power of subsequent parliaments to make or amend laws being granted the distinction of the article admitted the less debate all things being to be done only to the evident vtility of scotland  there was a second attempt made here with relation to exempting the scots from the sacramental test in england but as it was just the same thing as is mentioned already in the observation of november    th i need make no further remark upon it than this that it was thrown by as a thing in its self impracticable unreasonable for the scots parliament to meddle with and as offered only to embarrass the present great affair upon the stage  the session or term for lawproceedings was now further to be adjourned and this was thought necessary not only because of the present hurry the nation was in being universally taken up about the great affair of the union but it was thought some advantages were designed against the treaty from the confluence of people that from all parts of the kingdom generally come together on this occasion and the gentlemen who were for the union did not think it safe to give such an opportunity or pretense for the country to gather to edinburgh as that must of necessity offer to them  minute xlix thursday   january   0  prayers said  rolls called  act adjourning the session to the first day of february next to come read a second time and after reasoning it was proposed that the adjournment should be to the fourth of february and likeways proposed that the adjournment should only be to the twenty first of january instant and after further reasoning the vote was put approve of the act adjourning the session to the twenty first of january or fourth of february and it carried approve of the act adjourning the session to the fourth of february next to come  thereafter the act was touched with the royal scepter by her majestys high commissioner in the usual manner  then the nineteenth article of union was again read and after some reasoning on the first clause of the said article in relation to the court of session or college of justice a motion was made for adding a clause in these terms and that hereafter none shall be named by the queen or her successors to be ordinary lords of session but such who have served in the college of justice as advocats or principal clerks of session for the space of five years  and after some reasoning it was also moved that writers to the signet should be added to the advocats and clerks  and after further reasoning the vote was stated approve of the first clause or paragraph of the nineteenth article with the above additional clause or without it  but before voting it was agreed that in case the vote should carry approve of the said first paragraph of the nineteenth article with the additional clause it shall be entire to debate whether writers to the signet are to be added or not  and thereupon the said first paragraph and additional clause being read over the vote was put approve of the said first paragraph with or without the addition and it carried with the addition  and after debate whether writers to the signet shall be added or not it was put to the vote add writers to the signet or not and it carried add  whereupon it was moved that such of the writers to the signet as have served five years in that station shall be understood qualified as well as advocats and clerks and after debate thereon it was moved that the further debate be adjourned till the next sederunt of parliament and also moved to proceed now to the determination of the time for their qualification  and after reasoning the vote was put proceed or delay and it carried delay  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation xlix i have given the reasons for adjourning the session in the last observation the debates of this day were only upon the day to which it should be adjourned which are not material only to note that the gentlemen against the union were always for the shortest adjournment which some said was in hopes to get the session to begin before the parliament should end  by the nineteenth article the court of session or as it is called the college of justice with the court of justiciary are here effectually established and confirmed their being and constitution can not be touched no not by the parliament they are indeed to submit to regulations and it can not but be reasonable it should be so but none of these regulations can affect them as a court  it may not be unnecessary for the sake of the english reader to explain the terms in this article and to describe the people mentioned here by the like kind of offices known in england and to note   that the college of justice consists of the lords of session advocats and writers to the signet the lords of the session are a bench of judges consisting of fifteen of whom one is lord president of the session now possessed by sir hugh dalrymple brother to the earl of stair  these are judges of all causes of private right like as the court of queens bench and common pleas from whom appeals lay before the parliament called petitions for remeid of law their sallary was two hundred pound per annum but is now since the union five hundred pound   the court of justiciary is a criminal court consisting of five judges who are called the lords of justiciary of whom the earl of cromerty is president or chief and is called justice general advocats here are lawyers such as the counselors at law in england who plead before the lords of the session the judges and give advice take fees etc as the connsellors of the inns of court in england writers are something like attorneys who prosecute law suits and prepare things in due form for trials at the bar writers to the signet are a select number of those by whom all processes must be signed before they can go on in form   it was the subject of no small debate here whether any writer should be capable of being lord of the session or advocats or counselors only it had been alleged that it was dishonorable to the bench of judges to raise any of the writers which are a lower rank of practitioners to the dignity of a lord of the session that it was advancing them over the heads of the advocats that in england no man arrives to the dignity of a judge till he is first received within the bar that is made a sergeant and that till now writers were not admitted  the first motion was even against advocates or clerks of the session too till they had served a certain number of years as advocats but the writers finding themselves excluded by that vote got it added after a long debate  it remained then to determine what writers should be qualified and which excluded but as this debate seemed something of a surprise to the parliament and the whole faculty seemed concerned in it it was put off to the next day  the debate seemed of no great concern to the public but as it affected private persons whose interest was at that time strong in the parliament it occasioned warm debates  minute l friday   january   0  prayers said  rolls called  then the parliament resumed the consideration of the debate anent the qualification of writers to the signet before they can be named ordinary lords of session and after some further debate as to the time they are to serve as writers before they can be capable to be named lords there were two states of a vote offered the first in these terms whether they shall serve twenty years or none and the second in these terms whether they are to serve eight or ten years and after some reasoning which of the two should be the state of the vote first or second  the earl of abercorn gave in a protest against the first state of the vote in these terms i protest against the stating of the first vote because which way soever it may be carried it in my humble opinion elides one of the two votes past yesterday relating to the additional clause for if it should be carried that a writer to the signet may be admitted to be an ordinary lord of the session without limiting a reasonable time for qualifying himself by experience as to the practical part of the law then that seems to be inconsistent with the vote requiring advocats undergoing a five years probation at the bar on the other hand if the vote should be carried for a writers being twenty years in that station before being capable to be named by the sovereign to be an ordinary lord of the session that seems to be tantamount to an absolute exclusion of writers from the sad office and thereupon he took instruments  then the vote was put first or second and it carried second thereafter the vote was put eight or ten years and it carried ten years  then a motion was made for an additional clause in relation to the qualification of writers in these terms with this provision that no writer to the signet be capable to be admitted a lord of the session unless he undergo a private and public trial on the civil law before the faculty of advocats and be found by them qualified for the abovesaid office two years before they shall be named to be a lord of the session and after reasoning thereon the vote was stated add the clause or not  but before voting it was moved that the qualifications made or to be made for capacitating persons to be named ordinary lords of session shall be alterable by the parliament of great britain and after debate it was put to the vote alterable or not and it carried alterable  then the vote was put add the clause in relation to the qualification of writers and it carried add  thereafter the second clause of the nineteenth article of union in relation to the courts of justiciary was read and agreed to  and the third clause in relation to the admiralty was also read and agreed to  thereafter the other clauses of the said nineteenth article in relation to the court of exchequer and other courts and also the remainder of the article was read and agreed to  then the vote was put approve of the nineteenth article as amended or not and it carried approve  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation l there needs little to be said of this days work our last observation having stated the case and the vote it self being more particular than ordinary in that matter  the writers to the signet were admitted to be made ordinary lords of the session upon conditions and qualifications as by the minute viz ten years continuance as writer and two years afterward passing a trial before the advocats  but it may not be unnecessary to note that all this debate had some ground for it that did not yet appear and some personal views were in it on either hand the latter it can be of no use to meddle with here but the reasons in general of this debate were to foreclose the admitting persons to be judges who had not been bred to the law a thing really significant in it self and which some alleged had been but too much practiced in scotland to the great prejudice of the college of justice in general the injury of the gentlemen who were bred up to the study of and had run through long practice in the law and not over much to the reputation of the whole session in general  it was said also that there were views of this sort at this time and that much of the debate was founded upon that head but this i will not affirm it is certain the lawyers made no small struggle in the case of qualifications on both sides  the people generally seemed very well pleased with the limitations as what seemed very much to regard the reputation of the law and be some security for the time to come that such as shall be advanced to be judges of the law shall be chosen from among those who best understand the law  at last the debate seemed to meet with some interruption on the account of submitting these qualifications to the parliament of great britain  this was opposed by several sorts of people and it may be noted some were for submitting this to such alteration which were very warm against submitting other things  their reasons were plain to the persons concerned but being of no public consequence to record those things i leave them to the observation of the respective parties  it was at last settled as per the vote alterable by the british parliament and i cannot but note that those gentlemen who expect the limitations shall be enlarged by a british parliament and were on that account forward to subject it to such alteration may very probably be disappointed parliaments in england having on all occasions showen themselves forward to secure a succession of able and well qualified persons to be judges in england and will no doubt be careful of the same in scotland when ever that case shall come before them  minute li saturday   january   0  prayers said  rolls called  act in favors of the burgh of dundee for an imposition of two pennies upon the pint of ale and beer to be browen and vended within the bounds and for the uses therein mentioned read a second time and after reasoning thereon a clause was offered to be added thereto impowering overseers and managers of the said imposition and with power to determine how it shall be uplifted whether out of the malt or out of the liquor and a petition given in for the brewers of dundee against the said act was read and another clause was offered to be added to the said act in favors of mr james anderson in these terms with this provision as it is hereby expressly provided and declared that the said imposition is and shall be burdened with the sum of twelve hundred pounds yearly for the space of six years to be paid to mr james anderson writer to the signet or his assigneys as a part of the expenses of the work recommended to him by the parliament and that at two terms in the year martinmass and whitsunday beginning the first terms payment at martinmass   0  years and ordains the magistrates of the said burgh to make payment of the same accordingly which being read it was agreed to add the said clause and after further reasoning on the said act several other amendments were made thereupon and after debate on the above petition for the brewers and clause in relation to the management it was put to the vote approve of the act as amended or add the clause and it carried approve  then the lord chancellor by order of her majestys high commissioner acquainted the parliament that in this session of parliament other two days shall be appointed for private business  draught of an act for dissolution of the lands of orkney and zetland from the crown in savours of the earl of mortoun read and agreed that the feuduty payable therefore shall be six thousand pounds and that the queens haulks be reserved and a first reading ordered to be marked thereon and agreed that the said act shall be first proceeded upon the first sederunt for private business preferable to all others

petitioners goods and estate heretable and moveable against diligence at the instance of creditors for such debts as have been contracted before april   0  years excepting such debts as have been

parliament for private business  agreed that my lord chancellor rank and bring in private business to the parliament the following days for private business as he finds just  adjourned till monday next at ten of the clock  observation li this was a day for private business and i should have wholly omitted the minute of it but on the following occasion   first to note how the parliament of scotland on all occasions encouraged learning and industry and particularly the labors and study of mr james anderson a gentleman bred to the study of the laws of scotland but by his own inclination led into that painful but most excellent and useful study of antiquity  in the prosecution of which he had begun a most tedious and chargeable work in search after the antiquities of scotland and had formarly laid before them the specimens he had made of that work which met with a general approbation and the reward allotted him for it shows the sense the house had of the greatness of the undertaking which if that gentleman live to finish it may let the world know their money was not ill bestowed  the naturalizing monsieur huguetan was a thing lay open to some reflections and at first looked meanly enough the man was fled from france and as was said had defrauded the king of france and private persons also of great sums of money and finding himself unsafe in england where a commission of bankrupt had been attempted to be sued out  he sought protection here  however the parliament consented to the naturalization  but limited and restricted the protection he sought with such just and reasonable clauses as that monsieur huguetan never thought fit to take the benefit of it but went away to holland where what became of him how he was near being trapannd away into france where his fate had been most certain how the states general resented the attempt and punished the persons though at the same time they did it in respect to their own jurisdictions and constitution rather than in respect to the person  how afterward he was married to madamoisell dodyke in spite of all the opposition made by monsieur dauverkirke her near relation and velt marshall of the forces of the states these things as not material to this history i shall take no notice of and only mention the other to let the world see that though the enemies of scotland loudly clamoured that for the sake of bringing money thither they would make themselves the sanctuary of the most infamous persons yet that upon the application of this man they clogged the favor they bestowed with such just clauses in relief of the claims of private persons that if the person sought any sanctuary against his just debts he found it was not to be had in scotland and therefore he was so far entirely disappointed as to his public affair with the government in france it did not appear other than by report and no public body could be obliged to provide against any thing that they had no documents to prove and which no body appeared to accuse him of  minute lii monday   january   0  prayers said  rolls called  then the following addresses were given in and read viz address of barons freeholders

ordered to be printed  a report brought in from the committee to whom the consideration of the coin was remitted was read as also a proclamation in relation thereto and after reasoning thereon both were remitted back to the said committee to be further considered  then the twentieth article of union was read and it was moved that a clause should be added thereto for preserving the whole records and registers both general and particular and warrants thereof and for detaining and keeping them within this kingdom in all time coming and after reasoning thereon it was agreed that when the twenty fourth article falls under consideration a clause to that effect shall be brought in to be added thereto  agreed that after the words heretable offices and heretable jurisdictions the word superiorities be added to the said article and the article being read over with the said addition the vote was put approve the twentieth article of union or not and it carried approve  then the twentieth first article of union was read and after reasoning it was moved to add a clause thereto in these terms subject nevertheless to such alterations as the parliament of great britain shall think fit and after further reasoning thereon two states of a vote were offered the first in these terms approve the article or not the second in these terms add the clause or not and after some reasoning which should be the state of the vote first or second  it was agreed that the members votes shall be marked and that the list of their names as they vote shall be printed and recorded  then the vote was put which shall be the state of the vote first or second and it carried first  thereafter the vote was put approve the twenty first article of union or not and it carried approve  then the twenty second article of union was read and the consideration thereof delayed till next sederunt of parliament to be then proceeded upon previous to all other business  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation lii the affair of the courts of admiralty and exchequer need very little remark they were by the nineteenth article reserved and their distinct powers are very expressly stated in the article it self nor did it occasion any great debate in the parliament for those debates which were raised upon a supposition of the union taking place it was observed gave the house the least trouble  which i take to be a further proof that the main design in opposing and debating the particulars was as they pointed at the general and it was therefore a just observation that any head of argument became more or less vigoursly opposed as it more or less pushed at the union in general  the office of the lord high admiral for all britain it was absolutely necessary to reduce to one  but the courts of admiralty having their several jurisdictions and authorities were as necessary as several private rights which by the next article were to be reserved depending entirely upon it  the heretable rights of admiralty and the vice admiralties were also necessary to be supported and all these things made it absolutely necessary to preserve a court of admiralty the trials being to be had in scotland and which by the constitution and laws of scotland reserved as before could not be legally transferred to or taken cognizance of by the court of admiralty of england  the like in the affair of the exchequer where if the seizures of the customs if private rights and debates between the queen and subject could not have been tried in scotland the general reserve of the laws to scotland could not have been maintained and the subject would have been put to intolerable inconveniences and expenses in pursuing and defending in all pleas of the crown or cases between the queen and her subjects  these things therefore admitted of very little debate but were regulated by the methods required by the customs and forms of law and then past as it were in course  the affair of the privy council was also left to its own fate the story of which i omit here because it will come necessarly to be spoken of in the subsequent part of this history when it was deposed with some struggle and as some thought a little sooner than was needful  the present article which i take to be a very extensive one had passed and been in all its parts unexceptionable had not one unhappy word been brought in and this was the word svperiorities but this being added without any condition or power left in parliament to dissolve those superiorities upon an equivalent to the owners whenever the united parliament should find occasion for the public good to do so has bound down scotland to the private tyrrany and oppression of the heretors and lairds which it is easy to make appear is at this time one of the greatest obstructions to her peace and prosperity  the superiorities meant here are the rights of vassalage which the gentry of scotland have over the people which as it is extended gives the chiefs and heads of clans lairds and heretors such an absolute dominion over both the persons and goods of the poor subjected people as seems perfectly inconsistent both with the peace and the improvement of scotland in particular or of any free nation in general and this two ways    as it gives too great a power to particular persons who are thereby rendered independent of the law and put in too easy a condition to insult the government and break the public peace instances of which have been given since the union as shall particularly appear in the process of this history where persons by the assistance of their tenantry and the dominion of their own superiorities protected themselves from the public justice and bid defiance to the just resentments and suspicions of the government even in a time of french invasion  that a power to put any one in such a posture is inconsistent with the public peace i need not spend time here to dispute and scotland may have and i doubt will have occasion to acknowledge    as it keeps the common people and tenantry of scotland in a condition inconsistent with the liberty of a free nation and under an intolerable slavery to their landlords by which they are effectually prevented either improving their stocks for themselves or their lands for their landlords  which the landlord himself effectually prevents by his absolutely ruining and devouring their industry at his own will  this subject is too long for the extent of a single observation and will be more particularly spoken to in its place but i note it here as the proper subject of the place this being the day when it was introduced into the treaty and had only this unhappiness that it came in as it were by head and shoulders without any previous conditionary clause  i do not allege that the superiorities of the gentry should have been taken away by law without satisfaction made to the private estates of those from whom they should have been taken farther is it yet from me to say or think they should be surrendered to the crown  but certainly had it been left to a parliament of great britain to have dissolved them upon any just occasion and by land or money have made a full recompense to the proprietors and so have broken that bond of slavery by which scotland has been so long suppressed and the poor kept poor their industry discouraged and their labor devoured from that day the nation had dated its liberty and prosperity plenty and encouragement to trade and manufactures must have followed since no people can be supposed to work cheerfully when they cannot enjoy what they gain or call it their own  but this was a time of hurry and people could not look about them as at other times nor was the liberty of the poor people so near in view as to move that concern in mens minds which perhaps were it now to be done might be otherwise whether this or the fate of scotland i shall not determine as the cause of the omission  but it is evident the thing is unhappily for scotland omitted and the great opportunity of extending the love of liberty as well as the taste of it to all the people irrecoverably lost  the rights of the burghs came next to be debated the whole rights of the burrows were reserved to them by the union nor was any thing offered now to abridge those rights yet it was thought it both might be the advantage of the burrows and of the nation in general to have those rights subjected to parliamentary regulations but some people took an alarm at this as if the parliament in time coming would take away the privileges of the royal burrows and thus in this particular time of jealousy the great advantages which both the burghs of scotland in particular and the people of scotland in general might have had from parliamentary regulations were lost and foreclosed and the door barred against any future alterations to be made by parliament were they never so much to the advantage and benefit of the respective parts  the next thing brought upon the stage was the number and manner of electing the representative it had been moved in the debates of the third article but was purposely adjourned to this as the proper time of entering upon it  it was too long an affair to begin at the end of the day so it was adjourned to the next sederunt when it took up time enough  minute liii tuesday   january   0  prayers said  rolls called  the twenty second article of union again read and thereafter the first paragraph thereof in relation to the number of representatives for scotland in the parliament of great britain was read over again and after long debate a vote was stated approve of the first paragraph of the twenty second article or not  but before voting there were four several protests given in viz one by the duke of athole a second by the earl of buchan a third by george lockhart of carnwath and a fourth by walter stuart commissioner for the burgh of linlithgow all against the said vote and the several protesters took instruments thereupon  likeas a fifth protest was given in by the earl of errol in these terms i charles earl of errol lord high constable of scotland do hereby protest that the office of high constable of scotland with all the rights and privileges of the same belonging to me heretably and depending upon the monarchy sovereignty and ancient constitution of this kingdom may not be weakened nor prejudged by the conclusion of the treaty of union betwixt scotland and england nor any article clause or condition thereof but that the said heretable office with all the rights and privileges thereof may continue and remain to me and my successors entire and unhurt by any votes or acts of parliament or other proceedings whatsoever relative to the said union and i crave this my protestation may be admitted and recorded in the registers and rolls of parliament  and a sixth protest was given in by the earl marischal in these terms i william earl marischal do hereby protest that whatever is contained in any article of the treaty of union betwixt scotland and england shall no manner of way derogate from or be prejudicial to me or my successors in our heretable office of great marischal of scotland in all time coming or in the full and free enjoyment and exercise of the baill rights dignities titles honors powers and privileges thereto belonging which my ancestors and i have possessed and exercised as rights of property these seven hundred years and i do further protest that the parliament of scotland and constitution thereof may remain and continue as formerly and i desire this my protestation to be insert in the minutes and recorded in the books of parliament and thereupon takes instruments  which protestations being read the several protesters took instruments upon their respective protests  and it was agreed that the members votes be marked and that a list of their names as they shall vote be printed and recorded and that at calling the rolls the adherers to the above respective protests be marked as also the lord chancellor was allowed to have his name marked printed and recorded as an approver  then

kilmaronock sir humphrey colquhoun of luss robert rollo of powhouse mr james carnagie of phinhaven david graham of fintrie and the said james sinclair of stempster adhered to george lockhart of carnwaths protest and the earls of crawfurd and galloway adhered to the earl of buchans protest  then the second paragraph of the said twenty second article anent the calling of the representatives from scotland to the parliament of great britain beginning thus and that when her majesty etc and ending that the names of the persons so summoned and elected shall be returned by the privy council of scotland into the court from whence the said writ did issue was again read and after some reasoning an explanation was offered to be added after these words according to the agreement in this treaty viz in such manner as by a subsequent act of this present session of the parliament of scotland shall be settled which act is hereby declared to be as valid as if it were a part of and engrossed in this treaty and after further reasoning it was moved that the way and manner of choosing the representatives for scotland to the parliament of great britain be determined and that a clause to that purpose be engrossed in this article and after debate the vote was stated approve of the second paragraph of the said twenty second article as above explained yea or not  whereupon it being moved to delay the said vote till next sederunt of parliament a previous vote was stated proceed or delay and it carried proceed  then it was put to the vote approve of the second paragraph of the twenty second article of union with the above explanation above insert or not  and the clause with the explanation being thereupon again read before voting the earl of abercorn gave in the following protest viz i protest against the settling the representatives of scotland for the parliament of great britain after a distinct manner from what might be appointed by the vote approving of the two and twentieth article because i do not see clear into what may be the consequence thereof and thereupon he took instruments  then the vote was put approve or not and it carried approve  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation liii the affair of the number of the representative whether of the nobility or commons was the contents of the first paragraph now debated how and with what difficulty this part of the equality was settled in england has been noted already and the reasonableness of the proportion duly stated there  it was indeed urged again here and several ways disputed but the disputes here seemed to look another way and first it was vigorously opposed that scotland should come to any representative at all that her whole parliament should sit in conjunction with the english parliament and long speeches were made on that head some alleging that it was dishonorable to scotland to lessen the number of her representative while england retained her entire parliament others again attempted to argue against the very uniting of the parliament at all though that was foreclosed by the first vote passed on the third article    others yet went into the merit of the cause and to examine the just proportion of the representative and these objected very vigorously that the numbers were not equal  the opinions were variously divided as to the foundation of a true equality upon what principle an equality of proportions could be raised  some stating the numbers of people to be the test of the representative others the proportion of taxes some an estimate from both others alleged there could be no just rule laid down how an equal proportion of representatives could be made to balance a kingdom that is not it self equally represented and that before england had required scotland to reduce their representative to a just proportion to her she ought to have reduced her own representative to a just proportion to her self either in number of people or payment of taxes neither of which as they alleged were at all regarded in the english representative that it was the complaint in england and several had wrote very warmly upon that subject that their taxes were not equally levied or their people equally represented and it was unreasonable to talk of proportioning scotland to a country whose representative was not in its self equal  there were several answers given to this the present circumstances of both nations in general seemed to be the truest foundation of a proportion wherein though the particular towns in england might not be justly proportioned yet the general might be equal and thus without enquiring whether the parts of the representative were equally chosen in england it might be a just proportion in having the whole brought to a state and if the number for scotland bare the same proportion to the number for england as the numbers of people and wealth or payment of taxes jointly considered of the one part bare to the same articles in the other the equality was then preserved   it was remembered that this had been fully debated in england and that the number was brought up to the highest proportion that england could possibly grant  mr seton in his speech printed in the minutes herewith folio    th declared it was above what scotland ought to expect and that it was a full proportion upon the whole this first clause was put to the vote and passed by it self  the scruples on the second paragraph as principally relating to the manner of issuing out the writs for electing the members when they should be chosen for the parliament of britain i take no notice of here referring that to the time when a separate act came to be debated in the house for the said election of which in its place  minute live

said last sederunt was resumed in relation to the four protestations given in the seventh instant by the duke of athole the earl of buchan george lockhart of carnwath and walter stuart and in relation

mr john carruthers george home and mr robert frazer adhered thereto  and after some further debate it was agreed that none of the above protests be insert at length in the minutes or printed but that they be all recorded and insert in the records of parliament  then the third paragraph of the twenty second article of union beginning thus and if her majesty on or before the first day of may next etc and ending with these words and that parliaments may continue for such time only as the present parliament of england might have continued if the union of the two kingdoms had not been made unless sooner dissolved by her majesty was read  and after reasoning thereon it was moved to add the following clause thereto viz and that the said parliament of great britain shall meet and sit once in three years at least in that part of great britain now called scotland  and after further debate there were two states of a vote offered the first in these terms approve the third paragraph of the twenty second article or not and the second in these terms add the above clause or not and after reasoning which should be the state of the vote it was put to the vote first or second  and it was agreed that the members votes shall be marked and that the list of their names as they vote be printed and recorded and the lord chancellor was allowed to have his name printed and recorded as a voter for the first state and if that shall carry as voting among the approvers  then the vote was put first or second and it carried first thereafter the vote was put approve the third paragraph of the twenty second article or not and it carried approve  then the rest of the twenty second article of union was read and after some reasoning and reading of the oaths to which it relates an overture was given in for an additional clause for explaining the word limitation mentioned in the oath appointed to be taken by statute    w   cap    and another overture was given in for exeeming persons in any office or employments in scotland from taking the oath of abjuration mentioned in the said article  and a third overture for a clause that so long as the act appointing a sacramental test shall continue in force in england all persons in public trust within the limits of scotland shall swear and sign a formula thereto subjoyned in manner and under the penalties therein mentioned  and after reading the said three overtures and reasoning thereon a vote was stated approve of the twenty second article of union as explained or not  but before voting it was agreed that notwithstanding of the said vote and that the article shall be thereby approven it shall nevertheless be entire and free thereafter to proceed on the said overtures next sederunt of parliament and to the parliament to give their sentiments thereon  and it being thereupon moved to delay the vote for approving the article till next sederunt  a previous vote was stated proceed or delay and it carried proceed  then the vote was stated approve or not  but before voting it was agreed that the members votes be marked and that the list of their names as they vote be printed and recorded and the lord chancellor was allowed to have his name printed and recorded as an approver  thereafter the vote was put approve the twenty second article as explained or not and it carried approve  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation lv the debate about the protestations of the four gentlemen abovementioned ended now after some heat in ordering the protestations to be recorded and enrolled in the registers of parliament which satisfied all parties  it was very much enquired after why these protestations should not be made public since the gentlemen that made them did not concern themselves to conceal them some alleged the parliament behoved to enter into a confutation of the matter of the protests if they made them public and either to approve or censure them others thought the publishing them might do harm among the people and that since the parliament were now just at the end of the work it was better to keep them all easy than start any new dispute so the protests were not published but entered in the rolls or registers office of the kingdom of scotland  from whence the true copies of them are taken and added in the appendix to this work no l m n o  then they went upon the debate of triennial parliaments included in the third paragraph of the twenty second article  and some were very urgent for a new clause as in the minute  but when the gentlemen were put in mind that by the very words of the paragraph it was expressly provided that the first parliament of great britain could sit no longer than the next ensuing session being the termination of the english parliament then in being and that by the act then in force in england called the triennial act every parliament was to terminate in three years the thing appeared already settled and so admitted no further debate that law being among others continued by the twenty fifth article of which in its order  it was very strange that notwithstanding the debates of this day and the express provision of the treaty many people flattered themselves with the notion of the parliaments continuing to sit nor could it be beaten out of their thoughts in england as well as in scotland till they saw the very preparations making for a new election  the proposal for explaining the several oaths to be taken by the members of the british parliament was opposed not that there could be any concealed oath that was not known to the members  and the particular oaths of allegiance the declaration and abjuration were laid before the house  but the gentlemen who thought fit to oppose it did it on this foot that they thought the articles so expressly directed to the particular acts in which the said oaths were contained and in which no other oaths were expressed that the acts being named at large and referred to and the custom and usage of parliament known and public there could be no possible fraud mistake or misconstruction but that it was this way as expressly and directly pointed out as if it had been repeated in the articles word for word  the exception about the limitation mentioned in the    william iii cap   referring to the qualification of the successors to the crown also will come to be spoken to again in its place  the overture about the qualification of persons to offices of trust has been spoken to more than once already and needs no further observation at this time  minute lvi friday  0 january

after some reasoning thereon the overture was past from  thereafter the overture for additional clause to the said twenty second article for explaining the word limitation mentioned in the oath appointed to be taken by stat    w   cap   was again read in these terms like as it is declared that by the word limitation in the oath mentioned in the above article is only understood entail of the succession and not the conditions of government upon the successor and that all persons of scotland who may be liable to take the said oath swear it in that sense only  and after reasoning thereon the vote was put add the said clause or not and it carried not  then the third overture for a clause to be added to the said twenty second article mentioned in the minutes of the last sederunt was again read in these terms and further it is agreed that so long as that part of the  d act anno    chapter  d appointing a sacramental test shall stand and continue in force in england all persons in public trust civil or military within the limits of scotland shall swear and sign the formula underwritten within six months after the commencement of the union and all who shall be admitted to any public

of union was read and after reasoning thereon the further debate was adjourned till the next sederunt of parliament to be then proceeded upon previous to all other business except a proclamation to be then brought in for prorogating the diet for the choosing of collectors and clerks of the supply in the several shires of this kingdom and continuing the last collectors and clerks for the term of candlesmass next  the committee appointed to meet to morrow at ten of the clock in the usual place  adjourned till monday next at ten of the clock  observation lvi this whole day was taken up in debating the subject of the word limitation mentioned in that famous act of    th w   in england  some had alleged that by that act if any person took upon him the crown of england unqualified by any of the articles thereinnamed the allegiance sworn was not due and that the subject would be thereby obliged by his oath to oppose such successor others had declared the limitations to mean nothing but an entail of the succession by parliament without any conditions of government and upon these seeming uncertainties the persons that moved this clause demanded an explanation but it was upon the whole not thought proper to undertake any explanation of an act which as it stood seemed sufficient to settle the protestant succession and could not hurt the present scheme since so far as it might oppose any branch of the union it was provided against in the twenty fifth article and to put any construction upon it which might be inconsistent with the english affairs would be but to lay a stumbling block in the way of the union and therefore this project was also rejected  the affair of the sacramental test had been mentioned before but never so plainly moved in parliament as now it had been moved in the commission of the assembly and great endeavors had been used to bring the ministers in as objectors and a formula like this had been proposed there as is noted already but it failed on their side the ministers were in the first place not willing to meddle with things of that nature and secondly as to the formula many of the ministers gave their opinion that they did not approve of imposing any oath or acknowledgment of the church as a test of civil employment and to have an oath of acknowledgment to the church of scotland be a counter test was a tacit approbation of the method practiced in england which they detested  others again were of the opinion that the subjects of scotland were already by the union exempted from the sacramental test in england by two several clauses    in that the subjects of both kingdoms were by the fourth article of the union to enjoy equal privileges and encouragements  and   that by the adam for the security of the church government no oath was to be imposed upon the members of the church of scotland contrary to their principles  in arguing the first of these it was alleged that if a subject of scotland taking the sacrament in the national established church of scotland shall not be capable of any place of preferment under the government of britain as well as a subject of england taking the sacrament in the national established church of england then do not the subjects of either kingdom enjoy equal privileges  and lastly it was argued that by the last article of the treaty the sacramental test might be understood to be actually repealed as contraveening the equalities of the treaty  upon these debates it was thought that to meddle with this matter might do much more harm than good and therefore it was first let fall without doors and now rejected within and the article passed without it  minute lvii monday    january   0  prayers said  rolls called  then the twenty third article of union was again read and after some reasoning an overture was given in for adding a clause thereto in these terms with this express provision that none of the peers of scotland shall have personal protection within scotland for any debt owing before the commencement of the union  as also another overture was given in for adding a clause thereto in these terms that all the peers of that part of great britain now called scotland qualified according to law shall after the union have right to sit covered in the house of peers of great britain notwithstanding that the right to give vote therein belongs only to the said sixteen peers who are to be summoned in the manner appointed by the preceding article  and after reasoning upon the said two overtures and upon two separate motions the first in relation to allowing all the peers of scotland to sit upon the trial of the peers of britain and the other in relation to their precedence according to their patents the vote was stated in these terms approve the twenty third article of union or alter reserving entire the consideration of the above two overtures and whether the same shall be added to the article and it carried approve  then the first overture for the clause in relation to personal protection was again read and after debate it was put to the vote add the cause or not and it carried not  thereafter the second overture or a clause in relation to all the peers of scotland their sitting covered in the house of peers of great britain was again read and after reasoning the vote was put add the clause or not  but before voting it was agreed that the members votes shall be marked and that the list of their names as they shall vote be printed and recorded  then it was put to the vote add the clause or not and it carried not  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation lvii the debates of this day related wholly to the privileges of the peers and particularly to the differing privileges of those who were to sit in the parliament of great britain from those who were not i e for the time they were to sit some would have had it that those that did not sit should have no manner of privilege any more than as a commoner till such time as they should come to sit by election in the house of lords and then those that were formerly sitting peers or parliament lords became divested of all their privileges unless they were of the new election  some thought the gentlemen who were of this opinion moved it chiefly to bring the peers into a distaste of the union all other hopes being now almost over as to the union on the side of scotland  and that the nobility being thereby as it were degraded of their characters would think it too great a hardship and so fly off from the treaty in general or fly to some extreme on the other hand making some demand which the peers of england would not submit to  others it was thought had this further view in the proposal for levelling the scots nobility that were not sitting peers with the commons that they designed to propose the unsitting lords to be capable of being elected into the house of commons and sitting in the lower house  this was received with some resentment as a great dishonor to the peerage of scotland by some people and especially without doors the english were upbraided with endeavoring to have it so  in order to lessen the character of the nobility of scotland but in this they wronged their own judgment as well as the english nation since had such a thing been offered it had been rejected in england as unequal and injurious to the equality we have been so often speaking of as the ground of the whole treaty  nor could it have been consented to in england since it had been a bringing the scots nobility into too great an influence of parliamentary affairs when sixteen being already judged sufficient there might be now sixty one scots lords in every parliament viz sixteen in the house of lords and forty five in the commons which when any thing relating especially to the nobility or to the privileges of one house against the other might turn the balance to this or that side to the manifest injury of the constitution which now consists in the equality of powers and privileges and the due limits set between each kind to prevent their incroachment upon one another  but the wisdom and modesty of the nobility of scotland prevented this  and the article had been so well considered at london and was so warily worded that there was room for little or no exception on behalf of the peers for   as to privileges the sixteen peers or the peers of parliament for the time being had effectually all the privileges of the peers of england in the utmost extent and all the privileges they ever after could receive could not be received but in common with the said sixteen nor could any exception be made to it whether in the cases of parliamentary privileges or the personal privileges in case of trying of peers or being tried as criminals    the remainder of the nobility enjoyed privileges every way equal to the english nobility excepting only as it is in the article the rights of sitting in the house of lords and the privileges depending thereupon  but the great debates of this day began upon this clause the rights and privileges of the scots nobility who were not lords of parliament for the time being  and first it was moved to be excepted that the said lords should not enjoy the privilege of personal protection in cases of debt as is the privilege of the peers of england  some alleged they pleaded for the honor of the scots nobility in this head that it was below their dignity to be protected by their titles against their just obligations and a meanness they had all along contemned to plead the privilege of their house against the proceedings of the law that it was not agreeable to the true intent and meaning of parliamentary privileges that this privilege should extend to those that did not sit in parliament since the privileges of parliament of this kind were at first appointed to provide against any impediment to sitting in parliament that the members of either houses should on no pretense what ever be hindered from the service of their country in parliament  and this could not be of any signification in those peers that were not sitting members of the house of lords that for the scots peers to claim protection for their persons against their just debts was more than levelling their persons with the commons for it was setting them below the commons since no man would then trust the nobility in matters of debt without some commoner being security for them against whom they might have remedy at law  these objections had no little weight and this privilege of the persons of the peers in cases of debt seemed at first view very grievous to scotland and some of the peers themselves looked upon it as dishonorable  but when it was calmly considered and answered that the persons of the peers in england are accounted sacred on several accounts besides those of debt  that even the government can not proceed against a peer but in an extraordinary way that no warrant can be executed in the house of a peer but by three justices of the peace  and that there are several necessary exemptions to the peerage which this privilege preserves besides that of debt  and which as they are the hereditary counselors of the nation and have frequently great trusts committed to them  and both are and ought to be a great and ready assistance to the publik good upon sudden emergencies which upon pretense of arrests and attachments for debt may be prevented that as to the justice of personal protection in case of debt it was answered their estates were not protected in several cases only their persons  and it was as reasonable to pursue the estate as the person of the debtor  and especially in scotland where the law reaches the effects of the debtor though on personal bonds  that as to the credit and honor of being protected against just debts it would be much more for the honor of the scots nobility that they gave all men notice that they despised the advantage of their personal credit and since they could not sue a nobleman they might decline trusting them and welcome and for those that were trusted though they could not be sued it was yet greater reputation to them that the principle of honor in them was so well known that men would depend upon their honor where they could not otherwise oblige them to make payment  upon these and the like considerations this motion was rejected and the scots nobility by virtue of that clause in the twenty third article and shall enjoy all other privileges of peers as fully as the peers of england now do or as they or any other peers of great britain may hereafter enjoy the same are protected in their persons and estates as the peers of england are  whether they the scots peers are peers of parliament at that time or no  the next dispute was a privilege demanded for the peers of scotland that they not being of the parliament at that time might sit in the house of lords covered etc but not have any right to vote  this was urged many ways either that they might have a gallery to sit in as spectators or that they might stand behind the throne as the eldest sons of the english peers may  and either of these was thought might have been obtained  but the main design of bringing them in to be present at debates to argue speak and debate upon the several matters that should be brought before the house this was opposed upon several accounts first as it was thought impracticable and an invasion of the house of peers as a house and what could not be obtained if pusht at secondly as it was thought an insignificant thing to have persons to sit and argue who had no power to determine and thirdly as it would be far from any honor to the nobility of scotland to be admitted into debates where they must always have the mortification of being distinguished and like mere solicitors whose place is without the bar be allowed to talk and yet have no signification in a question  but if the house divided be obliged to stand all together like mutes in an alphabet who have no sound in the expression of a syllable  and thus ended the debates of this great point the privilege of the peerage and the article received no manner of alteration  minute lviii tuesday    january   0  prayers said  rolls called  then the twenty fourth article of union was read whereupon a memorial was given in for the lion king at arms in relation to his precedence which being read after reasoning it was moved that the rank and precedence of the lion king of arms be left to her majesty and that next to these words in the said article viz and that the quartering the arms these other words viz and the rank and precedence of lion king of arms of the kingdom of scotland be added  and it being also moved that his rank should be insert in the said article to be immediately next after garter principal king of arms in england after debate it was put to the vote add the above words that the rank and precedence be left to her majesty or insert the rank and precedence and it carried add the words  which being accordingly added there was another clause offered to be added to the said twenty fourth article in these terms and the crown scepter and sword of state records of parliament and all other records rolls and registers whatsomever both public and private general and particular and warrants thereof continue to be kept as they are in that part of the united kingdom now called scotland and that they shall so remain in all time coming notwithstanding of the union which being read the same was agreed to be added and was accordingly subjoyned and the article as amended read over  then the vote was put approve of the twenty fourth article of union as amended or not and it carried approve  thereafter the twenty fifth article of union was read and after reasoning thereon the vote was put approve of the twenty fifth article or not and it carried approve  moved that a diet be appointed for considering the manner of electing the representatives for scotland to the parliament of great britain and agreed that the motion be entire next sederunt of parliament  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation lviii the debate of the rank and precedence of the heralds and of the quartering of arms the standards and colors was a thing of no great consequence nor could it be referred to any body better than to her majesty and therefore the dispute of this was not long  the keeping the honors as they called them in scotland viz the crown scepter and sword was indeed a material point at least as it had been made so by some gentlemen who had pretended to excite the common people with apprehensions that they were to be all carried away to england as tokens of surrendering the sovereignty of scotland to the english  but as no such thing was ever thought of in england the proposal met with no opposition and some people thought that not only the ensigns of royalty but the royalty it self sovereignty and government of scotland remain as entire as the same things respecting england remain entire either kingdom voluntarly consenting to an union of power an union of government and of all things needful to preserve both  the last article respecting the abrogation of all laws which might be supposed to contraveen the treaty met with no opposition at all  and thus this weighty affair was finished on the side of scotland contrary i believe i may say to the expectation of all the world who were amazed to see a thing of that consequence and with difficulties which seemed in themselves insuperable so successfully brought to a close a thing which had been so many times attempted in vain a thing which had so often been set about rather in a show than design of uniting and i think i may say a thing that never was heartily set about on both sides before  it had held the parliament of scotland a long a troublesome a dangerous and i must own a very uncomfortable debate step by step and article by article from the third of october to the fourteenth of january with very little intermission for never was business closer applied more strenuously pushed or more vigorously opposed  the work that remained i mean to the parliament was but short and i shall do little more than relate the fact which will be found in the minutes of parliament  and i shall set them down in their order omitting what relates to private business as not material here  since i can very ill spare room for any thing but what relates immediately to the business and agrees with the title   minute lix wednesday    january   0  prayers said  rolls called  draught of an act ratifying and approving the treaty of union of the two kingdoms of scotland and england given in and offered to be read  whereupon it was moved that the parliament should first proceed to the constitution of the manner of electing the representatives for scotland to the parliament of great britain and either now to determine that matter or to appoint a diet for that end  and after debate the vote was stated proceed to the ratification of the treaty of union and act for security of the protestant religion and presbyterian church government or to the constitution of the manner of electing the representatives for scotland to the parliament of great britain  but before voting it was agreed that in case it shall carry to proceed to the ratification the parliament will immediately after passing the act of ratification proceed to the constitution of the manner of electing the representatives for scotland  then the vote was put proceed to the ratification or constitution and it carried ratification  thereafter the draught of the act ratifying approving and at length narrating the articles of union as enlarged explained and amended and the act for security of the protestant religion and presbyterian church government was read  and after some discourse it was put to the vote mark a first reading on the act or not and it carried mark a first reading and accordingly a first reading was marked thereon  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation lix the articles were now gone through and finished as before  yet there remained two things to be done in order to completing the affair so far as referred to scotland one was to pass the act of security for the presbyterian church government in scotland which was to be engrossed and inserted in the body of the act of union and made a part of it  and then to pass in parliament some subsequent acts which being previous to the treaty or depending upon it ought to be finished in parliament before the union and would be of course confirmed by it by virtue of the eighteenth article continuing and confirming all laws and acts then in force except such only as came within the reach of the twenty fifth article viz such as were contrary to and inconsistent with the union  these were   an act to settle and determine the constitution of the manner of electing the representatives for scotland in the ensuing parliament of great britain   an act for plantation of kirks a thing long wanted in scotland together with the valuation of teinds or tithes and about the reversions of kirk lands   for the settling the public debts disposing and appointing the equivalent i e the payment of it according to the true intent of the treaty adjusting the affair of the african company etc which was now under reference to a committee  these things were necessary adjuncts to the treaty  but as the act of union it self was the foundation on which all these things were depending and that there was a great deal yet to be done to it viz to be engrossed and passed into an act and sent to london the interval of time after the main affair should be dispatched was thought the proper season to settle pass and enact all these things wherefore they resolved to go first to work with the act and that no time might be lost the act had been drawing up with all the amendments to every article as they had passed in the house and was ready to present to the house this day  and as per the minute obtained a first reading all other business being delayed   minute lx thursday    january   0  prayers said  rolls called  draught of the act ratifying and approving the treaty of union of the two kingdoms of scotland and england read a second time  then the act for security of the protestant religion and presbyterian church government which is insert in and ratifyed by the above act was touched with the royal scepter by her majestys high commissioner in the usual manner  representation and petition of the commission of the general assembly of the church of scotland given in and read  and after reasoning upon the act and representation the vote was stated approve of the act or not  and before voting it was agreed that the members votes be marked and that the list of their names as they vote be printed and recorded and the lord high chancellor was allowed to have his name marked printed and recorded as an approver  likeas a protest was given in for the duke of douglass and read in these terms we undersubscribers tutors testamentars to his grace the duke of douglass whereof three is a quorum in name and behalf of the said duke forasmuch as his grace the duke of douglass and his heirs has by their investitures and honors of the estate of douglass in consideration of the great and faithful services done and performed to this crown and kingdom by his ancestors provided to them the honor of lg the van of the arms of scotland in the day of battle the carrying of the crown of scotland in processions and giving the first vote in all parliaments councils or conventions in scotland and sicklike by the twentieth article of the union all heritable offices are reserved to the owners as rights of property in the same manner as they are now enjoined by the laws of scotland notwithstanding of this treaty whereby his graces foresaid offices and privileges by parity of reason and justice ought to be preserved yet seeing the entire union of the two kingdoms will be attended with an union of their arms crowns and councils whereby his graces offices and privileges may seem to be of more difficult explication his graces tutors and guardians in his pupillarity do now before the treaty be ratified in this parliament judge it indispensibly their duty for his graces interest in his name and theirs undersubscribers as tutors to him with all humility to protest that the said treaty may not in any sort prejudge the honors and privileges belonging to his grace and successors which have been the glorious rewards and maks of honor to the illustrious families of douglass and angus for their loyalty great and faithful services to the crown and kingdom of scotland  protest may be received and marked in the  records of parliament  as also another  was given in by the duke of hamilton in these terms  forasmuch as there is a protestation made in behalf of the duke of douglass in relation to his pretensions of having the first seat and vote in parliament which protestation being altogether groundless therefore i james duke of hamilton d protest in the contrary in regard that none of the said duke of douglass his predecessors has or enjoyed any such privilege since there were dukes or marquisles created in scotland and my prodecessors were dignified with patents of marquess and duke successively long before he or his predecessors had the same secondly william earl of angus the said duke his predecessor did upon the fourth day of june one thousand six hundred and thirty three years resign all right and claim that he or his predecessors or successors had or should have to that privilege of first sitting and voting in parliament in his majestys hands which resignation is registrate in the books of parliament the twentieth day of the said month of june one thousand six hundred and thirty three years thirdly i and my predecessors have been in continual possession of having the first seat and of first voting in parliament and have been first called in the rolls of parliament past memory of man and upon this protestation i take instruments and desire the same to be insert in the records of parliament  and the several protesters or ingivers took instruments upon their respective protests  then the vote was put approve of the act ratifying and approving the treaty of union of the two kingdoms of scotland and england yea or not and it carried approve  and the act was thereafter touched with the royal scepter by her majestys high commissioner in the usual manner  the committee appointed to meet to morrow at nine of the clock  adjourned till monday next at ten of the clock  observation lx the act for the union admitted now no debate the articles having been voted and approved one by one as is seem at large so there was nothing to do but to put the question upon and to mark it a second reading according to the custom of the parliament of scotland  the church act was to be inserted in the body of the act of union as a part of the treaty and yet it was to be passed into an act by it self and touched by the scepter in form as an act of parliament before the act of union was passed and it was accordingly done so as per the minute so that the act for the establishment of the church of scotland received a double sanction in this parliament it was not enacted singly by the union as an effect of the treaty but was established by a law before the union and again repeated in the body of the treaty of union as a ratification only or recognition of what before was an established law of the kingdom  of the first representation and petition of the commission of the general assembly i have spoken already at large there was some little debate about it now but it made no alteration in the act of the church but it past as it had been before settled  however that it may be seen what addition was made to the first overture i have added both the overture as first given in and the act as it was passed in parliament and what more was required will be seen in the representation of the commission all which are added in the appendix  it is to be observed here that there was a second representation and petition presented to the parliament this day from the commission of the general assembly upon the following occasion  the church of scotland having been effectually secured by an act of parliament called the act of security etc and which was made a part of the act of union as appears in its place there was a clause added in the end of the act of union in these words declaring nevertheless that the parliament of england may provide for the security of the church of england as they shall think expedient to take place within the bounds of the said kingdom of england and not derogating from the security above provided for establishing the church of scotland within the bounds of this kingdom which shall not suspend or derogate from the force and effect of this present ratification but shall be understood as here included without any necessity of any new ratification in the parliament of scotland  this was called an establishing the church of england with the hierarchy of episcopacy and ceremonies of the church of england by the presbyterian church of scotland i have for the more direct understanding this part given the said representation and petition in the appendix no k x with the reasons at that time given for it to which i refer  i could not suffer the two protestations of the families of douglass and hamilton to be omitted in the minutes though with respect to the length of this work i have industriously shunned private affairs but the honor of leading the van of the scots armies which these families contended for might give both the kingdoms a remembrance of what the union has delivered them from since these armies were only such as within the bowels of this poor island fought with and showed their courage in butchering and destroying one another a thing its hoped is now effectually put to an end  the affair of war is now carried abroad against the ancient professed enemy of all protestant powers where the english and scots valor need no more contend but unite together to overthrow their foreign adversaries  a contest which if they had been united in as they are now in former ages perhaps europe had paid honors enough to us before now as to the greatest nation in the world  this is the famous day to scotland in which she set her signal to the union of great britain we shall now make a short digression to enquire how it went on in the parliament of england and what reception it met with there which because it is but very short i shall bring in here and adjourning the minutes a little shall return to them again in their course  of the act of ratification after it was past in the parliament of scotland till the exemplification of it was returned from the parliament of england the parliament of england being to be the finishers of this great work and the parliament of scotland not meeting till it was late enough in the year viz the second of october the english parliament were by small adjournments put off as long as it was possible the public affairs of england could permit and longer than any parliament since the revolution had been delayed not having met till the third of december  when the public business admitting no more delay they came together  it is worth observation that this was a strange concurring juncture a critical moment as it may be called in which providence seemed to bring every thing together that could propagate the great affair of the uniting the kingdoms and which it may not be improper to notice in this place because at the opening of this session of the english parliament the queen her self took notice of it  the campaign abroad had ended in the most glorious manner for the confederates that could be desired and above all manner of expectation the french had received three blows that very summer enough to overthrow the greatest empire in the world one under the conduct of the earl of peterburgh with the english forces and fleet in the mediterranean relieving the city of barcelona and causing the french with the loss of all their cannon and ammunition to raise the siege one under the command of the duke of marlborough being the great victory at ramellies in flanders and the last under the command of prince eugene of savoy at turin in all which actions it was calculated that the french lost slain in action taken prisoners deserted and dead of their wounds above  00000 men with  00 pieces of cannon and mortars and other spoil without and indeed past all manner of account  there are two reasons why i take this occasion to mention this here  and both are introductory to the present affair   the people of england by these great successes made glad and easy in hopes of a speedy peace were prepared to grant almost any thing which the queen in reason could ask and the queen discovering a passionate desire to see her two jarring long contending kingdoms united the parliament came together with a temper disposed to yield as far as reason could suggest more than perhaps at any other juncture could have been expected   the enemies of the union whether abroad or at home received most sensible discouragement in their designs against it  and first abroad   there could be but two kinds of enemies abroad to the union and these were the french or the dutch  as to the dutch they were now in so closs a confederacy with england and their whole concern as to the war was so involved together that there was no room for any public differences about it nor indeed could the dutch have put in any rational objection against it to either side if the interest of holland clasht with the union upon any sort it was only with respect to trade and though they might perhaps on that score have some reason to be jealous of it as what might some time or other clash with them in the fishing and eastern trades yet they could have no pretense to concern themselves publicly and nationally against it and as for private negotiations to embarrass or prevent it though as i have been informed they were once or twice considering of it yet they never thought fit to meddle whether it was that they saw no prospect of succeeding in it or that they were not willing to do any thing at that time that should give an uneasiness to england or not i shall not pretend to determine    the french these had no doubt stomach enough to it and had tools enough to work with and i must own had they but made the least attempt they had effectually broke up the treaty for that time but god had tied their hands and cut them out other work they were beset and embarrast on every hand and had no leisure to look this way nor if they had had leisure had they men or money then to spare being employed with all their power and diligence to recruit their troops and restore their own affairs  and i cannot but record this as a singular hand of heaven in the affair of the union for though when the next year the french did make an attempt upon scotland when their affairs being bettered after their success in spain they thought themselves in a condition for it  they found it too late and that the opposers of the union were settled and would not appear for them  yet i must say had they made that attempt at the time of this treaty whatever they might have done in the end toward opening the eyes of the people and restoring them to their senses they had certainly put all the nation into the utmost confusion for the time and effectually have broken up the treaty  the parliament of england was now met december     0  and the queen opened the session with the following speech which i insert here as it refers to the treaty of union and also as it hints at the successes i mentioned above  the queens speech to the parliament of england on tuesday the third of december   0  my lords and gentlemen i hope we are all met together at this time with hearts truly thankful to almighty god for the glorious successes with which he has blessed our arms and those of our allies through the whole course of this year and with serious and steady resolutions to prosecute the advantages we have gained till we reap the desired fruit of them in an honorable and durable peace  the goodness of god has brought this happy prospect so much nearer to us that if we be not wanting to our selves we may upon good grounds hope to see such a balance of power established in europe that it shall no longer be at the pleasure of one prince to disturb the repose and endanger the liberties of this part of the world  a just consideration of the present posture of affairs of the circumstances of our enemies and the good disposition of our allies must needs excite an uncommon zeal and animate us to exert our utmost endeavors at this critical conjuncture  gentlemen of the house of commons  as i am fully persuaded you are all of this mind so i must earnestly desire you to grant me supplies sufficient for carrying on the war next year in so effectual a manner that we may be able to improve every where the advantages of this successful campaign and i assure you i shall make it my business to see all you give applied to those ends with the greatest care and management  my lords and gentlemen  in pursuance of the powers vested in me by act of parliament both in england and scotland i have appointed commissioners to treat of an union between the two kingdoms and though this be a work of such a nature as could not but be attended with great difficulties yet such has been the application of the commissioners that they have concluded a treaty which is at this time before the parliament of scotland and i hope the mutual advantages of an entire union of the two kingdoms will be found so apparent that it will not be long before i shall have an opportunity of acquainting you with the success which it has met with there  your meeting at this time being later than usual i cannot conclude without earnestly recommending to you to give as much dispatch to the public affairs as the nature of them will admit it being of the greatest consequence that both our friends and our enemies should be fully convinced of your firmness and the vigor of your proceedings  i shall not meddle here with any of the proceedings of the parliament of england in their own affairs they having no relation to the case in hand only make this short remark that notwithstanding the lateness of their coming together the occasion of which was known to be to attend the debates of the parliament of scotland they fell so heartily about their business and went on so smoothly in every thing that they got the land tax bill past rather sooner in it than it used to be in any former parliaments  and before christmas had not only the land tax but several other of their public funds settled and in an unusual forwardness  which is a confirmation of the extraordinary disposition which as i have noted appeared in england at this time and of which we shall see further instances presently  it was the sixteenth day of january that the ratification of the union passed in scotland on the eighteenth the duke of queensberry dispatched it away by an express there were several gentlemen who contended for the honor of carrying it up to the queen but to avoid giving any offense it was sent by an ordinary courrier or express  as soon as it came to the queen her majesty caused it to be laid before both houses that though it was first to pass one house and then the other yet the particular houses might be upon the several articles together  great was the expectation in both kingdoms from these debates of the english parliament and in scotland the fears on one hand and the hopes on the other are not to be expressed  but the house of commons deceived both sides  on the twenty second of january it was read in the house of commons  and as the best way to go through the whole they ordered every article to be read and voted upon singly in the committee of the whole house  it may perhaps surprise posterity when the debates disputes heats and long speeches which these articles occasioned in scotland come to be read  and they shall come to understand that in the house of commons in england every article passed one by one after the sedatest reading calmest considering and leasurely proceeding without any opposition amendment or alteration no not in the least  there was some small opposition against it in general in the house of lords  but no amendment offered to any particular article nor any thing considerable objected what was objected seems generally contained in some protests and reasons given in by the persons protesting against it which were but few and not much noticed  at the same time that the articles were reading in the house of commons an act was also prepared by the bishops to whom that affair was referred for security of the church of england to be passed in the parliament and then ratified by being inserted in the body of the act of union as the act for the security of of the church of scotland had been done before  this had been so far provided for by a blank left in the treaty of ratification to which so far as it concerned the security of the church of england only the parliament of scotland declared themselves to assent as if it was expressed and this was thought but just the parliament of scotland having had the drawing up and wording of their own act of security themselves though some people made loud objections against this as a plain establishing episcopacy in england by the very parliament of scotland  it was indeed leaving the thing as selfexistent as it was possible it was absolutely necessary that the treaty of union should be ratified by either kingdom  but as to the acts severally establishing the respective churches they were the distinct act and deed of either kingdom and if the scots may be said to have consented to establish episcopacy it is every whit as plain that the english have established presbytery in scotland with this further distinction that what has been done in scotland is an act of the state only in england both church and state have given their sanction to the establishment of the presbyterian church of scotland the bishops being the representatives of the church of england in this case  at the same time i think the matter clear that with respect to union their establishment is reciprocally secure and either kingdoms cannot now put their hand to the weakening or injuring the establishment of the other without setting at the same time its hand to the destruction of its own constitution  this act for the security of the church of england seems to be the exact copy of the act for security of the church of scotland with the necessary alterations only of names etc a testimony indeed unexpected to the sufficiency of the act of security for scotland in that the church of england divines being left to their full liberty to make their constitution as safe as it was possible to be contented themselves with the very same model which the scots had passed for themselves as the best and compleatest security they could devise  which they that cavilled so much at the security of the act in scotland as insufficient might have received great satisfaction from if they had thought fit   the copy of this act in england is added in the appendix no h xx  i need not count days nor enter into the minutes of this affair in the english parliament it may suffice to tell the reader that the whole act passed both houses by the fourth of march and the queen passed it on the sixth it was designed to have delayed the passing it to the eighth which was the day of her majestys coming to the crown that so the day might have been doubly remembered for the commencement of her majestys reign over the three kingdoms first and then over the united kingdom of britain but her majesty not willing to delay a thing which the whole island waited so much for and had their eyes upon went to the house of lords on the sixth of march and having passed the bill made the following speech with which i think i may close this short period of the union i mean its passing in england there was some opposition made to the articles in the house of lords in england and some lords protested against the several articles and some against all of them  but the house of lords in england having expressly forbid the printing any of the proceedings of their house i cannot enter upon the historical part of it i hope something like an abridgment of some matters etc may be found in the appendix no a xx  the queens speech to the english parliament at the passing the union my lords and gentlemen it is with the greatest satisfaction that i have given my assent to a bill for the uniting england and scotland into one kingdom  i consider this union as a matter of the greatest importance to the wealth strength and safety of the whole island and at the same time as a work of so much difficulty and nicety in its own nature that till now all attempts which have been made toward it in the course of above an hundred years have proved ineffectual and therefore i make no doubt but it will be remembered and spoke of hereafter to the honor of those who have been instrumental in bringing it to such an happy conclusion  i desire and expect from all my subjects of both nations that from henceforth they act with all possible respect and kindness to one another that so it may appear to all the world they have hearts disposed to become one people  this will be a great pleasure to me and will make us all quickly sensible of the good effects of this union  and i cannot but look upon it as a particular happiness that in my reign so full a provision is made for the peace and quiet of my people and for the security of our religion by so firm an establishment of the protestant succession throughout great britain  gentlemen of the house of commons  i have this occasion to remind you of making effectual provision for the payment of the equivalent to scotland within the time appointed by this act and i am persuaded you will show as much readiness in this particular as you have done in all the other parts of this great work  my lords and gentlemen  the season of the year being now pretty far advanced i hope you will continue the same zeal which has appeared throughout this session in dispatching what yet remains unfinished of the public business before you  it took up some time in england to ingross and inroll and make copies of this great transaction the original of which was to be lodged in the tower of london and an exemplification under the great seal of england to be sent down to scotland to be again read in parliament there and then laid up in the registers and rolls of parliament in perpetuam rei memoriam  i must now return to the minutes of the parliament where several things subsequent to the treaty but really absolutely necessary to its existence was to be finished and which took them up the time between the sending up the ratification and receiving down the exemplification as above  the minutes of the parliament of scotland continued minute lxi monday  0 january   0  prayers said  rolls called  upon reading of the minutes it was moved to insert therein the petitory part of the representation and petition of the commission of the general assembly of the church of scotland mentioned in the said minutes and after debate thereon the vote was stated insert the petitory part of the said representation and petition yea or not  and after further debate the duke of hamilton made a motion for a state of a vote wherein the petitory part of the said petition was repeated but that state of the vote being reclaimed against as yielding the question the duke of hamilton protested that he having made motion and being seconded it was against the rule of parliament to refuse a vote and to insert his motion in the minutes  then the vote was put insert the petitory part of the above representation and petition in the minutes yes or not and it carried not  thereafter it was moved that conform to the minutes of the fifteenth of january instant the parliament proceed to consider the manner of electing the representatives for scotland to the parliament of great britain whereupon a resolve was given in and read in these terms resolved that the sixteen peers and forty five commissioners for shires and burrows who are to be the members to the first parliament of great britain for and on the part of scotland be chosen out of this present parliament and that the members so chosen be the members of the first parliament of great britain if her majesty shall declare on or before the first day of may next that the lords and commons of the present parliament of england be the members of the first parliament of great britain for and on the part of england  and after reasoning thereon the further debate was adjourned till next sederunt of parliament  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation lxi it was not very easy to know the reason why they desired the petitory part as they called it of this paper to be inserted in the minutes  some were of the opinion it was to show the nation that the opposers of the union were friends to the church and that they would have it appear they stood up for the church of scotland  others thought it was with design to expose the presbyterians to the church of england as utter enemies to their constitution  nor could i ever hear any other reasons given for it  however the duke after having with some dificulty obtained a vote upon it lost it and so the representation and petition was left just where they found it viz as a testimony of the church against some things which were thought to clash both with their constitution and a little with their principles and in this it was thought it had its uses though it was not effectually answered in parliament  the affair of the electing their members for the first parliament of britain came next upon the stage and the ground of the motion mentioned in the minutes was founded upon a supposition mentioned in the twelfth article of the treaty viz that her majesty on or before the first day of may on which day the union was to take place should declare under the great seal of england that it is expedient that the lords of parliament of england and commons of the present parliament of england should be the members of the respective houses of the first parliament of great britain for and on the part of great britain now it was thought very equal that if the then present sitting parliament of england should be nammed for the first parliament of great britain in conjunction with the several members that should be named from scotland that the members of both houses which were to represent scotland should be likewise named out of the current or then present sitting parliament of scotland  it was pretty easy to conjecture that her majesty would appoint these members of the english parliament to constitute the first british parliament as it after happened and therefore this was moved now  in order to settle it in the act of parliament now to be made in which it was absolutely necessary to be determined this matter being to be signed and past into a law before the union was to take place  what vigorous opposition it met with will be seen in the next observation  minute lxii tuesday    january   0  prayers said  rolls called  the earl of stair swore the oath of alledgeance subscribed the same with the assurance and took the oath of parliament  then the resolve insert in the former days minutes anent choosing the representatives for scotland to the first parliament of great britain was again read  and after reasoning thereon an overture was given in for establishing a certain way for electing the representatives of scotland to the parliament of great britain in all time coming in the terms of the treaty of union which was read and thereafter another overture was offered for an act for choosing the sixty one members to represent scotland in the parliament of great britain as also a resolve was given in and read that previous to all other business the parliament proceed to determine the manner of electing the representatives for scotland to the parliament of great britain and to determine the number and quota of barons and burrows  and after debate the vote was stated approve the resolve insert in the former days minutes yea or not  but before voting the duke of hamilton gave in a protestation in these terms i james duke of hamilton do hereby protest for my self and in name of all those who shall adhere to this my protestation against the electing by this present parliament the sixteen peers and forty five barons and burrows who are to represent scotland in the first parliament of great britain as inconsistent with the whole tenor of the twenty second article of the treaty of union and contrair to the express words thereof whereby it is provided that after the time and place of the meeting of the said parliament is appointed by her majestys proclamation which time shall not be less than fifty days after the proclamation a write shall be immediately issued under the greatseal of great britain directed to the privy council of scotland for summoning the sixteen peers and for electing forty five members by whom scotland is to be represented in the parliament of great britain and further as utterly subversive of the right of election competent to the barons and burrows of this kingdom and desires this my protestation may be insert in the minutes and records of parliament and thereupon takes instruments  and mr william cochran of kilmaronock gave in a protestation in these terms i mr william cochran of kilmaronock do protest in my own name and in name of all those that shall adhere to this my protestation that the electing of members to represent this part of the united kingdom in the parliament of great britain out of this present parliament by the members of this house is contrary to and inconsistent with the birthrights and privileges of the barons and burrows of scotland that it is contrary to the principles of common law and diverse acts of parliament and directly opposite and contradictory to the express words and meaning of two several paragraphs of the twenty two article of the treaty of union betwixt scotland and england so lately ratified in this house and i desire this my protestation may be insert in the minutes and recorded in the books of parliament upon which i take instruments  and after reading of the above protestations each of the said protesters took instruments upon their respective protestations and adhered to the protestation given in by the other and it was agreed that the members votes be marked and that the list of their names as they vote be printed and recorded and that at calling the rolls the adherers to the above protests be also marked  then the vote was put approve the resolve insert in the former days minutes or not and it carried approve and the earl of errol the earl marischal the earl of buchan the earl of eglingtoun and the earl of galloway the viscount of kilsyth the lord semple the lord balmerino the lord blantyre the lord bargany the lord beilhaven and the lord colvill sir john lauder of fountainhal alexander fletcher of saltoun sir robert sinclair of longformacus john brisbane younger of bishoptoun sir humphrey colquhoun of luss john grahame of killearn robert rollo of powhouse thomas sharp of houstoun sir thomas burnet of leys sir david ramsay of balmain john forbes of colloden mr thomas hope of rankeillor david grahame younger of fintry alexander mackye of palgown james sinclair of stempster mr james dumbar younger of hemprigs sir henry innes younger of that ilk mr george mackenzie of inchcoulter alexander edgar james scot francis mollison robert scot john hutcheson archibald sheils mr john lion george brodie and mr john carruthers adhered to both the above two protestations  thereafter an overture given in and read for appointing the manner of electing the peers of scotland to the parliament of great britain to be by dividing the peerage into four several classes out of which they are to be chosen with some regard to the several ranks of peers in manner mentioned in the said overture  and after reasoning thereon the further debate was adjourned till next sederunt of parliament  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation lxii the reason of the earl of stairs taking the oaths now and his place in parliament was very unhappy at this time his father the earl of stair justly reputed the greatest man of counsel in the kingdom of scotland died suddenly the eighth of this month  he had been an eminent instrument in carrying on the union and had the very day of his death spoken very earnestly in the house upon some particular cases relating to the union he went out of the house not very well yet went home and wrote several letters that very night to england and in the morning died in his bed without being able to speak so much as to his lady who was with him to the general grief of the whole island being universally lamented  the debate was now renewed about choosing the representatives for the first parliament the principal objection was against choosing them out of the current parliament  as to the allegations of its being against law and constitution and against the twenty second article of the treaty just then ratified they all centered in this that it was to be passed and approved by parliament and that parliament having yet the whole legislature in their hands had power to repeal any law or statute then in being and consequently did so far repeal any clause in any act of parliament formerly made  as to its being against the treaty now ratified that was rectified thus that whereas the act of ratification of the treaty of union in the parliament of scotland in which several acts since made and to be made in the parliament of scotland were yet to be inserted lay now before the parliament of england  what ever method the parliament of scotland thought fit to take for the nomination of the members of parliament for the first parliament of great britain should and must of course also be inserted and so be and become an essential part or branch of the union and this vote having passed as per the minute is inserted in the said act for settling the election of the members and again recited in the act of union as per the exemplification appears in these words in that case only does hereby statute and ordain that the sixteen peers and forty five commissioners for shires and burghs who shall be chosen by the peers barons and burghs respectively in this present session of parliament and out of the members thereof in the same manner as committees of parliament are usually now chosen shall be the members of the respective houses of the said first parliament of great britain for and on the part of scotland which nomination and election being certifyed by a write under the lord clerk registers hand the persons so nominated and elected shall have right to sit and vote in the house of lords and in the house of commons of the said first parliament of great britain as by the said act passed in scotland for settling the manner of electing the sixteen peers and forty five members to represent scotland in the parliament of great britain may appear be it therefore further enacted and declared by the authority aforesaid that the said last mentioned act passed in scotland for settling the manner of electing the sixteen peers and forty five members to represent scotland in the parliament of great britain as aforesaid shall be and the same is hereby declared to be as valid as if the same had been part of and engrossed in the said articles of union ratified and approved by the said act of parliament of scotland and by this act as aforesaid and carried it for the new model the two protestations against it made a great noise and were printed and carried all over the kingdom besides their being printed in the minutes of parliament some said the chief reason why they insisted on this so much was that the party who opposed the union foresaw that as they had been outvoted and overpowered as they called it in every question relating to the union so they would be in this and that by consequence few or none of them would be named to the first british parliament which was really true in the consequence  the several overtures relating to the form of future elections will be spoken to in their places   minute lxiii wednesday    january   0  prayers said  rolls called  thereafter the three several overtures and resolve mentioned in the former days minutes relating to the way of electing the representatives for scotland to the parliament of great britain was again read  and after reasoning thereon the vote was put whether the sixteen peers who are to be representatives for scotland in the said parliament shall be sent by rotation or by election and it carried by election  then it was moved that it be considered what way the election shall be whether by balloting or by an open election and after debate thereon the vote was put whether it shall be by open election or by balloting and it carried by open election  thereafter moved to proceed to consider what proportions the barons and burrows shall have of the forty five members who are to sit in the house of commons of great britain and after reasoning thereon the further debate was adjourned till next sederunt of parliament  the committee appointed to meet to morrow at nine of the clock  adjourned till friday next at ten of the clock  minute lxiv friday    january   0  prayers said  rolls called  then the debate mentioned in the former days minutes was resumed anent what proportions the barons and burrows shall have of the forty five members that are to sit in the house of commons of great britain  and thereupon a clause was offered to be insert in the act regulating the manner of electing the representatives for scotland in these terms and her majesty with advice and consent foresaid statutes and ordains that thirty shall be the number of the barons and fifteen the number of the burrows to represent this part of the united kingdom in the house of commons of great britain and that no peer nor the eldest son of any peer can be chosen to represent either shire or burgh of this part of the united kingdom in the said house of commons  and after debate upon the first part of the said clause the vote was stated if the number shall be thirty for the barons and fifteen for the burrows yea or not  but before voting the earl of cromerty gave in a protestation in the terms following viz i george earl of cromerty do protest that nothing that shall be enacted as to the shire of cromerty their being adjoined to any other shire as to the method or manner of electing of commissioners to the parliament of great britain shall infer any derogation to the privileges of that shire or to my right as heretable sheriff therreof and took instruments thereupon  thereafter the vote was put if the number shall be thirty for the barons and fifteen for the burrows yea or not and it carried yea  adjourned till monday next at ten of the clock  minute lxv monday    january   0  prayers said  rolls called  then the second part of the overture mentioned in the former days minutes was again read in these terms and that no peer nor the eldest son of any peer can be chosen to represent either shire or burgh of this part of the united kingdom in the said house of commons  and after debate thereon another clause was offered in these terms declaring always that none shall elect nor be elected to represent a shire or burgh in the parliament of great britain from this part of the united kingdom except such as are now capable by the laws of this kingdom to elect or be elected as commissioners for shire or burgh to the said parliament  and after further reasoning thereon the vote was stated approve of the first clause or of the second  but before voting it was agreed that the votes be marked and that a list of the members names as they vote be printed and recorded and the lord chancellor was allowed to have his name printed and recorded amongst those who voted for the second clause  then the vote was put approve of the first clause or second and it carried second  thereafter moved that the parliament proceed to consider in what manner the several shires of this kingdom shall choose the thirty members appointed to represent them in the house of commons of great britain as also in what manner the several burrows shall choose the fifteen members appointed to represent them in the said house of commons  and after some discourse thereon the further consideration thereof was delayed till next sederunt of parliament  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observations lxiii lxiv lxv i put these three minutes together because they are all on the same subject viz the electing the representatives to the parliament of great britain which was now to be formed into an act by it self  there had been several schemes of elections laid down for the peers and three overtures had been presented to the house  some were for naming the several families and fixing the representative to be chosen out of them exclusively  and these were those who pretended to make distinctions between the ancient and modern nobility  they thought it was reasonable since the numbers of noblemen lately made and especially in the last thirty or forty years were but burdensome as they alleged to the nation that those families newly made noble should relinquish this affair to the ancient nobility as what was inherent in them but a new accession to these and that since scotland was to retrench her nobility as to sitting in parliament it was but just they should be preferred who had the most ancient title  others were for dividing the nobility into four classes and taking every year a proportioned number out of each class  others were for taking by rotation and so beginning at the extremes take the families as they rise either beginning at the eldest or youngest peers  but all these methods were rejected and that of election carried it whether it were that each party thought themselves able to carry it from the other or that they thought it their advantage that they should carry it who could make the best interest i know not  but i cannot say they took the best way for the preserving the public tranquillity since the factions and partymakings for the interest of elections which must necessarily be the consequence of this method cannot but keep up a constant feud of parties and families in the nation which must necessarily be renewed every three year the parliament being to be new chosen so often  during which time the parties will be at work to cultivate increase and fortify their several interests which it is to be doubted will go a great way to entailing a spirit of division and partystrife upon the whole nation  i wish i may be found to have made a wrong conjecture  but i shall have occasion to speak to this again in the process of this story and to observe how too much of this was made good in the very first election i mean for the second british parliament of which hereafter   after the settling of the affair of the peers it was to be determined how the forty five members for the house of commons should be proportioned and this was prepared for them before hand and given in in a scheme or overture which occasioned some dispute  the number of the shires and counties and stewartries that formerly elected were these were now to be reduced by joining two or three together where they were small and remote to thirty members each county choosing none but one  and each head of counties where any were joined together choosing but one  the burghs or royal burrows were in number these were formed into classes or districts  and were for each district to choose one member and because the meeting together of the votes in the said burghs might be both chargeable and inconvenient a medium was found out each burgh was to choose a commissioner in the same manner as usual which commissioner was to meet with the commissioners of the other burghs of that district and these were to choose the member  the respective persons concerned made some opposition about the joining of shires  but this had been a thing well concerted and therefore admitted the less dispute in the house the persons also who had made the calculations being prepared to defend the equalities of it  it remained therefore to agree on the partition of the counties and towns or as called in the minutes barons and burghs which was done with little dispute as per the minute  the motion against the eldest sons of peers had not a little to be said for it particularly that when the influence of the nobility in scotland comes to be considered with the small number of members to be chosen it might in time to come rise to what was hinted before in the project of reducing the lords that did not sit in the house of peers to a level with the commons and make them capable of sitting in the house of commons that then it might come to pass that scotland should be represented only by her nobility and that there should be scots lords in the parliament of britain so here in time it might happen that the nobility in the house of peers and their eldest sons in the house of commons might make up the whole representative of scotland   there were a great many arguments brought against this proposal but these seemed the most prevailing viz   that it had been always allowed in scotland before viz that the eldest sons of peers might be elected   that in england the eldest sons of peers do sit in the house of commons and it would break in upon the rule of equalities to alter it and put the scots gentlemen in a worse condition than the english   after some time a vote was offered that put it to an end viz to let the right of being elected remain just as it was without any alteration at all that he that had a right or capacity to vote or to be chosen before should have so still and this ended the debate  the manner of electing the commons came next to be considered  minute lxvi tuesday    january   0  prayers said  rolls called  then the parliament proceeded to consider in what manner the several shires of this kingdom shall choose the thirty members appointed to represent them in the house of commons of great britain as also in what manner the several burrows shall choose the fifteen members to represent them in the said house of commons  and after reasoning thereon a draught of an act was offered settling the manner of electing and summoning the sixteen peers and forty five commoners to represent scotland in the parliament of great britain  which being read it was moved to proceed to consider that clause of the draught of the act appointing the shires of bute and caithness to have only one representative the shires of nairn and cromerty to have only one representative and the shires of clackmannan and kinross to have only one representative to be chosen alternatively and the hail other shires and stewartries of this kingdom now represented in this present parliament each to have one representative in the parliament of great britain  and it was also moved to remit the same to a committee and after reasoning on these motions the vote was stated approve of the above clause of the act or commit  but before voting a protestation was given in in these terms i james sinclair of stempster one of the commissioners for the shire of caithness do protest for my self and the other barons and freeholders of the said shire that the vote now to be put for approving the conjunction of the said shire of caithness with bute or any other of the lesser shires is against our right of being always separately represented in parliament and that because the rule of reducing shires is by their valuation and six only to be reduced the shire of caithness ought to enjoy its representation as other greater shires and the shire of sutherland being less in valuation than caithness ought to be conjoined with the other lesser five shires which being read he took instruments thereupon and mr james dumbar younger of hemprigs the other commissioner for the said shire of caithness adhered thereto  then the vote was put approve of that clause of the act settling the manner of electing representatives for shires or commit and it carried approve  thereafter it was moved to proceed to consider in what manner the burghs shall choose their representatives  and after debate thereon the further consideration thereof was delayed till next sederunt of parliament  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  minute lxvii wednesday    january   0  prayers said  rolls called  then the parliament proceeded to the consideration of the manner in which the burrows shall elect their representatives to the house of commons of great britain  whereupon several schemes being given in and read in relation to the manner of the said election  after reasoning thereon and upon the number of the districts that shall be appointed for making of the said elections and upon a motion that the burgh of edinburgh by it self shall have always one representative  the vote was stated whether the burghs shall be divided into three districts or fifteen reserving entire the motion as to the town of edinburgh it is having one representative by it self and it carried fifteen  then the vote was put if the burgh of edinburgh by it self shall have one representative or not and it carried one  thereafter a scheme dividing the burghs into fifteen districts each of which districts is to have one representative was given in and read and is as follows the burghs of kirkwal week dornock dingwal and tayn one fortrose inverness nairn and forress one elgine cullen bamff inverury and kintore one aberdeen bervie montrose aberbrothock and brechin one forfar perth dundee couper and st andrews one crail kilrenny anstruther easter anstruther wester and pittenweem one dysart kirkaldie kinghorn and

selkirk peebles linlithgow and lanerk one dumfries sanquhar annan lochmeban and kirkendbright one wigtoun newgalloway stranrawer and whitehorn one and air irving rothsay campbelltoun and inverary one  and after debate thereupon whether it should be approven or remitted to the committee  the vote was put approve the scheme or commit and it carried approve  then it was moved that the commissioners for the treaty of union have their expenses allowed to them and a debate having arisen thereupon the further consideration thereof delayed till next sederunt of parliament  adjourned till friday next at ten a clock  observations lxvi lxvii these minutes are so expressive of the subject debated about that there needs no explanation to be given they were only matters of form dividing the burghs into districts for election and uniting the smaller remote counties to reduce the number and all being stated before hand as i noted in the last nothing material happened  minute lxviii friday    january   0  prayers said  rolls called  then the parliament proceeded to consider the motion for allowing the commissioners for the treaty of union their expenses and thereupon a resolve was given in in these terms that the charge of the commissioners sent to the treaty of union on the part of the kingdom of scotland who met at london in pursuance of her majestys nomination by authority of parliament and of the allowance to the secretary of the said commission and to the accomptants appointed by the said commission are public debts and that there be allowed to each nobleman who attended the said treaty at london the sum of twelve thousand pounds scots and to each other of the commissioners attending the sum of six thousand pounds scots and to the secretary of the said commission the sum of four thousand eight hundred pounds scots and to each of the three accomptants named by the said commission the sum of two thousand four hundred pounds scots and that the said respective sums be paid out of the sum of three hundred ninety eight thousand eighty five pounds ten shillings sterling mentioned in the fifteenth article of the said treaty of union ratified in this parliament and that the said sums be ranked and preferred after the sums payable to the proprietors of the african and indian company of scotland pari passu with the first of the public debts appointed to be paid out of the foresaid sum of three hundred ninety eight thousand and eighty five pounds ten shillings sterling money  which being read upon reasoning thereon a motion being made for restricting the quotas of the treaters expenses and some objections being also made against allowing the said expenses out of the above fund the vote was stated approve of the resolve or alter  and before voting it was agreed that the votes be marked and that a list of the members names as they vote be printed and recorded  then the vote was put approve of the resolve or alter and it carried approve  it was also agreed that the earl of ilay designed in the commission for the treaty lord archibald campbell be allowed his expenses as a nobleman  thereafter it was moved that the commissioners for the treaty   0  have allowance of their expenses in manner following viz each nobleman five hundred pounds sterling each baron three hundred pounds sterling and each burrow two hundred pounds sterling  and after debate thereupon the vote was put grant allowance to the commissioners for the treaty   0  of their expenses in the above manner yea or not and it carried yea and the said expense was declared to be a public debt and it was remitted to the committee for stating of public debts to state and rank the same as a public debt  thereafter it was moved that no representative from either shire or burgh from this kingdom to the parliament of great britain shall have any allowance for their charges and expenses in attending the same  and after debate it being moved to delay the consideration thereof till next sederunt of parliament  the vote was put proceed or delay and it carried delay  the committee appointed to meet to morrow at nine a clock  adjourned till monday next at ten of the clock  observation lxviii this proposal was ill received indeed and a horrid clamor raised at it without doors the people who had been hot against the union took hold of it with an unbridled railery reproaching the treaters in a most indecent manner exclaiming at the very thing it self now the nation might see they said what they had been doing at london and what they had been pursuing ever since that they had sold their country for a sum of money and they were beginning to share it among them this referred to the equivalent out of which this money was to be paid  that they voted for one another the new commissioners and the old and that this was taking that money away to their private uses which they had pretended was to be employed in encouraging the manufactures and employing the poor raising stocks for the woollen trade and funds for the fishing that these were the specious pretenses when the nation was brought in to accept of the equivalent but that now it was done and over now they were dividing the spoil  it would be endless to set down the ill nature of the day as soon as this proposal was talked of without doors and yet there was really no reason the gentlemen who went to england upon that occasion who set all their private affairs aside to serve their country and attended in england several months at expense enough should do all this at their own charges when at the same time every other article had its supply out of the general fund and therefore notwithstanding the clamours of the people and several attempts within doors first to reject it wholly then to refuse the payment of it out of the equivalent which was indeed refusing it wholly since there was no other fund to pay it  and lastly to restrict the quantity yet at last it past as it had been at first proposed  the allowance to the old treaters they alleged was a trick to draw in the allowance for the new because being to be voted together it was certain the old would vote for the new that they might be sure the new would in return vote for the old  but there was certainly the same reason that one should be allowed their expense as the other since though they could not then bring it to a conclusion yet their pains and expenses might not be the less but rather the more for that and thus they were both voted to be allowed their charges as per the minute  minute lxix monday   february   0  prayers said  rolls called  thereafter the first sederunt of parliament after passing the act settling the manner of electing and summoning the representatives for scotland to the parliament of great britain was appointed for private business  then the motion made the former sederunt anent allowing no charges or expenses to the representatives from the shires and burghs of this kingdom to the parliament of great britain resumed  and after debate thereon the vote was put whether there shall be a clause in relation to the charges and expenses of the representatives for shires and burghs insert in the act settling the manner of electing etc yea or no and it carried no  thereafter it was moved that at all meetings of the peers for electing of their representatives such peers as are absent be allowed to have votes in the said election by proxies the said proxies being peers and they and their constituents being qualified at the time by taking the oaths required by law and that the said absent peers may either vote by their proxies or by sending up lists subscribed by them  and after reasoning thereon the vote was put allow proxies in the above terms yea or not and it carried allow  agreed that the meeting of the peers for the said elections shall be at any place her majesty shall appoint within the limits of scotland  agreed also that in case of the decease or legal incapacity of any of the forty five commoners to be chosen out of this session of parliament to the parliament of great britain the shire stewartry or district of burrows for which he is a member shall choose another in his place  agreed likewise that in case of the decease or legal incapacity of any of the sixteen peers the peers shall meet and elect another in place of the deceaser  moved that such peers of scotland who are likeways peers of england or who after the union shall be created peers of great britain have no vote in the election of the sixteen peers from scotland to the parliament of great britain  and after debate thereon it was put to the vote whether any clause in relation to the said motion shall be insert in the above act settling the manner of election etc yea or not and it carried not  thereafter it was agreed that when the votes of the commissioners for burrows who shall meet for electing their representatives are equal the president of the meeting shall have a casting or decisive vote beside his vote as a commissioner representing the burgh from whom he is sent and that the commissioner for the eldest burgh shall preside at the first meeting and the commissioner for the other burghs by turns as the burghs are now called in the rolls of parliament  adjourned till to morrow at ten of the clock  observation lxix the charges being allowed to the treaters it was thought the house would go on and allow this also but it was presently rejected  some said it was offered by way of jest as a reproach to the gentlemen that took money for the service of their country  but the proposal was made another way viz that no representative from either shire or burgh from this kingdom to the parliament of great britain shall have any allowance for their charges or expenses etc it was alleged that the english took no such allowance and that it would be a reproach to scotland if the scots gentry should take their charges from the country and the english did not  to this it was answered that though the english gentlemen generally refused the allowance of the countries for their attendance yet that by law there was such an allowance due to them from the countries and they might not only justify accepting it but might legally demand it and therefore it ought in like manner be left at liberty in scotland when doubtless the scots representatives in proportion to their capacities would be found as frank and generous in sparing the country as the english  and it was remarkable that in subsequent elections in scotland for the counties it was very often agreed jointly by the several candidates for election that whosoever carried it should relinquish any pretense to an allowance from the county for their service in parliament  the affair of proxies in election of peers is expressed at large in the minute and needs no remark nor was there any long debate upon it in the house  the other heads also being matter of form only were readily agreed to  there was indeed some struggle about excluding these noblemen of scotland who were noblemen in england or should be peers of britain from voting but they could not carry it  and yet it is to be observed that at the first election of the sixteen peers by virtue of this act some of the peers of scotland protested against the votes of those that had english or british titles a debate that is not yet  viz at the

manner of electing the representative was now past and because it is an act containing a great variety of heads useful for posterity to know when the respective elections may come on i have inserted it in the appendix to this work no i x x  the overtures for plantation of kirks and valuation of teinds were put both together and proceeded upon as one act the case was in short thus  it had been the custom in former parliaments to grant a commission to certain of their own members to sit as a court and to judge and determine of several things relating to the two heads above viz plantation of kirks and valuation of teinds the things they determined of were generally sale and valuation of teinds or tithes in the several paroches augmentation of the stipends of ministers prorogation of tacks or leases of teinds dividing or disjoyning paroches or parishes where they where too large erecting and endowing new churches annexing and dismembering churches and the like   it was some time since these commissions had been discontinued and that was not all the misfortune but all the registers and rolls of that court were lost in the great fire which happened in the parliament closs at edinburgh in the year   00 so that there was no having recourse to any thing past  this was a great loss to the church of scotland upon several accounts and had it remained unsettled at this juncture the injury had been past remedy wherefore it was earnestly desired and readily granted that all the powers formerly exercised by the said commission of parliament should now be conveyed to some particular court judicatory or body of men that should judge and determine in such cases some were for having it vested in the church it self and committed to the general assembly  but it was alleged that were to make the church judge in her own cause and put too much power into the hands of the assembly others were for desiring it to be in the hands of the crown to grant commission to proper persons as the parliament did before  but that was objected against as dangerous to the safety and constitution of the church at length it was devolved on the lords of the session and there it past as in the act printed also at large in the appendix no k x x  the committee also now made their report about the coin and the manner of settling it the time of reducing and calling in the money of which i have spoken already  but the report of the committee being recited in the proclamation and that proclamation stating the particulars exactly i have placed the said proclamation in the appendix no l

clock  observations lxxv lxxvi lxxvii the church act about kirks and teinds was now settled the motion of having these things still referred to a parliamentary commission was thought to proceed from these who were willing it should remain in the same condition it had lain in for a long time viz unsettled and unprovided for since it must yearly put the persons concerned to make application to the parliament of britain which was remote and very troublesome to get such commission settled or triennially at least  and whereas while it lay before their own parliament it had for some years been unsettled and the church left as it were unregarded in those affairs it might much more be supposed to be neglected if referred to the british parliament  that at the end of every parliament which at furthest would be but three years this matter behoved to be laid before them again and diligently solicited in order to have it effectually settled  this therefore was vigorously opposed and it was carried to be referred to the lords of the session as per the act vide the appendix no k xx  the proemiums and drawbacks on the exportation of corn had been settled as before is observed and are inserted in the union as per the act appears but in regard the union was not to take place till may and the want of those allowances might put a stop to the exportation in the mean time and particularly that there was a great dutch fleet and several norway ships in the port of leith at that time which would in case of the encouragements now to be given carry away a great quantity of corn before the first of may which exportation of corn would be a great advantage to the counny therefore this short lived act was proposed for the encouragement of trade but it was alleged that the term of the commencement of the union was so near that no convoy would stir or ships sail before that time would be come and the advantages would be the same to the merchant upon which the bill was dropped in the house and came to nothing  the debate about the surgeons and apothecaries never came to any head the design was to authorize the apothecaries and chirurgeones to administer physic without the assistance or prescription of the physicians in extraordinary cases  it would have been perhaps a a contested thing if the house had been of longer continuance but the end of the parliament being so near there was no time for it  the act about kirklands and discharging the feuduties was a necessary law at that time in some special causes and met with no opposition  the house sat on thursday the twentieth of february but was wholly employed about private business which i have all along omitted as not to the purpose on the twenty first they did little but read the bill about prohibiting musters etc and past it with the church act  minute lxxviii wednesday    february   0  prayers said  rolls called  report of the committee anent the accounts of the african and indian company was

preceding the first of august school and remitted to the committee to rectify the account accordingly  the committee appointed to meet to morrow at nine of the clock  adjourned till friday next at ten a clock  minute lxxxi friday   march   0  prayers said  rolls called  this day the parliament was only employed on private business  observations lxxviii lxxix lxxx lxxxi the house had now very little public business before them the affair of the african company and such things as related to the payment of the equivalent were the principal matters and this is the reason of putting so many days minutes together in which i omit the private affairs before them as not to my purpose  the committee had been long upon the affair of the equivalent they had settled the coin and given in the report as before the next thing was to state the accounts of the african company and this having taken them up a great deal of time was at last settled and reported by the committee and is as follows  report of the committee concerning the indian and african company edinburgh    february   0  the committee to whom it was remitted to consider what the capital stock and interest of the african company may amount to and how and to whom the same shall be paid having considered the foresaid remit with a representation given in to them by the directors of the said company and the companies books and accounts of money paid in to them with the instructions relative thereto and a report of a subcommittee of their number who did inspect and examine the said companies books with the said accounts and instructions and did calculate the sums therein contained find that the total capital stock advanced by the proprietors of the said company with interest thereof at five per cent from the respective terms at which the same was payable to the first of may one thousand seven hundred and seven extends in all to two hundred and twenty nine thousand four hundred and eighty two pounds fifteen shillings one penny and five sixths of a penny sterling and that the total accounts of the debts due by the company the instructions whereof were also produced to and considered by the committee extends in principal and interest to the sum of fourteen thousand eight hundred and nine pounds eighteen shillings eleven pence sterling both which sums together amount to two hundred and forty four thousand two hundred and ninety two pounds fourteen shillings and five sixths of a penny sterling out of which sums is to be deduced of money lent to severals of the proprietors with the interest thereof the sum of one thousand one hundred and twenty six pounds thirteen shilling nine pence and five sixths of a penny so that there remains yet due to the proprietors of the said company of neat balance upon the first of may next the sum of two hundred and forty three thousand one hundred and sixty six pounds three pence sterling which sums the committee are of opinion should be paid in to the company or these commissioned by them out of the equivalent upon the first day of may next and the committee are of opinion that the court of directors and council general nominate some particular persons who shall be authorized to receive the hail capital stock and interest payable to the company from the commissioners to be appointed for the equivalent and who shall be empowered to grant a discharge thereof with absolute warrandice and that the said persons so to be named in conjunction with a committee of parliament to be named as overseers shall be liable for the said moneys being truly applied and paid to the proprietors without loss delay or defalcation and that the receipts granted by the companies cashiers or extracts of the proprietors payment out of their books shall be a sufficient instruction of each mans share to entitle them to demand payment thereof which extracts shall be given gratis and that the certificate or extract out of their books shall be a sufficient warrant for a charge of horning for payment of their shares against the persons to be named who receives the money and the committee are of opinion that gavin plummer and andrew cockburn who were cashiers of the said company when the sums of money foresaid were paid in to the company should now be the cashiers and tellers for receiving the sums abovewritten from the commissioners of the equivalent and for paying out and delivering the same to the respective proprietors and others deriving right from them upon the said gavin plummer and andrew cockburn their finding sufficient caution of their faithfulness in performing the premises in the same manner as they found formerly and in case the said sum be not paid at the said first of may next to the persons foresaid then and in that case the committee are of opinion that the sum of one hundred and fifty five thousand and fifty four pounds fifteen shillings and two thirds of a penny as a part of the said total sum due and payable at the said first day of may next should bear annualrent from and after the said first day of may during the not payment thereof and that the annualrent after the first of may foresaid effeiring to the said sum of one hundred and fifty five thousand and fifty four pounds fifteen shillings and two thirds of a penny should be paid out of the equivalent in the same manner and to the same persons as the principal sum and annualrents due before the said first of may next  and also the committee find that the debts due to the company by the proprietors of their subscriptionmoney with interest till the first of may next extends to the sum of twenty two thousand nine hundred and fifty one pounds three shillings three pence and three sevenths of a penny which sum the said committee are of opinion needs not be sought in from the said debitors in regard the same behoved to be paid back to them and would increase the capital stock due to the company  and the committee find that the dead stock belonging to the said company and consisting of the ship the caledonia lying in the river of clyde with her furniture guns and apparelling that lodging at the back of milns square over against the tronkirk with some little household plenishing therein and the companies share of the cargo of the speedwel shipwracked in the east indies effeiring to the stock of six hundred pounds sterling with the burden of cellar rent of the stores of the caledonia and the expenses of keeping the said ship after the first of may and of the fraught seamen and factors wages of the said cargo of the speedwell and other supervenient charges upon the said ship and cargo does in the whole extend to one thousand six hundred and fifty four pounds eleven shillings and two thirds of a penny sterling as to which the committee having considered that the commissioners of the council general and directors who are to receive the money and grant discharges therefore are not only to be bound in absolute warrandice by the said discharges but be obliged to give personal attendance both at receiving in and giving out the said money and to keep an office for that effect and to pay cashiers tellers and bookkeepers and to provide books chests and other conveniences for receiving and keeping the money until it be paid out and will be likeways obliged and burdened to employ advocates writers and other persons for advising the discharges to be granted at receiving and paying out of the money and defending processes on competition of rights or making up of sufficient titles in the person of these who are to receive out the money and the necessar attendance and loss of time of the said commissioners of the council general and directors both for bygones and in time coming and the losses upon telling at receiving in and giving out of the money the said committee are of opinion that the foresaid dead stock extending in hail with and under the said burden to the said sum of one thousand six hundred and fifty four pounds eleven shillings and two thirds of a penny sterling ought to be allowed to the said company and retained by them for the ends and uses foresaid and particularly to enable the council general and directors of the said company to pay such necessary allowances and satisfaction to the several gentlemen who suffered in their persons and goods for the companies services as their services losses and sufferings do justly merit  and the committee having considered the act of parliament establishing the company privileges thereincontained and that part of the representation relating thereto they are of opinion that when the company is dissolved and the capital stock and interest paid in by the commissioners and others entrusted with the equivalent to the hands of the commissioners appointed by the council general and directors to receive the same every proprietors share may be recovered out of the hands of the said commissioners to be appointed by the said council general and directors as other money belonging to private persons  sic subscribitur haddingtoun i p c  on the third of march the report of the committee was only again read and little done the day being taken up on private business  on the fifth they spent a little time in considering further the report of the committee  and read an overture concerning the debts of the company which as it was the foundation of the act that afterward passed and by which all this matter was settled i think it very needful to publish it and have therefore placed it in the appendix no a x x  upon this overture as is above noted together with the report of the committee the act for settling the payment of these things out of the equivalent to the african company was built and the regulation being exactly set

the persons who had a right to the payment by act of parliament   some thought this was dishonorable to the directors of the company and they moved that they should appoint persons to receive and distribute the money but this last met with very little approbation   i care not to take notice of some disputes that happened upon this occasion because they seemed to make personal reflections  and only signified that some people were more jealous of one another than i hope there was occasion for on either side  but it was evident the people who were to receive the money were generally most concerned to have it paid them by the commissioners of the equivalent immediately as being the surest method and so it was at last agreed  the money being thus directed and who should have the payment it is not material to take notice of the several claims put in debts demanded of the company and services to be rewarded they were all matter of private interest and i omit them of course  the affair of the coin and the report of the committee i have noted already and as it issued in a proclamation and that proclamation recited the report of the committee i have inserted the whole in the appendix no l x x  on the seventeenth the act for the payment of the capital and interest of the african and indian company was read and little more but private business was done the union was now finished in england and expected down every day and the parliament saving the dispatch of some private bills had nothing before them but the african affair which held them just to the end of their time  minute lxxxvi wednesday    march   0  prayers said  rolls called  then my lord commissioner made the following speeech viz my lords and gentlemen i have received by her majestys command an exemplification under the great seal of england of the act past in the parliament of that kingdom ratifying the treaty of union in the same terms as the treaty was past here  her majesty orders it to be inserted in the books of parliament and to remain with the records of this kingdom for which end i have put it in my lord clerk registers hand  my lords and gentlemen it is a great satisfaction to the queen that the union is thus happily concluded in her reign and i am commanded by her majesty to assure you that nothing shall be omitted on her part to make the whole island feel the good effects of it  and as i doubt not but the finishing of this great affair is acceptable to you so i hope you will study to promote a cordial union with our neighbors for the greater happiness and advantage of both kingdoms  then the exemplification of the act of the parliament of england ratifying the treaty of union betwixt scotland and england under the great seal of england was read and ordered to be recorded  act for

electing the sixteen peers and forty members to represent scotland in the parliament of great britain were ordered to be proclaimed and printed  thereafter the act for payment of the capital and interest to the proprietors of the african and indian company of scotland out of the equivalent was again read as also read over by paragraphs  and upon reading the last paragraph a petition for the earl of crawfurd craving that a debt due to the deceast major john lindsay by the african company might be allowed out of their effects was read and an allowance was granted in the terms of a deliverance thereon  as also upon another petition given in by the relict of captain baillie who died in the said companies service for some allowance for her great loss an allowance was also granted to her in the terms of a deliverance thereon and after several amendments were made upon the said act the same was voted and approven  adjourned till friday next at ten a clock  observation lxxxvi now the work drew toward a close the long hopes of those people who promised themselves doubts delays and long hesitations in england were entirely vanished and people were generally surprised at the treaty being so readily and so summarly past in england the gentlemen on the other side had two kinds of expectation from the parliament of england   delay and length of time in debating and disputing with amendments conferences and free conferences between the upper and lower house of parliament in england according to the known way and usage in cases of such difficulty as this was   amendments or alterations which might occasion the respective articles so amended to be remitted or returned to the parliament of scotland to be reconsidered by which means not the particular articles only but perhaps the whole treaty might necessarily go through the hands of the parliament in scotland again and so the time which began to approach viz the first of may at which time the union was to take place should be elapsed and so it might be put off to another parliament and the work be to be done over again   but all men were surprised when they understood the parliament of england had past it in the gross without the least deviation alteration or amendment  the additions which the english parliament made by inserting the act of security for the church of england in the body of the union agreeable to the same in scotland was nothing but what was provided for according to that clause before noted in these terms that the parliament of england may provide for the security of the church of england as they think expedient to take place within the said bounds of the kingdom of england and not derogating from the security above provided for establishing the church of scotland within the

to the crown by a land tax that part of the united kingdom now called scotland shall be charged by the same act with a further sum of forty eight thousand pounds free of all charges as the quota of scotland to such tax and so proportionally for any greater or lesser sum raised in england by any tax on land and other things usually charged together with the land and that such quota for scotland

that part of the united kingdom now called scotland shall not be charged with any imposition upon malt during this present war and seeing it cannot be supposed that the parliament of great britain will ever lay any sorts of burdens upon the united kingdom but what they shall find of necessity at that time for the preservation and good of the whole and with due regard to the circumstances and abilities of every part of the united kingdom therefore it is agreed that there be no further exemption insisted upon for any part of the united kingdom but that the consideration of any exemptions beyond what are already agreed on in this treaty shall be left to the determination of the parliament of great britain xv whereas by the terms of this treaty the subjects of scotland for preserving an

the several alterations made in the laws trade customs and constitution of both kingdoms by the union the union was no sonner concluded and the ratifications exchanged as has been said but an unlucky business happened that opened afresh the mouths of those that had all along watched occasions for that purpose and furnished them with matter of new clamor the particulars are as follows  the time when the union was to take place was the first of may after which by the fourth article of the treaty the subjects of either kingdom were to have a free intercourse of trade to enjoy equal privileges and were to be upon an equal foot as to taxes customs duties prohibitions etc as by words of the treaty viz article   th  that all the subjects of the united kingdom of great britain shall from and after the union have full freedom and intercourse of trade and navigation to and from any port or place within the said united kingdom and the dominions and plantations thereunto belonging and that there be a communication of all other rights privileges and advantages which do or may belong to the subjects of either kingdom except where it is otherways expressly agreed in these articles but in the interval of time between the finishing of the treaty and the first of may all things by consequence remained as they were and all merchandises being imported into scotland upon the foot of the former customs which were much lower than in england the merchants in both kingdoms laying hold of that advantage for their private gain fraughted abundance of ships in france and holland with all sorts of goods which paid high duties in england landing them in scotland and paying only the scots dues presuming that after the first of may they should be sent free to england according to the general article of freedom of commerce  to let the reader more exactly into this case i shall state the difference of the duties of some of the several commodities which being thus imported into scotland were after to be carried into england such as wines brandies salt lintseed iron timber deals etc being the chief kinds of goods imported in scotland and which the duties were most complained of  besides this it is to be observed that the customs of scotland being let in tack as they call it in scotland or in farm as in england the tacksmen or farmers to encourage the merchants to make large importations made several compositions and abatements to them less or more according as the quantity of the goods imported encouraged by this means the customs were still reduced and yet the farmers of the customs made great gain of that interval of trade  another article of the contrivance of the merchants on this head was in england upon the drawbacks on foreign goods imported there and exported again by certificate  and this indeed was less honest by far than the other though both of them politic enough and which was thought had slipped the notice of the treaters on both sides during the negotiating the treaty  the exporters in this case sent goods from england to scotland by certificate drawing back the duties paid on their import in england as being sent to a foreign country after the union the kingdoms becoming one it was by the treaty left open for them to carry the same goods back into england and sell them there as if they had paid the duty  the principal article this circumstance relates to was tobacco which paying a large duty of near six pence per pound in england above six thousand hogsheads as i have been told some have said much more even to double the quantity but i choose to relate the lowest number was sent into scotland and   per pound of the said custom drawn back by the merchant  i need not acquaint the reader that the exporter was both bound in a bond with securities and also sworn against the relanding or returning it into england again but as the union gave a free intercourse of trade i e exporting and importing to and from the respective kingdoms without paying any duties or any molestation whatsoever so their bonds seemed to be of no value in that case but whether the oath was of no value to them is another affair and not for me to determine here  it is evident the tobacco was sent to scotland in quantities so much above the usual consumption of that country that it could rationally be esteemed to be with no other prospect than of returning it into england again after the union and so to obtain the advantage of the drawback  in like manner it is evident the great import into scotland of wines and brandy from france either directly or by way of holland was so much beyond the ordinary consumption of the place that it could be with no other end than the carrying it into england after the union should take place nor did the merchants stick to own that to be in the design  the merchants in london especially such as were concerned in the trade to spain italy and portugal and consequently had the greatest injury made loud complaints of this as an intolerable inequality and a thing so unjust that they made no doubt to concern the government in it and the parliament being then sitting they addressed the house of commons for relief  their address was followed with numerous solicitations they even wearied the members the secretaries of state and every body that they thought would espouse their cause that as some have expressed it they almost drove the house by the force of their clamours upon a debate of a thing which most people thought they had really no power at least no reason to meddle with  the parliament then sitting was the same which had in concert with the parliament of scotland made this union and it could not seem reasonable that the parliament of england in its separate capacity could be qualified to explain any part of the articles which were then ratified and recorded in both kingdoms and neither parliament could determine in things belonging to the other any more than they could have done before the treaty  however this was the house of commons went upon it great application being made by the english merchants and after some debate came to this resolution resolved that the importation of goods and merchandises of the growth and produce of france and other foreign parts into scotland in order to be brought from thence into england after the first of may and with intention to avoid the payment of the english duties will be to the damnage and ruin of the fair traders to the prejudice of the manufactures of england a great loss to her majestys revenue of the customs and a very great detriment to the public    and in pursuance of this resolution a bill was ordered to be brought in the enacting part of which i have annexed to this work in the appendsx no c   the title of it was as follows a bill to prevent the mischiefs of a fraudulent practice in obtaining drawbacks for goods carried from england to scotland in order to be brought back again and in carrying goods from foreign parts into scotland in order to be brought into england without paying the english duties and for better securing the duties of goods brought from the east indies was according to order read a second time and committed to a committee of the whole house  this bill past all the usual forms in the house of commons and went up to the lords but after long debate in the vpperhouse the lords rejected it  it is true that upon the petitions and representations of the scots merchants there were long debates and great difficulties in the passing this bill in the house of commons and the scots demanding by the letter of the treaty a free intercourse of trade alleged they could not be refused the importing of any goods out of scotland into england which were not by law counterband in scotland before the said treaty since having been fairly admitted to an entry in the customhouse of scotland and all the duties which were demanded being paid the free intercourse of trade between the nations immediately opened all the ports of england to their goods  this argument was too powerful and too plain not to have its weight in the house but to solve this there was an exception put in to the bill for the property of scots merchants as a thing which would effectually remove their scruples and answer the end both of the union one way and of the portugal merchants another for the complaint seemed to ly not so much against the freedom of scots merchants importing their own goods but of foreigners dutch french jews and english who under the cover of scots men had crowded in vast quantities of wine and brandy merely to evade paying the english duty taking the advantage of the interval of time and thereby bringing their goods to market upon terms vastly differing from the course of trade  to prevent this the act was to provide that all the properties of the scots merchants should be exempted and be allowed to come to england but this was restricted in point of proof   the onus probandi lay upon the merchant in which many niceties occurred needless to be mentioned here   none were to be reputed scots merchants but such as resided in scotland this excluded the scots merchants at london and in holland who were deeply embarke in these importations and on whose management the chief part of the design was charged   the proof of the importations and properties lay before the commissioners of the customs and it was doubtful how it should be determined  under all these difficulties with other restrictions needless here this first act struggled and past the commons and yet it was thought also that had the scots been fairly excepted they would have been well enough pleased with such a difference and they would have had some reason to have been so nor was the exception of foreigners altogether unreasonable the thing being really a fraud in trade and a hardship upon the fair traders but the main objection turned upon another point viz the power the parliament of england alone could have to determine construe or explain any one of the articles of the union which being made by the concurrence of the two respective kingdoms could not be subject to the cognizance of either parliament in its separate capacity and upon this head the lords rejected the bill and this being the main thing in my observation on which the whole case depended i have purposly omitted the reasonings on that article on either side which were very many referring my reader to the substance of the address of the scots merchants to the house of lords and to an observation made by an eminent member of the parliament which i have added in the appendix in order to leave this case as clear to posterity as is possible marked no  d  and no  e   however it was absolutely necessary if possible to bring this affair to some conclusion and in order to this the parliament at that time drawing near an end for they could sit no longer than the last of april the union commencing the   st of may wherefore it was thought expedient to give the house a short recess that this matter might come again upon the stage whereupon the queen prorogued the parliament for three days only and in a short speech made them acquainted with the reason of it viz in order to find out an expedient to prevent any mischiefs arising to either kingdom in the short interval of time between that and the commencement of the union  when the house met again the commons began again and voted to the same purpose as before and ordered a bill to be brought in in the same terms as before  the vote of the house of commons ran thus that the importation of sundry goods of the growth of france through scotland into england with design to avoid paying the duties payable for the same in england is a notorious fraud ruinous to the fair traders and injurious to her majestys revenue  upon this vote the merchants at london renewed their clamours and all methods possible were made use of to bring the parliament into it the government would willingly have foundout some expedient to have softened the general complaint and to have prevented the injury to the revenue but all mediums were found imperfect and the house of lords persisting in the first scruple it fell to the ground  while this was transacting the merchants went on with their importation and though the quantity did not amount to what had been alleged would be brought in yet it was a very great quantity indeed and the damage to the revenue in england appears by the following calculation  there were not some wanting in either kingdom who expected to make early objections against this proceeding as a breach of the union on the english side and had the act past though with the utmost precautions discovered that they would have improved that suggestion to the utmost and yet it was observable that none were so forward to approve of the act of restriction as some gentlemen who declared their aversion to the union and their willingness to have it dissolved again  whatever loss therefore the government received by this affair they avoided the stroke it would have given to the union and the enemies of the treaty lost the opportunity of saying it was broken  the first of may being arrived the scots merchants began to apply themselves to the government for the settlement of this matter and the importation of their goods to england this held a long de bate and took up a great deal of time however the scots shipped their goods took certificats in scotland of their being fairly imported there before the first of may and though after many hesitations and delays about the middle of june the fleet sailed for london consisting of about  0 sail mostly loaded with wine and brandy  as soon as they arrived in the river of thames the customhouse officers made a general seizure both of ship and goods and all was put to a full stop  this perplexed the merchands very much and loud clamours were made of it in scotland as a breach of the union the royal borroughs in scotland held their convention upon this affair and the merchants concerned in the said ships presented a petition to them which because it relates the complaint in express terms and for the information of those people in england who do not particularly understand the methods there i insert at large in the appendix  it may be observed that the royal burghs in scotland have their meetings on emergent occasions for the regulation of trade and settling their own affairs besides their annual meeting  the merchants of scotland generally speaking are all freemen of some one or other of these burghs and there happening to be a convention or meeting as above at that time the merchants presented to them their petition entreating them to represent their case to the queen setting forth their grievances this petition you will find in the appendix no a    pursuant to this petition the convention of buroughs represented their case very earnestly to the government by the means of the scots secretarys of state then at london  their address i have also placed in the appendix to this work no b    and thus the case was wholly referred to the queen and council  it was thought hard indeed that the ships should not be suffered to unlade the season being hot and the wines exposed to spoil but there was no immediate remedy the customhouse officers could not possibly do otherwise for this reason had the debate been what duty they should pay they might have suffered them to unlade into the queens warehouses and have detained them there till such duty had been paid but the trade of france being universally prohibit by act of parliament they could not be admitted to an entry but were all forfeited both ships and goods  the government willing if possible to give the necessary relief in this exigence the attorney general and all other judges whose advice was necessary were required to give their opinion but they differed in their judgments so much that no resolution could be made in it  however that the merchants might be made easy it was proposed to them that they should land their goods upon condition that they gave security to stand to the judgment of the british parliament this was thought but reasonable and some complied with it and had their ships unloaden others refused such securities and their goods lay longer and suffered more  at length a medium was found out which was to let all the merchants have the possession of their goods serving the possessors of the goods with a writ of devenirunt out of the exchequer  this is a kind of write which puts the matter in a form of prosecution only that in case of further occasion the queen might recover her dues and so the merchants had their goods and the decision of it was left to time and to the british parliament  thus it continued in a course of law though not under prosecucution till the meeting of the british parliament when by a vote of the house of commons the whole affair was discharged and all prosecutions ordered to be stopped of which hereafter mean time the clause in parliament so much struggled about you will find in the appendix to this work no c    thus ended this difficult matter in which is to be noted the exactness of the house of lords and tenderness in respect to the union which delivered us from the apprehensions of an invasion upon the articles and notwithstanding the damage done to the revenue which was finally sacrificed to the ease of the peoples minds the whole claim was let fall  it may be thought it had this use however that the difficulty which appeared in it checked the quantity of the goods that would otherways have been brought in which would have been intolerable and some thought this was part of the design in it  while this was transacting the government began to take the state of the nation into their consideration in order to settle things conform to the respective constitutions and yet to put the union as far in practice as the general circumstances would admit and this took up the most part of the time between the first of may when the union took place and the sitting down of the first british parliament nor was the thing without its difficulties as will appear in the several articles following   the customs    the excise   the equivalent   petty justice   the forces and the coin   previous to these particulars it is requisite to observe that the administration of public affairs was left to remain as before in the ministry of a privy council a treasury a chancellor and two secretaries of state with all other dependents and substitutes as before  this the queen thought fit to order not only because the weight of business was too great and the particulars too nice and of too much consequence to suffer a sudden change which would have made large intervals in the course of administration put a stop to the public business and influence private persons affairs also but as the queen has always thought it best in such cases to take advice of her great council the parliament a happiness we have often complained for want of in former reigns so it was referred to the sitting of the british parliament that it might be settled to the satisfaction of the nation by the advice of their full representative  thus the civil list remained as it was the army was subsisted upon the old establishment and paid from the cess granted by the parliament of scotland as far as it extended the deficiency was left to the parliament of britain to supply as appears by the act of parliament granting the cess  on the first of may one thousand seven hundred and eight the army received their pay from london the regiment of foot guards was received as english guards and the command of them given to the marquess of lothian as colonel the guards were clothed after the english manner i mean as the english guards and the whole establishment of the forces received their regulations and pay from the british government  but two things required an immediate application viz the customs and excise for these being to be established upon a new foot viz according to the articles and to commence precisely on the first of may it was absolutely necessary that they should be first settled  the same reasons made it absolutely necessary to bring down some englishmen to supply inferior offices both in the customs and excise at least till proper persons might be found or instructed to act without them  it was thought at first that as scotland being united to england the whole united kingdom coming under one denomination and under one method of government so the revenues should become united in one general collection that the customs should be managed by the commissioners at london and under them only by collectors and other officers in the respective ports in scotland as it is in england all subservient to and under the government of the commissioners at london and the like in the excise  but the business appeared too weighty and embarrast with too many difficulties to admit of such a conjunction and indeed were i to enter into an historical account of the labyrinths which the first settlement of these duties led the managers of them into what difficulties they met with what clamours were raised at their conduct however impartially they endeavored to act it would look as if i were going to write of persons instead of relating things and that is none of my business here  it will be enough here to touch the matters of fact by which it will appear both that the government proceeded in the best method in putting the customs and excise into a distinct management in scotland and also that the commissioners of both showed they wanted neither judgment or application in a settlement so speedy under such perplexed circumstances as they found these revenues in at first  the commissioners named for the management of the customs were as is noted three englishmen two scotsmen englishmen sir alexander rigby james isaacson esquire lionel norman esquire scotsmen sir robert dickson baronet mr will boil bro to the e of glasgow    the whole extent of the kingdom lay before them and they had not only new officers to place in the respective ports but they had all their old officers to instruct in the new methods customs and manner of securing and accounting the respective duties  this obliged the government even before commissioners were named and before the time for the new collection began to direct five persons from england experienced in the methods and usage of the customs to go down into scotland to put them into some manner of order as to exports and imports especially of goods to be passed between the two kingdoms when the union was to take place and of imports which might happen before the commission came down as also to regulate the collection of the subsequent duties secure the payment and instruct the officers and this was about the latter end of april  if the disorders these gentlemen found the customhouse in the confusion of method and remisness of practice was material to note in a history it would take up a large discourse here and make the necessity of a new modelling the custom house more distinctly appear  these gentlemen though it was impossible to build any thing upon the method they found things in yet by their diligence and application brought them to a little of a form and prepared them the better for the regulations which were to follow  these were the following persons mr lionel norman since one of the commissioners from the customhouse  at berwick mr jessop boughton since secretary of the customs from the customhouse  at london mr john colquit since collector at leith  from chester mr john sewell  from carslisle mr warwick arthur  from burlington   the first clamor i meet with against these proceedings was the filling all the commissions up with english men and strangers and i mention it not that it was a real ground of complaint their number being not one fifth part of the whole as appears by their establishment but to remark how readily every thing was laid hold upon to reproach the union as being either originally designed for or consequentially improved to the particular advantage of the english separately considered  now although the small number of english employed in the customs were a sufficient answer to the objections and a full justification of the english government in that case yet it is a more clear defense when it is considered that it was impossible to introduce the new method of collection the rules of their keeping their several offices and their accounts which were all now to be done after the english manner without the assistance of officers from england who had been bred up to the same business and were absolutely masters of the methods practiced in england of which by it self  but to return to the question i mean the necessity of a separate collection of the customs and excise in scotland it will further appear in reflecting on the proceedings of the officers in the prosecution of their new methods  for first the people finding the duties on french goods so extravagantly high that the stealing the customs was more worth their while than usual sell upon that practice with so much eagerness that it was not in the power of the customhouse officers at first to suppress it at several places they practiced it so openly and with such assurance that when the officers had made their seizures they were driven from them by the rabbles and the goods attempted to be taken from them by force and a fleet arriving from holland about the months of august or september after the union it was thought that several thousand small casks of brandy were conveyed secretly on shore which it was impossible to prevent but of this i shall be more particular by and by  it was time therefore to take new methods and the commissioners applying themselves to the government in this matter soldiers were appointed to defend the collectors as occasion should offer and the persons who had resisted as above were seized and ordered to be prosecuted i might give a long history here of the frauds and violences put upon the government in the matters of the customs by which whole ships loadings of goods were attempted to be put on shore without paying the custom but this is enough to make it plain what occasion there was of a strict and exact management in this affair and consequently of a separate commission  the business of the customs also in scotland had been under a management quite different from that in england the commissioners sound the trade small the officers few and discouraged their salaries small and the extent of the ports vastly large so that of that small business there was in the nation much of it was carried on by the clandestine management of the merchant and though the farmers or tacksmen did their utmost with the officers they had yet it was impossible to prevent the running great quantities of goods  if this was a general practice before much more was it so now when the sweetness of it was tasted by the merchants after the union when the duty of wine and brandy was about five times to eight times as much as it was before this added to the inconveniences the customhouse at first labored under made it impossible to put a stop to the irregular practice of the merchants the firths of forth and clyde are known to be very large and the whole kingdom full of creiks coves harbors and bays that unless a little army of officers had been maintained it was not possible they could easily check the running goods on shore where there was so great a temptation and opportunity  but in order to rectify this as much as possible riding officers were appointed to survey the coast these were useful to observe the officers that they did their duty and withal to inform the commissioners of what happened to regulate the ports and direct the fixing officers in proper places  these consisted of four general riding surveyors who dividing the whole kingdom in proper districts had twelve riding officers under them three to each surveyor these were subject to the orders and inspection of the first four and all subject to the general orders of the commissioners themselves as they found occasion nor did the commissioners themselves stick as they found the service required it to take a personal inspection into the business of the customs at their first planting frequently making long journeys themselves to visit the coast and rectify such abuses as they found requisite which though not usual they made no difficulty to do at the first settlement of this nice branch of the revenue  several cruising vessels also and small boats were built for the customhouse officers were entirely without them before by which they were able to visit and search ships as they appeared at any time in the sea off of the ports or in all the creiks and rivers as there was occasion  for want of which it was frequently practiced for ships to appear at a distance make signals for their confederates who came off in boats and so delivered the goods they designed to run before they came into port these boats particularly in the firth of forth having the whole firth to range in had their appointed signals also on the shores whereby they never failed to have notice if the officers appeared and could shift from port to port or from one side of the firth to the other till they had a clear port to land in and the customhouse officers might have the satisfaction to stand on the shore and look on but having no vessel or boat to go off in could not prevent the fraud  but this was entirely prevented by the vigilance of the commissioners who placed their cruising vessels in proper stations on the sea and their several smaller boats in the rivers creiks and ports and these concurred together with the riding officers and surveyors on shore who in their constant circuits answered exactly by land what the said vessels did on the sea  by the exactness of this method the affair of the customs presently came into form and things looked with a new face in trade to the satisfaction of fair traders and the better collecting and securing the duties  and for the better explaining the particular management of the customs in scotland as to this point and giving a proof of what i have noted as above i have added a brief scheme of the several stations of the said cruisers by sea their appointed business and original coasts together with the stations of the riding officers on shore which will be found appendix part    no r x x s x x and to which the reader is referred a scheme also of the difference of several duties before and after the union from which the encouragement for these disorders were drawn these you will find appendix part    no t x x v x x x x x  i have been the longer on this as well to give the true reasons why it was absolutely necessary to place english officers in scotland in order to regulate the collection as why it was absolutely necessary to have a distinct commission in scotland and this will always hold to be a reason for such a method it being impracticable that all the variety of cases which shall happen there should be determined by the board at london or left to the arbitrary decision of single collectors and this was one reason among others why the parliament found it necessary to have a court of exchequer established in scotland in which all the seizures confiscations and pleas between the merchant and the customhouse officers should be determined since it would have been an insupportable grievance both to the queen as well as to the subject to the first to have had such pleas be determined in the ordinary methods of the law and to the second to have been obliged to defend themselves in england whither witnesses must have been sent and the defendants have been bound to have appeared upon every trifling occasion of which by it self  as the customs were thus necessarily put under a separate collection so was the excise  that branch of the revenue was not without its difficulties and as there would be every day niceties and difficulties arising which no government could foresee so it would have been too great a neglect of scotland to have put the determination of that whole branch of the revenue into the hands of single collectors  again the disputes in the excise in england being referred wholly to the justices of the peace and at the first settling this duty there being no justices of the peace settled in scotland it would too much have exposed the subject to have left them to the arbitrary decision of inferior collectors and too much have exposed the government to have left the queen without a due power to have secured the revenue  but there was yet other reasons which made the establishing separate commissions in scotland for the revenue as above to be absolutely necessary and this was the eighteenth and nineteenth articles of the union which appointed the laws of scotland to remain in force as they were  one consequence of this article was that all the pleas of the crown as well as all matters of private right became cognoscable only in scotland and to be judged by what was before or was now to be deemed the law of scotland  hence it appeared absolutely necessary to have two new courts erected in scotland that is to say new in method though not in name viz a court of admiralty and a court of exchequer the first to determine maritime disputes the other such as related to the receipt of the revenue as seizures forfeitures penalties crown lands leases grants patents etc and whatever demands the sovereign had upon the subjects  it was expressly stipulated in the twenty fourth article of the union that a seal in scotland after the union be always kept and made use of in all things relating to private rights or grants which have usually passed the great seal of scotland and which only concern offices grants commissions and private rights within that kingdom and that until such seal shall be appointed by her majesty the present great seal of scotland shall be used for such purposes and that the privy seal signet casset signet of the justiciary court quarterseal and seals of courts now used in scotland be continued  by this clause all grants patents commissions etc were necessarily to be past in scotland  by this clause also it became necessary that there should be a distinct keeper of the seal and a distinct keeper of the signet in scotland though there was but one lord chancellor  again by the eighteenth article it was expressly stipulated that the laws concerning regulation of trade customs and such excises to which scotland is by virtue of this treaty to be liable be the same in scotland from and after the union as in england and that all other laws in use within the kingdom of scotland do after the union and notwithstanding thereof remain in the same force as before except such as are contrary to or inconsistent with the terms of this treaty but alterable by the parliament of great britain with this difference betwixt the laws concerning public right policy and civil government and those which concern private right that the laws which concern public right policy and civil government may be made the same throughout the whole united kingdom but that no alteration be made in laws which concern private rights except for evident vtility of the subjects within scotland  this drove the treaters to the absolute necessity of forming all those particulars of the nineteenth article which are but the explanation of the eighteenth that the court of session or college of justice do after the union and notwithstanding thereof remain in all time coming within scotland as it is now constituted by the laws of that kingdom and with the same authority and privileges as before the union  this settled the laws of private right then the court of admiralty comes as a consequence of the second clause as follows and that all admiralty jurisdictions be under the lord high admiral or commissioners for the admiralty of great britain for the time being and that the court of admiralty now established in scotland be continued and that all reviews reductions or suspensions of the sentences in maritime cases competent to the jurisdiction of that court remain in the same manner after the union as now in scotland until the parliament of great britain shall make such regulations and alterations as shall be judged expedient for the whole united kingdom so as there be always continued in scotland a court of admiralty such as is in england for determination of all maritime cases relating to private rights in scotland competent to the jurisdiction of the admiralty court subject nevertheless to such regulations and alterations as shall be thought proper to be made by the parliament of great britain and that the heretable rights of admiralty and viceadmiralties in scotland be reserved to the respective proprietors as rights of property subject nevertheless as to the manner of exercising such heretable rights  that all pleas of right whether in private right or pleas of the crown were cognisable only in scotland is proved by the same article in the following words and that no causes in scotland be cognoscable by the courts of chancery queensbench common pleas or any other court in westminster hall and that the said courts or any other of the like nature after the union shall have no power to cognosce review or alter the acts or sentences of the judicatures within scotland or to stop the execution of the same  the exchequer as a further consequence follows next in these words and that there be a court of exchequer in scotland after the union for deciding questions concerning the revenues of customs and excises there having the same power and authority in such cases as the court of exchequer has in england and that the said court of exchequer in scotland have power of passing signatures gifts tutories and in other things as the court of exchequer at present in scotland has and that the court of exchequer that now is in scotland do remain until a new court of exchequer be settled by the parliament of great britain in scotland after the union  by these particular establishments may be seen not only the manner of the public management in scotland but the reason of it and from whence it became necessary to have the court of exchequer the commissions and the separate collection of the public revenue settled in scotland all flowing from this main original stated in the treaty viz that all causes between the queen and the subject are only cognisable in scotland  according to this foundation the collections for the customs and excises were settled in scotland in distinct commissions as has been said and though at first the difficulties in the said collections appeared great and some uneasiness on every side began to rise yet as they principally lay on the backwardness of the subject to come under a strict survey as to the duties time wore off these things and the people became more sensible of the necessity of the exact collection in order to bring trade to an equality  at the beginning the people thought every seizure of prohibited goods a violence upon their properties and clamoured at the english and the union as if the union had been made not to bring them under good government but to leave them without government upon this notion they fell to running of brandy in particular at that prodigious rate that some thousands of small casks of brandy was in spite of all the vigilance of officers secretly supposed to be put on shore out of the first dutch fleet that came to scotland after the union and when the officers made seizure of several parcels the rabbles by violence rescued them again as is already noted above  but this practice was easily suppressed for not the government only but all the fair merchants were concerned in it since the running of goods on shore without paying custom is a known prejudice to the merchant who entering his goods fairly and paying large customs is by these people undersold and the market forestald these things therefore began to meet with less encouragement and having no countenance but from the mere rabble the frequent losses they met with by the activity of the officers of the customs by little and little discouraged the adventurers and trade began to run in it is proper channel  the difficulties of the excise were of another kind of which by themselves and though the rules of the collecting the excise and the methods of charging the subject were very exact and regular yet they were not without great obstructions in their work as has been noted the first by reason of a misunderstanding of the sense of the article in the union settling the duty of excise which having expressed the several measures not very exactly admitted a double construction as to the quantity what was to be esteemed the english barrel the commissioners had charged it one way and the brewers demanded it another as follows  the act expresses it thus vii that all the parts of the united kingdom be for ever and after the union liable to the same excises upon all exciseable liquors excepting only that the thirty four gallons english to the barrel of beer or ale amounting to twelve gallons scots present measure sold in scotland by the brewer at nine shilling six pence sterling excluding all duties and retailed including duties on the retailers profit at two pence the scots pint or eight part of the scots gallon be not after the union liable on account of the present excise upon exciseable liquors in england to any higher imposition than two shillings sterling upon the foresaid thirty four gallons english measure being twelve gallons the present scots measure and that the excise settled in england on all other liquors when the union commences take place throughout the whole united kingdom  when the excise office came to charge the brewer upon this cause they could reckon it no otherwise than as in england by the gauge of thirty four gallons english to the barrel and thus the brewer stood charged for some time  but the brewers objected and sticking to the letter of the article demanded to pay but   sh for    scots gallons whether it overrun the english    gallons or no  this occasioned some small debate but the prudence of the commissioners prevented the clamor some people would willingly have raised upon it and the justices of peace directing     in each thirty four gallons to be allowed the brewer for the present left it undetermined till the parliament should settle it and thus the brewers were made easy it is to be observed to the honor of the persons employed in the first settlement of the excise in scotland that considering the ignorance of the most part of their officers in the art of gauging and in the new methods of taking the worts and making a charge considering the difficulty of satisfying and convincing the people who were to pay the duty that they had no wrong done them they themselves being unable to examine the gaugers accounts no duty was ever settled with so little noise or with so few complaints not one person that ever i could hear of having any appeal from the commissioners sentences or making any complaint of injustice done them but the collection went on easy was collected quietly paid cheerfully and visibly improved the revenue though nothing was paid by the brewer more than they paid before  nor had it been possible to collect this duty legally if it had not been so for the commissioners of the excise labored under another difficulty which none of the other branches of the revenue were troubled with viz that the laws of collection being by the union to be the same as in england and the justices of the peace being by the act of parliament    carol ii in england made judges between the queen and the subject in cases of dispute from the beginning of the union till about august   0  which was    months they were without the assistance of justices to determine those disputes  there was indeed a nomination of justices by the privy council of scotland    august   0  as will appear in its place and for some few months they did meet and act but this was a new settlement and the centlemen named were yet young in their business little help could be had from them and which was still worse before they had time to inform themselves their power died by the act of paliament in england dissolving the privy council in scotland this act past in the beginning of the first british parliament and by the ceasing of that power from whence those justices derived the power of the justices also ceased and they were now to receive new commissions from the lord chancellor of britain as the justices in england also did  this was not finished till august   0  so that in all that time the commissioners of the excise had no legal authority before whom they could convict any offender or punish any breach of the law or by whom any case could be determined  yet their business went on and no complaint was heard against their management no appeal made against them no difficulties but what they worked through to the general satisfaction  the excise as well as customs in scotland had been farmed out or let in tack as they call it the tacksmen or farmers did their best  for their own interest but several circumstances rendered their method of collecting the excise unfit to be imitated such as their officers who were entirely ignorant of the art of gauging aking the lengths of the worts by guess and proving quantities chiefly by the oaths of the brewers and the like which joined with some other practices i care not to mention exposed both the collectors and the brewers to several inconveniences and in general made the charge on the brewer many ways unequal  a thing prejudicial not to the duty only but to the fair dealer particularly who always suffers by the frauds and connivances of others  on this account when the first of may came and the union taking place the new duty was to begin the government found themselves necessitated to send down a great many officers into scotland if possible to put things into some order and prepare the people for the new method of collection  what treatment these officers received in scotland how ill the people there used them and how little they were able to do will best appear by this that the government found themselves obliged by proclamation to let the duty go on for some time in the same methods and collected by the same officers till the new methods could be prepared  nor was this all for though the new commission was formed as soon as possible for the commissioners began to act on the   th of june yet they had the whole kingdom to regulate as to the collection all their officers to instruct both as to method and to act the first relating to the accounts and the last as to gauging not an officer in the whole kingdom understanding the use of the gauging rod as is noted already nor the people knowing the meaning of it  this makes the difficulty of settling the excise in scotland appear and indeed who ever considers the manner of collection before the union as before will wonder how it was possible ever to bring the business into any order for the people being most intolerably averse at first to the new regulations raised innumerable clamours at the officers that came from england as imposing novelties on them and confounding their business  and here as well as in the customs the clamor against englishmen being employed was laid hold of but the conduct of the commissioners here likewise effectually answered that pretense for no sooner had the officers sent by the commissioners in england as above done the work they came about viz in directing and instructing the officers in scotland but the greatest part of them were sent back again and so few englishmen remained in the excise that it is not worth naming  the names of the commissioners as settled after some few alterations were as follows alexander wetherburn esquire john montgomery esquire john whittham esquire david ross esquire alexander forbes esquire   nor was the duty of excise as a revenue without its discouragements as well as the customs the article of private rights reserved by the union had of course brought several exemptions upon them some of which have proved very considerable hindrances to the duty  the commissioners however disputed with some of those people who claimed exemptions of duty and the debate on those heads lay undetermined before the barons of exchequer at the writing these sheets  under all these discouragements yet the collection went on and the brewers soon became satisfied with the manner of charging the excise viz by gauging as the most equal indifferent and undeniably certain and as a method no man could be wronged by  which giving them all an equality with one another was very much the advantage of the fair traders  who always suffer by the frauds of clandestine dealing  nay this was evident by the brewers themselves who differing with the city of edinburghs assessors about the taxes paid to the city endeavored to have the city officers charge them by the gauging rod as in the excise but could not obtain it  i have insisted upon the difficulties of settling these things to show the world the absolute necessity of placing the collection of the revenue in scotland distinct from that in england and also as a thing needful to show by what steps the several offices arrived to that order and exactness which they now appeared to be managed in  i come now to the affair of the equivalent  the calculations and proportions between the nations being the ground from whence it became payable to scotland i have gone through already as distinctly as i can in the several observations on the minutes of the treaty first at london and after in the parliament of scotland we are now come to the payment of it  the parliament had determined both how it should be disposed of and who should dispose it viz that the queen should name commissioners to receive and issue out the said money according to the terms of the union this you have expressly in the fifteenth article of the union as concluded at london as follows and it is agreed that her majesty be empowered to appoint commissioners who shall be accountable to the parliament of great britain for disposing the said sum of three hundred ninety eight thousand eighty five pounds ten shillings and all other moneys which shall arise to scotland upon the agreements aforesaid to the purposes beforementioned which commissioners shall be empowered to call for receive and dispose of the said moneys in manner aforesaid and to inspect the books of the several collectors of the said revenues and of all other duties from whence an equivalent may arise and that the collectors and managers of the said revenues and duties be obliged to give to the said commissioners subscribed authentic abbreviates of the produce of such revenues and duties arising in their respective districts and that the said commissioners shall have their office within the limits of scotland and shall in such office keep books containing accounts of the amount of the equivalents and how the same shall have been disposed of from time to time which may be inspected by any of the subjects who shall desire the samen  the queen pursuant to this power appointed commissioners for the management of the equivalent and the money being raised by parliament lay ready in the bank of england  the commissioners named by the queen were twenty five in number as follows commissioners of the equivalent sir andrew hume mr william dalrymple of glenmuir sir robert sinclair of stevenson sir thomas burnet of leyes sir john areskin of alva sir john swintoun of that ilk sir james campbell of aberuchil sir james smollet of bonhil sir patrick johnstoun mr john hadden of glenagis mr john bruce of kinross mr william seton younger of pitmedden mr john clark younger of penniecook alexander abercrombie of glassoch mungo grahame of gorthie mr john pringle of haining daniel campbell sir john cope jacob reynardson john bridges merchants in london james houblon these did not accept the business at the first sir francis grant baillie of jerviswood grahame of dowgalstoun douglass of kelhead    the four merchants of london were named because as members of the bank of england they were required to be present upon the spot in order to support the credit of the bank in case any body had scrupled their bills and indeed there was occasion sufficient for their being there as will appear presently  it was now the beginning of july and the money was not yet come away from london it would be endless to record here the scandalous reflections spread about of the delay of payment and how the english having secured the main point would pay the money when they pleased or perhaps never and some ran it up to that height as to say that the english designed to cheat them of the money  again another sort of people pretended the union was broke because the money was not paid by the first of may and there was a discourse of some gentlemen who came up to the cross of edinburgh and protested in the name of the whole scots nation that the conditions of the treaty being not complied with and the terms performed the whole was void and scotland was again free when ever an occasion offered to lay hold of that freedom  that some people were so weak to talk thus and that a certain gentleman was foolish enough to make such a formal protestation i have some reason to believe but that d  h  was the man i profess not to know and believe that noble person to understand the nature of the treaty and the nature of protesting also better than so  be it as it will such protestation was of no use neither could it have any signification being made purely without ground the treaty having no where tied up the government of england to have the money actually in scotland by such a day  nor was england by the treaty under any obligation to a day of payment but two things prescribed the payment and a third clears it all most effectually    that by the custom of england any payment contracted for sine die becomes a debt demander or payable at demand and so the day being not prefixed in the articles the money became presently due viz the first of may but under no forfeiture on delay of days much less a dissolution of articles    but if this nicety had been insisted on then it is answered that the money was actually paid by england being delivered by the treasury to a certain number of the commissioners appointed for receiving the equivalent and this either upon or before the first of may and though it was not actually come down into scotland yet if it was delivered in london to the proper persons appointed to receive it the government of england was fairly acquitted of the payment  and this is to be seen by the said commissioners receipt in the exchequer in england when the money was paid    but a third clause showed all this to be an insignificant and a most ignorant pretense for the equivalent was actually paid and made good to scotland before the treaty was concluded and it was expressly stipulated so to be ordered in the fifteenth article in these words it is agreed that scotland shall have an equivalent for what the subjects thereof shall be so charged toward payment of the said debts of england in all particulars whatsoever in manner following viz that before the union of the said kingdoms the sum of three hundred ninety eight thousand and eighty five pound ten shillings be granted to her majesty by the parliament of england for the uses aftermentioned being the equivalent to be answered to scotland for such parts of the said customs and excises upon all exciseable liquors with which that kingdom is to be charged upon the union as will be applicable to the payment of the said debts of england according to the proportions which the present customs in scotland being thirty thousand pounds per annum do bear to the customs in england computed at one million three hundred forty one thousand five hundred and fifty nine pounds per annum and which the present excises on exciseable liquors in scotland being thirty three thousand and five hundred pounds per annum do bear to the excises on exciseable liquors in england computed at nine hundred forty seven thousand six hundred and two pounds per annum which sum of three hundred ninety eight thousand eighty five pounds ten shillings shall be due and payable from the time of the union  it is evident from this article that the security demanded by scotland for the payment of this money was that the parliament of england should raise the sum agreed and should grant it to her majesty for the uses in that fifteenth article expressed that is in short that the parliament should grant to her majesty such a sum of money and appropriate it to the payment of the equivalent  this really was payment and was so accepted and the money being granted to the queen was nothing but as a deposite in a third hand till the ratification of the treaty should pass in scotland and be confirmed in england or till the union should take place when and as soon as that was done the money was actually the right the proper goods of the scots and the government of england could not have kept it back no though the treaty had been afterward dissolved or broken so that the objection against the payment of the equivalent in time dies and falls to the ground in this that it was actually paid by england before the union began and placed in such hands as a trust to be at the demand of the scots as soon as the union took place due and payable from the time of the union are the words of the article  as soon therefore as the union took place the treasury of england became debtor to scotland for such a sum of money  but the parliament of england with whom the treaty was made were discharged of the payment as soon as ever the act of appropriation was past in the house  this i think is clear and admits of no dispute but it shows the weakness of those people that promised themselves any thing from the delay of the money coming into scotland  nor did their error cease here for when the money came they were not at all better pleased but raised new clamours at the union  and really went to that height in their reproaches that it seemed as if they had yet latent expectations of raising a new tumult  it was indeed something remarkable here and not a few people took notice of it that the very same people who just before exclaimed at the english for not paying the money and cried out they were cheated and the union broken were the same  who when the money came made as much noise on the other hand of being bought and sold and that money being the price of their country  the violence of this temper appearing so openly i can not be counted partial in giving a true account of it since i could not be faithful to the matters of fact if i omitted it  on the day of august the money came to edinburgh in twelve wagons guarded by a party of scots dragoons and was carried directly to the castle if i omit to enter into the detail of the reproaches and railings at the poor innocent people that brought it nay at the very horses that drew the carriages it is because it was a folly below reproof and rather deserves pity  if i omit naming a known person in no concealed station who was for having the dragoons that guarded it hanged for bringing it in  and being asked what he would have the poor men do with it answered they should have cut all them that brought it to pieces and kept the money from coming into the country if i omit naming this gentleman it is in respect to his character and in hopes he may live to be wiser and to acknowledge his inconsiderate rashness  the wagons as is noted were driven directly to the castle and the money lodged there to be issued in its course  the people set on by proper engines showed their dissatisfaction at first by rudely stoning the poor carters and drivers and two or three were very much hurt by stones as they came back with their horses from the castle  but this was but the remains of the tumultuous temper we have been taking notice of before and the poor ignorant people acting only from outward appearances without consideration  grew calm again of course  nor among the most malecontent persons could i ever find any that when the money upon the african stock came to be paid would think the species unhallowed enough to refuse their share of it  as soon as the money was arrived the commissioners for the equivalent began to sit and immediately applied themselves to the distribution of it according to the terms of the treaty  and having set a parta due proportion for the expense of the coinage they went immediately to work with the african stock and began to pay off  yet i must not omit a difficulty here that had almost put the affair to a full stop for a while  and this was from the species of the money they had brought the case was as follows  the bank of england had that year upon an advance of a sum of money to the government received   00000 libs or there abouts in exchequer bills  which being made current by the credit both of the government in public and after by the bank in particular they presumed would pass in payment as common paper credit usually did in london without interest being always payable at demand by the bank in london this they expected should go down without any difficulty in scotland  but the bank seemed under some mistake as to the extent of their reputation or at least as to the circumstances of scotland when they proposed the putting off these exchequer bills there  however they ventured and sending only  00000 lib in ready money in the wagons mentioned before the other    0   lib  0 shillings  was sent down in this paper credit or exchequer bills  this raised a new clamor in scotland and abundance of people run away with it that the english tricked them that they had sent them paper in stead of money that the great argument formerly used to persuade scotland to the union to take upon them a share of the burden of the english debts and to accept of an equivalent was the great advantage that should accrue to scotland by the circulating of so much ready money in the nation  and that now they were to be put off with bills payable  00 miles off and which if lostor mislaid or by accident burnt were irrecoverable  the truth is the bank of england took a wrong step here  for first they ventured upon scotland with their bills in stead of money without consulting either the temper or the circumstances of scotland at that time  had they corresponded with the bank of scotland and obtained of the said bank to circulate their bills either by their own credit or cash had they established any running cash in scotland for the circulation where they should have been received and issued on occasion they had come off better  or had the bills had running interest upon them that those people who laid them up might have had an increase upon them as they lay by there had been some reason to expect they might have past  but the bank had engrossed the interest paid on the bills by the government and then sent them naked into the world to run purely on the credit of their fund without any interest running upon them this and considering scotland a place not yet of a great in land commerce in which alone such bills are capable of being made current made it very improbable that their bills should pass in scotland this mistake the commissioners themselves saw as soon as they came to scotland  and therefore immediately sent away to england for  0000 lib sterling more in gold  nor had this been able to have carried them through the payment had not the commissioners very prudently taken all the exchequer bills that any one brought them and given bills of exchange for them payable in london   when the commissioners found how it was  they saw no remedy but to declare that though they had brought exchequer bills down in order to supply the deficiency of bullion which was then scarce enough in england yet that no body should be obliged to take them without their consent nor should any body be refused payment as they came in their order and as a certain great person began with them as some thought by way of experiment and having a demand for   or  000 lib upon the african stock refused to take any of the said bills the commissioners immediately ordered it all to be paid in specie  this and a constant currency of payment began to raise them some reputation and some who were friends to the government and saw the exigence of the present case accepted of exchequer bills for large sums others would take half money half bills  and others that came for their money before their turn came yet had it offered them if they would take bills still preserving this point sacred that no body was refused his payment in course in money if he insisted on it thus with a great deal of difficulty at last they worked through the payment of the african stock  the bills went all away to england so directly that in six months time there was not one to be seen  so the main end of the bank viz the circulation of these bills in trade as a paper credit was quite lost which had the interest been running upon them would have been easy and readily complied with  however it was at last contrary to expectation concluded and the whole african stock being paid off that company dissolved and died  the next affair was the settlement of justice in scotland  and this suffering some alteration it is needful to give a true account of it according to my title  it had been stipulated by the eighteenth and nineteenth articles that all other laws in use within the kingdom of scotland do after the union and notwithstanding thereof remain in the same force as before except such as are contrary to or inconsistent with the terms of this treaty but alterable by the parliament of great britain with this difference betwixt the laws concerning public right policy and civil government and those which concern private right that the laws which concern public right policy and civil government may be made the same throughout the whole united kingdom but that no alteration be made in laws which concern private right except for evident vtility of the subjects within scotland  that the court of session or college of justice do after the union and notwithstanding thereof remain in all time coming within scotland as it is now constituted by the laws of that kingdom and with the same authority and privileges as before the union subject nevertheless to such regulations for the better administration of justice as shall be made by the parliament of great britain and that the court of justiciary do also after the union and notwithstanding thereof remain in all time coming within scotland as it is now constituted by the laws of that kingdom and with the same authority and privileges as before the union subject nevertheless to such regulations as shall be made by the parliament of great britain and without prejudice of other rights of justiciary  these clauses preserved the ordinary process of law in case of private right in the same course and condition as before but all pleas of the crown matters of dispute between the queen and the subject relating to the revenue and trade being to be the same as in england for that reason there were necessary alterations to be made in the methods and even new models of proceedings to be formed special to scotland  and first of the civil peace  the several branches of the revenue depending much upon the execution of petty justice and particularly the excise in which the justices of peace are in most cases the judges between the brewer and the collector in this case it was necessary to renew the model formerly used and taken from england viz of justices constables headboroughs etc and this not only for the deciding differences in the duties but in forcible entries executing warrants apprehending offenders and the like in which cases constables and other officers are necessary both to preserve the peace to assist in searching houses and in executing the respective warrants of the said justices of the peace  this i say made it absolutely necessary to establish the same method of civil justice in scotland as in england viz by justices of the peace constables etc which at that time was not in use in the whole country  it had indeed been formerly attempted in scotland and there were some acts of parliament then in force for the making justices of the peace in scotland as in england particularly the    th act of the first parl carol   anno      and again by the    th act of the same parliament  and these acts are recited again in the proclamation for erecting new justices at this time which proclamation leaving out the names of the persons as useless and tedious i have annexed in the appendix no f    upon the revolution this method of governing by justices however useful in its kind yet as having been negligently or arbitrarily made use of in the former times was laid aside and the government of scotland lay as it had usually done too much in the absolute disposition of the heretable magistrates such as sheriffs of counties steuarts of stewartries and such right as the superiorities and usages of places gave to the lairds a constitution not at all calculated for the liberty of scotland or the increase of the happiness of the people  upon the settling the customs and excise as above it became i say necessary to restore the former model of petty justice as per the proclamation before named was done at this time and accordingly justices of the peace and constables were erected all over scotland  but this received another interruption as a consequence of the union which put a stop to all the civil administration for a time as follows  by the nineteenth article of the union the affair of the privy council in scotland was left thus and that after the union the queens majesty and her royal successors may continue a privy council in scotland for preserving of public peace and order until the parliament of great britain shall think fit to alter it or establish any other effectual method for that end  as soon as the parliament of great britain met and began to enquire into the matter they found the very nature of a privy council in scotland but especially the manner of their privy councils so inconsistent with the treaty of union and above all with the liberty of the subject that they effectually dissolved it and voted that there should be but one privy council in britain  i know this act was opposed by several sorts of people  and complaint was made after its dissolution that scotland was left without any form of government some others complained from another principle of which i need say nothing here  the ministers of state also opposed it a little but no further than as they thought things were not ripe in scotland for so sudden a dissolution of the face of power among them and therefore would have had it continued for some certain limited time only and that with such limitations of authority as might be regulated by parliament  but it was thought both burdensome and dangerous and indeed the council in scotland acting arbitrarily had given the lovers of liberty such an aversion to them that they could not hear of it and so after some struggle the council was dissolved by act of parliament  this is mentioned here because of the interruption given by the accident of this dissolution to the course of petty justice as aforesaid for now all the commissions of the peace ceased being granted by the said privy council and by the new establishment of the council which was now to be called the council of great britain and which was to have the same powers and no other which the council of england had before the commissions of the peace could no more be given by the council but by the lord chancellor the commissions therefore terminated and the new method of administration met with an interruption of several months but was restored again by a general commission of the peace under the great seal of britain nominating justices of the peace through all scotland conform to the method of england this commission bears date the    day of may anno   0  and on this foot the whole island now stands in one form of administration as to petty justice and therefore this act is called an act for rendering the union more complete which act for the more particular understanding this affair i have added in the appendix no h   but here it is to be observed that though this act gives power to all the justices of the peace in scotland to do use and exercise over all persons within their several bounds whatever does appertain to the office and trust of a justice of peace by virtue of the laws in england before the union in relation to or for the preservation of the public peace yet it is provided that in all the sessions of the peace they are prescribed to the methods of trial and judgment according to the laws of scotland  this i note here because some would have suggested that this erecting of courts of petty justice for such the several sessions of the justices properly are in scotland and giving them authorities from the laws and usage of england was an invasion of the nineteenth article of the union  but it was clear otherwise for though in the public peace their methods were the same as in england yet it is observable   that very clause was enacted in scotland in the several acts of parliament of      recited in the commission and never rescinded in scotland and by the union those acts are of course confirmed not being any way inconsistent with or contradicting the treaty   had it not been so the thing it self had been no way injurious to the treaty of union the methods of trial judgment and execution being as above prescribed by the laws of scotland and to continue in the same form as before   and this will more particularly appear in reading the very nature and form of the commissions of the peace granted by the queen to the respective counties or shires in scotland one of which viz for the shire of edinburgh for the more especial understanding this matter i have annexed in the appendix part ii numb g    i might have entered here upon the differences of proceedings in the several new established courts of justice as of the exchequer and admiralty and the general and petty sessions of the justices  but these things seem not the proper subject of a history so i wave them here the latter part also being very well performed to my hand i mean relating to the proceedings and office of a justice of the peace in scotland by the ingenious hand of mr william forbes advocate in scotland to which i refer the reader  there was an alteration in matters of justiciary as it is called in scotland  that is of criminal process for whereas this was wholly left to a certain court consisting of five judges who were therefore called the lords of the justiciary and that their court was holden only at edinburgh it was considered that this was too great an interruption of justice and often times occasioned the neglect of prosecution as well as made that prosecution both difficult and chargeable to the subject by which means thefts violences and sometimes murders escaped due punishment the parliament determined by the same act of parliament as before that the lords of the justiciary should divide the kingdom into circuits and that these circuits should be twice a year  that thus justice might as in england be carried home to every mans door and all the former inconveniences might be for the future avoided  the manner methods and other circumstances such as time place etc since they were nothing at all altered the act of parliament referring wholly to a former law made in the   d session of the   d parliament of king charles ii came not under the head of alterations which i am now upon and consequently need not be inserted  i might bring the alterations of elections of members for parliament into this head as well of the lords as commons but it requires nothing but to repeat the very articles of the union again and i think it is so expressly set down there that it needs no comment at all being nothing but mere matter of form but as there required some addition to the manner of the returning of writs and of the managing elections you will find them in the same act of parliament last quoted and printed in the appendix as above  all that matter being fully determined in this act   the matter of the exchequer court now erected needs no other description than this that it is erected in the same form and proceeds by the same method as in england having barons a remembrancer treasurer and all the respective clerks and offices as in england  the first barons were as follows the earl of seafield formerly lord chancellor of scotland lord chief baron mr baron clark mr baron maitland mr baron smith mr baron scroop   the admiralty court in scotland remained and the earl of weemyss who was before lord admiral in scotland was now made vice admiral by commission under the prince of denmark lord high admiral of britain and was at the same time nominated a member of the princes council in england  the inferior courts of judicature in the admiralty remained as before suffering no alteration in form save that what related to the public revenue or the claims of the sovereign began to be modelled as in england agreeable to the   th and   th articles of the union  thus the law in scotland remained entire the process in common causes being the same and the alterations being consined as per the treaty to the established methods of scotland  i come now to the coin and though this has been a thing of great consequence yet it requires little more to be said to it than just that it suffered a general revolution and that all the former coyns of scotland as well as the foreign species of money which went current in scotland the english money excepted was called in and recoyned the english money being only to pass current  but there was a difficulty which i have noted in the minutes gave them some trouble viz that the english money which went for one penny in every shilling advance should be reduced to a par that the loss should be made good by the government and yet the english not bring in great quantities to scotland to be offered to the mint at one penny per shilling and immediately received again with an allowance of the difference to prevent this that contrivance was found out to bring in all the english money at one certain day and receive it out again with an allowance for the difference  this occasioned the proclamation for the alteration that all the money should be paid in on a short day and immediately returned with notes for the difference this proclamation as it expresses the whole scheme i have added in the appendix no i which though it be a long proclamation yet as it may be a precedent in like cases i have set down for general information  the several proclamations for the gradual calling in the old money are too many to note here it may suffice to hint that as the foreign money being brought in which amounted to above   0000 pounds sterling and this going into the mint the new coin began to circulate very speedily and at the writing these sheets the whole nation was full of new money  the several denominations of money before the union in scotland i mean not of old obsolete coyns but such as were now current were as follows these were all of copper the bodle or turner six of which goes to a penny the halfpenny or baubee two to a penny the irish halfpenny and french doits had passed but were cried down by act of council the silver coin was foreign such as the ducatoon of several coyns which passed at   sh   d they had passed at   sh  0 d but were raised by an act of council to   sh   d which caused great quantities to be brought in the dollar  of several coyns went formerly at   sh   d were raised up to   sh  0 d each  and four sorts viz the bank dollar the wild horse the castle and the wild man dollars were by the same act of council raised to crowns the french crown had formerly passed for    d but was also raised to    the french quarter pieces which passed for   d each english coin broad gold of england generally passed jacobus at    sh  and carolus at    sh the guinea gold passed at the revolution at    sh each but were raised without any public authority or rule only by the circumstances of trade to    sh   d  this was the reason why when the coin was called in and the price of this reduced the government made no allowance on the gold the english silver coin passed by act of council at one penny per shilling advance domestic coin old crowns of king jamess and queen marys  which passed for crowns but very few of them were to be seen old mark pieces called old fourteens new mark pieces called also fourteens the last coined in cha i and cha ii time with doubles of the last called two marks after raised to half dollars and four marks raised also in proportion  with half pieces at   d and quarters at   d new milled money of king williams coin of several values as crowns and half crowns forty pence twenty pence ten pence and five pence pieces there was at this time no scots gold coin current or to be seen except a few preserved for antiquity     there were several species of scots money that had been current and of which several remainders were to be found  but the quantities were so small that i do not place them among the current coin  it is enough to say that all sorts were called in by the treaty and no money made current by the government but the english or british coin  i need not record the days and times when and how long every particular species were permitted to pass it is enough to say the prudence of the government so ordered it that the people felt no miss or want of the current money and the thing was done so gradually that the new money was circulating before the old was called in  this was done thus  first the english money was reduced as has been observed by proclamation  then the foreign money was brought in and this being a much greater quantity than was expected the mint immediately fell to work with it  and this joined to the money brought down for the equivalent furnished above  00000 l in silver money besides what english money was in the country before so that the new money was dispersed in every corner of the nation insensibly and the old went off gradually without any interruption to business  and at the writing these sheets the last viz the scots milled money was yet passing but appointed to come into the mint by a certain day there were several proclamations for this and several days appointed i have added only one in the appendix to let the reader into the method settled for this purpose which terminated the currency of the scots money to the    th of february   0   but even that time was lengthened afterward and the scots money suffered to pass again till the latter end of september   0   and thus by degrees the english coin prevailed and is now the only current coin of the nation this proclamation is marked in the appendix no k    i cannot say so much for the new regulations of weights and measures in which though appointed by the union to be made the same little progress could be made at the writing of these accounts save that the public business of the customhouse was all settled by the weights and measures of england but custom had so inured the people to the former weights and measures especially the weights for their retailing goods and the measures for corn that it was impossible to bring the change about so soon time alone can bring it to the issue designed  nor is the reducing the measures to an uniform standart so absolutely necessary as that we should think the union defective for want of it since the measures especially that which we call dry measure as of corn and fruit is at this time various almost all over england  as particularly in the north the boll remains a received measure in northumberland and cumberland in the west as in cornwall and devonshire the bushel is almost two bushels of the common measure  even the winchester bushel which is the standart of measure in england varies and in some places it contains eight gallons in others nine gallons in some places they have one to the score thrown into the measure in other places not  again in liquid measure we have the quart of two kinds for several liquors as the wine quart and the winchester quart we have the pottle and gallon for dry measure the pint and thence up to the gallon of liquid measure in coals we have what is called the chalder at newcastle and the chalder at london and the differing chalder in several differing parts  at london the chalder is    bushels at sandwich    at lym  0 at newcastle  0 bushels so though the measures of corn and liquors should have their variations in scotland according to the old customs and usage of towns counties and manners yet this does not at all render the union incomplete since the reducing the weights and measures to an equal standart in the public accounts such as in the customs tolls excises public receipts and payments and the like is as effectual an equality as is needful and indeed is as much as was intended by the union no act of parliament law or statute that can be made being able to oblige the country people in every place to leave off their wonted calculations and denominations of things which are frequently made upon the foot of their ancient customs for example as before the valuation of lands tenor of leases the rents the entails rentcharges liferents and payments for or out of land revenue are all reckoned in scotland by the chalder boll firlot and lippy and cannot be altered even marriage settlements and entails are entered in this manner and it would run scotland into all manner of confusion to oblige them at once to leave off all the terms by which their lands are known valued mortgaged entailed charged or conveyed  i think we have thus gently touched at all the alterations of moment which were made in the laws trade custom and constitution of scotland according to my title but lest it may be thought that these alterations ly too much dispersed up and down this book in the relation of particular cases i shall endeavor to sum them up in the following abridgement  first as to the constitution though last named  i conceive it suffered some alteration though not as was alleged by some an entire dissolution  it was not dissolved because the government by king and parliament continued the same viz a limited monarchy it received no diminution but an addition of privileges and liberties and had the scots thought sit to have gone a little further and made provision for transferring their superiorities they might have at last come to an entire enjoyment of that same liberty that england is now so happy in  however though the constitution received no dissolution yet it is acknowledged that it suffered alterations in several articles of which these are the principal   that tho the monarchy is the same yet that they become incorporated into one monarchy with their neighbor kingdom subjected for ever to the same sovereign and engaged in war peace alliances and succession with them so that they can no more act in their separate capacity in any thing relating to government or constitution   they suffer alterations in their representative  and these consist in two branches first that the number of their representative is reduced to    secondly that the elections pass under a new regulation and are managed by a different method and thirdly that they sit not any more in parliament by themselves but in conjunction with the english parliament representing the several counties and corporations as members of the united kingdom of great britain   the hereditary branch of parliament i mean the peers suffer also an alteration being changed from a full appearance in parliament to a representative appearance and that representative limited to the number of sixteen   their regal administration suffers an alteration the sovereign who before executed the civil power in a separate capacity being now obliged to change the face of that administration into an united management governing now by one parliament one privy council one high admiral one chancery one treasury  and in short one general economy of government  thus the several distinct offices of admiral chancellor treasurer secretaries of state and president of privy council sunk in either kingdom and new commissions were issued  as one privy council and one president under the title of lord president of the privy council of britain lord high chancellor of britain lord high treasurer of britain lord high admiral of britain and the like and which i close all with the queen her self lays down her separate titles and is now no more queen of england scotland etc but queen of great britain and is called in missives and in foreign accounts her britannick majesty  her troops are no more english and scots but british forces  and the arms of the island are a new incorporated and quartered together  as appears at large in the foregoing sheets   this i think is the sum of the principal alterations in the constitution of scotland by the union in all which except that of the parliament the commons being reduced in number and the lords by representative i say in all the rest england suffered the same alterations as scotland such as dissolving her parliament her name as a kingdom her council great offices and title of her sovereign  and all things began de novo in both kingdoms under the single denomination of britain and british  the second head of alterations is that of the laws and this is so particularly entered into in the beginning of this very part of my work that i need be but very short   the laws of government continue as the government continues established in the claim of right i mean as to the limitations of government and obedience nor has scotland suffered any loss but rather been a manifest gainer in this point by the union the privy council tyranny being abolished who had arrived to that height in scotland as to give their acts almost of an equal authority to acts of parliament  a power wholly disclaimed by the privy council in england to whose powers and authorities the present council of britain is by parliament expressly limited and confined   the laws of private right have suffered no alteration other than as private right may be intermixed with that of the crown  but all the laws of public right such as relate to customs and excises have suffered the alterations mentioned in the union a court of exchequer being established in scotland for that purpose and this was necessary as has been noted because of the alterations necessary in the revenue and in the respective methods of ascertaining and collecting the customs excises etc due to the crown and in this clause may be included the several laws for penalties fines forfeitures and confiscations upon the particular trespasses of the laws relating to customs and excise which were wholly new    the governing laws relating to the civil peace have suffered some alteration as to what was just before the union by the erecting justices of the peace but this seems a restoring what was before rather than an alteration of what was since it was nothing but what was actually put in practice twice before and what there were laws then in being to justify their return so all the alterations that seem to be made now were first only that the justices of peace formerly had their commission from the privy council in scotland but now received it from the lord chancellor of britain  and secondly that the justices of peace had some new powers vested in them since the union which they had not before such as determining disputes in the duty of excise giving power of distress for payment warrants of forcible entries in case of concealments of customs and the like   all the rest of the laws of scotland remained the same per the union the circuits of the lords of the justiciary i take also to be no innovation at all as what had formerly been practiced  i come now to alterations of trade and these can receive but a very short description here because the greatest alterations which happened in trade could not follow the union so closs at the heels as the time of the writing these sheets require to relate it but such as were immediately the consequence of the union were such as these   a general prohibition and stop of commerce with france which till now scotland publicly carried on   a prohibition of all exports and imports as in england and by virtue of that clause a particular prohibition of the exportation of wool which was till then publicly allowed in scotland and which though people seemed at first very uneasy at yet was without doubt very much for the public advantage of scotland whose manufactures were thereby quite sunk as to exportation  this article was attended with penalties and forfeitures particular and such as were not practiced in scotland and for which the laws of excise and customs in england were introduced and the trials on which were brought on either before the justices of peace or court of exchequer as above   whereas scotland had before this prohibited all the english woollen manufactures under severe penalties and england on the other hand had excluded the scots from trading with scots ships to their colonies in america directly from scotland and had confiscated even their own english ships trading to the said colonies from england if navigated or manned with above one third scots seamen had laid tolls and heavy imposts upon cattle and linen imported into england from scotland and had prohibited the exportation of corn from england to scotland though the occasion of it might be never so great but on the same conditions and under the same restrictions as to other countries now by the union all these prohibitions restraints tolls imposts and exclusions on either hand were taken off the english growth and manufactures formerly prohibited came immediately free of all interruptions into scotland all the tolls and imposts upon scots cattle linen or other goods in england were taken off all the ports of england whether in europe or america were open to scots ships without any imposts or restraint scots sailers in english bottoms were immediately free and ships from the english colonies might sail to and unlade free in scotland without any obstruction   these i call alterations in the laws of trade besides which there were some particular alterations which relate to the drawbacks bounties and allowances on the exportation and for encouragement of the exportation of fish corn pork etc of which i need say nothing having been very particular already in the relation of the debates upon those heads in parliament  the consequences of these things upon trade are at present few but will necessarily be far greater hereafter  the first visible consequence was the rise and fall of several kinds of merchandises as the new alterations prohibitions or importations of them happened differing from what they were before  as for example wines brandy and all kinds of goods of the growth of france must of course rise in their value the further import being prohibited and this would have enriched a great many families in scotland who had quantities of these goods on their hands had not the difficulty of enforcing these prohibitions at first laid trade open to clandestine importations by which the fair trader was as in such cases always happens a very great sufferer  secondly all the goods of the growth of the english colonies or which were to be had from england being now imported directly to scotland began to come as the return of the scots manufactures  several ships being laden from scotland to virginia and barbados the very first year after the union  another consequence of this union in trade was the letting fall almost all the woollen manufactures which had been erected in scotland and where they began to come to some perfection in making broad cloth druggets and stuffs of all sorts but upon the opening the english trade they were immediately so thronged with english goods of the same sorts so much cheaper that it appeared those things would die of course  though indeed this seemed to be some blow to their trade and particularly to the employment of their poor yet at the same time the duties upon linen from scotland being taken off in england made so great a demand for scots linen more than usual that it seemed the poor could want no employment and several kinds of linen being set to work by english men which never before were made or at least for exportation in scotland such as sailcloths canvas damask etc it is thought the employment of the poor was not lessened by this alteration  on the other hand the lower and courser manufactures in scotland which were made of their own wool seemed to increase and not only found a larger vent in scotland but were bought up by the english merchants who brought other stuffs thither and sold in england and these manufactures are not unlikely to rise to a considerable height such as stirling serges in england called shaloons musselburgh stuffs and the like and we find in england some proposals from the african company for the making guinea stuffs there which perhaps may in time come to be very considerable  i might enter here into the schemes and projects which have made much noise in the world for improvement of fishing in scotland and of navigation and building ships in scotland but as these things have yet made no alterations in the trade and are but in embrio at the writing these sheets i cannot mingle them here as matter of history but have touched them more at large in the preface  it remains only to speak of the alterations of the customs  and this would have required a long table of the several duties and impost formerly paid in scotland upon the export and import of merchandises  but having already given an account that the whole customs are settled upon the english foot and the duties of all kinds being too large to insert here and already printed in the book of rates reprinted in scotland it would be a vain labor to recite the particulars and as to the difference between the duties on the english foot and the duties as paid before it required the very same recital of particulars the length of which would be intolerable and for this reason though i have referred to some schemes said to be in the second part of this appendix and which i received from the customhouse in scotland yet when i came to find upon examination that the tacksmen of the customs in scotland usually compounded with the merchants and reduced the said customs to what sum they pleased i chose to omit a scheme which when put down would give the reader no certain guess at the thing and consequently signify nothing  if any man should enquire whether upon the whole of these alterations in trade scotland is gainer or loser i must acknowledge it is a difficult point to resolve at so small a distance from the finishing the union but as to the profit of the trade between scotland and england in particular as it appears at the writing these sheets i shall leave the impartial observer to guess by these two particulars   that about seventeen ships from the several ports of scotland are already fitted out and sent away to the english colonies whose loading is certainly the product of the ground or labor of the poor and whose return must be in sugar tobacco cotton indico etc and money    that above   0000 bolls of corn of sundry sorts has already been shipped off from scotland for england besides a very great quantity bought up by england and shipped directly for portugal both these articles are additions to the trade of scotland and both within little more than a year immediately succeeding the union of the island what further increase of commerce may accrue to scotland when these bloody wars shall end and when peace shall be restored to europe i shall not pretend to examine but there seems to be no question but the trade of scotland stands fair for very great improvements   finis appendix part ii no a x act anent prayer for the parliament anent the union at edinburgh the fourteenth day of october one thousand seven hundred and six years the commission of the general assembly taking to their most serious consideration the great and weighty affairs now in agitation specially the treaty betwixt the two kingdoms and how much these call to all to be earnest with god in sincere and fervent supplications for his direction and assistance to the high court of parliament and all others concerned to bring them to a happy issue for his own glory and the good of this church and kingdom do therefore resolve

of their determinations with respect to the same may prove of the highest consequence both to this church and nation in all their interests civil and religious and that both to the present and succeeding generations considering likewise that the abounding and continued increase of impiety popery and prophanness through the land the abuse of the privileges and mercies we have enjoyed and hitherto through the infinite goodness and longsuffering patience of god do still enjoy our unthankfulness for and vnfruitfulness under the gospel our formality decay of zeal and slackness in promoving according to our stations the much called for work of sincere personal and national reformation may justly provoke the righteous and holy god to remove our blessings to smite us in his hot displeasure and for our sins to leave our rulers in this vastly important and difficult exigence wherein there is so much need of clear and unprejudicated light and of harmony and oneness in the lord they have therefore judged it incumbent upon them to excite themselves and all the people of god in the land to much seriousness diligence and continued fervor in applying to the throne of grace upon so great and momentuous affairs and they do hereby most seriously and earnestly recommend to all the presbytries within this national church to appoint set a part and observe a day for solemn public prayer fasting and humiliation in all the curches within their respective bounds as soon as possible for which end the moderators of the several presbytries are to call them pro re nata as soon as this comes to their hand and farther that presbytries continue to keep among themselves and ministers with their sessions dyets for persisting instant in prayer to god and for preserving upon their own spirits and of all the lords people a due concern about their proper duty with respect unto the church of christ and the great affairs now in agitarion  and the commission does most earnestly beseech and obtest in the bowels of our lord jesus christ all their brethren of the ministry and all the lords people that they stir up themselves and one another to humble sincere and penitent confessions of their own sins and the sins of the land and to unfeigned resolutiosn to amendment with active and zealous endeavors after through reformation respectively in their places together also

the forces of her majesty and these of her allies against the great troubler of the peace of europe and persecutor of the church and people of god and that god may continue his kindness in prospering her majestys and these of her allies forces both by sea and land against the common enemy and that all the consultations and determinations of the estates of parliament especially with respect to an union with england may be influenced and directed by divine wisdom and conduct in the fear of the lord to his glory the good of religion and this national church established by law in doctrine worship

estates of parliament the address of the commissioners to the general convention of the royal burrows of this ancient kingdom conveened the   th of october last upon the great concern of the union proposed betwixt scotland and england for concerting such measures as should be esteemed proper for them to take with relation to their trade and other concerns humbly shows that as by the claim of right it is the privilege of all subjects to petition so at this time being mostly empowered by our constitvents and knowing the sentiments of the people we represent it is our indispensible duty to signify to your grace and the honorable estates of parliament that as we are not against an honorable and safe union with england consisting with the being of this kingdom and parliament thereof without which we conceive neither our religion nor our civil interests and trade as we now by law enjoy them can be secured to us and our posterity far less can we expect to have the condition of the people of scotland with relation to these great concerns made better and improven without a scots parliament  and seeing by the articles of union now under the consideration of the honorable estates of parliament it is agreed that scotland and england shall be united into one kingdom and that the united kingdoms be united by one and the same parliament by which our monarchy is suppressed our parliaments extinguished and in consequence our religion church government claim of right laws liberties trade and all that is dear to us daily in danger of being encroached upon altered or wholly subverted by the english in a britishparaliament wherein the mean representation allowed for scotland can never signify in securing to us the interest reserved by us or granted to us by the english  and by these articles our poor people are made liable to the english taxes which is a certain unsupportable burden considering that the trade proposed is uncertain involved and wholly precarious especially when regulate as to export and import by the laws of england and under the same prohibitions and restrictions customs and duties and considering that the most considerable branches of our trade are differing from those of england and are and may be yet more discouraged by their laws and that all the concerts of trade and our interest are after the union subject to such alterations as the parliament of great britain shall think fit  we therefore supplicate your grace and the honorable estates of parliament and do assuredly expect that ye will not conclude such an incorporate union as is contained in the articles proposed but that ye will support and maintain the trve reformed protestant religion and chvrch government as by law established the sovereignity and independency of this crown and kingdom and the rights and privileges of parliament which has been generously asserted by you in the session of this present parliament and do further pray that effectual means may be used for defeating the designs and attempts of all popish pretenders whatsomever to the succession of this crown and kingdom and for securing this nation against all the attempts and encroachments that may be made by any persons whatsomever upon the sovereignity religion laws liberties trade and qviet of the same and we promise to maintain with our lives and fortunes all these valuable things in opposition to all popish and other enemies whatsomever according to our laws and claim of right  signed by order and in presence of the convention by sam mclellan preses  no e x these are to notify to all concerned what are our reasons for and designs in the burning of the printed articles of the proposed union with england with the names of the scots commissioners subscribers thereof together with the minutes of the whole treaty betwixt them and the english commissioners thereanent we have herein no design against her majesty nor against england or any englishman neither against our present parliament in their acts or actings for the interest safety and sovereignity of this our native and ancient nation but to testify our dissent from discontent with and protestation against the twenty five articles of the said union subscribed by the foresaid commissioners as being inconsistent with and altogether prejudicial to and utterly destructive of this nations independency grownrights and our constitute laws both sacred and civil we shall not here condescend upon the particular prejudices that do and will redound to this nation if the said union should be carried on according to the printed articles but referrs the reader to the variety of addresses given in to the present parliament by all ranks from almost all corners of this nation against the said union only we must say and profess that the commissioners for this nation have been either simple ignorant or treacherous if not all three when the minutes of the treaty betwixt the commissioners of both kingdoms are duly considered and when we compare their dastardly tieldings unto the demands and proposals of the english commissioners who on the contrair have valiantly acquit themselves for the interest and safety of their nation  we acknowledge it is in the power of the present parliament to give remissions to the subscribers of the foresaid articles and we heartily wish for a good agreement amongst all the members of the parliament so as it may tend to the safety and preservation of both church and state with all the privileges belonging thereto within the kingdom of scotland  but if the subscribers of the foresaid treaty and union with their associats in parliament shall presume to carry on the said union by a supreme power over the belly of the generality of this nation then and in that case as we judge that the consent of the generality of the same can only divest them of their sacred and civil libertys purchased and maintained by our ancestors with their blood so we protest whatever ratification of the foresaid union may pass in parliament contrair to our fundamental laws liberties and privileges concerning church and state may not be binding upon the nation now or at any time to come and particularly we protest against the approbation of the first article of the said union before the privileges of this nation contained in the other articles had been adjusted and secured and so we earnestly require that the representatives in parliament who are for our nations privileges would give timeous warning to all the corners of the kingdom that we and our posterity become not tributary and bondslaves to our neighbors without acquiting our selves as becomes men and christians and we are confident that the soldiers now in martial power have so much of the spirits of scots men that they are not ambitions to be disposed of at the pleasure of another nation and we hereby declare that we have no design against them in this matter  no f x overture for an act for security of the church our sovereign lady and the estates of parliament considering that by the late act of parliament for a treaty with england for an union of both kingdoms it is provided that the commissioners for that treaty should not treat of or concerning any alteration of the worship discipline and government of the church of this kingdom as now by law established which treaty being now reported to the parliament and it being reasonable and necessary that the true protestant religion as presently professed within this kingdom with the worship discipline and government of this church should be effectually and vnalterably secured therefore her majesty with advice and consent of the said estates of parliament does hereby establish and confirm the said true protestant religion and the worship discipline and government of this church to continue without any alteration to the people of this land in all succeeding generations and more especially her majesty with advice and consent foresaid ratifies approves and for ever confirms the   th act of the   parliament k w and q m entitled act ratifying the confession of faith and settling presbyterian church government with the hall other acts of parliament relating thereto in prosecution of the declaration of the estates of this kingdom containing the claim of right bearing date the    th of april      and her majesty with advice and consent foresaid expressly provides and declares that the foresaid true protestant religion contained in the above mentioned confession of faith with the form and purity of worship presently in use within this church and its presbyterian church government and discipline that is to say the government of the church by kirksessions presbytries provincialsynods and generalassemblys all established by the foresaid acts of parliament pursuant to the claim of right shall remain and continue unalterable and that the said presbyterian government shall be the only government of the church within the kingdom of scotland and further for the greater security of the foresaid protestant religion and of the worship discipline and government of this church as above established her majesty with advice and consent foresaid statutes and ordains that in all time coming no professors principals regents masters or others bearing office in any university college or school within this kingdom be capable or be admitted or allowed to continue in the exercise of their said functions but such as shall own and acknowledge the civil government in manner prescribed or to be prescribed by the acts of parliament as also that before or at their admissions they do and shall acknowledge and profess and shall subscribe to the foresaid confession of faith as confession of their faith and that they will practice and conform themselves to the worship presently in use in this church and submit themselves to the government and discipline thereof and never endeavor directly or indirectly the prejudice or subversion of the same and that before the respective presbytries of their bounds by whatsomever gift presentation or provision they may be thereto provided and further her majesty with advice foresaid expressly declares and statutes that none of the subjects of this kingdom shall be liable to but all and every one of them for ever free of any oath test or subscription within this kingdom contrary to or inconsistent with the foresaid true protestant religion and presbyterian church government worship and discipline as above established and that the same within the bounds of this church and kingdom shall never be imposed upon or required of them in any sort and lastly that after the decease of her present majesty whom god long preserve the sovereign succeeding to her in the royal government of this kingdom shall in all time coming at his or her accession to the crown swear and subscribe that they shall maintain and preserve the foresaid settlement of the true protestant religion with the government worship and discipline of this church as above established inviolably and it is hereby statute and ordained that this act of parliament with the establishment therein contained shall be held and observed in all time coming as a fundamental and essential condition of any treaty or union to be concluded betwixt the two kingdoms without any alteration thereof or derogation thereto in any sort for ever as also that this act of parliament and settlement therein contained shall be insert and repeated in any act of parliament that shall pass for agreeing and concluding the foresaid treaty or union betwixt the two kingdoms and that the same shall be there expressly declared to be a fundamental and essential condition of the said treaty or union in all time coming  no g x agreed to in the commission november     0  unto his grace her majestys high commissioner and the right honorable the estate of parliament the humble representation and petition of the commission of the general assembly of this national church shows that beside the general address already made by us for securing the doctrine worship discipline and government of this church and now under your consideration which withal gratitude we acknowledge there are some particulars which in pursuance of the design of our said address we do with all humility lay before your grace and lordships i that the sacramental test being the condition of access to places of trust and to benefits from the crown all of our communion must be debarred from the same if not in scotland yet through the rest of the dominion of britain which may prove of most dangerous consequence to this church ii that this church and nation may be exposed to the further danger of new oaths from the parliament of britain unless it be provided that no oath bond or test of any kind shall be required of any minister or member of the church of scotland which are inconsistent with the known principles of this church iii there being no provision in the treaty of union for securing of this church by a coronation oath that therefore in the coronation oath to be taken by the sovereigns of great britain they be engaged to maintain the doctrine worship discipline and government of this church and the rights and privileges thereof as now by law established iv that in case the proposed union be concluded the church will suffer prejudice unless there be a commission for plantation of kirks and valuation of teinds and making up the registers of that court which were burnt and a judicatory in scotland for redressing grievances and judging causes which formerly were judged by the privy council such as the growth of popery and other irregularities and with which judicature the church may correspond anent fasts and thanksgivings v likewise we do humbly represent that in the second part of the oath of abjuration in favors of the succession in the protestant line there is reference made to some acts of the english parliament which every one in this nation who may be obliged to take the said oath may not so well know and therefore cannot swear with judgment as also there seems to us some qualifications required in the successor to the crown which are not suitable to our principles vi and in the last place in case this proposed treaty of union shall be concluded this nation will be subjected in its civil interests to a british parliament wherein twenty six prelates are to be constituent members and legislators and lest our silence should be constructed to import our consent to or approbation of the civil places and power of church men we crave leave in all humility and due respect to your grace and honorable estates of parliament to represent that its contrary to our known principles and covenants that any church man should bear civil offices or have power in the common wealth   these things we humbly beseech your grace and lordships to consider and provide suitable remedies thereto and we shall pray that the only wise god may so direct and guide your grace and lordships in these and all other matters that ly before you that the result of your consultations may be the glory of god the advantage of religion the peace and comfort of her majesty whose long and prosperous reign we heartily pray for the preservation of peace and truth in both kingdoms and the welfare of this church and nation in particular the satisfaction of all who truly love and fear the lord therein the peace of your own consciences and your comfort in the day of

of the commission of the late general assembly of the church of scotland against the representation and petition at edinburgh the twelfth day of november one thousand seven hundred and six years by the under subscribing noblemen and gentlemen elders in the said commission reasons for dissent entered and protestation taken by them upon the   th day of the said month in the meeting of the commission against an address proposed to be made by the commission upon the grounds contained in six articles to the high court of parliament which articles were by several members of the commission urged to be put to the vote for approbation in the form and terms following  the articles are as follows   that the sacramental test being the condition of access to places of trust and to benefits from the crown all of our communion must be debarred from the same if not in scotland yet through the rest of the dominion of britain which may prove of most dangerous consequence to this church   that this church and nation may be exposed to the further danger of new oaths from the parliament of britain unless it be provided that no oath bond or test of any kind shall be required of any minister or member of the church of scotland which are inconsistent with the known principles of this church   there being no provision in the treaty of union for securing of this church by the coronation oath that therefore in the coronation oath to be taken by the sovereigns of great britain they be engaged to maintain the doctrine worship discipline and government of this church and the rights and privileges thereof as now by law established   that in case the proposed union be concluded the church will suffer prejudice unless there be a commission for plantation of kirks and

in the last place in case the proposed treaty of union shall be concluded this nation will be subjected in its civil interests to a british parliament wherein twenty six prelates are to be constituent

your grace and honorable estates of parliament to represent that its contrary to our known principles and covenants that any churchman should bear civil offices or have power in the common wealth   against which articles and address proposed the said elders did before the vote protest and take instruments in the hands of the clerk of the commission for the reasons following   the commission of the general assembly having already addressed to the parliament for securing the doctrine worship discipline and government of this church and that address being read in the house upon the    th of october last the parliament did thereupon declare that before concluding the union they would take the said address to their consideration and would do every thing necessary for securing the true protestant religion and church government presently by law established in this kingdom which assurance we conceive the commission may very well rely upon seeing it is not to be doubted that the parliament will in due time when the address is taken to consideration make all necessary provisions for securing our religion and church government by law established and it may be constructed jealousy or diffidence in this commission to press and pursue the said address further before it appear what steps and progress the parliament shall make upon it especially seeing there are so many elders of this commission who are members of the house and being heartily concerned for the churches interest will certainly take care that nothing be ommitted or forgot to be represented in parliament which is necessary for the churches security    the parliament having upon the    th of october last voted to proceed presently to the consideration of the articles of the treaty of union which might be known to all by the published minutes we conceive it not decent or suitable to the prudence of this commission to present an new address relating to the subject of the former whereby the house may be impeded in its procedure which may cause a longer delay of considering the first address by occasioning new questions and debates in the house    the   th article of the now intended address contains matters which we conceive are not within the sphere and compass of the commissions business prescribed to them by the general assembly yet a wide step is made in quarrelling and objecting to the constitution of the parliament of england the representative of that nation with which this is now in a treaty about an union likeways in that article the form and frame of the civil policy and government of england in the extent and latitude of it agreeable to it is laws is reflected upon and challenged all which in our opinion insinuates a blaming and condemning our parliament for treating of an union with a kingdom so circumstantiated as england is    whatever the constitution of the parliament of england now is and whatever may be the constitution of the parliament of great britain after the union the present legal establishment of our church is not alterable by it that being without the bounds of the treaty which can reach no farther than the civil policy and government of the united kingdom besides that our legal establishment will no doubt be further fenced and fortified when the commissions address is taken into consideration by the parliament    the parliament having upon the fourth of this month voted that the two kingdoms of scotland and england shall upon the first day of may next ensuing and for ever after be united into one kingdom by the name of great britain with this provision that if the articles of union be not adjusted by the parliament then the agreeing to and approving of the first shall be of no effect we apprehend it may be of dangerous consequence to present now any address which may admit of a construction opposite to that vote in parliament and certainly it would not be excuseable in any who are members in the house to concur in an address of that sort  so being fully persuaded that the way of proceeding by the new address now intended will tend to the great disadvantage and prejudice of the church as now established and of the presbyterian interest we found our selves obliged to enter our dissent and to protest  sic subscribitur rothes marchment polwarth george baillie alexander ogilvie j c auchinbreck j campbell  the commission of the general assembly reply to the reasons given by the elders for their protest entitled some modest animadversions by way of reply to a paper entitled reasons etc ut supra it was a great grief to the commission when it pleased some of our honorable friends of the ruling elders to protest against the vote whether the   th article of the commissions second address should be added to the other articles formerly agreed to and it does add no little to our grief that a paper is given in with reasons as against the whole address whereas they may remember the first three of the articles of the said adress were unanimously agreed unto before  we do sincerly profess we have such a sense of and confidence in the kindness of thse noble and honorable persons to this church that it afflicts us when in any thing we cannot comply with their opinion but we hope they will excuse us when purely our conscience toward god makes us differ  we heartily wish this debate sopite and that yet it would please them to take up this paper perhaps on more mature and second thoughts they may see there is no ground to be so severe against our second address as to censure it as jealousy or diffidence of the parliament or our friends in it as in the first reasons and of indecency and unsuitable to prudence as reason second or dangerous and such as may be construed as contrary to a vote of parliament november   th as in reason   th for the first address being general the second was but a humble representation of some particulars we humbly desired might be minded when it pleased the parliament to resume the consideration of the first address leaving the time to the wisdom of the parliament we being far from any design to occasion delay or debate and it has pleased the parliament to insert diverse of the things there desired in the act for the security of the church and we would gladly hope they will consider the rest of them in due time  but we conceive it is the   th article against which the chief offense is taken and against which the   d and   th reasons are levelled but our honorable friends know there had been much reasoning on that head for diverse days and when there was no appearance of unanimity how could the commission shun a vote for decision of the difference nor can we be persuaded that the commission went in their vote without the sphere and compass of the business prescribed to them by the general assembly or made a wide step in quarrelling and objecting to the constitution of the parliament of england as is alleged in reason   d for it was often told in the conference and debate we did not meddle with the constitution of the parliament of england as the parliament of england though we cannot command our judgment to an approbation of it nor do we speak any thing against treating with the parliament of england as the representative of that nation nor does it blame our parliament for treating with them for they treat with the parliament of scotland as the representative of the nation which as theirs is in its frame established by the laws of the land yet a regulation thereof is treated of for constituting the british parliament why then should there be so much offense taken that in due season before the conclusion of the treaty it is humbly represented to the parliament that in case the proposed treaty of union be concluded this nation will be subjected in its civil interests to a british parliament wherein    prelates are to be constituent members and legislators  we do not speak in that   th article of the legal establishment of our church and so the   th reason touches not this point  and could any thing be more modestly expressed than this is by the commission in their address in these words  and lest our silence should be constructed to import our consent to or approbation of the civil places and power of churchmen we crave leave in all humility and due respect to your grace and honorable estates of parliament to represent that it is contrary to our known principles and covenants that any church man should bear civil offices or have power in the commonwealth  nor can we see how this address does of its own nature tend to the disadvantage of the established church and presbyterian interest  but as we have charity toward them we expect the same charity toward us acting purely from conscience toward god and we entreat and expect the continuance of their kindness to this church  no k x unto his grace her majestys high commissioner and the most honorable the estates of parliament the representation and petition of the commission of the general assembly of this national church of scotland edinburgh january    th   0  humbly shows that we considering the trust reposed in us by the late general assembly find it our duty to lay before your grace and lordships when as we are informed you are about the passing of an act of ratification of the articles of the treaty of union betwixt the two kingdoms of scotland and england which contains these following words declaring nevertheless that the parliament of england may provide for the security of the church of england as they shall think expedient to take place within the bounds of the said kingdom of england and not derogating from the security above provided for establishing the church of scotland within the bounds of this kingdom which shall not suspend or derogate from the force and effect of this present ratification but shall be understood as here included without any necessity of any new raticfiation in the parliament of scotland which clause seems to us not only to be like a blank put with your grace and lordships consent in the hands of the parliament of england to enact what they shall think fit for securing the hierarchy and ceremonies of their church but also a consent that it be an article and fundamental of the union and as is contained in your ratification cannot but imply a manifest homologation  we do therefore humbly beseech your grace and lordships that there be no such stipulation or consent for the establishment of that hierarchy and ceremonies as you would not involve your selves and this nation in guilt and as you consult the peace and quiet of this nation both in church and state we pray that god may bless and preserve our gracious queen and direct your grace and lordships in this and all the great and momentuous affairs which are or may be before you  signed in name in presence and at the appointment of the commission

and agree to as expressive of our known and covenanted principles and tho it may appear unnecessar that we should give your grace and the honorable estates of parliament any trouble this way yet from a sense of the duty we owe to god at this juncture to our gracious sovereign queen anne whom the lord long preserve for a blessing to this church and nation and to your grace and lordships we could not forbear in all humility to represent how much we are alarmed with the present scheme of union in the printed articles as apprehending the fatal consequences thereof in the event of a british parliament to our sacred and religious concerns and to which we can not go in without guilt before god in a manifest breach of our solemn covenants by which we are engaged against ecclesiastical persons being legislators in the common wealth the setting up of public mass and english ceremonies the illegal and disorderly practices of the episcopal clergy from the hopes of a popish successor to the crown without any effectual redress from the government notwithstanding of repeated application made by this church do give just umbrage of what may be expected when scotland and england are united into one kingdom and represented by one and the same parliament  may it therefore please your grace and the honorable estates of parliament to be tender of the peace and quiet of this church and nation and settle the succession in the protestant line and to do nothing that may be prejudicial to this national church in any of its religious or sacred interests which her majesty in her gracious letter backed with your grace and my lord chancellors speeches to this present session of parliament give just ground to expect  no m x unto his grace her majestys high commissioner and the right honorable estates of parliament the humble address of the barons and freeholders within the stewartry of kirkcudbright we the barons freeholders of the said stewartry of kirkcudbright undersubscribing having seen the articles of the union agreed upon by the commissioners nominate on behalf of the kingdom of scotland and the commissioners nominate on behalf of the kingdom of england in which they have agreed that scotland and england shall be united into the kingdom the which united kingdom shall be united by one and the same parliament and seeing it does evidently appear to us that such an incorporating union as is contained in the said articles is contrair to the honor fundamental laws and constitution of this kingdom claim of right and rights and privileges of the barons and freeholders of this kingdom and that the same is destructive to the true interest of the nation and being likewise apprehensive of the danger that evidently threatens our church government from a parliament where there is not one member of that communion therefore we humbly beseech your grace and the honorable estates of parliament that ye will not promote any such incorporating union but do confidently expect that ye will support and preserve entire the sovereignity and independency of this crown and kingdom and the rights and privileges maintained by our heroic ancestors for the space of near two thousand years that the same may be transmitted to succeeding generations as it has been conveyed to us and we will heartily concur with you for supporting and maintaining our sovereignity and independency with our lives and fortunes conform to the qualified laws of the nation  no n x unto his grace her majestys high commissioner and the right honorable the estates of parliament the humble address of the presbytery of hamilton shows that we heartily concur with the addresses made by the commission of the general assembly to your grace and lordships and do believe that there is a full unanimity therein amongst the ministers of this national church both as to the matter of these addresses and in their humble and earnest desires that the honorable estates of parliament may take them into further consideration to prevent the fears and dangers of this church that may ensue from an incorporating union with england in the terms of the treaty offered to the parliament  but that which more especially obliges us in duty and conscience as ministers of the gospel of peace most humbly to interpose with your grace and lordships is the lamentable and distracted state of the kingdom and particularly the people under our pastoral charge from the sad apprehensions they have and have expressed in their several addresses to the parliament of the woeful effects and consequences of such an union to their liberties both civil and religious and that it cannot be entered into by the nation in the terms without incurring the guilt of national perjury and though hitherto we have endeavored to keep them from breaking out yet the ferment and dissatisfaction does so increase amongst all that we are justly afraid of what these things may turn unto  we do therefore after serious supplication at the throne of grace most earnestly implore and with all humility beseech in the bowels of our lord jesus christ that your grace and lordships may compassionate the trembling state of this church and nation and listen as it were to their dying groans god having put it in your hands to allay their fears avert their dangers and prevent the dreadful confusions that threaten this land by laying aside this incorporating union with england as offered in the treaty and by supplicating her most gracious majesty for whose long and happy reign over us we do and always shall most heartily pray and upon whose royal assurances in behalf of this church we do most cheerfully rely that the protestant succession to the sovereign and independent crown of this kingdom may be settled by an act of our own parliament and that no incorporating union with england may be concluded until her majesty shall be pleased to call the general assembly of this church which being the national church established by law and founded on the nations claim of right has an undoubted right to be consulted about her own securities before any such union be entered into with a government of another communion where that government is to be in a manner sole master of the whole administration  these things we most humbly beg of your grace and lordships as our protectors and patrons under god beseeching you to hearken unto us that god may hearken unto you and give you peace and comfort in the day of your accounts  sic subscribitur  no o x a letter from the commission of the general assembly to the presbytery of hamilton edinburgh december   th   0  r d b the general assembly of this church having appointed us to take care that it suffer no prejudice through neglect of due application to the honorable estates of parliament or any other judicatory concerned in the management of public affairs we have in this juncture wherein a treaty of union with the neighboring kingdom is under deliberation before the representatives of our nation endeavored and are still endeavoring to exoner our consciences in doing what we judge incumbent upon us for securing the doctrine worship discipline government rights and privileges of this church as now by the great goodness of god the same are established among us and being informed of disorders and tumults in some parts of the country which the enemies of our present happy establishment may be ready to improve though without ground to the disadvantage and reproach of this church we do look upon it as our duty to recommend to all our brethren that as they have in their stations access they do discountenance and discourage all irregularities and tumults that tend to disturb the government of our gracious sovereign the queen to whom we are in gratitude as well as duty under the highest obligations seeing in the kind providence of god we by her good and wise management enjoy so many advantages and upon whose preservation our peace and the security of all that is dear to us do under god much depend this in name and by the order of the commission of the general assembly of this national church is subscribed by  r d b your affectionate brother and servant in the lord william carstairs moderator protempore  for the right reverend the moderator and remanent members of the presbytery of hamilton no p x the answer of the presbytery of hamilton to the letter from the commission of the general assembly bothwel    december   0  r d b your letter signed by the r mr carstairs moderator pro tem pore we received this day being our first meeting after its date of the  th instant wherein there is mention of your being informed of disorders and tumults in some parts of the country which you recommend unto us to discountenance and discoursge as we have access  we know there have been many reports spread abroad of tumults and disorders not only in glasgow which is too true but in other places within the shire of lanerk which as to the bounds of our presbytery are grossly false and we have reason to believe them to be so likewise as to the rest of the shire we have heard also of some calumnious stories industriously disseminated concerning some of our number with respect to these pretended disorders which are not only contrary to truth but to common sense we wish the forgers and spreaders may be forgiven they act in this neither the part of good christians nor of good subjects  as to the disposition of the people the plain truth is that they are generally most averse from the union and many have expressed themselves broadly enough against it as what they fear may prove an irremediable evil if it should be concluded wishing that some stop might be put to it and we have not been wanting as there was occasion to advise and exhort the people to calmness and regularity and to refrain from any undue keenness might be in their words but we must say that it is utterly false and malicious to suggest that there has been the least tumult or irregular practice among them since this union came in question far less any shadow or appearance of any undutiful or disloyal thought of her majesty yea there has not been so much as the least motion toward their accustomed ordinary rendezvous warranted by law since the publishing of a proclamation and act forbidding the same it is true that some of those rash youths who broke out from glasgow passed through our bounds but they were not allowed to make any stay nor received the least encouragement at any hand for ought we know so that we can well assure the r commission there is as much peace and quiet within the whole bounds of this presbytery as is any place of the kingdom  we have heard with much satisfaction of the zeal which the r commission has showed by their addresses mentioned in your letter for the interests of the church at this time when they are in so eminent hazard and we have testified our concurrence therewith by our address to the parliament but we are still of opinion that the pressing necessity of the present juncture and the manifest impossibility in the event of such an union as is molded in the treaty of securing this church in any of her precious concerns now established by the laws and constitution of our own government and kingdom does not only require the continuance of assidous application to the right honorable estates of parliament but likewise that the commission in name of this church testify against the concluding of any union with england upon the foot of this treaty till the general assembly of this national church according to her undoubted right as we have showed in our address be called and allowed to consider of solid and essential securities for the church in such an exigence this we humbly think the trust reposed in the commission and faithfulness to the church of scotland both in the present and succeeding generations does undenyably demand thus heartily recommending you to divine conduct and assistance we rest  r d b your most affectionate brethren and humble servants in the lord the ministers of the presbytery of hamilton subscribed in

entreated that in case the union be concluded that for preserving the peace of the nation and redressing of grievances of the church the privy council may be continued or some court established for judging in such cases as were formerly judged by the council and this church may correspond with them for fasts and thanksgivings secundo the interests of diverse heretors as well as the exigents of the church will require that there be some fixed court to do the work of the commission for plantation of kirks and valuation of teinds which is the more necessary in respect of the great prejudice the church has sustained for want thereof and that this court be empowered to make up the registers of the commissions of former parliaments that were burnt in the great fire in edinburgh tertio seeing the terms of an oath should be clear that it may be taken in truth in righteousness and judgment it is desired that if the english abjuration oath be required of scotsmen the words may be made

agreeable to our known principles quarto seeing upon the event of an union there ought to be a commuication of all privileges and advantages which do or may belong to the subjects of either kingdom it is entreated that due provision be made that in case of any union scotsmen may be capable of places of power and trust in all places of britain without any obligation to take the english sacramental test for that besides what may be said of the danger that way to profane that holy ordinance it may prove a temptation to diverse to conform who otherways would not do it and this way by degrees bring in corruption to this church quinto seeing the eccesiastical supremacy claimed some time by the sovereigns in this land was such an encroachment on the prerogative of our lord jesus christ the alone

subscribed thus  to his grace the duke of queensberry her majestys high commissioner to the parliament of scotland may it please your grace i could not have peace in my own mind night or day until i made this discovery of a plot so clossly laid against your grace that the world could not have discovered unless it had pleased god thus to touch my conscience or some others of the conspirators wherefore i shall give your grace a short account of the true matter of fact without the least dissembling upon thursday last at    a clock at night there came a gentleman to my house who whispered in mine ear while i was in bed to go along with him in all haste so i got up out of bed and went with him he led me into a chamber where i met seven other young men who welcomed me to the place and after a little talk told me they were upon a business which they could not effect without me which was to dispatch that treacherous devil the commissioner so they were pleased to call your grace i god forgive me joined with them heartily whereupon they produced a paper containing a most horrid oath whereby they bound themselves to assassinate your grace the first day the parliament sat after newyearsday and that they should rather be burned alive than discover their fellows  two and twenty has subscribed this oath with their blood  they said they wanted only two to complete their number for the work they desiring to have twenty four concerned in it some of these your grace would little suspect but these that are to be the main actors are the most graceless debauched wretches in the world that fear neither god nor man some of them are to be clothed in the highland dress one in the habit of a beggar with a false beard six of them are to be in the habit of baxters that by this means they may with the more ease raise the rabble one of those in highland dress is to stand on your left hand as you come out of the parliament house with a naked durk beneath his played to stab your grace but if he has no opportunity for action then the beggar is to attend your coach with a pistol beneath his rags which he is to fire at your grace at which the baxters are to raise the rabble with their cries which they think will soon be done then lest your grace should escape with life they are to take care to get the netherbow port closed in spite of the guards their next design is upon the chancellor philiphaugh and some others after repeated oaths of secrecy we parted about   a clock this morning and i came home but perplexing thoughts so tormented me that i could neither sleep eat or drink till i cased my mind with this discovery if your grace will assure me of pardon and that you will obtain me a remission from the queen for this and an other crime which the conspirators will allege for revenge i was guilty of ten years ago abroad i will come to your graces lodging and make a full discovery of this whole design and let your grace see their names written with their own hands and with their own blood for they put so much trust in me as that they gave it me in keeping your grace may take your own method in making it known if you will pardon me and protect me which if your grace do i shall not fail to perform my promise and tell your grace other circumstances than can recite here  dec  0   at night   0  i am may it please your grace your graces humble servant  there were several other letters some to bully and insult the commissioner some pretending to caution him but his grace took no notice of any of them nor did he ever omit going to the parliament house

britain  no k x x thursday   january   0  a protest was given in by george lockhart of carnwath in these terms i george lockhart of carnwath do protest for my self and in name of such other barons as shall adhere to this my protestation that neither this vote nor any other vote conclusion or article in this treaty of union shall prejudge the barons of this kingdom from their full representation in parliament as now by law established nor any of their privileges and particularly their judicative and legislative capacities of which they are deprived by the terms of this treaty of union and i crave this my protestation to be admitted and recorded  no l x x and another protest was given in by the duke of athole in these terms whereas by my protest given in the  th of november last before voting the first article of union i did reserve liberty to renew protestations against any other article of the treaty and as i protested for the reasons therein mentioned so i do now for my self and all others who shall adhere protest against any vote for approving the    d article of this treaty of union and against all the parts of it for these reasons because the peers of this realm who are hereditary members of her majestys great council and parliament do thereby become elective and so her majesty is deprived of her born counselors and the peers of their birthright and whereas they are at present   0 in number they are by this article reduced to    which    are to be joined with the house of lords in england whose number at present consists of above   0 whereby it is plain that the scots peers share in the legislative and judicative powers in the british parliament is very unequal with that of the english tho the one be representatives of as free and independent a nation as the other and is therefore a plain forfeiture of the peerage of this kingdom and as it is the hight of injustice and against all the laws and practices of this and all other well governed nations to forfeit any person without a heinous crime so its against all law to forfeit either the peers that are now present or those that are minors or absent without being so much as called or cited for that end  it is likewise contrary to the honor and true interest of her majesty and the monarchy to suppress the estate of peers who have formerly been the great supporters of the monarchy  and it is dishonorable and disgraceful to this kingdom that the peers thereof shall only have rank and precedence next after the peers of the like order and degree in england without regard to their antiquity or the dates of their patents as is stipulate by the following articles of this treaty  in the next place each shire and royal burgh within this kingdom have the number of their representatives determined by acts of parliament whose number at present being     are by this article of the treaty reduced to    and to be joined to     members in the house of commons where they can have no influence by reason of the vast disproportion of their numbers besides that the barons and burrows of this nation by this way of uniting are deprived of their inherent right of being fully and individually represented in parliament both with relation to their legislative and judicative capacities  and they are not only highly prejudged in lessening their representation but also degraded from being members of the parliaments of this kingdom where they sit as judges in all causes civil and criminal to be joined to the commons of another nation who are accustomed to supplicate for justice at the bar of the house of lords  the barons and burgesses are also further prejudged in this that whereas every shire and royal burgh have their own representatives one commissioner will hereafter represent several shires or burghs who it cannot be supposed will understand the several interests and concerns of the said several shires and burghs whom he may represent  and further for the present representatives of the barons and burgesses to offer by any vote or deed of theirs to incapacitate their constituents or deprive them of any part of their inherent right is what their constituents may and do justly dissallow they only having their commissions with the ordinary powers of making and amending laws and giving supplys but no ways to alter fundamental constitutions or to take away or diminish their representation which is also a plain forfeiture of their constituents of their inherent rights and undoubted privileges and is contrary to the fundamental laws of this nation which are the birthright of the people thereof  from all which it is plain and evident that this from a sovereign independent monarchy shall dissolve its constitution and be at the disposal of england whose constitution is not in the least to be altered by this treaty and where it is not to be supposed the scots shall have any weight in the making of laws even though relative to their own kingdom by reason of the vast disproportion and disparity of the representation aforesaid  and therefore i do also protest that no vote may hinder or prejudge the noblemen barons and burgesses as now represented in parliament to retain bruik enjoy and exerce all their rights liberties and privileges as fully and freely as hitherto they have enjoyed them  and since it evidently appears not only from the many protests of the honorable and worthy members of this house but also from the multitudes of addresses and petitions from the several parts of this kingdom of the barons freeholders heretors burgesses and commons and from the commission of the general assembly that there is a general dislike and aversion from the incorporating union as contained in these articles and that there is not one address from any part of the kingdom in favors of this union  i do therefore further protest against concluding this and the following articles of this treaty until hermajesty shall be fully informed of the in clinations of the people that if hermajesty think fit she may call a new parliament to have immediate sentiments of the union since the articles have been made public where it is hoped they may fall on such methods as may allay the ferment of the nation satisfy the minds of the people and create a full understanding betwixt the two kingdoms by an union upon honorable just and equal terms which may unite them in affection and interest the surest foundation of peace and tranquillity for both kingdoms and this my protestation i desire may be received and insert in the minutes and recorded in the books of parliament as a testimony of my disassent and the disassent of such as adhere to me    no m x x and a third protest was given in by the earl of buchan in these terms forasmuch as the changing of the right of the peers of this realm from a constant and hereditary right to one that is elective and the debarring all or any of them from taking place and voting in parliaments conventions or public councils is subversive of the birthright and undoubted privilege of the peers dishonorable to the whole kingdom and contrary to the fundamental laws and constitutions of it as well as to all justice and equity i do therefore protest for my self and in name of all who shall adhere to this my protestation that the foresaid right of the peers of this realm to sit and vote in all parliaments public councils and conventions do after the intended union with england and notwithstanding thereof continue in full force and remain to them as their undoubted right and property and that no vote to be passed in this house do prejudge all or any of them thereof or debar them from retaining the same in all time coming    no n x x another protest was likewise given in by walter steuart commissioner for the burgh of linlithgow in these terms i walter steuart protest for my self and in name of all others who shall adhere to this my protestation that the restriction of the representatives in parliament for this kingdom as contained in the    d article of the treaty of union is contrair to the birthright of the peers and rights and privileges of the barons freeholders and royal burrows and the fundamental laws and constitutions of this nation and if any vote shall pass approving the said article in the terms that it stands that any such vote shall not prejudge the birthright of the peers rights and privileges of the barons freeholders and royalburrows competent to them by the laws and constitution of this kingdom and takes instruments upon this protestation and desires that it may be insert in the records of parliament  no o x x the    th february   0  articles of union read that all laws and statutes in either kingdom so far as they are contrary to or inconsistent with the terms of these articles or any of them shall from and after the union cease and become void and shall be so declared to be by the respective parliaments of the said kingdoms the question was put whether this house shall agree with the committee in this resolution  it was resolved in the affirmative  i dissent to every one of the    resolutions sta  ll

thereupon is left to the judges  roch  er no  th and gr  y guil  rd le  gh   dissentient to the  th resolution because we humbly conceive the sum of   000 l to be charged on the kingdom of scotland as the quota of scotland for a land tax is not proportionable to the   d aid granted by the parliament of england but if by reason of the present circumstances of that kingdom it might have been thought it was not able to bear a greater proportion at this time yet we cannot but think it unequal to this kingdom that it should be agreed that whenever the   d aid shall be enacted by the parliament of great britain to beraised on land in england that the   000 l now raised on scotland shall never be increased in time to come though the trade of that kingdom should be extremely improved and consequently the value of their land preportionably raised which in all probability it must do when this union shall have taken effect  n  th and gr  y how  d roch  r g  ford le  h  dissentient to the   th resolution i dissent to every one of the    resolutions beau  t i dissent to the                               th resolutions abing  n because we humbly conceive nothing could have been more equal on this head of the treaty than that neither of the kingdoms should have been burdened with the debts of the other contracted before the union and if that proposal which we find once made in the minutes of the treaty had taken place there would have been no occasion to have employed the revenues of the kingdom of scotland toward the payment of the debts of england those revenues might have been strictly appropriated to the debts of that kingdom and to any other uses within themselves as should have been judged requisite and there would have been then no need of an equivalent of very near  00000 l to be raised on england within this year for the purchase of these revenues in scotland which however it may prove to be but a reasonable bargain upon a strict calculation there does not seem to have been a necessity just now to have raised so great a sum when this kingdom is already burdened with so vast ones for the necessary charges of the war  roch  r n  th and g  y l  h g  ford  dissentient to the   d resolution because we humbly conceive in the first place that the number of    peers of scotland is too great a proportion to be added to the peers of england who very rarely consists of more than  00 attending lords in any one session of parliament and for that reason we humbly apprehend such a number of    may have a very great sway in the resolutions of this house of which the consequences cannot now be foreseen  in the second place we conceive the lords of scotland who by virtue of this treaty are to sit in this house being not qualified as the peers of england are must suffer a diminution of their dignity to sit here on so different foundations their right of sitting here depending entirely on an election and that from time to time during the continuance of one parliament only and at the same time we are humbly of opinion that the peers of england who sit here by creation from the crown and have a right of so doing in themselves or their heirs by that creation for ever may find it an alteration in their constitution to have lords added to their number to sit and vote in all matters brought before a parliament who have not the same tenure of their seats in parliament as the peers of england have  n  h and gr  y buck  am le  h roch  r guil  d  die martis  o martii hodie  a vice lecta est billa entitled act for an union of the two kingdoms of

the ships and cargos now arrived at london and other ports of england humbly shows that where we under subscribing having upon the faith of the treaty of union sent from scotland to england several goods and merchandise allowed to be imported to scotland before commencment of the union and which were entered and paid her majestys duties and for which before transportation we obtained coasting cocquets a copy whereof as approven by the attorney general at london was transmitted to the lords of treasury here and delivered by them to the officers of her majestys customs upon which we had good ground to rest secure yet to our great surprise we have information that not only our ships and goods are seized but the goods themselves made havoc of and imbezzeld expressly contrair to the articles of union our seamen impressed and our ships thereby rendered useless which treatment is so unsupportable that all these promised advantages by the union are like to be so many traps to ensnare us which in end must turn to our inevitable ruin for if our effects be seized and our ships laid up and taken from us by violence where shall we have any hopes left us for trade  these our grievances we have thought fit to lay before your honors the representatives of the royal burrows in convention assembled that you in your prudence may address her majesty in such terms as the present emergent of so much import and concern to the nation does require  may it therefore please your honors seriously to consider of what we have above represented and to lay our case before her majesty  no b   a copy of the address of the royal burrows to her majesty to the queens most excellent majesty we your majestys most loyal and dutiful subjects the general convention of the royal burrows in this part of your majestys united kingdom called scotland do most humbly represent that having received several grievous complaints from the trading merchants how that they upon the faith of the late treaty of union betwixt the two kingdoms ratified in both their parliaments have from several ports of scotland sent to london and several ports in england goods and merchandise allowed to be imported to scotland and actually there imported before the union for which they not only paid your majestys duty but being resolved upon the faith of the said treaty to send them to england after due deliberation they by warrant from england received coastcocquets and other ordinary documents from your majestys commissioners of the customs lately established and did also to cut off all pretext make faith before the lords of your majestys treasury and exchequer and other judges that the goods were imported upon their own proper account and upon their own proper risque  notwithstanding whereof they have very surprising accounts from their correspondents in england that the commissioners of your majestys customs there have given orders to seize their ships and goods and that some of them are actually seized and others both seized and imbezzelled and that the best conditions they can obtain from your majestys said commissioners in england are that they should give security or bail in some cases for ship and cargo and in other cases for paying new and high duties at the determination of the british parliament all which being in our humble apprehension nothing agreeable but contrary to the faith of the said articles of treaty and a manifest disappointment of these advantages and encouragements that we still did and do firmly promise our selves from your majestys royal justice and most gracious government and with all such visible hardships as must be the loss and even the ruin of many honest traders who cannot bear their ships and goods to be thus encumbered by bail and lawsuits or double and high duties and withal subjected to the delay and hazard of uncertain determination  we cannot but in the greatest submission whereof we are capable and with a yet greater confidence of your majestys royal justice and goodness whereof we have had so great and innumerable proofs lay the case before your majesty as it is viz that by the first article of the treaty of union the two kingdoms are for ever united into one after the first of may last which plainly after that day excludes the very notion of importation or importers betwixt them and all former restrictions and penalties imposed thereupon and by the fourth article it is agreed that all the subjects of the said united kingdom shall from and after the union have full freedom and intercourse of trade to and from any port or place within the said united kingdom and that there be a communication of all other rights and privileges which do or may belong to the subjects of either kingdom by which it is plain that we have the same privilege to transport our effects notwithstanding of former restraints from one part of britain to another which your majestys subjects of berwick newcastle bristol etc do enjoy in importing now to scotland without any comptrol all such goods both of english and foreign manufacture and growth as were before the union expressly prohibit by our laws and farther by the    and last article of the said treaty it is by statute enacted that all laws and statutes in either kingdom so far as they are contrary to and inconsistent with the articles of the union shall from and after the union cease and become void whereby it evidently appears that the prohibitions and restrictions that might have been of force on either side while we were separate kingdoms are now made void and for ever to cease  being then founded upon such clear and evident grounds and yet much more upon the assuring experiences that we have always had of your majestys justice equity and unparalled goodness we do with all submission and humility beseech and obtest your majesty that you would be pleased to give such orders to your high treasurer and commissioners of customs and others in england that the aforesaid heavy and vexatious grievances may be remeded and removed that so the hearts and interests of all your good subjects may be united to your majestys satisfaction and perpetual glory  no c   the clause proposed in the english parliament to prevent the french goods being imported through scotland and whereas it is well known that in diverse foreign parts great quantities of goods and merchandises have lately been shipped and are now shipping with intention to be carried to scotland and to be imported there paying only the low duties in that kingdom before the first day of may   0  but with a manifest design to have the same brought coastwise after the said first day of may from that part of great britain now called scotland to that part of great britain now called england wales or the town of berwick upon tweed without paying the high duties which are now payable in england and which after the said first of may will be also payable in the whole united kingdom of great britain for the like goods imported there which practice if it be not timely prevented does apparently tend not only to her majestys damage in her revenue but to the ruin or impoverishment of many fair traders who have stocks of such commodities in either of the said kingdoms by giving unreasonable advantages to foreigners be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid that all goods and merchandise imported or to be imported into scotland between the first day of february to the said first of may   0  from any foreign parts beyond the sea and shall after the said first day of may be brought by sea or land into england wales or the town of berwick upon tweed unless such goods or merchandises were shipped from any such foreign parts as aforesaid for the sale account and risque of some of her majestys natural born subjects of scotland and be afterward brought from scotland to england wales or town of berwick upon tweed as aforesaid upon the like account and risque and unless such respective goods and merchandise from the time they were shipped in foreign parts till the time they were brought into england wales or berwick by the way of scotland as aforesaid did wholly and bona fide belong to some of her majestys said subjects of the kingdom of scotland as the owners thereof shall be chargeable with there shall be paid or secured for the same so much money as together with the moneys which shall have been actually paid upon the importation into scotland shall complete all the subsidies impositions and other duties which are to be paid or secured for the like goods of merchandise in case they were imported directly into england before the said first day of may  and in case such goods and merchandise be so brought in and landed before such payment made and security given as the case requires the goods so landed shall and may be seized and the same and the importers thereof be liable to such penalties and forfeitures as by the laws of england are prescribed for landing the like goods without paying or securing her majestys duties or for defrauding her majesty thereof and if any doubt or question shall arise whether the goods and merchandise so brought in or any of them were brought from foreign parts by the way of scotland for the sale account and risque of some of her majestys subjects of that kingdom within such days and times as aforesaid or were their property in such manner as aforesaid the onus probandi shall ly upon the person or persons that shall claim the said goods and merchandise and not upon the seizer informer or prosecutor  no d   the humble address of the scots merchants at london to the right honorable the lords spiritual and temporal assembled in parliament against passing the bill for laying duties upon goods which may be brought by her majestys subjects from scotland to england after the commencement of the union by the articles of union most solemnly ratified in scotland and england it is expressly declared that from and after the first of may   0  the two kingdoms shall be united into one called great britain and that all the subjects of either kingdom shall have full freedom and intercourse of trade and navigation to and from any port or place within the said united kingdom and that there shall be a communication of all other rights privileges and advantages which do or may belong to the subjects of either kingdom  it is humbly conceived that the bill now before your lordships is directly contrary to these articles of union for nothing can be a greater hinderance to the freedom and intercourse of trade than the laying such high duties on goods brought from scotland to england as are by this bill intended to be imposed on her majestys english subjects and the scots residing here whereby they are deprived of their just right of bringing goods from scotland to england by transire duty free which is plainly granted to them by the fourth article of union etc  the exception in this bill pretended to be in favor of the natives of scotland residing there destroys their privileges also because it only allows them to bring such goods duty free into england after the union commences as have been before that time laden beyond seas and imported into scotland on their own accounts but not to bring any such as they have bought or may buy at their own markets whereby this retrospect bill will stop the circulation of trade and entail ruin on all the traders in scotland by confining such quantities of goods to that part of great britain as will exceed the consumption thereof  the scots being also hindered by this bill from bringing duty free unto england goods imported into scotland before the first of may whereof they have not been the sole proprietors from the time they were first shipped off beyond seas for scotland until brought into england they will be prevented from bringing their own parts of any goods wherein the english had any share at the time of importation into scotland  and a particular hardship to the scots the bill imposes on them the unsupportable onus probandi whereby they will be obliged to prove their sole property from the time of buying the goods beyond seas to their arrival in england in order whereto their factors mariners coopers warehousekeepers porters and a great number of other servants must be all produced together at the exchequer bar and all maintained during their voyages and journeys and abode in london so that the evidence necessary on this occasion will cost at least  00 l sterling for each parcel of goods besides all the delay and vexation of a tedious course of law and the severe penalties in case they should by one neglect or misfortune fail in the least particular of an absolute proof  this bill will not answer the proposed end of advancing her majestys revenues but seems to be founded on mistaken notions of trade since after the union commences the disadvantages or conveniences to great britain will be equal whether the goods then in scotland remain and be consumed in that or any other part of the united kingdom  the allowances granted in some articles of the union whereby the regulation of minute circumstances is left to the parliament of great britain seems to be an unanswerable argument that where no such liberty is given even the parliament of great britain was not intended to have the power of making any alterations or regulations and as the last article of the union confirms the whole by repealing all laws in either kingdom which are contrary to the articles this bill if it should pass into an act and all other laws being inconsistent with the articles of any of them will as it is humbly conceived be void after the first of may  this bill differs little from the former sent up to your lordships last session which your lordships did not then think fit to pass  therefore it is hoped that your lordships will not pass this bill being as is humbly conceived more injurious than the former and which can only serve to advance distinctions and animosities between the subjects of scotland and england and prevent that union of hearts which her majesty so graciously recommended from the throne   note this bill is unnecessary in reference to foreigners who can have no benefit nor share in the communication of trade and privileges mentioned in the  th article of union the same being thereby prudently restricted to the subjects of both kingdoms  no e   observations upon the fourth article of union i equity and reason places the subjects of the same kingdom on equal foot when they are cemented together in affection laws trade and interest this will be the case after the union when agreements on each side are fulfilled but when england and scotland were separate they who submitted proposed the terms and equivalents of an union and when these are granted and agreed should be honorably maintained with the greatest nicety and favorable interpretation to the weakest the reputation of england abroad is founded on the stability of their treaties ss much as on the strength of their arms treasure or constitution  with the same strength of reason and equity may the scots desire that englishmen since february last should be subject to the onus probandi for goods in their possession imported by foreigners or for account of foreigners under covert  by the same rule of reason that the english require an augmentation of duties on goods imported into england may the scots desire that goods in england should be taxed with scots duties and then both kingdoms would be on equal terms  the establishment of the union was a communicatory contract agreed and fixed by persons equal in knowledge and freedom of will the matter in debate was proposed argued and covenanted afterward confirmed in the most solemn and authentic manner by the parliaments of both kingdoms and cannot now legally and in a decent or friendly manner be touched or amended in any oint but by the parliament of great britain who are the competent judges of the rights privileges and conveniences of the united kingdoms when the general good safety and interest of the whole will with it is natural weight sway the balance of equity when england will have no reason to repine at any accidental advantage which scotland may get by the union at it is commencement since it will not only enable but encourage that part of the united kingdom to undergo with cheerfulness their future restrictions and taxes  ii to the second reason the answer is plainly obvious that the sixth seventh fifteenth and eighteenth articles of the union were consented to by scotland in consideration of an equivalent and the sense of the commissioners on the point of customs is more fully explained in the fourteenth article of union viz that the kingdom of scotland shall not be charged with any duties laid on by the parliament of england before the union except these consented to in this treaty  certainly the scots never expected that in the interval between the ratification of the articles and the commencement of the union the parliament of england would have laid the onus probandi upon the subjects of scotland and for a time so far backward nor that a greater proof for the property of goods should be required from the subjects of scotland than what is stipulated for justifying their interest in shipping by the fifth article of union by which they are free from all perplexing trials at the exchequer bar and are treated therein as friends and men of probity by referring the proof of their interest to their proper oath to be taken in the port next to the abode of the owner this shows that the scots never would have consented to undergo the onus probandi in england for any goods in their possession belonging to them at or before the union  it was absolutely impossible to attain this union without a free communication of trade and in consequence as absolutely impossible to hinder the scots from trading as scotsmen in their own kingdom until the union commences or from trading afterward as britains when the union takes place to deny them the first privilege is to take away their birthright and to debar them from the latter advantage would be a grievous detriment and a sensible injury because it touches their property at present and weakens their hopes of advantage in future by the union at least it will make them think their title precarious and uncertain  after the first of may   0  when the union is to commence the goods then brought from scotland to england and vice versa cannot in any sense be said to be either exported or imported seeing whether by land or water they will only be carried from one place to another within the same kingdom and therefore this matter can no ways be comprehended under the sixth article  iii to the third reason that the fair traders of england will be great sufferers etc it may be answered that a certain sort of fair traders commonly distinguished by the character of wellmeaning f  s are greater sufferers daily by the cunning contrivances of stockjobbers and other overreaching practices in commerce they would not censure a man who can take up money at   per cent from private persons and at the same time can lend it to the government at   per cent if by the fair traders be meant the wine merchants or vintners those who know their method of management will admire how they have gained this character allowing it however to them for once in complaisance their damage will be as soon forgot as the loss of a ship is on the exchange and their loss will be recompensed by a public advantage which happens but once and will be of very short continuance the nobility and gentry of england may drink the queens health and prosperity to the union in a glass of claret at   s   d per quart on which the best of the nation saves   s seeing the vintner sells his mixed liquor at   s   d the scots merchant or importer from scotland cannot gain nor save by his sale one fourth part of what the english nation does and the proportion will hold the same upon whatever quantities of goods are imported from scotland if it were possible to the value of a million of money the nation of england in this time of jubilee will be by far the greatest gainer if the sole profit redounds wholly to the scots merchants or to the importers from scotland then the price of goods will be kept at their present height and the fair traders of england cannot lose by the stocks of goods now on their hands  iv that the revenue of the customs will be very much diminished may be answered that this is not a real loss but accidental and imaginary for without the union and freedom of commerce those goods would not have been imported and i am persuaded the queen would rather lose the value of the goods imported than suffer the foundation of the union to be undermined or her subjects in scotland to undergo hardships from which in virtue of this union they may so reasonably expect an exemption and i believe all her majestys friends and wellwishers to great britain will cordially praise her sentiments and readily concur in suspecting the assertions of some gentlemen as to the quantities of goods expected from scotland these very persons would not be afraid of finding money in a days time to purchase the whole at prime cost and to put themselves in place of the scots then they would cry up the union as sacred as the firmest foundation of our constitution and would severely censure the least encroachment  v to the fifth and most important reason the promoters of the bill are great men in their way but in comparison with great britain like two drops of water to the ocean and in their greatest splendor are only valuable so far as they are useful to the common good it is humbly conceived every prudent man will conclude it is better to let a few men grumble than to disgust a kingdom and the best of queens by endangering the constitution of great britain  no f   commission and proclamation naming justices of peace within scotland anne by

scots to sue to us who are superiors in the field and masters of a great part of their realm yet that our charitable mind and brotherly love might be known we do by all means possible provoke and call you to your own commodity and profit as the father does the son or the elder brother the younger  and invite you to amity and equality because as we inhabit in the same island there is no people so like one another in manners customs and language  but because some object that we dont seek equality nor the marriage but a conquest and that we would not be friends but lords although our proclamation at the last wars did enough declare the contrary yet here we declare to you and all christian people to be the kings majestys mind our masters by our advice and counsel not to conquer but to have in amity not to win by force but to conciliate by love not to spoil and kill but to save and keep not to dissever and divorce but to join in marriage from high to low both the realms to make of one isle one realm in love amity concord peace and charity  we offer love we offer equality and amity we overcome in war and offer peace we win holds and offer no conquest we get in your land and offer england  what can be more offered and more proffered than intercourse of merchandises and interchange of marriages the abolishing of all such our laws as prohibit the same or might be impediment to the mutual amity we have offered not only to leave the authority name title right or challenge of conqueror but to receive that which is the shame of men overcome to leave the name of the nation and the glory of any victory if any we have had or should have of you and to take the indifferent old name of britains again because nothing should be left on our part to be offered nothing on your part unrefused whereby ye might be inexcusable  what face has this of conquest we intend not to disherit your queen but to make her heirs inheritors also of england we seek not to take from you your laws nor customs but we seek to redress your oppression which of diverse ye do sustain in the realm of england diverse laws and customs be according to the ancient usage thereof and likewise france normandy and gascoigne have sundry kind of orders have all the realms and dominions that the emperor now has one custom and one sort of laws these vain fears and fantasies of expulsion of your nation of changing of the laws of making a conquest be driven into your heads by those who indeed had rather you were all conquered spoiled and slain than they would lose any point of their will of their desire of rule and of their estimation which they know in quietness would be seen what it were as it were in a calm water  if we two being made one by amity be most able to defend us against all nations and having the sea for the wall mutual love for garrison and god for defense should make so noble and well agreeing monarchy that neither in peace we may be ashamed nor in war afraid of any worldly or foreign power why should not you be as desireous of the same and have as much cause to rejoice at it as we  and for a more sure proof and plainer token of the good mind and will which we bear unto you that which never yet was granted to scotland in any league truce or peace betwixt england and scotland because ye shall have proof of the beginning of love and amity of both the realms the kings highness considering the multitude of them which are come to his majestys devotion and of them that be wellwillers and aiders of this godly enterprise has by our advice and counsel granted and by these presents does grant that from henceforth all manner of merchants and other scotsmen who will enter their names with one of the wardens of the marches and there profess to take part with us in this before named godly purpose may lawfully and without any trouble and vexation enter into any port creek or haven of england and there use their traffic of merchandise buy and sell bring in the commodities of scotland and take and carry forth the commodities of england as liberally and as freely and with the same and none other customs therefore than englishmen and the kings subjects do at this present holinshed history of england vol iii p      no    the commissioners being met at westminster the chief things debated on were   whether the two kingdoms should be united under the name of great britain and   whether both nations should be equally capable of honors and offices in either kingdom some advanced against the first that it was without all example that two kingdoms equally supreme should lay aside their former names for a third new one nor could the name of great britain be so honorable as the several names and pluralities of kingdoms thus tho castile leon and arragon be united under the subjection of the king of spain and france and navarr under the french yet these kings alwise in their designations mention the several kingdoms they command  others alleged this ruight prejudice the precedence of the kings of england among other princes as being but a new one but for all that we find in history that this is no new thing and in particular livy reports that the trojans and aborigines did after the union of their nations assume the common name of latins thus the hungarians derived their name from the huni and avari morden in his geography mentions the authors from whence we have it the catalonians from the catti and albani the counties in germany use that common name and that only is called feudum novum which is acquired by money donation or conquest and that feudum antiquum which descends by blood and succession  when the   d question came under debate some of the commissioners agreed it was unreasonable the scots should be admitted to and made capable of all the employments in england to this it was answered that to refuse it would continue the ancient grudge and enmity for the romans were never engaged in a sharper war than in the bellum sociale which the latins raised against them because they would not admit them to be consuls after they were united  vide livy plutarch florus etc after which the romans did by their own law declare that inter concives and municipes omnia munera debent esse communicata municipes enim sunt qui pariter minera publica suscipiunt and polybins in lib   speaking of the method whereby the achaeans established their happy union read also plutarch observes it to have been by this means  this privilege has been allowed the scots in france for the earl of buchan was made constable by chapter the  th because he defeated the duke of charence douglass was made duke of turaine aubigney vice roy of naples count lesly was preferred lately to be an earl of the empire and still in the emperial dyets in england william of malmsbury confesses three scotsmen were successively created archbishops of tork and the earl of forth was in the late wars the successful general of the english army  king james thought this debate encroachd upon his prerogative and therefore desired it might go no further that tho by his prerogative he might employ natives of either kingdom as he pleased yet he would prefer the subjects of the respective kingdoms in their native countries till mutual education and a lasting union had fitted them to be indifferently employed upon which assurance all the commissioners rested and so they proceeded to put these conclusions in form and the articles agreed upon were these  it is agreed by the commissioners of e and s to be mutually proposed to the parliaments of both realms at the next session that all hostile laws made and conceived expressly either by e against s or s against e shall in the next sessions be abrogated and utterly extinguished  it is also agreed that all laws customs and treaties of the border betwixt england and scotland shall be declared by a general act to be abrogated and obliterated and that the subjects on either part shall be governed by the laws and statutes of the kingdoms where they dwell and the name of the borders extinguished  and because by abolishing the borderlaws and customs it may be doubted that the executions shall cease upon these sentences that have heretofore been given by the opposite officers of those borders upon wrongs committed before the death of the late queen of happy memory it is therefore thought fit that in case the commissioners or officers to be appointed by his majesty before the time of the next sessions of parliament shall not procure sufficient redress of such fyled bills and sentences that then the said parliament may be moved to take such order as to their wisdoms shall seem convenient in satisfaction of that which has been decerned by some officers as also how disorders and insolences may be hereafter repressed and the country which was lately of the borders kept in peace and quietness in time to come as likewise to prescribe some orders how the pursuits of former wrongs preceding the death of the late queen and since the last treaty of the borders in the years      and      which have never as yet been moved may be continued and prosecuted to a definitive sentence  and forasmuch as the next degree to the abolition of all memory of hostility is the participation of mutual commodities and commerce it is agreed first concerning importation of merchandise into either realm from foreign parts that whereas certain commodities are wholly prohibited by the several laws of both realms to be brought into either of them by the natives themselves or by any other the said prohibitions shall now be made mutual to both and neither an englishman bring into scotland or a scotsman into england any of these prohibited wares and commodities nevertheless if the said commodities be made in scotland it shall be lawful to bring them out of scotland to england and so reciprocally of the commodities made in england and carried to scotland  whereas a doubt has been conceived against the equal communication of trade betwixt the english and scots subjects in the matter of importation grounded upon some inequality of privileges which the scots are reported to have in foreign parts and namely in france above the english whereby the english might be prejudged and that after a deliberate consideration had of the supposed inequalities both private and public examination of diverse merchants of either side touching all liberties privileges immunities imposts and payments on the part of the english and on the part of the scots either at bourdeaux for their trade of wines or in normandy or any other parts of france for other commodities it appeared that in the trade of bourdeaux there was and is so little difference in any advantage of privileges or immunities or in the imposts and payments all being reckoned and well weighed on either side as it could not justly hinder the communication of trade in the trade of normandy likewise or any other parts of france the advantage the scots subjects by their privileges are acknowledged to have is such as without much difficulty may be reconciled and reduced to an equality with the english by such means as are hereafter declared it is agreed that the scotsmen shall be free for transporting of wine from bourdeaux to england paying the same customs and duties that the englishmen do pay and the englishmen likewise shall be free for transporting wine and other commodities from bourdeaux to scotland paying the same customs and duties that the scotsmen do pay there  and likewise for clearing and resolving the doubts touching the advantage that these scots are supposed to have above the english in buying and transporting the commodities of normandy and other parts of the kingdom of france excepting the buying of wine in bourdeaux which is already determined it is agreed that there shall be sent some meet and discreet persons into france two for either side to take notice of any such advantage as either the english have above the scots or the scots above the english in buying or transporting of any commodities of normandy or any parts of france excepting the wine of bourdeaux and as the said persons shall find the advantage to be so for making the trade equal the customs shall be advanced to the king in england and scotland and for the part of these that have the advantage and according to the proportion of the said advantage the advancement of the custom to continue no longer than the privilege having such advantage shall continue and that generally for all other trade from any parts the english and scots subjects each in others country shall have liberty of importation as freely as any of the native subjects themselves having special privilege  next concerning exportation it is agreed that all such goods as are prohibited and forbidden to englishmen themselves to be exported out of england to any foreign part the same shall be unlawful for any scotsman or any other to export to any foreign nation beyond sea under the same penalties and forfeitures that the english are subject unto and reciprocally that forth of scotland no english man shall transport to any foreign parts the goods and commodities that are prohibited in scotland to scots men themselves nevertheless such goods and commodities and merchandises as are licensed to english men to transport out of england to any foreign part the same may be likewise transported by scots men thither they certifying their going into foreign parts and taking a cocquet accordingly and paying the ordinary custom that english men do pay themselves at the exportation of such wares the like liberty to be for english men in scotland  as for the native commodities which either of the countries do yield and may serve for the use and benefit of the other it is agreed that mutually there may be transported forth of e to s and forth of s to e all such wares as are either of the growth or handywork of either of the said realms without payment of any impost custom or exaction and as freely in all respects as any wares may be transported either in england from part to part or in scotland from part to part except such particular sorts of goods and merchandises as are hereafter mentioned being restrained for the proper and inward use of each country and for that purpose it is declared that both in this communication of benefit and participation of the native commodities of the one country with the other there shall be specially reserved and excepted the sorts hereafter specified that is to say wool sheep sheepfell cattle leather hides and linenyarn which are specially restrained within each country not to be transported from one to the other excepting also and reserving to the scots men their trade of fishing within the lochs firths and bays within land and in the seas within    miles of the coasts of the realm of scotland where neither englishmen nor any strangers have used to fish and so reciprocally on the behalf of england all which restrictions and exceptions are not to be understood or mentioned in any sort for a mark or note of separation and division but only as matters of policy and convenience for the several estates of each country  furthermore it is agreed that all foreign wares to be transported forth of scotland into england or out of england into scotland by any of the kings subjects of either kingdoms having at their first entry once paid custom in either of the kingdoms shall not pay outward customs therein afterward save only inward custom at the port whereunto they shall be transported but the owner of the goods or factor or master of the ship shall give bond not to transport the same into any foreign parts  it is also agreed that scotsmen shall not be debarred from being associates unto any english company of merchants as merchantventurers or others upon such conditions as any englishman may be admitted and so reciprocally for english men in scotland  it is nevertheless agreed by mutual consent and is so to be understood that the mutual liberty aforesaid of exportation and trade in each part from the one to the other shall serve for the inward use only of either reahn and order taken for the restraining and prohibiting the transportation of the said commodities to foreign parts and for due punishment of those that shall transgress in that behalf and for the better assurance and caution herein it is agreed that every merchant so offending shall forfeit his goods the ships wherein the said goods shall be transported confiscated the customers searchers and other officers of the custom whatsoever in case of consent or knowledge on their part to lose their offices and goods and their bodies to be imprisoned at his majestys pleasure of which escheats and forfeitures two parts shall appertain to his majesty if the customs be unfarmd and the third to the informer and if the customs be farmed one third of the forfeiture to belong to his majesty a third to the farmer and the other third to the informer the trial of the offense to be summar in either country in the exchequer chamber by writ sufficient witnesses or oath of party or before the justice by jury or assize and his majestys officers in either country to concur with the complainers that insist in the pursuit  as also for the more security that there shall be no transportation of such goods it is agreed that at the shipping of all such native commodities there be taken by the customer of the port where the goods or wares are embarked a bond or obligation subscribed by the owner of the goods and master of the ship by the owner if he be present or by the master of the ship or factor or party that loadeth the same in case of his absence which bond shall contain a sum of money answerable to the value of the goods with condition of relieving the party obliged and discharging him of the said bond in case return be made of a due certificate to the custom where the goods were laden from any port within england or scotland and the certificate to be subscribed and sealed by the officers of the customs of the port where the said goods shall arrive to be unladen or if there be no such officers there by the chief magistrate and town clerk of that harbor and town under their hand and seal and it is further agreed touching the different fraighting of commodities either in english or scots bottoms that englishmen and scots men freight and laden their goods each in others ships and bottoms indifferently paying only english and scots custom notwithstanding any contrary laws or prohibitions and that a proposition be made to the parliament of england for establishing some good orders for upholding and maintaining the great fishing of england as also that a proposition be made to the parliament of scotland for making of their shipping more proportionable in burden to the shipping of england the better to serve for the equality of trade and a common defense for the whole isle  and because it is requisite that the mutual communication aforesaid be not only extended to the matter of commerce but to all other benefits and privileges of natural born subjects it is agreed that an act be proponed to be passed in manner following that all the subjects of both realms born since the decease of the late queen and that shall be born hereafter under the obedience of his majesty or his royal progeny are by the common laws of both realms and shall be for ever enabled to obtain succeed inherit and possess all goods lands and chattels honors dignities offices liberties and privileges and benefices ecclesiastic or civil in parliament and all other places of the kingdoms and every one of the same in all respects and without any exception whatsomever as fully and amply as the subjects of either realm respectively might have done or may do in any sort within the kingdom where they are born  further his majesty out of his great judgment and providence has not only professed in public and private speech to the nobility and council of both kingdoms but has also vouchsafed to be contented that for a more full satisfaction and comfort of all his loving subjects it may be comprised in the said act that his majesty means not to confer any office of the crown any office of judicature place voice or office in parliament of either kingdom upon the subjects of the other born before the death of the late queen until time and conversation have increased and accomplished an union of the said kingdoms as well in the hearts of all the people and in the conformity of laws and policies in these kingdoms as in the knowledge and sufficiency of particular men who being untimely employed in such authorities could no way be able much less acceptable to discharge such duties belonging to them it is therefore resolved by us the commissioners aforesaid not only in regard of our desires and endeavors to further a speedy conclusion of this happy work intended but also as a testimony of our love and thankfulness for his gracious promise on whose sincerity and benignity we build our full assurance even according to the inward sense and feeling of our own loyal and hearty affections to obey and please him in all things worthy the subjects of so worthy a sovereign that it shall be desired of both the parliaments to be enacted by their authority that all the subjects of both realms born before the decease of the late queen may be enabled and made capable to acquire purchase inherit succeed use and dispose of all lands goods inheritances offices honors dignities liberties privileges immunities benefices and preferments whatsoever each subject in either kingdom with the same freedom and as lawfully and peaceably as the very natural and born subjects of either realm where the said rights estates or profits are established notwithstanding whatsoever law statute or former constitution heretofore in force to the contrary other than to acquire possess succeed or inherit any office of the crown office of judicatory or any voice place or office in parliament all which shall remain free from being claimed held or enjoyed by the subjects of the one kingdom within the other born before the decease of the late queen notwithstanding any words sense or interpretation of the act or any circumstance thereupon depending until there be a perfect and full accomplishment of the union as is desired mutually by both the realms in all which points of reservation either in recital of the words his majestys sacred promise or in any clause or sentence before specified from enabling them to any of the foresaid places or dignities it has been and ever shall be so far from the thoughts of any of us to presume to alter or impair his majestys prerogative royal who contrariwise do with all comfort and confidence depend herein upon the gracious assurance which his majesty is pleased to give in the declaration of his so just and princely care and favor to all his people as for a further laying open of our clear and dutiful intentions toward his majesty in this and in all things else which may concern his prerogative we do also herein profess and declare that we think it fit there be inserted in the act to be proponed and passed in express terms a sufficient reservation of his majestys prerogative royal to denizate enable and prefer to such offices honors dignities and benefices whatsoever in both the said kingdoms and either of them as are heretofore excepted in the preceding reservation of all english and scots subjects born before the decease of the late queen as freely soveraignly and absolutely as any of his majestys royal progenitors kings of england or scotland might have done at any time heretofore and to all other intents and purposes in as ample manner as if no such act had been thought of or mentioned  and forasmuch as the several jurisdictions and administrations of either realm may be abused by malefactors by their own impunity if they shall commit any offense in the one realm and afterward remove their persons and abode into the other it is agreed that there may be some fit course advised of by the wisdoms of the parliaments for trial and proceeding against the persons of offenders remaining in the one realm for and concerning the crimes and faults committed in the other realm and yet nevertheless that it may be lawful for the justice of the realm where the offense is committed to remand the offender remaining in the other realm to be answerable to the justice of the same realm where the fact was committed and that upon such remand made the offender shall be accordingly delivered and all further proceedings if any be in the other realm shall cease so as it may be done without prejudice to his majesty or other lords in their escheats and forfeitures with provision nevertheless that this be not thought necessary to be made for all criminal offenses but in special cases only as namely in the cases of wilful murder falsifying of moneys and forging of deeds instruments and writings and such other like cases as upon further advice in the said parliament may be thought fit to be added    no    a paper given in by the scots commissioners to the english commissioners for adjusting the differences of trade between the two kingdoms jan         we the commissioners of and for the kingdom of scotland nominated and sufficiently authorized by his majesty under his great seal of that kingdom to treat and consult as also to conclude and determine with your lordships the commissioners nominated by his majesty for the kingdom of england of and concerning the freedom and liberty of trade between the two kingdoms of england and scotland do represent that whereas his majestys subjects of scotland be under the alledgeance of the king since the happy succession of k james to the crown of england are so far from being aliens that they are declared to have by the law of this kingdom all the privileges of natural born subjects of england and whereas his majestys subjects in scotland have enjoyed the same in all the dominions and plantations belonging to the kingdom of england more than    years without any considerable obstruction all that time yet since the    of march in the    year of his majestys reign by some acts of parliament here in england the kings subjects of scotland are clearly debarred from the privilege granted to all his majestys other subjects seeing by these acts several immunities and privileges granted to such ships as do truly and without fraud belong only to the people of england or ireland dominion of wales or town of berwick upon tweed and all other ships and vessels without any exception with all their goods and merchandises are declared to be forefaulted also by other acts of parliament since that time goods and commodities of scotland are at some times charged with a double duty or imposition above    times more than the goods of the like nature of foreign growth and some unusual customs are exacted in northumberland and cumberland  in order to the removing of all obstructions to the freedom and liberty of trade between the two kingdoms to the end the people of scotland may be encouraged to trade here as formerly and to export from the kingdom such foreign and other commodities as are necessary for them which we conceive to be a great advantage to this kingdom the exported commodities far exceeding these imported hither for encouraging the shipping and seamen of scotland without which trade cannot be continued and for preventing the removal of the trade of scotland into foreign parts which would be very prejudicial to his majestys customs in this kingdom as we conceive and to the happy union and correspondence of the two kingdoms which we do above all things endeavor to preserve  we do begin with that which was   st in time and indeed of the greatest importance to scotland an act entitled an act for the encouraging and increasing shipping and navigation passed in the    year of his majestys reign and ratified confirmed and enacted in the    year cap   0 in relation to which act we desire   st that as to the trade with the lands islands plantations and territories to his majesty belonging or in his possession or which may thereafter belong unto or be in the possession of his majesty his heirs or successors in asia africa or america the same freedom may be allowed to such ships and vessels as do truly and without fraud belong to the people of scotland whereof the master and three  th parts are scotsmen or other his majestys subjects and fraighted only by his majestys subjects as are allowed to his majestys subjects of ireland dominion of wales and berwick upon tweed    that it be declared that his majestys subjects of scotland are not meaned to be debarred by the clause debarring men or persons not born within the alledgeance of our sovereign lord the king from exercising the trade or occupation of merchants or factors in any of the said places    that the ships or vessels belonging truly to his majestys subjects of scotland navigated as is before expressed and fraighted only by his majestys subjects may be declared to have liberty to bring into england the goods and commodities that are of foreign growth production or manufactory under the same restrictions and limitations as are expressed ever since king james came to england is of absolute necessity for entertaining the shipping of scotland and keeping the samen there for his majestys service and will be an increase of his majestys customs    that all other privileges granted by this act to the ships and vessels belonging truly to the subjects of ireland wales and town of berwick upon tweed may be also declared to belong to the ships or vessels truly belonging to the subjects of scotland and navigated and fraighted as is aforesaid under the same restrictions and limitations alwise as by this act laid upon the subjects of ireland etc that it may be declared that the penalties imposed upon aliens for transporting of goods from ports to ports and all other penalties imposed upon aliens by this act that the subjects of scotland are no ways therein concerned    that whereas almost all the ships and vessels belonging to his majestys subjects of scotland were during the late usurpation taken burnt or destroyed and many of the vessels taken or bought since his majestys happy return are foreign built we desire that all vessels taken from the kings enemies and condemned as lawful prize may be declared naturalized as is lately done here and that they and all such ships as are truly in the possession of his majestys subjects of scotland may be declared capable of free trade here as if they had been built within his majestys dominions a list of such ships being entered betwixt and a day to be agreed upon into the customhouse books here provided that it shall not be lawful for scotsmen to trade here with any foreign built ships to be bought hereafter but only with such ships as are built in scotland or some other of his majestys dominions and that both the prizeships and other ships now in the possession of the subjects of scotland be navigated by   parts of   of scotsmen or others his majestys subjects and fraighted only by his majestys subjects    and whereas it may be supposed that by demanding such a trade with the plantations as is allowed to the subjects of ireland we may prejudge his majestys customs here or destroy the ends of the act of navigation as to these commodities we declare that we are willing to treat and conclude with your lordships upon such assurances as can be reasonably demanded that none of these commodities shall be transported by scots ships from the english plantations to any place beyond the seas but they shall be wholly brought into such parts of england as shall be agreed upon excepting only such a very small number for the consumption of scotland as shall be agreed upon betwixt your lordships and us  no    journal of the meeting held in the council

indissoluble union between the two nations which her majesty thinks the most likely means under heaven to establish the monarchy secure the peace and increase the trade wealth and happiness of both

their lordships agree to the proposition in general reserving to their future consideration such proposals as shall be offered to make it practicable  my lord duke of quensberry moved that since they had given their lordships a full answer to the proposals offered by them at their preceding meeting and have only received their lordships answer to two of the three articles proposed by them that nothing should be entered by the secretarys in their books till they have an answer to their third article about the communication of trade which was agreed to  and then they adjourned to monday the

mutual communication of trade and other privileges and advantages and if your lordships do acquiesce and consent to the communication of trade in these terms the lords commissioners for scotland do consent that the answer and this addition be entered in the respective books and journals  the lords commissioners for england withdrew to consider this and returning within a little the lord keeper offered what follows which was read  their lordships conceive that the union cannot be complete till the terms are adjusted upon which it is to be constituted and therefore tho they allow the communication of trade and other privileges to be the necessary result of a complete union yet in the method of proceeding they must first settle with your lordships the terms and conditions of the communication of trade and other privileges and they are ready to enter upon the consideration of them in such a method as shall be agreeed on and most likely to bring this particular matter to a

payment of their debts or if an equality be thought necessary that there be allowed to scotland an equivalent   that the former proposals are made without prejudice to the companies or manufactories of either kingdom which are reserved to further consideration in the progress of this treaty   the lords commissioners for england took these proposals to consideration  resolved that the former

business since the last meeting they had not prepared answers to the proposals then offered by them but that they should endeavor to have them ready against the next  he also acquainted their lordships that her majesty designs to honor this meeting with her presence and moved that the proposals made on either side since the commencement of the treaty and the resolutions taken thereupon should be read over to her majesty  within a little her majesty came in and being set in her chamber spoke to the lords commissioners to this purpose my lords  i am fully persuaded that the union of the two kingdoms will prove the happiness of both and render this island more formidable than it has been in past ages that i wish this treaty may be brought to a good and speedy conclusion i am come to know what progress you have made in it and i do assure you nothing shall be wanting on my part to bring it to perfection    the lord keeper told her majesty that what was then under consideration was some proposals offered on the part of their lordships for scotland about trade to which they had not yet prepared an answer but desired to know if her majesty would hear read the proposals formerly given on either side and the resolutions taken thereupon which her majesty allowed  after reading whereof her majesty went away and the commissioners adjourned to the   th instant  die mercurii   th december   0  the commissioners met and the lord keeper in name of the english commissioners gave in the following paper to the lords commissioners for scotland which was read as follows  some considerations of the lords commissioners for england upon the proposals delivered by the lords commissioners for scotland on the  th instant to be proposed as the subject matter of debate between the lords commissioners of both kingdoms  as to the first article their lordships are of opinion that there be a free trade between the two kingdoms for the native commodities of the growth product or manufactory of the respective countries with an exception of wool sheep and sheep fells and without any distinction or imposition other than equal duties upon the home consumption respectively their lordships being of opinion that the trade between the two kingdoms cannot be upon an equal foot unless the said duties and impositions be the same in scotland as in england  and this article respecting a coasttrade it seems reasonable for their lordships to insist that the master mariner and goods should be under the same securities penalties and regulations as are in that case provided by the laws in england  as to the   d article it seems reasonable but their lordships offer that it will be necessary therein to add a provision that not only the impositions on trade but the prohibitions be the same on both sides in respect as well of importations as exportations  as to the   d article their lordships say that the plantations are the property of english men and that this trade is of so great a consequence and so beneficial as not to be communicated as is proposed till all other particulars which shall be thought necessary to this union be adjusted and as the case now stands by law no european goods can be carried to the english plantations but what have been first landed in england except salt irish and scots provisions servants and horses madera wine and wine of the azores nor can the product of the plantations be carried to other parts of europe till it be first landed in england their lordships further offer that in this article it will be necessary to make provision that the subjects of scotland shall be liable to be pressed for the sea in the same manner as the english subjects are in time of war for her majestys service  as to the   th article their lordships agree that an act of navigation must be granted in both kingdoms adapted to the terms of the union  as to the   th article their lordships say that the proposals thereincontained seems to contradict what was granted by the   d article in as much as there is no duty subsisting on trade excepting only on some funds for the civil government but what is appropriated to the payment of the debts of the nation that tho the said debts have been contracted by a long war entered into more particularly for the preservation of england and the dominions thereto belonging yet that scotland has tasted of the benefits which have accrued to great britain in general from the opposition that has been made to the growth and power of france that such burdens will be abundantly recompensed to scotland by a complete union to which complete union as a free communication of trade is essential so such a free communication of trade cannot be established with equality unless the same duties both upon foreign trade and home consumption be levied on both kingdoms but how the sums of money thereby arising within the said realm shall be applied or what equivalent is to be allowed in the room thereof may be settled when your lordships are ready to offer what proportion of the public burdens scotland proposes to bear toward the future support of the government both in times of peace and war  as to the   th article their lordships say that it requires to be further explained before they can be ready to give any answer to it  after giving in the above proposals in answer to the last proposal made by scotland the english desired a day for a conference on both might be appointed which was accordingly appointed on saturday next  die saturni    th december   0  the commissioners on both sides had a full conference upon the subject of the communication of trade in the foresaids proposals and answers which was very amicable and their lordships for england agreed to all the proposals made by their lordships for scotland and a committee was appointed to draw up the resolutions taken thereupon to be offered at their next meeting on wednesday the    instant  die mercurii    d december   0  the committee having met to draw up the result of the conference of the   th instant to have been this day presented to the general meeting and there not being a quorum of the english they adjourned to the   th instant  die martis   th december   0  a quorum of the scots commissioners being met at the usual place of meeting and there not being a quorum of the english they adjourned to the  0 instant  these frequent disappointments seeming to denote an indifferency on the part of the english the scots began to signify their impatience so as severals of them threatened to return to scotland  die mercurii  0 december   0  the commissioners met and at their taking their places the lord keeper said their lordships of england had taken notice of the publishing of some of their proceedings in the flyingpost which they thought not convenient and therefore had ordered their secretary not to give out any copies of their proceedings and desired their lordships for scotland would do the like which was agreed to and then  the lord keeper offered a paper containing the result of the last conference in the proposals made by the lords commissioners for scotland about trade and the duke of queensberry offered another which were both read the english in the following terms  agreed by the lords commissioners of both kingdoms in the terms of the preliminaries and to take effect when the union shall be completed   that there be a free trade between all the subjects of the island of great britain without any distinction in the same manner as is now practiced from one part of england to another and that the masters mariners and goods be under the same securities and penalties in the coastingtrade   that both kingdoms be under the same regulations and prohibitions and liable to equal impositions for importation and exportation and upon the home consumption and that a book of rates be adjusted for both   that the subjects of both kingdoms and their seamen and shipping have equal freedom of trade and commerce to and from the plantations under such and the same regulations and restrictions as are and will be necessary for preserving the said trade of great britain and that the seamen of scotland be equally liable to the public service as the seamen of england now are   that such laws part or parts of the act of navigation or of any other law now in force in either kingdom as shall be contrary to or inconsistent with the union shall be on both sides repealed   the paper offered by the scots differed only materially from this in that in the second article the words and upon the home consumpt were left out and so need not to be inserted  after reading of which the scots commissioners withdrew and returning within a little the duke of queensberry told their lordships for england that they had taken notice of some things in the paper offered by their lordships which did not seem properly to fall under the head of trade as the duties on home consumpt the english insisted that it did so it was moved that there should be a conference on this matter saturday next  die saturni januar     0   at the conference the following articles were agreed on and ordered to be insert in the journals the english having been satisfied that the imposition on home consumpt should be reserved to a conference at next meeting which was appointed to be upon monday thereafter  agreed by the lords commissioners for both kingdoms in the terms of the preliminaries and to take place when the union shall be completed   that there be a free trade between all the subjects of the island of great britain without any distinction in the same manner as is now practiced from one part of england to another and that the masters mariners and goods be under the same securities and penalties in the coasting trade   that both kingdoms be under the same regulations and prohibitions and liable to equal impositions for importation and exportation and that a book of rates be adjusted for both   that the subjects of both kingdoms and their seamen and shipping have equal freedom of trade and commerce to and from the plantations under such and the same regulations and restrictions as are and will be necessary for preserving the said trade of great britain and that the seamen of scotland be equally liable to the public service as the seamen of england now are   such laws part or parts of the act of navigation or of any other law now in force in either kingdom as shall be contrary to or inconfistent with the terms of the union shall be on both sides repealed and that an act of navigation be framed and adapted to the terms of the union   die lunae   januar   0   the lords commissioners and from scotland being met there not being a quorum of the english they adjourned to the  th instant and upon the like disappointments on the part of the english hhey further adjourned three several times without doing any business he last of which was to the   th instant  die martis   th januar   0   the commissioners of both sides being met they had a long conference in relation to the home consumpt in which the english seemed positive that an equality of impositions throughout the united kingdom as absolutely necessary but seemed inclinable to condescend that scotland should be exempted from all excises and duties laid on for payment of debts contracted by england before the union but that scotland should be subject to such duties as should be laid on for exigences after the union and adjourned to the   th instant  die lunae   th januar   0   the duke of queensberry for the lords commissioners for scotland acquainted their lordships of england that they had drawn up some articles as the result of their last conference in which they had yielded as much in the several points thereinmentioned as possibly they could which articles were read and taken into consideration by the lords commissioners for england against the next meeting which was appointed to be upon the  0 instant  follows the articles offered by the scots   that neither kingdom be burdened with debts contracted or to be contracted by the other before the union and that no other or greater excise or other duties on home consumption or inland taxes be raised or imposed within that part of the united kingdom now called scotland than these now on foot there till the debts of england contracted or to be contracted before the union be fully satisfied and paid   that after payment of the english debts as aforesaid that part of britain now called scotland shall be subject to the survey of the parliament of great britain and be liable to such excise and other home duties as shall by the said parliament be thought just and suitable to the circumstances of that part of the united kingdom for the time provided that the proportion of inland duties and impositions of that part of the united kingdom shall not then or ever after be more than that of the neighboring counties of the now kingdom of england   if any goods or merchandise of the native product of scotland not liable to any excise or imposition there shall be transported from scotland to england by sea or land the said goods and merchandice when brought into england shall be liable to the same duties and no other which might have been raised or exacted if they had been of the native product of england   as an equivalent to scotland for becoming subject to the same regulations with england in export and import and for the encouragement of fishing and trade and manufactorie in scotland that out of some effectual branch of the revenue arising from that part of britain now called scotland there be  0000 lib yearly after completing the union appropriated toward carrying on the fisherie and improving the manufactures and native product there as shall be directed and ordered by commissioners and trustees to be named for that purpose   that   000 lib shall be reckoned as the just proportion of scotland in the   lib rate of land tax and so proportionally in all landtaxes in time coming   die veneris    januar   0   there not being a quorum of the english and the scots being met in their own chamber in the cockpit the marquess of normanbie and earls of pembroke and notinghame came unto them from such of the english commissioners as were met in the council chamber to signify that they were so much ashamed of the frequent disappointments they had given them that for preventing the like for the future they had resolved amongst themselves to apply to her majesty for a new commission under the broad seal in which seven might be named a quorum  after these lords withdrew the scots commissioners considered the proposition and having caused read their own commission by which they are authorized to treat with commissioners to be named by her majesty under the broadseal of england their sufficient number which is not specified they thought themselves sufficiently warranted to treat with that number of the english which should be determined by the commission under the greatseal of england and of this they acquainted the english by the marquess of annandale earl of seafield and viscount of tarbat and then adjourned to saturday the    instant  die saturni    januar   0   the commissioners being met the english gave in a new commission under the broadseal of england whereby seven were appointed a quorum and the same being read the lord keeper offered in writing the following considerations upon the articles in reference to home consumpt offered by their lordships of scotland on the   th which considerations being read were by the scots commissioners taken into consideration till next meeting which was appointed on the   th instant and a conference appointed on the   th instant  follows the considerations offered by the english   as to the former part of the first article viz that neither kingdom be burdened with the debts contracted or to be contracted by the other before the union it being the same in terminis with the  th proposition delivered by your lordships on the  th december the observation made then may suffice for a reply to it now viz that tho the debts of england have been contracted by a long war entered into more particularly for the preservation of england and the dominions thereto belonging yet scotland has had its share in the benefits which have accrued to great britain in general from the opposition that has been made to the growth and power of france and have increased the number of their seamen considerably by the employment they had in the coasttrade of england during the war but as it is necessary they should be under equal impositions with regard to the balance of trade and manufactories when the kingdoms shall be united and a free communication of native product settled so it may be reasonable that the money so raised upon that part which is now called scotland should be applied to the security and protection of scotland and the trade thereof nor does it follow that because the duties now raised on particular funds in england are appropriate for payment of debts that therefore when the like duties are laid on in scotland they must be applied in the same manner but for their lordships to propose that there be no other duty in scotland than these now on foot there till the debts in england contracted or to be contracted before the union be fully satisfied and paid setts the present trade on an equal foot which is intended by an equality of impositions at such a distance as gives little hopes to any now alive of coming at it for one of the nine pences on beer and ale being the fund of the first million act anno   and   of the late king and queen was granted for    years one nine pences more which is the fund of the lottery for about eight years yet to come one nine pence more which is the bankfund inheritance to the crown as are also the several duties upon salt and half that on stamped paper though in these latter duties there are clauses of provision for redemption but whilst it is insisted that there shall be no other nor greater in scotland than are already paid there it may be presumed that these already mentioned are enough to prevent the necessity of enquiring into the number or proportion of what they have in scotland where if by exemption from such duties a clothier can subsist himself at   d per diem whereas he cannot subsist in england under   d per diem then all such manufactures who shall go thither will be able to undersell and consequently outtrade those that stay in england half in half in what relates to their labor by subsisting so much cheaper but the workmanship of every pound of wool made in cloth advances the value of it near nine parts in ten for its first cost   as to the second article their lordships say that duties upon the home consumption require to be equally laid on all the parts of the united kingdoms nor do the northern counties of england pay less duties of excise as seems here suggested than the midland but rather more in proportion to the value of their counties and commodities excised   as to the third article it is needless to debate upon it till the first be settled these two depending the one upon the other if indeed the lords commissioners for england should think it expedient to exempt homeconsumption of scotland from any new duties for some reasonable period of time till that kingdom began to reap the benefit of the free communication of trade intended by the union then their lordships will insist that such commodities as pay duties in england may be cleared with the same duties when they are exported or brought out of scotland into england and upon some other provisions which will be requisite to prevent frauds in her majestys revenues   as to the  th article the lords commissioners for england say that the free communication especially of the foreign trade to which in the terms of the preliminaries their lordships have assented is so great a benefit to scotland that they did not expect an equivalent should have been mentioned for the equality of imposition on importation and exportation besides their lordships say your lordships have already agreed upon an equality of impositions as to foreign trade both as to exportation and importation   as to the  th article it will be impossible to determine this point till their lordships shall be informed of the value of the lands in scotland and this may be further debated when their members or representatives in the parliament of great britain shall be settled   die mercurii    januar   0   the commissioners for the conference having met on the    instant the scots commissioners thought it best to give answers in writing to the considerations offered by the english which might be entered in the books with the considerations and gave them in accordingly which prevented the conference for the english desired to consider the answers till next meeting which was appointed on the    instant  die jovis   th januar   0   the commissioners having met the lord president on the part of the lords commissioners for england offered the following paper as their lordships sense of the conference at the preceding meeting which was read as follows  the lords commissioners for england agree that neither kingdom shall be burdened with the debts of the other contracted before the union and that no duties on home consumption or taxes to be levied from scotland shall be applied for payment of the english debts and whatever time may be fit to be allowed to scotland to reap the benefit of the communication of trade and enable them the better to pay duties on home consumption equal to england is most proper to be determined in the respective parliaments of both kingdoms  then his lordship offered on the part of the lords commissioners for england an answer to the proposition made at the last meeting by their lordships of scotland which was read as follows  as to the last proposition delivered the   th instant their lordships say it has been found by experience that two companies existing together in the same kingdom and carrying on the same traffic are destructive to trade and are therefore of opinion that to agree with this proposition will be inconsistent with the interest of great britain  the lords commissioners for scotland withdrew to consider these papers and returning to the council chamber my lord duke of queensberry acquainted their lordships of england that the lords commissioners for scotland would consider their lordships answer to their proposition about the company against the next meeting that they had now prepared for their lordships what they took to be their sense of the paper they had received from their lordships which was read as follows  the lords commissioners for scotland understand the paper given in by their lordships in this sense that neither kingdoms shall be burdened with the debts of the other contracted before the union and that no duties on home consumption or taxes to be levied from scotland shall be applied to the payment of english debts and that a time be allowed to scotland to reap the benefit of the communication of trade before that kingdom become liable to pay other or greater duties on home consumption or inland taxes than those now on foot and that it is most proper to be determined by the respective parliaments of both kingdoms how long that time of exemption shall subsist this paper their lordships of england took into consideration against next meeting  the duke of queensberry moved that since they were so near agreeing on this matter which was only the first of the articles offered on the   th instant that they should proceed to the consideration of the other articles  and accordingly the   d of the said articles was read and the consideration and answers relative thereto were spoke to by the lords commissioners on both sides but before coming to any resolution their lordships adjourned to the  0th instant  die saturni  0 th januar   0   the commissioners having met the lord president of the council on the part of the lords commissioners for england acquainted their lordships of scotland that they had drawn up an article in reference to the matter which had been the subject of conference at the two last meetings which he hoped would give their lordships full sarisfaction  the said article was read and the said commissioners for scotland having withdrawn to consider the same and returning to the council chamger my lord duke of queensberry acquainted their lordships of england that the lords commissioners for scotland had agreed to the article as given in by their lordships understanding their lordships sense of the last clause to be such as that it relates to the length of the time to be allowed to scotland  ordered that the said article be insert in the journals of this day as agreed on between the lords commissioners of both kingdoms  agreed by the said commissioners of both kingdoms that neither kingdom shall be burdened with the debts of the other contracted before the union and that no duties on home consumption or taxes to be levied from scotland shall be applied to the payment of english debts and that some time is to be allowed to scotland to reap the benefit of the communication of trade and enable them the better to pay duties on home consumption equal to england but that it is most proper to be determined in the respective parliaments of both kingdoms  ordered that the journals of what has been transacted hitherto be made ready by the secretaries to be read over at the general meeting appointed to be on monday the first of february  die lunae   st febr   0   the lords commissioners having met the l duke of queensberry moved on the part of the lords commissioners for scotland that the first of the proposals offered on the   th of january being adjusted they should proceed to the consideration of the other articles whereupon the second and subsequent articles were read severally and spoke to by the lords commissioners on both sides but their lordships came to no resolution on any of these articles  the duke of queensberry acquainted the lords commissioners for england that their lordships of scotland having considered their lordships answer to their proposition of the   th of january about the company trading to africa and the indies they did offer to their lordships the following paper which was read and taken into consideration by the lords commissioners for england and is as follows  by the lords commissioners for scotland their lordships do still insist for preserving and securing the privileges of the scots company trading to africa and the indies because the undertakers did on the public faith of the kingdom advance a stock of  00000 lib or thereby and it is not unknown to your lordships what part the generality of the kingdom and also the parliament of scotland did take in the discouragements and disappointments the said company did receive as is fully expressed in the address of the parliament to the late king   their lordships conceive that the privileges of the scots company may consist with the english east india company or any other english company which are circumscribed to the present limits of england and it is not proposed that the privileges of the scots company should be extended beyond the bounds of scotland so the several companies do not interfere   if the existing of companies for carrying on the same traffic do appear to your lordships destructive of trade it is not expected that your lordships will insist that therefore the privileges of the scots company should be abandoned without offering at the same time to purchase their right at the public expense   and then they adjourned to wednesday the   d instant
