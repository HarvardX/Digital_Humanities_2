honorable lord george sutton a just and incorrupt senator candid and ingenuous highly esteemed by some generally respected by all as a testimony of regard and gratitude for his civilities and friendship with diffidence and submission the following sheets are most humbly inscribed  by his lordships most devoted most obedient and humble servant the author  essay on epilepsy the intention of the author under this genus epilepsia is to describe that disease which has been most commonly in this island called the falling sickness the reason why we choose to give it the title of epilepsy is it being the general term now in use amongst the most accurate and recent systematics but before i attempt to enumerate the phenomenon and different symptoms accompanying it i think it necessary in order to avoid the danger of its being confounded with any other genera of the class of neuroses of dr cullen or of the spasmi of sauvage to which it pertains to give it a definition which i shall endeavor to be as concise in as the matter will admit  definition the epilepsy is a disease of the convulsive kind returning periodically affecting the extremities with various and irregular motions every sense as well as the faculties of the mind for a certain time are altogether obliterated  history of the disease having thus defined the disease i shall next endeavor to illustrate its appearance more accurately in a detail of the particular symptoms attending it but as i have before remarked that it is a periodical one and as many circumstances show the approach of these periods it seems most proper to take our first observations from them before any one is seized with an epileptic fit as it is called he or she generally perceives the head to be in some degree affected by stupor or a kind of swimming which we express by the name vertigo the countenance is sometimes red and bloated at other times in a collapsed state the eyes sparkle and appear highly excited a small inflammation or red spot is frequently perceived upon the white of them increasing gradually till the time of accession the circumambient parts are considerably distended vision is diminished and vitiated in some degree sometimes indeed altogether absent  the iris has very different appearances sometimes purple at others black the ears tingle and sounds are difficultly heard disagreeable smells and tastes are also perceived  the patients discourse deviates much from what it is in health being either quicker or slower and at this time saliva is emitted from the mouth very copiously the jugular veins are enlarged and at last a loss of sense takes place  neither are the parts below these altogether free from complaint but are affected with symptoms common to other spasmodic diseases particularly those of hysteria and hypochondriari but it frequently varies here acting differently in different temperaments sometimes a pain is felt between the shoulders the abdomen is drawn upwards the tendons are convulsed the heart and extremities tremble yawning and difficult respiration succeed the extremities grow cold the penis is praeternaturally distended a sense of air or warm vapor is often perceived from the hypochondria extremities or lowest parts ascending to the higher and to the senorium  the eructions also are very irregular for besides the profusion of saliva which has been spoken of above the digestions of the intestines are foetid and very offensive the urine is also discharged in greater quantity than is customary and not sufficiently elaborated  nocturnal emissions of semen frequently happen from salacious dreaming a sense of inflation is also perceived at the praecordia the abdomen begins to swell and murmur the appetite vitiated requiring food either in too great or small quantity some are excited by anger others are depressed by sorrow or fear others again are distracted by anxious cares some transported by joy by foolish and intemperate laughing others within a short space of time run through all their different affections sleep is either too profound or disturbed with terrifying dreams the incubus or nightmare frequently is an addition to these calamities by the increase of these symptoms at last the occasion appears by which the patient is prostrated on the ground by a groan all the senses and the faculty of the mind being abandoned  violent convulsions seize the whole body the muscies of the face being differently distorted seem to express different senses of the mind as those of grief joy anger love etc there is also a violent grinding or grating of the teeth takes place to such a degree as sometimes to destroy part of their extremities it is not unusual for the tongue to protrude a little out of the mouth and the closing of the jaws frequently cause the teeth to cut it exceedingly a livid appearance of the lips and under parts of the eyes takes place which in a short time runs over the whole face the palpebrae of the eyes are irregularly moved but never are so far constricted as to cover all the white the mouth is dry sparm prevailing in the beginning afterward it pours forth its saliva the sparm not being solved respiration is performed with the greatest difficulty and labor as if a person was actually under efforts of strength and the hands are clinched with great force neither are the heart and arteries free from distress the pulsations of which are at first quick and small in a short time they become full and slow not having their proper force and can scarcely be numbered wanting their regular order after this the venis of the face also the praecordia and abdomen begin to swell the excretions are also considerably disturbed for instead of saliva which was before very profusely secreted a soam arises in the mouth also stools urine sweat and semen are spontaneously evacuated in an excited system endued with great sensibility vomiting also happens sometimes  all these symptoms by degrees begin to vanish and the convalescent epileptic has not the appearance of death or a moribund state but a more natural sleep at last returns again but yet not so sufficiently natural but that it represents apoplexy the breathing at last becomes less laborious and a short space of time intervening the patient not conscious of any thing that has happened is restored to his natural state it rarely occurs that a person recovers immediately all his faculties upon the paroxysm subsiding for generally there remains an inactivity to motion in all the extremities dullness of conception pains of the head and dimness of sight all which continue some time  the times of interval between these accessions are very different some are attacked every day or sometimes twice in the day others once in the month and others again at a much greater distance of time but the accessions do not observe regular periods even in the same person and the continuance of the accession also differs greatly some only being distressed for a few minutes others whole days and here we conclude our account of the symptoms attending epilepsy  remote causes the different remote causes and the effects of those visible upon the brain of dissected epileptics sufficiently demonstrate that epilepsy most frequently depends on a turgid state of the brain these causes whether they act directly upon the brain or primarily on another part of the body are at last transferred to it and there act vide bonetus morgagni and lieutaud   those that act within the brain may as sar as at present we have learnt from dissections be properly reserred to six heads   mechanical stimuli  as a fractured cranium and all cases of depression   chemical stimuli  collections of acrid fluids   matters preventing the free circulation of the blood or proper action of the nerves under which are comprehended tumor ossifications and compressions   where the vessels of the brain are preternaturally filled with blood   effusions of blood   effusions of serum  it is obvious beyond a doubt that all these causes consist in a full and turgid state of the brain which is the fourth cause and an increase of this the fifth and the sixth follows either of these when no hydropic habit is present which may be easily detected by its symptoms and distinguished from that state of turgiscency which we are endeavoring to investigate an impeded circulation in the sinuses of the brain or jugular veins will cause the arterious blood to act with greater impetus upon their exhalents which will cause an effusion of serum and a small effusion in the brain is more liable to do harm than in any other part because here we have no absorbents and the veins only perform this office so that a small quantity of serum effused must accumulate by stagnation for want of this absorbent system  the sixth cause is therefore an effect of the two foregoing nor does the first act immediately unless by giving that full habit we have been discussing or in some degree assisted by that we are certain it does not give a more certain epilepsy and the cure of every epilepsy coming from this origin consists in a diminution of the full habit  what pertains to the second i agree that acrid chemical stimuli are both obnoxious to and capable of giving epilepsy but as such i deny its capability of giving one where the paroxysm is continued longer and when the stimulus is present and the fit has been more durable and serous colluvies found extravasated i contend that it is the effect of the disease and of the impetus of the blood which before has been elucidated  the third cause is the only one remaining to be reconciled to our general opinion under which are classed hard tumors and consertions in the brain impeding the free circulation through it this is pretty well explained by the first and second cause such is a compression of the softer parts into a praeternatural hardness this cause therefore seems to me to act as a stimulus quickening the circulation of the blood through its vessels therefore this as well as the first cause if not directly yet in effect produces the plenitude necessary for our proposition and the same may be added with respect to the other four causes which have been before enumerated and properly reconciled as terminating similarly  these conclusions are or the greatest advantage in practice and clearly show us how we ought to diminish the plethoric habit of epileptics and recommend abstinence this is an excellent example of the use of dissections in investigating proximate causes of diseases though much neglected at present by physicians  not that i mean to affirm or give it as my opinion that there is no epilepsy but what depends on plethora many depend on inanition others on neither cause more are however to be referred to it than at first view we imagine  i remember a case of epilepsy remarked by my most ingenious master and illustrious professor dr cullen at edinburgh which was brought on by fear and yet before every return of the paroxysm an inflammation of one of the eyes was clearly perceived  as we have gone pretty fully through these causes which act within the cranium let us endeavor in order more certainly to establish the nature of the disease as depending on this plethoric state of the brain to show how causes originally acting elsewhere or at a distance produce the same effects  impressions of different kinds acting upon the senses in general give epilepsy according to their degree of impulse they do not act as being of distinct or different kinds but by force of impression or reflect sensations excited as they are called and this may be reconciled to all the senses except that of smell upon which odours seem to act particularly neither have these the power of acting unless sufficiently strong so a considerable degree of pain of any part  joy and what is still more fear which is carried to a degree of terror have produced epilepsy  terror acts more powerfully as a stimulus than joy because we are modified by nature to attend more peculiarly to those motions of the mind which free us from danger than those which elevate us to sudden prosperity  and why not when we consider that sudden destruction is escaped in one case and only transitory pleasure acquired in the other  chemical stimuli act also in like manner some upon the whole system others only on a particular part as by stimulating the stomach and these do not act specifically but according to their strength do they produce epilepsy  odours indeed as we have before said seem to have a peculiar mode of action and some other causes produce the disease from increased irritability of the patient as among children dentition calculi and worms and these causes act in the same manner as those within the brain viz by stimulating the brain to more violent motions and quickening the circulation of the blood through it which from our former observations seems to be the most frequent cause of epilepsy but having before said that epilepsy might arise from a contrary state we shall run over these causes as not being of so much consequence and importance with less precision  perturbations of the mind by diminishing the action of the brain produce a temporary epilepsy quickly terminating in either death or health as is observed in the effects of great and sudden joy or terror but it would have been sufficient only to have mentioned these once as they very commonly bring on death in a similar manner as by palsy apoplexy syncope and convulsions  some of the affections of the mind give a more continued epilepsy and one more pertinent to our proposition as fear which by diminishing in a certain manner the mobility of the nervous power seems by an inherent law in our system to give in a certain ratio a reaction of the efforts of the brain which is even greater than natural or the remembrance of this same cause of fear is often very surficient to bring back the disease  there is a fact of a pregnant woman being fatigued with trying a new gown which by diminishing the excitement of the sensorium gave that reaction necessary for the production of an epileptic fit the sight of which gown for sometime after was sufficient to renew the paroxysm atonia of the stomach sometimes is sufficient to give epilepsy such as is made by distention after eating as is observed by galen  fumes of ipecacuana taken into the stomach are capable of producing the same effects also mercury and many other matters the variolous contagion induced by inoculation and the aura epileptica and finally compression of the brain which produces epilepsy such as generally precedes apoplexy or palsy  there causes from the effects and method of cure are very clearly seen to act by giving a state of the brain contrary to excitement which we choose to call by the name collapse but then these act very rarely when compared with the former neither do they essentially deviate from our proposition  from innumerable dissections of lieutaud morgagni and others of epileptic patients also in the opinion of the greatest characters in physic albertinius and hossman and many others truly honored and esteemed for their practice it appears that they for the most part frequently treated epilepsy as a disease strictly connected with plethora and this also particularly agrees with the opinions and doctrines of my late most worthy master and instructor doctor cullen of edinburgh professor of the institutes and practice of physic whole name i am at a loss for words to adorn with that reverence gratitude and affection that it demands of me but will always endeavor to keep it in view in my practice  i am also of opinion that this turgescent state which we have been endeavoring to establish will argued fairly most easily investigate the nature and cure of the epilepsy  for the more clear and accurate elucidation of the proximate cause of this disease let us consider those habits that are most predisposed to it  those systems inclined to epilepsy are generally endowed with increased mobility by this i mean persons subject to sudden irregular and violent motions of the mind and is it not highly probable that the state of the brain in these habits which is moved by every impulse of stimuli and every change of tension is similar  this mobility is increased by repetition and after sometime become habitual and almost natural according to the law of irritability by which i mean the power of contraction of muscles it is increased and facilitated by motion  this explains the reason why after one paroxysm others can be produced by less active and weaker stimuli and seems as if they were produced even spontaneously for which reason it has been called a voluntary and feigned disease this mobility assists us much in the investigation of the proximate cause of every epilepsy  there are two causes of mobility   debility of muscular fibers   excess of tension   the first cause is clearly elucidated in infants who are particularly obnoxious to epileptic fits a debile state of muscular fibers or of the original stamina can give such a certain condition of the nervous power which makes it more adapted to irregular motions which we call increased mobility but perhaps this reasoning may appear too subtle so i shall pass to the other cause of mobility viz  excess of tension  this giving mobility remains by some means now more clearly to be explained stretching fibers beyond their tone gives increase of mobility so fibers immoderately distended by the potentiae nocentes such as exercise heat drunkenness etc especially in a plethoric system when the force of these is removed they immediately relax themselves in a certain ratio as they have been before distended and in like manner are their oscillations increased which remission or relaxation must frequently necessarily take place in the brain  this tension which depends on the quantity and impetus of the humors frequently remits an explanation of which by an example of an elastic cord may perhaps render it more easy to conceive if such a cord is extended by force or by any weight to a certain length it will require a greater force or weight to stretch it as much more than was at first applied and in a ratio according to the degree of distension so will be the resilition the distending power being removed or i may explain the same thing by a pendulum as far as you remove it by the hand from the center of gravity in one direction giving it liberty it will in a certain ratio go so much farther from it on the reverse side  a full turgid state of the brain is analogous to this the oscillations of which are produced either spontaneously or by faults occuring elsewhere as plethora always increases itself  but besides this cause of epilepsy consisting in the excitement of the brain or in its greater oscillations that is excess of tension connected with debility a defect of tension debility being present will produce the same effects  this is a peculiar law of our system as excitement produces collapse so in return does sedative powers produce excitements  for the motions of our minds run into contrary extremes  terror produces this disease by exciting the brain but in a short time it produces a contrary state the impetus being a little moderated exquisite titillation brings about the same phenomenon as is observed by aristotle omne animal post coitum triste  and other sedative causes act in like manner we shall however leave these discussions and pass to the cure of epilepsy depending on a turgescent state of the vessels of the brain  method of cure the indications of cure seem to be two i to avoid occasional causes ii to obviate a full habit   i all exciting causes are particularly to be guarded against so every thing that induces plethora is strictly to be forbid as animal food and matters that are highly nutritious also whatever has the power of determining the blood to the head as the rays of the sun acting upon it heat of the bed favored by the horizontal position bathing exercise drunkenness and anger and whatever is capable of inducing vertigo as viewing of objects from eminencies venery strong impulses as sudden noises stridor of the hinge of a door commotions of the mind remembrance of the first cause of the disease and sight of other patients laboring under the same paroxysm  ii by the second indication of cure is intended not only to obviate the increase of a full habit but also to diminish that which is present for which purposes the following method seems to me most advantageous  first blood letting this is peculiarly efficacious where the disease chiefly seems to consist in tension and a few ounces drawn will answer the intent but when signs of congestion appear in the head as by acute pain tumor or any inflammation then blood is to be drawn plentifully and for this reason i advise a large quantity to be taken at once because it is not so soon repaired and as we know from fact that nothing more increases plethora than frequent small bleedings performed periodically the system being accustomed to lose a certain quantity of blood at particular times always provides for such a loss therefore from the reasons above it is sufficienity clear by small repeated bleedings we increase that habit we wish to obviate and this remedy may be used with greater advantage when we are acquainted by any symptoms of an approaching accession upon the appearance of which i would very freely immediately draw blood from a vein i should at the same time be very cautious of inducing a deliquium animi and this for two reasons  st lest i should be frustrated in my intent as to quantity and  dly as by this there is some danger to be apprehended of inducing an accession  this then may be the rule to bleed while the strength of the patient remains favorable should not this prove sufficient which i am in hopes it would then leeches or cupping glasses may be applied to the temples as necessity requires  second purgatives the action of these is accompanied with stimulus and if this be a general one often does as much harm as good we should always in this case pay particular attention that this stimulus be as much confined to the alimentary canal as possible which may have good effect in altering the determination from the head which before we elucidated to be so generally the case with epileptics  these act by exciting the peristaltic motion of the intestines and thus occasioning a discharge of their contents also by emulging the several excretions which is a greater evacuation than the former hence purgatives must have a considerable power in depleting the system and diminishing its tension which we have showed to abound in epilepsy i would however recommend those of the milder kind such as neutral salts senna manna rhubarb castor  oil etc as most proper  third issues and setons these by discharging the coagulable lymph are without doubt useful against a full habit as this is the part of our fluids which forms pus that we see evacuated by these emunctories which are generally placed in the neighborhood of the system where the cause of the disease acts hence in epilepsy the most proper part for an issue or seton is the nape of the neck  these remedies in most cases are sufficient either to cure or at least to alleviate the disease yet i would not recommend a long use of them since the system being inured to this evacuation from custom and habit assimilates an increased quantity of coagulable nymph in order to supply the discharge of pus analogous to frequent blood lettings increasing plethora  so the longer we continue these evacuations the less essential are the effects  the most proper method after the use of these means to obviate a full habit is  fourth abstinence this is highly effectual against the cause of epilepsy consequently against a turgid state of the vessels of the brain the cause of this disease and certainly more epileptics are cured by this than all other remedies and whatever advantages may arise from the use of the above evacuations it is absolutely necessary that the patient observe strist regularity in the nonnaturals and adhere inviolably to the antiphlogistic regimen for a considerable length of time and perhaps through life  in epilepsy arising from debility the following indication of cure seems most proper  to obviate mobility of the nervous power  this takes place in a lax state of the system and is relieved by tonics and antispasmodics there is doubt in the former from the difficulty in the administration in the vegetable kingdom there are some plants abound peculiarly with an astringent quality as the bark of oak which has been thought to act specifically in this disease perhaps commended enthusiastically as it is very uncertain  the vegetables where the bitter and astringent qualities are connected are the most powerful as in the  peruvian bark and this is not administered with so much propriety to a full plethoric habit as to remove mobility of the nervous power for it certainly is injurious to systems accompanied with the haermorrhagic or inflammatory diathesis and as this disease sometimes fluctuates from the mobility arising from turgescency to that from laxity particularly connected with the nervous system in this state we may admit it as a most powerful remedy especially where the accessions observe regular periods as we know the bark has particular qualities of removing periodical diseases as is clearly elucidated in the phenomenon of intermittents and that it has very trifling powers unless given very nigh to the approach of a paroxysm hence it appears that the indiscriminate manner in which the bark has been prescribed is the reason of its being exploded by many in practice it however with some justice may be said that the jesuit who first showed the use of this most noble medicine has sufficiently compensated for the crimes of the whole fraternity  now we go to  metallic tonics which are more powerful than all the vegetable except the peruvian bark and   arsenic  this is dangerous although much commended   tin  this is said to have had good effects   iron  this is sufficiently safe but if chalybeate waters have alleviated epilepsies they have done this not so much from their tonic power as from the effects that succeed cold bathing exercise and cold air in general   copper  this is perhaps an useful medicine against epilepsy and it is much to be lamented that we are not particularly acquainted with that composition of it that proved so remarkably effectual and which is recorded by baron van swieten the form of which he himself is ignorant of but most probably it may depend on this circumstance preserving the tonic power of the copper and rejecting altogether its stimulating qualities which may in some measure be obviated by joining a neutral instead of an acid with the copper which is done in the cuprum ammoniacale now in use in epileptic cases consisting merely of copper connected with the sal ammoniacum this composition has very strong advocates   cold bathing this alone has frequently been recommended as a cure in epileptic cases and wherever it has been of service i should imagine it to be in those systems where the mobility of the nervous power is considerably increased but injurious in those where the inflammatory or plethoric diathesis prevails  the method of using the cold bath should be either by the patient going in head foremost or by cold water being first thrown upon his head as in this manner it is most likely to be effectual  antispasmodics to enter formally into a strict discussion of these would be a work of time and require much experiment and observation to show with accuracy their modus operandi but we can in general say of these they scarcely merit the praise attributed to them  we shall speak of those chiefly recommended  peony and valerian these have long been held very efficacious in the cure of epilepsy the former of which has been extolled even to absurdity many having credulity enough to believe that the root of this plant worn about the neck only was very serviceable in this disease but its great use i own myself unacquainted with therefore pass it over  many physicians have ascribed great praise to valerian but i have been informed by a most eminent professor at edinburgh who has been very much engaged in the practice of physic for thirty years past who declared he had only seen it of service in one or two cases and when that takes place it acts merely as a purgative destitute of any antispasmodic qualities  animal oil this has been highly celebrated amongst the germans which is the empyreumatic oil of animals highly purified by distillation which destroys the original disagreeable odor and renders it thin and limpid of a subtle penetrating not disagreeable smell and taste its volatility is so great that it gives all its power to the air for which reason if there is any hopes of advantage in volatile medicines it may justly be expected from this and the testimony of many confirm the fact  mosch this is the most subtle of all and therefore ought to be scattered upon the whole body if its powers are obvious in the cure of hydrophobia it ought from similitude of reasoning to appear in epilepsy and its fame is every where divulged but it is found necessary to give it in large doses to answer the intent which may be owing to our very rarely meeting with this medicine pure and therefore being uncertain of its efficacy  ether this is not altogether useless because of its volatility rendering it capable of being diffused through the whole system and therefore it is not to be altogether rejected  opium this has been condemned by many in the cure of epilepsy two very illustrious names in physic de haen and morgagni have commended it but without giving any sufficient reason for their opinion de haen relates a particular case where the accession used to return during sleep and he declares that many paroxysms were obviated by the use of opium the slowness of the pulse having sufficiently indicated their approach this is very little to the purpose neither is the reasoning of morgagni sufficiently probable  in my own opinion opium acts here as a tonic and being given at a happy crisis before the accession by that means obviates it  certainly if ever it is to be admitted in spasmodic convulsions or epilepsies it ought to be admitted as nearly as possible to the accession because of its quickly losing its power and this being over it always leaves the system more irritable its inebriating quality on the one hand quickens the circulation to the head and debilitates and irritates in consequence so on the other hand its being given in such quantity and at such a particular time to obviate an accession by diminishing the nervous mobility or to be more particular the mobility of the nervous power in which spasms consist but this power of opium does not appear so clearly in a pure idiopathic epilepsy where the brain itself is the seat of the disease as in one arising from irritation of the system in general or of a particular part  but in fact the rash use of it in the former case is scarcely compensated for by the more prudent use of it in the latter  hyocyamus the action of this plant is not unlike that of opium only that it does not leave the belly so constipated this advantage alone being admitted it is either notwithstanding the high character given of it by dr stork not to be given at all or with the same restrictions as opium in epilepsy  this indication for the removing mobility contains a great many remedies the use of which in a plethoric system would be altogether absurd and are adapted simply to mobility accompanied with debility but as this frequently in time succeeds the other so must we practice accordingly  we may add a fourth indication for the convalescent state  to obviate altogether an habitual disease  this is chiefly done by avoiding occasional causes a little fuller diet may be admitted this disease sometimes varies in such a manner that to those where abstinence has been strictly commanded a fuller diet comes in for a remedy after a few years i say here a more liberal regimen not absolutely a full regimen for irritability of the nervous and sanguiferous system is particularly to be attended to  a generous glass of wine may be admitted but not in quantity to inebriate as a little strengthens and nourishes the body without irritating it which effect has considerable power against the very production of mobility  sleep ought to be enjoyed temperately which is most adapted to corroborating the body  let the degree of the atmosphere if it can be so contrived be under    of farenheits thermometer rather than above  all these may be varied discretionally according to the state of the convalescents this alteration being properly and skilfully managed other remedies being less efficacious and the disease itself not being so well investigated is highly beneficial which is a maxim from the time of hippocrates down to the present  finis
