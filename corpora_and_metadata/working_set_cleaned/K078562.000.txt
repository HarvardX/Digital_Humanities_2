leonidas a poem        pind olymp od    london printed for r dodsley at tullys head in pallmall mdccxxxvii  the preface to illustrate the following poem to vindicate the subject from the censure of improbability and to show by the concurring evidence of the best historians that such disinterested public virtue did once exist i have thought it would not be improper to prefix the subsequent narration  while darius the father of xerxes was yet on the throne of persia cleomenes and demaratus were kings in lacedaemon both descended from hercules demaratus was unfortunately exposed by an uncertain rumor which rendered his legitimacy suspected to the malice and treachery of his colleague who had conceived a personal resentment against him for cleomenes taking advantage of this report persuaded the spartans to examine into the birth of demaratus and refer the difficulty to the oracle of delphi and was assisted in his perfidious designs by a near relation of demaratus named leotychides who aspired to succeed him in his dignity cleomenes found means to corrupt the priestess of delphi who declared demaratus not legitimate thus by the base practices of his colleague cleomenes and his kinsman leotychides demaratus was expelled from his office of king in the commonwealth after having frequently signalized his valor in its service he went into voluntary banishment and retiring to asia was there protected by darius while leotychides succeeded to the regal authority in sparta upon the death of cleomenes leonidas was made king who ruled in conjunction with this leotychides when xerxes the son of darius invaded greece the number of land and naval forces which accompanied that monarch together with the servants women and other usual attendants on the army of an eastern prince amounted to upwards of five millions as reported by herodotus who wrote within a few years after the event and publicly recited his history at the olympic games in this general assembly not only from greece itself but from every part of the world wherever a colony of grecians was planted had he greatly exceeded the truth he must certainly have been detected and censured by some among so great a multitude and such a voluntary falsehood must have entirely destroyed that merit and authority which have procured to herodotus the veneration of all posterity with the appellation of the father of history on the first news of this attempt upon their liberty a convention was immediately held at the isthmus of corinth composed of deputies from the several states of greece to consult on proper measures for the public safety the spartans also sent messengers to enquire of the oracle at delphi into the event of the war who returned with an answer from the priestess of apollo that either a king descended from hercules must die or lacedaemon would be entirely destroyed leonidas immediately offered to sacrifice his life for the safety of lacedaemon and marching to thermopylae possessed himself of that important pass with three hundred of his countrymen who with the forces of some other cities in the peloponnesus together with the thebans thespians and the troops of those states which adjoind to thermopylae composed an army of near eight thousand men  xerxes was now advanced as far as thessalia when hearing that a small body of grecians was assembled at thermopylae with some lacedaemonians at their head and among the rest leonidas a descendant of hercules he dispatched a single horseman before to observe their numbers and discover their designs when this horseman approached he could not take a view of the whole camp which lay concealed behind a rampart formerly raised by the phocians at the entrance of thermopylae so that his whole attention was employed on those who were on guard before the wall and who at that instant chanced to be the lacedaemonians their manner and gestures greatly astonished the persian some were amusing themselves in gymnastic exercises others were combing their hair and all discovered a total disregard of him whom they suffered to depart without molestation and report to xerxes what he had seen which appearing to that prince quite ridiculous he sent for demaratus who was with him in the camp and required him to explain this strange behavior of his countrymen demaratus informed him that it was a custom among the spartans to comb down and adjust their hair when they were determined to fight till the last extremity xerxes notwithstanding in the confidence of his power sent ambassadors to the grecians to demand their arms to bid them disperse and become his friends and allies which proposals being received with disdain he commanded the medes and saces to seize on the grecians and bring them alive into his presence these nations immediately attacked the grecians and were soon repulsed with great slaughter fresh troops still succeeded but with no better fortune than the first being opposed to an enemy not only superior in valor and resolution but who had the advantage of discipline and were furnished with better arms both offensive and defensive  plutarch in his laconic apothegms reports that the persian king offered to invest leonidas with the sovereignty of all greece provided he would join his arms to those of persia this offer was too considerable a condescension to have been made before a trial of their force and must therefore have been proposed by xerxes after such a series of ill success as might probably have depressed the insolence of his temper and it may be easily supposed that the virtue of leonidas was proof against any temptations of that nature whether this be a fact or not thus much is certain that xerxes was reduced to extreme difficulties by this resolute defense of thermopylae till he was extricated from his distress by a malian named epialtes who conducted twenty thousand of the persian army into greece through a pass which lay higher up the country among the mountains of oeta whereas the passage at thermopylae was situated on the seashore between the end of those mountains and the malian bay the defense of the upper pass had been committed to a thousand phocians who upon the first sight of the enemy inconsiderately abandoned their station and put themselves in array upon a neighboring eminence but the persians wisely avoided an engagement and with the utmost expedition marched to thermopylae leonidas no sooner received information that the barbarians had passed the mountains but he commanded the allies to retreat reserving the three hundred spartans and four hundred thebans whom as they followed him with reluctance at first he now compelled to stay but the thespians whose number amounted to seven hundred would not be persuaded by leonidas to forsake him their commander was demophilus and the most eminent amongst them for his valor was dithyrambus among the spartans the most conspicuous next to leonidas was dieneces who being told that the multitude of persian arrows would obscure the sun replied the battle would then be in the shade two brothers named alpheus and maron are also recorded for their valor and were lacedaemonians megistias a priest by birth an acarnanian refused to desert leonidas though entreated by him to consult his safety and retire but sent away his only son and remained himself behind to die with the lacedaemonians among the three hundred spartans were two called eurytus and aristodemus who being almost blind were dismissed by leonidas of these aristodemus returned home but eurytus waited till the persians descended from the hills and then commanding his slave to lead him among the combatants was slain with the rest of his countrymen  herodotus relates that leonidas drew up his men in the broadest part of thermopylae where being surrounded by the persians they fell with great numbers of their enemies but plutarch diodorus siculus and others affirm that the grecians attacked the very camp of xerxes in the night the action is thus described by diodorus the grecians having now rejected all thoughts of safety preferring glory to life unanimously called on their general to lead them against the persians before they could be apprisd that their friends had passed round the mountains leonidas embraced the occasion which the ready zeal of his soldiers afforded and commanded them forthwith to dine as men who were to sup in elysium himself in consequence of this command took a repast as the means to furnish strength for a long continuance and to give perseverance in danger after a short refreshment the grecians were now prepared and received orders to assail the enemies camp to put all they met to the sword and force a passage to the royal pavilion when formed into one compact body with leonidas himself at their head they marched against the persians and entered their camp at the dead of night the barbarians wholly unprepared and blindly conjecturing that their friends were defeated and themselves attacked by the united power of greece hurry together from their tents with the utmost disorder and consternation many were slain by leonidas and his party but much greater multitudes by their own troops to whom in the midst of this blind confusion they were not distinguishable from enemies for as night took away the power of discerning truly and the tumult was spread universally over the camp a prodigious slaughter must naturally ensue the want of command of a watchword and of confidence in themselves reduced the persians to such a state of confusion that they destroyed each other without distinction had xerxes continued in the royal pavilion the grecians without difficulty might have brought the war to a speedy conclusion by his death but he at the beginning of the tumult betook himself to flight with the utmost precipitation when the grecians rushing into the tent put to the sword most of those who were left behind then while night lasted they ranged through the whole camp in diligent search of the tyrant when morning appeared the persians perceiving the true state of things held the inconsiderable number of their enemies in contempt yet were so terrified at their valor that they avoided a near engagement but enclosing the grecians on every side showerd their darts and arrows upon them at a distance and in the end destroyed their whole body such was the period of their lives who under the conduct of leonidas defended the pass of thermopylae who can refrain from admiring the virtue of these men who with one consent maintaining the post allotted by their country cheerfully renounced their lives for the common safety of greece and esteemed a glorious death more eligible than to live with dishonor nor is the consternation of the persians incredible who among those barbarians could have conjectured such an event who could have expected that five hundred men would have dared to attack a million wherefore shall not all posterity from that day reflect on the virtue of these men as the object of imitation who though the loss of their lives was the necessary consequence of their undertaking were yet unconquered in their spirit and among all the great names delivered down to remembrance are the only heroes who obtained more glory in their fall than others from the brightest victories with justice may they be deemed the preservers of the grecian liberty even preferably to those who were conquerors in the battles fought afterward with xerxes for the memory of their valor who fell at thermopylae for ever dejected the barbarians while the greeks were fired with emulation to equal such a pitch of magnanimity upon the whole there never were any before these who attained to immortality through the mere excess of virtue whence the praise of their fortitude has not been recorded by historians only but has been celebrated by numbers of poets among others by simonides the lyric  pausanias in his laconics considers the defense of thermopylae as an action superior to any achieved by their cotemporaries and to all the exploits of preceding ages never says he had xerxes beheld greece or laid in ashes the city of athens had not his forces under hydarnes been conducted through a path over oeta and by that means incompassing the greeks overcome and slain leonidas nor is it improbable that leonidas should have maintained his post in so narrow a pass till the whole army of xerxes had perished by famine at the same time the persian navy had been miserably shattered by a storm and worsted in an engagement with the athenians at artemisium  to conclude the fall of leonidas and his brave companions so meritorious to their country and so glorious to themselves has obtained such an high degree of veneration and applause from past ages that few among the ancient compilers of history have been silent on this amazing instance of magnanimity and zeal for liberty and many are the epigrams and inscriptions now extant some on the whole body others on particulars who died at thermopylae still preserving their memory in every nation conversant with learning and at this distance of time still rendering their virtue the object of admiration and praise  i shall now detain the reader no longer than to take this public occasion of expressing my sincere regard for the lord viscount cobham and the sense of my obligations for the early honor of his friendship to him i inscribe the following poem and herein might i be justified independent of all personal motives from his lordships public conduct so highly distinguished by his disinterested zeal and unshaken fidelity to his country not less in civil life than in the field and to whom a poem founded on a character eminent for military glory and love of liberty is due from the nature of the subject  r glover  leonidas book i the argument xerxes king of persia having drawn together the whole force of his empire and passed over the hellespont into thrace with a design to conquer greece the deputies from the several states of that country who had some time before assembled themselves at the isthmus of corinth to deliberate on proper measures for resisting the invader were no sooner apprisd of his march into thrace than they determined without further delay to dispute his passage at the straits of thermopylae the most accessible part of greece on the side of thrace and thessaly alpheus one of the deputies from sparta repairs to that city and communicates this resolution to his countrymen who chanced that day to be assembled in expectation of receiving an answer from apollo to whom they had sent a messenger to consult about the event of the war leotychides one of their two kings counsels the people to advance no further than the isthmus of corinth which separates the peloponnesus where lacedaemon was situated from the rest of greece but leonidas the other king dissuades them from it agis the messenger who had been deputed to delphi and brother to the queen of leonidas returns with the oracle which denounces ruin to the lacedaemonians unless one of their kings lays down his life for the public leonidas offers himself for the victim three hundred spartans are chosen to accompany him to thermopylae and alpheus returns to the isthmus leonidas after an interview with his queen departs from lacedaemon at the end of six days he encamps near the isthmus when he is joined by alpheus who describes the auxiliaries that wait at the isthmus those who are already possessed of thermopylae as also the pass itself and concludes with a relation of the captivity of his brother polydorus in persia  rehearse o muse the deeds and glorious death of that famed spartan who withstood the power of xerxes near thermopylae and fell to save his country when from asias coast with half the nations of the peopled globe the persian king the hellespont had passed and now in thrace his boundless camp was spread soon to the isthmus where thassembled chiefs of greece in anxious council long had sat how best their menaced liberties to guard the dreadful tidings reached the near approach of asias lord determines their resolves these they convey to all the grecian states back to eurotas shores where sparta rose laconian alpheus speeds in council there he finds the spartan people with their kings their kings who boast an origin divine from hercules descended they the sons of lacedaemon had convened to learn the sacred mandates of the immortal gods that morn expected from the delphian dome but in their presence alpheus first appeared and thus addressed them for immediate war prepare o spartans xerxes numerous powers already fill the trembling bounds of thrace the isthmian council has decreed to guard the strait and rocky entrance into greece thermopylae where even a slender force may stem the torrent of unnumberd foes he said when leotychides who shared the rule with great leonidas bespake the spartans thus my countrymen give ear why from her bosom should laconia send her valiant sons to wage a distant war for others safety why exhaust her strength and thin her numbers in defense of those who far remote from lacedaemon dwell beyond the isthmus there the gods have placed our native ramparts there our empires bound and there alone our country claims our swords he ceased the people with assenting shouts replied when thus leonidas began o most ungenrous counsel most unjust and base desertion of the grecian weal what shall thathenians whose assiduous fleets undaunted watch the innumerable foes wherever they menace our affrighted shores and trust the impending dangers of the field to spartas wellknown valor shall they hear that we disowning thus the general cause maintain the isthmus only and expose the rest of greece even athens while she guards our naked coasts to all the waste of war her walls to ruin and her fields to flames her sons her matrons and her hoary sires to violation servitude and shame o should they hear such counsels guide our state would they not court the first propitious gale to waft them far from such perfidious friends and raise new seats in other climes remote safe from insulting foes and false allies then should we soon behold the proud array of xerxes navy with their hostile beaks affront our shores and deluge all our fields with inexhausted numbers half the greeks by us betrayed to bondage would support the persian king and lift the avenging spear for our destruction but my friends reject such mean and dangerous counsels which will blast your long established glories and assist the proud invader o eternal king of gods and mortals elevate our minds each low and partial passion thence dispel till this great truth in every heart be known that none but those who aid the public cause can shield their countries or themselves from chains he said by shame suppressed each clamorous voice was lost in silence till a general shout proclaimed the approach of agis from the fane where taught by phoebus on the delphic hill the pythian maid his oracles revealed he came but discontent and grief overcast his anxious brow reluctant he advanced and now prepared to speak the impatient throng was gathered round him motionless they stood with expectation not a whisper told the silent fear but all on agis gaze and still as death attend the solemn tale as over the western waves when every storm is hushed within its cavern and a breeze softbreathing lightly with its wings along the slackened cordage glides the sailors ear perceives no sound throughout the vast expanse none but the murmurs of the sliding prowe which slowly parts the smooth and yielding main so through the wide and listening crowd no sound no voice but thine o agis broke the air declaring thus the oracle divine i went to delphi i inquired what fate was doomed to sparta from the impending war when thus the allseeing deity replied inhabitants of sparta persias arms shall lay your proud and ancient seat in dust unless a king from hercules derived cause lacedaemon for his death to mourn as when the hand of perseus had disclosed the snakes of dirc medusa all who viewed the gorgon features were congealed to stone with ghastly eye balls on the hero bent and horror living in their marble form thus with amazement rooted where they stood and froze with speechless terror on their kings the spartans gazed but soon their anxious looks all on the great leonidas unite long known his countrys refuge he alone remains unshaken rising he displays his godlike presence dignity and grace adorn his frame and manly beauty joined with strength herculean on his aspect shines sublimest virtue and desire of fame where justice gives the laurel in his eye the inextinguishable spark which fires the souls of patriots while his brow supports undaunted valor and contempt of death serene he rose and thus addressed the throng why this astonishment on every face ye men of sparta does the name of death create this fear and wonder o my friends why do we labor through the arduous paths which lead to virtue fruitless were the toil above the reach of human feet were placed the distant summit if the fear of death could intercept our passage but in vain his blackest frowns and terrors he assumes to shake the firmness of the mind which knows that wanting virtue life is pain and woe that wanting liberty even virtue mourns and looks around for happiness in vain then speak o sparta and demand my life my heart exulting answers to thy call and smiles on glorious fate to live with fame the gods allow to many but to die with equal luster is a blessing heaven selects from all the choicest boons of fate and with a sparing hand on few bestows he said new wonder fixed the gazing throng in silence joy and admiration sat suspending praise at length with high acclaim the arch of heaven resounded when amid the assembly stood dieneces and spoke so from thermopylae may spartas shouts affright the ear of asia haste my friends to guard the gates of greece which open stand to tyranny and rapine they with dread will shrink before your standards and again in servile persia seek their native seats your wives your sons your parents general greece forbid delay and equal to the cause a chief behold can spartans ask for more he ceased when alpheus thus it well becomes the spartans held the chiefs of greece and famed for dauntless courage and unyielding hearts which neither want nor pain nor death can bend to lead the rest to battle then with speed from all your number form a chosen band while i returning will my seat resume among the isthmian council and declare your instant march our brave allies i deem now on the isthmus wait the spartan king all but the locrian and boeotian force with phocis youth appointed to secure thermopylae this said not long he paused but with unwearied steps his course renews now from the assembly with majestic steps forth moves their godlike king with conscious worth his generous bosom glowing like his sire the invincible alcides when he trod with ardent speed to face in horrid war the triple form of geryon or against the bulk of huge antaeus match his strength say muse who next present their dauntless breasts to meet all danger in their countrys cause dieneces advances sage and brave and skilled along the martial field to range the ordered ranks of battle maron next to alpheus dear his brother and his friend then rose megistias with his blooming heir joy of his age and menalippus called megistias wise and venerable seer whose penetrating mind as fame records could from the entrails of the victim slain before the altar and the mystic flight of birds foresee the dark events of time though sprung a stranger on the distant shore of acarnania for his worth received and hospitably cherished he the wreath pontific bore amid the spartan camp serene in danger nor his sacred arm from warlike toils secluding nor unskilled to wield the sword or poize the weighty spear him agis followed brother to the queen of great leonidas his friend in war his tried companion graceful were his steps and gentle his demeanor still his soul preserved its rigid virtue though refined with arts unknown to lacedaemons race high was his office he when spartas weal their aid and counsel from the gods required was sent the sacred messenger to learn their mystic will in oracles declared from rocky delphi and dodonas shade or seaincircled delos or the cell of dark trophonius round boeotia known three hundred more complete the intrepid band but to his home leonidas retired there calm in secret thought he thus explored his mighty soul while nature to his breast a shortlived terror called what sudden grief what cold reluctance thus unmans my heart and whispers that i fear  can death dismay leonidas so often seen and scorned when clad most dreadful in the battles front  or to relinquish life in all its pride with all my honors blooming round my head repines my soul or rather to forsake eternally forsake my weeping wife my infant offspring and my faithful friends  leonidas awake shall these withstand the public safety lo thy country calls o sacred voice i hear thee at that sound returning virtue brightens in my heart fear vanishes before her death receive my unreluctant hand and lead me on thou too o fame attendant on my fall with wings unwearied shall protect my tomb nor time himself shall violate my praise the hero thus confirmed his virtuous soul when agis entered if till now my tongue he thus began o brother has delayed to pay its grateful offering of the praise thy merit claims and only filled the cries of general applause forgive thy friend since her distresses hers whom most you love detained me from thee o unequalled man though lacedaemon call thy first regard forget not her who now for thee laments in sorrows which fraternal love in vain has strove to sooth leonidas embraced his generous friend and thus replied most dear and best of men conceive not but my heart must still remember her from whom my life its largest share of happiness derives can i who yield my breath lest others mourn lest thousands should be wretched when she pines more loved than any though less dear than all can i neglect her griefs in future days if thou with grateful memory record my name and fate o sparta pass not this unheeded by the life i gave for thee knew not a painful hour to tire my soul nor were they common joys i left behind so spoke the patriot and his heart oerflowd with fondest passion then in eager haste the faithful partner of his bed he sought amid her weeping children sat the queen immovable and mute her swimming eyes fixed on the earth her arms were folded over her laboring bosom blotted with her tears as when a dusky mist involves the sky the moon through all the dreary vapors spreads the radiant vesture of its silver light over the dull face of nature so her charms divinely graceful shone upon her grief brightning the cloud of woe the chief approached soon as in gentlest phrase his wellknown voice her drooping mind awakened for a time its cares were hushed she lifts her languid head and thus gives uttrance to her tender thoughts o thou whose presence is my only joy if thus leonidas thy looks and voice can dissipate at once the sharpest pangs how greatly am i wretched who no more must hear that voice which lulls my anguish thus nor see that face which makes affliction smile this said returning grief her breast invades her orphan children her devoted lord pale bleeding breathless on the field of death her everduring solitude of woe all rise in mingled horror to her sight when thus in bittrest agony she spoke o whither art thou going from my arms shall i no more behold thee oh no more in conquest clad and wrapped in glorious dust will thou return to greet thy native soil and make thy dwelling joyful yet too brave why would thou hasten to the dreary gates of death uncalled another might have fallen like thee a victim of alcides race less dear to all and sparta been secure now every eye with mine is drowned in tears all with these babes lament their father lost but oh how heavy is our lot of pain our sighs must last when every other breast exults with transport and the public joy will but increase our anguish yet unmoved thou did not heed our sorrows did not seek a moments pause to teach us how to bear thy endless absence or like thee to die unutterable sorrow here confined her voice these words leonidas returned i see i feel thy anguish nor my soul has ever known the prevalence of love ever proved a fathers fondness as this hour nor when most ardent to assert my fame was once my heart insensible to thee how had it stained the honors of my name to hesitate a moment and suspend my countrys fate till shameful life preferred by my inglorious colleague left no choice but what in me were infamy to shun not virtue to accept then deem no more that of thy love regardless or thy tears i haste uncalled to death the voice of fate the gods my fame my country bid me bleed  oh thou dear mourner wherefore streams afresh that flood of woe why heaves with sighs renewed that tender breast leonidas must fall alas far heavier misery impends over thee and these if softened by thy tears i shamefully refuse to yield that breath which justice glory liberty and heaven claim for my country for my sons and thee think on my long unaltered love reflect on my paternal fondness has my heart ever known a pause of love or pious care now shall that care that tenderness be proved most warm and faithful when thy husband dies for lacedaemons safety thou will share thou and thy children the diffusive good should i thus singled from the rest of men alone entrusted by th immortal gods with power to save a people should my soul desert that sacred cause thee too i yield to sorrow and to shame for thou must weep with lacedaemon must with her sustain thy painful portion of oppressions weight thy sons behold now worthy of their names and spartan birth their growing bloom must pine in shame and bondage and their youthful hearts beat at the sound of liberty no more on their own virtue and their fathers fame when he the spartan freedom has confirmed before the world illustrious shall they rise their countrys bulwark and their mothers joy here paused the patriot with religious awe grief heard the voice of virtue no complaint the solemn silence broke tears ceased to flow ceased for a moment soon again to stream for now in arms before the palace ranged his brave companions of the war demand their leaders presence then her griefs renewed too great for uttrance intercept her sighs and freeze each accent on her faltring tongue in speechless anguish on the heros breast she sinks on every side his children press hang on his knees and kiss his honored hand his soul no longer struggles to confine its strong compunction down the heros cheek down flows the manly sorrow great in woe amid his children who enclose him round he stands indulging tenderness and love in graceful tears when thus with lifted eyes addressed to heaven thou everliving power look down propitious sire of gods and men and to this faithful woman whose desert may claim thy favor grant the hours of peace and thou my great forefather son of jove o hercules neglect not these thy race but since that spirit i from thee derive now bears me from them to resistless fate do thou support their virtue be they taught like thee with glorious labor life to grace and from their father let them learn to die so saying forth he issues and assumes before the band his station of command they now proceed so moved the host of heaven down from olympus in majestic march on jove attendant to the flaming plains of phlegra there to face the giant sons of earth and titan he before them towrd thus through the streets of lacedaemon passed leonidas before his footsteps bow the multitude exulting on he treads revered and honored their inrapturd sight pursues his graceful stature and their tongues extol and hail him as their guardian god firm in his nervous hand he grasps his spear down from his shoulders to his ankles hangs the massy shield and over his burnished helm the purple plumage nods harmonious youths around whose brows entwining laurels played in loftysounding strains his praise record while snowyfingerd virgins all the ways with odorous garlands strewn his bosom now was all possessed with glory which dispelled whatever of grief remained or fond regret for those he left behind the reverend train of lacedaemons senate now approached to give their solemn last farewell and grace their heros parting steps around him flowed in civil pomp their venerable robes mixed with the blaze of arms the radiant troop of warriors pressed behind him maron here with menalippus warm in flowery prime and agis there with manly grace advanced dieneces and acarnanias seer megistias sage the spartan dames ascend the loftiest domes and thronging over the roofs gaze on their sons and husbands as they march so parted argo from the iolchian strand and ploughd the foaming surge thessalias nymphs their hills forsaking and their hallowed groves ranged on the cliffs which overshade the deep still on the distant vessel fixed their sight where greece her chosen heroes had embarked to seek the dangers of the cholchian shore swift on his course leonidas proceeds soon is eurotas passed and lernas banks where his unconquered ancestor subdued the manyheaded hydra and with fame immortalized the lake thunwearied bands next through the pines of maenalus he led and down parthenius urged the rapid toil six days incessant thus the spartans march when now they hear the hoarseresounding tide beat on the isthmus here their tents they spread below the wide horizon then the sun had sunk his beamy head the queen of night gleamd from the center of thethereal vault and over the dusky robe of darkness shed her silver light leonidas detains dieneces and agis open stands the tall pavilion and admits the moon as here they sat conversing from the hill which rose before them one of noble port appears with speed descending lightly down the slope he treads and calls aloud they heard and knew the voice of alpheus from their seats they rose and thus leonidas began o thou whom heaven with swiftness has endud to match the ardour of thy daring soul what calls thee from the isthmus do the greeks neglect to arm nor face the public foe i come to meet thee alpheus thus returned a messenger who gladsome tidings bears through greece the voice of liberty is heard and all unfold their banners in her cause the thebans only with reluctant hands arcadias sons with morning shall thou join who on the isthmus wait thy great command with diophantus mantinea sends five hundred spears nor less from tegeas walls with hegesander move a thousand more who in orchomenus reside who range along parrhasius and cyllenes brow or near the foot of erymanthus dwell or on alpheus banks with various chiefs attend thy call but most is clonius famed of stature huge unshaken as a rock his giant bulk the line of war sustains four hundred warriors brave alcmaeon draws from stately corinths towers two hundred march from phlius whom eupalamus commands an equal number of mycenaes race aristobulus heads through fear alone of thee and threatening greece the thebans arm to these inglorious greeks my self repaired their dying sense of honor to recall a few corrupted by the persian gold unjust dominion have usurped in thebes these in each bosom quell the generous flame of liberty the eloquent they bribe with specious tales the multitude they cheat and prostitute the name of public good to veil oppression others are immersed in all the sloth of riches and unmoved in shameful ease behold their country fall i first implored their senates instant aid but they with artful wiles demanding time for consultation i addressed them thus the shortest moment may suffice to know if to die free be better than to serve but if deluding greece by vain delays you mean to show your friendship to the foe you cannot then deliberate too long how to withstand her swiftavenging wrath approaching with leonidas this heard four hundred warriors they appoint to march the wily anaxander is their chief with leontiades i saw their march begun then hastened to survey the straits which thou shall render sacred to renown where ever mingling with the crumbling soil which moulders round the malian bay the sea in slimy surges rolls upon the rock which forms the utmost limit of the bay thermopylae is stretched where broadest spread it measures threescore paces bounded here by the deep ooze which underneath presents its dreary surface there the lofty cliffs of woody oeta overlook the pass and far beyond over half the surge below their horrid umbrage cast across the straits an ancient bulwark of the phocians stands a wall with turrets crowned in station here i found the locrians and from thespias gates sevn hundred more demophilus has led his brothers son attends him to the camp young dithyrambus greatly famed in war but more for temperance of mind renowned loved by his country and with honors graced his early bloom with brightest glory shines nor wantons in the blaze here agis spoke well have thou painted that illustrious youth he was my host at thespia though adorned with highest deeds by fame and fortune crowned his gentle virtues take from envys mouth its blasting venom and her baneful face strives on his worth to smile in silence all again remain and alpheus thus pursues a chosen troop has bold plataea sent small in its numbers but unmatched in arms above the rest diomedon their chief excels in prowess signal were his deeds upon that day of glory when the fields of marathon were hid with persian slain these guard thermopylae among the hills a winding path to strangers feet unknown affords another entrance into greece this by a thousand phocians is secured here alpheus paused leonidas embraced the noble spartan and rejoined thou know what fate to me the immortal gods ordain frame now thy choice accompany our march or go to lacedaemon and relate how thy discerning mind and active limbs have served thy country from the impatient mouth of alpheus straight these fervent accents broke i have not measured such a tract of land not looked unwearied on the setting sun and through the shade of midnight urged my steps to rouse the greeks to battle that myself might be exempted from the glorious toil return oh no a second time my feet shall visit thee thermopylae and there with great leonidas shall alpheus find an honorable grave and oh amid his countrys danger if a spartan breast may feel a private sorrow not alone for injured greece i hasten to revenge but for a brothers wrongs a younger hope than i or maron blessed our fathers years child of his age and polydorus named his mind while tender in its opening prime was bent to rigid virtue generous scorn of pain and danger taught his early strength to struggle patient with severest toils often when inclement winter chilled the air and frozen showers had swollen eurotas stream amid the impetuous channel would he plunge and breast the torrent on a fatal day as in the sea his active limbs he bathed a servile corsair of the persian king my brother naked and defenseless bore even in my sight to asia there to waste with all the promise of its growing worth his youth in bondage never can my tongue my pains recount much less my fathers woes the days he wept the sleepless nights he beat his aged bosom and shall alpheus spear be absent from thermopylae nor claim o polydorus vengeance for thy bonds in that first slaughter of the barbarous foe here interposed dieneces the hands of alpheus and leonidas he grasped and joyful thus your glory wants no more than that lycurgus should himself arise to praise the virtue which his laws inspire thus passed these heroes till the dead of night the hours in friendly converse and enjoyed each others virtue happiest of men at length with gentle heaviness the hand of sleep invades their eyelids on the ground oppressed with slumber they extend their limbs when sliding down the hemisphere the moon now plunged in midnight gloom her silver head end of the first book leonidas book ii the argument leonidas on his approach to the isthmus is met by the leaders of the troops sent from other grecian states and by the deputies who composed the isthmian council he harangues them then proceeds in conjunction with the other forces toward thermopylae is joined by dithyrambus and arrives at the straits about noon on the fourth day after his departure from the isthmus he is received at thermopylae by the thespian commander demophilus and by anaxander the theban treacherously recommending epialtes a malian who seeks by a pompous description of the persian power to intimidate the grecian leaders as they are viewing the enemies camp from the top of mount oeta he is answered by dieneces and diomedon xerxes sends tigranes and phraortes to the grecian camp who are dismissed by leonidas and conducted back by dithyrambus and diomedon which last incensed with the insolence of tigranes treats him with contempt and menaces this occasions a challenge to single combat between diomedon and tigranes dithyrambus and phraortes epialtes after a conference with anaxander declares his intention of returning to xerxes  aurora spread her purple beams around when moved the spartans their approach is known the isthmian council and the various chiefs who led the auxiliar bands proceed to meet leonidas eupalamus the strong alcmaeon clonius diophantus brave and hegesander at their head advanced aristobulus whom mycenaes youth attend to war mycenae once elate with power and dazzling wealth and vaunting still the name of agamemnon who along the seas of asia opened to the wind unnumberd sails and darkened half the shore of trembling phrygia with the hostile shade aristobulus joined the spartan king and thus began leonidas survey mycenaes race should every other greek be awed by xerxes and his asian host believe not we can fear derived from those who once conducted over the foaming surge the strength of greece who desert left the fields of ravaged asia and her proudest walls from their foundations humbled to the dust leonidas replied not but addressed the chiefs around illustrious warriors hail who thus undaunted signalize your faith and generous ardour in the common cause but you whose counsels prop the grecian state o venerable synod whose decrees have called us forth to vanquish or to die thrice hail whatever by valor we obtain your wisdom must preserve with piercing eyes each grecian state contemplate and discern their various tempers some with partial care to guard their own neglect the public weal cold and unmoved are others terror here and there corruption reigns o fire the brave with generous zeal to quit their native walls and join their valor in the general cause confirm the wavering animate the cold and watch the faithless some there are betray themselves and greece their perfidy prevent or call them back to honor let us all be linked in sacred union and the greeks shall stand the worlds whole multitude in arms if for the spoil which paris bore to troy a thousand barks the hellespont overspread shall not again confederated greece be roused to battle and to freedom give what once she gave to fame behold we haste to stop the invading tyrant till we bleed he shall not pour his millions on your plains but as the gods conceal how long our strength may stand unconquered or how soon must fall waste not a moment till consenting greece range all her freeborn numbers in the field leonidas concludes when awful stepped before the sage assembly one whose head was hoar with aged snow and thus replied thy great example every heart unites from thee her happiest omens greece derives of concord freedom victory and fame go then o first of mortals and impress amaze and terror in the persians breast the freeborn greeks instructing life to deem less dear than virtue and their countrys cause this heard leonidas thy secret soul exulting tasted of the sweet reward due to thy name from endless time his eyes once more he turned and viewed in rapturous thought his native land which he alone can save then summoned all his majesty and over the isthmus trod behind the grecians move in deep arrangement so the imperial bark with stately bulk along the beating tide in military pomp conducts the power of some proud navy bounding from the port to bear the vengeance of a mighty state against a tyrants walls the grecians march till noon when halting as they take repast upon the plain before them they descry a troop of thespians one above the rest in eminence precedes his glittering shield whose spacious orb collects the effulgent beams which from his throne meridian phoebus cast flames like another sun a snowy plume falls over his dazzling cask in wanton curls which floated in the breathing air around the lofty crest it waved approaching near beneath the honors of his radiant helm the warrior now a countenance displayed where youth in rosy prime with sweetness mixed its manly beauty with such modest grace respectful near leonidas he came as all ideas of his own desert were lost in veneration phoebus thus appears before his everlasting sire when from his altar in the imbowring grove of palmy delos or the hallowed bound of tenedos or claros where he hears his hymns and praises from the sons of men he reascends the high olympian seats such reverential awe his brow invests diffusing over the glowing flower of youth new loveliness and grace the king receives the illustrious thespian and began my tongue would call thee dithyrambus for thou bear all in thy aspect to become that name for valor known and virtue o reveal thy birth and charge whoever thou art my soul desires to know thee and would call thee friend to whom the youth returned o first of greeks my name is dithyrambus which the lips of some benevolent and generous friend to thee have sounded with a partial voice and thou have heard with favorable ears i come deputed by the thespian chief the theban and the locrian and the brave diomedon to hasten thy approach three days will bring the persian powers in view he ceased at once the standards are upreard the host till evening with impetuous pace their march continue through the earliest dews of morning they proceed and reach the pass ever the fourth sun attained the sultry noon to their impatient sight no sooner rose the rocks of oeta but with rapid feet and martial sounds of joy they rushed along as if the present deity of fame her temples with unfading laurels bound and in her hand her adamantine trump had from the hills her radiant form disclosed and bade their valor hasten to the field that she their acts beholding might resound their name and glory over the earth and seas before the van leonidas advanced his eye confessed the ardour of his mind which thus found uttrance from his eager lips all hail thermopylae and you the powers which here preside all hail ye silvan gods ye fountain nymphs who pour your lucid rills in broken murmurs down the rugged steep receive us o benignant and support the cause of greece conceal the secret paths which over the crags and through the forests wind untrod by human feet and traced alone by your immortal footsteps o defend your own recesses nor let impious war profane the solemn silence of your groves thus on your hills your praises shall you hear from those whose deeds shall tell the approving world that not to undeservers did you grant your high protection you my valiant friends now rouse the generous spirit which inflames your breasts now prove the vigor of your arms that your recorded actions may survive within the breasts of all the brave and free and sound delightful in the ear of time as long as neptune beats the malian bay or those tall cliffs erect their shaggy tops so near to heaven your monuments of fame as in some torrid region where the head of ceres bends beneath its golden load if on the parching ground a fatal spark fall from a burning brand the sudden blaze increased and aided by tumultuous winds in rapid torrents of involving flames sweeps over the crackling plain and mounting high in ruddy spires illumines half the skies not with less swiftness through the glowing ranks the words of great leonidas diffused a more than mortal fervor every heart distends with great ideas such as raise the patriots virtue and the soldiers fire when danger in its most tremendous form seems to their eyes most lovely in their thoughts imagination pictures all the scenes of war the purple field the heaps of death and glittering trophies pild with persian arms but now the grecian leaders who before were stationd near thermopylae accost the spartan king the thespian chief allied to dithyrambus first the silence broke an ancient warrior from behind his casque whose crested weight his aged temples pressed his slender hairs which time had silvered over flowed venerable down he thus began joy now shall crown the period of my days and whether with my fathers dust i sleep or slain by persias sword i press the earth our common parent be it as the gods shall best determine for the present hour i bless their bounty which has given my age to see the great leonidas and bid the hero welcome on this glorious shore where he by heaven selected from mankind shall fix the basis of the grecian weal here too the wily anaxander spoke hail glorious chief of all the theban race we shall at least with gladsome bosoms meet the great defender of the grecian cause o may oblivion over the shame of thebes its darkest wing extend or they alone be cursed by fame whose impious counsels turn their countrymen from virtue thebes alas still had been buried in dishonest sloth had not to wake her languor alpheus come the messenger of freedom o accept our grateful hearts thou alpheus art the cause that anaxander from his native gates here has not borne a solitary spear nor these inglorious in their walls remained but longer do we loiter haste my friends to yonder cliff which points its shade afar and view the persian camp the morning sun beheld their numbers hide the adjacent plains lo here a malian epialtes named who with the foe from thracias bounds has marched he said his seeming virtue all deceived the camp not long had epialtes joined by race a malian eloquent his tongue but false his heart and abject he was skilled to grace perfidious counsels and to cloth in swelling phrase the baseness of his soul foul nurse of treasons to the tents of greece himself a greek a faithless spy he came soon to the friends of xerxes he repaired the theban chiefs and nightly consult held how best with consternation to deject the spartan valor or how best betray with him the leaders climb the arduous hill from whence the dreadful prospect they command where endless plains by white pavilions hid spread like the vast atlantic when no shore no rock or promontory stops the sight unbounded as it wanders but the moon resplendent eye of night in fullest orb throughout the interminated surface throws its rays abroad and decks in snowy light the dancing billows such was xerxes camp a power unrivaled by the greatest king or conqueror that ever with ruthless hands dissolving all the sacred ties which bind the happiness of nations have alarmed the sleeping fury discord from her den not from the hundred brazen gates of thebes the towers of memphis and the pregnant fields by niles prolifick torrents deluged over ever flowed such armies with the egyptian lord renowned sesostris who with trophies filled the vanquished earth and over the rapid foam of distant tanais and the huge expanse of trembling ganges spread his dreaded name nor yet in asias far extended bounds ever met such numbers not when belus drew the assyrian bands to conquest or the pride of highexalted babylon surveyed the plains along euphrates covered wide with armed myriads swarming from her walls when at the rage of dire semiramis peace fled affrighted from the ravaged east yet all this hideous face of war dismays no grecian heart unterrified they stood the immeasurable camp with fearless eyes they traverse while in meditation near the treacherous malian waits collecting all his pomp of words to paint the hostile power nor yet with falsehood arms his fraudful tongue to feign a tale of terror truth herself beyond the reach of fiction to inhance now aids his treason and with cold dismay might pierce the boldest breast unless secured by dauntless virtue which disdains to live from liberty divorced requested now by every voice the traitor spoke and all attentive ears incline oh greeks and friends can i behold my native malian fields presenting hostile millions to your sight and not with grief suppress the horrid tale which you exact from these illomend lips on thracias sands i first beheld the foe when joining europe with the asian shore a mighty bridge the outrageous waves restrained and stemd the impetuous current while in arms the universal progeny of men seemed all before me trampling over the sea by thousands and ten thousands persians medes assyrians saces indians swarthy files from aethiopia aegypts tawny sons arabians bactrians parthians all the strength of libya and of asia neptune groaned beneath the burden and indignant heaved his neck against the incumbent weight in vain the violence of boreas and the west with rage combined against the unshaken pile dashed half the hellespont the eastern world sevn days and nights uninterrupted pass and pour on thracias confines they accept the persian lord and range their hardy race beneath his standards macedonias youth with all thessalia next and every greek who dwells beyond thermopylae attend thus not alone embodied asia lifts her threatening lance but macedon and thrace whose martial loins with daring warriors teem and faithless greeks in multitudes untold the persian monarch aid celestial powers and thou who reignest over men and gods who in a moment by thy will supreme can quell the mighty in their proudest hopes and raise the weak to safety thou impart thy instant succor interpose thy arm with lightning blast their legions oh confound with triplebolted thunder persias camp whence like an inundation with the morn shall millions rush and overwhelm the greeks resistance else were vain against an host which covers all thessalia for beyond the malian plains thus widely stretched below beyond the utmost measure of the sight bent from the height of this aspiring cliff lie yet more hideous numbers which might drain the streams of copious rivers with their thirst and with their arrows hide the midday sun then shall we join our battle in the shade dieneces replied not calmly thus diomedon on xerxes camp he bends his lowering brow which frowns had furrowed over and thus exclaimed bellona turn and view with joyful eyes that field the fatal stage which regal madness has for you prepared to exercise your horrors thou o death shall riot here unceasing when the rocks of yonder pass with bleeding ranks are strewn and all who shun the avenging steel of greece by pestilence and meager famine seized shall with variety of ruin feast thy unabated hunger thus he spoke while on the host immense his gloomy eyes he fixed disdainful and its strength defied meantime within the entrenchment of the greeks from asias monarch delegated came tigranes and phraortes from the hills leonidas conducts the impatient chiefs around the hero in his tent they throng when thus tigranes their attention calls ambassadors from persias king we stand before you grecians to display the power of our great master were a needless task the name of xerxes asias mighty lord invincible and seated on a throne surpassing human luster must have reached the extremest border of the earth and taught the hearts of men to own resistless force with awe and low submission yet i swear by yon refulgent orb which flames above the glorious symbol of the eternal power this military throng this show of war persuade me you have never heard that name at whose dread sound the billows wide remote of indus tremble and the caspian wave the egyptian tide and hellespontic surge with homage roll o impotent and rash whom yet the large beneficence of heaven and our great monarch merciful and kind deign to preserve resign your arms disperse each to your cities there with humblest hands before your lord bestrew the way with flowers as through the extensive grove whose leafy boughs intwining crown some eminence with shade the tempests rush sonorous and between the crashing branches roar by fierce disdain and indignation thus the grecians moved with clamorous murmurs close the persians speech but spartas king arising all is hushed in sudden silence when he thus replied o persian when to xerxes thou returnst say thou have told the wonders of his power then say thou saw a slender band of greece which dares his boasted millions to the field the spartan said thambassadors retire them over the limits of the grecian lines diomedon and thespias youth conduct with slow solemnity they all proceed in sullen silence but their looks denote what speech would shame and weaken wrath contracts the forehead of diomedon his teeth gnash with impatience for delayed revenge disdain which sprung from conscious merit flushed the cheek of dithyrambus on the face of either persian insolence and pride incensed by disappointment gloomy lowrd but when they reached the limits of the straits where xerxes camp began to open wide its deep immense arrangement then the heart of vain tigranes swelling at the sight thus overflows in loud and haughty phrase o arimanius origin of ill have we demanded of thy ruthless power thus with the curse of madness to afflict these wretched men but since thy dreadful will to irresistible perdition dooms the sons of greece in vain should we oppose be thy dire will accomplished let them fall and fatten with their blood their native soil enraged the stern diomedon replies thou servile base dependent on a king inglorious mercenary slave to those whom most we scorn thou boaster do thou know that i beheld the marathonian field when like the libyan sands before the wind your host was scattered by thunconquerd greeks where thou perhaps did turn before this arm to ignominious flight thy shivering limbs o may i find thee in to morrows fight then on this rocky pavement shall thou lie beneath this arm to feast the vultures beak he ended here and thus the persian chief o thou whose hand omnipotent protects the throne of xerxes bend thy sacred ear for lo my first victorious fruits of war to thee i here devote the gory spoils which from this grecian with the rising dawn in sight of either host my arm shall rend phraortes interrupting then began i too would find among the grecian chiefs one who in battle dare abide my spear to him thus answered thespias gallant youth thou look on me o persian worthier far thou might indeed have singled from our host but none more willing to essay thy force yes i will prove before the eye of mars how far the valor of the meanest greek beyond thy vaunts deserves the palm of fame this said the persians to their king repair back to their camp the grecians there they found each soldier poizing his extended spear and his large buckler bracing on his arm for instant war prepared through all the files each leader moves exulting and with praise and exhortations aids their native warmth alone the theban anaxander pined who thus apart addressed his malian friend what has thy lofty eloquence availed alas in vain attempting to confound the spartan valor with redoubled fires see how their bosoms glow they wish to die and wait impatient for the unequal fight too soon will come the insuperable foes and in promiscuous ruin all be whelmed nor shall our merit to the persian lord be told or known for whose adventurous feet to serve the thebans through the guarded pass the grecian watch eluding will approach the tents of asia that the king may know and spare his friends amid the general wreck when his highswoln resentment like a flood increased with stormy showers shall cover greece with desolation epialtes here whence anaxander this unjust despair is there a path on oetas hills unknown to epialtes over the trackless rock and mazy grove shall pass my secret steps this night i part thy merit shall be told to persias king thou only watch the hour nor then be tardy when he wants thy aid end of the second book leonidas book iii the argument tigranes and phraortes repair to xerxes whom they find seated on a throne surrounded by his satraps in a magnificent pavilion while the magi stand before him and sing an hymn containing the religion of zoroastres xerxes notwithstanding the arguments of his brothers hyperanthes and abrocomes gives no credit to the ambassadors who report that the grecians are determined to maintain the pass against him but commands demaratus an exiled king of sparta to attend him and ascends his chariot to take a view of the grecians himself he passes through the midst of his army consisting of many nations differing in arms customs and manners he advances to the entrance of the straits and surprised at the behavior of the spartans demands the reason of it from demaratus which occasions a conversation between them on the mercenary forces of persia and the militia of greece demaratus weeping at the fight of his countrymen is comforted by hyperanthes xerxes still incredulous commands tigranes and phraortes to bring the grecians bound before him the next day and retires to his pavilion  now had tigranes and phraortes gained the splendid tent of xerxes him they found begirt with princes and illustrious chiefs the potentates of asia near his side his valiant brothers stood abrocomes and hyperanthes then pharnuchus brave pandates intaphernes mighty lords and numbers more in purple splendor clad with homage all attending round the throne whose gorgeous seat erected high upbore their regal master he above their heads looked down imperious so the stately tower of belus mingling its majestic front with heavens bright azure from on high surveyed the huge extent of babylon with all its sumptuous domes and palaces beneath that day the monarch deemed to enter greece and hide her fields with war but first ordains that grateful hymns should celebrate the name of oromasdes so the persians called the worlds great author by the kings decree the magi stood before the unfolded tent fire blazed beside them toward the sacred flame they turned and sent their tuneful praise to heaven from zoroastres was the song derived who on the hills of persia from his cave with flowers incircled and with murmuring founts that cheered the solemn mansion had revealed how oromasdes radiant source of good original immortal framed the globe with all its varied beauty how with stars by him the heavens were spangled how the sun refulgent mithra purest spring of light and genial warmth whence fruitful nature smiles burst from the east at his creating voice when straight beyond the golden verge of day night showed the horrors of her distant reign whence black and hateful arimanius sprung the author foul of evil he with shades from his dire mansion veiled the earth and skies or to destruction changed the solar beam when parching fields deny the foodful grain and from their channels fly the exhaling streams whence pestilence and famine how the power of oromasdes in the human breast benevolence and equity infused truth temperance and wisdom sprung from heaven when arimanius blackened all the soul with falsehood and injustice with desires insatiable with violence and rage malignity and folly if the hand of oromasdes on precarious life shed wealth and pleasure soon the infernal god with wild excess or avarice blasts the joy thou oromasdes victory do give by thee with fame the regal head is crowned great xerxes owns thy succor when with storms the hate of direful arimanius swelled the hellespont thou over the angry surge the destined master of the world did lead this day his promised glories to enjoy when greece affrighted to his arm shall bend even as at last shall arimanius fall before thy might and evil be no more the magi ceased their harmony when now before the king with adoration bowed tigranes and phraortes prone they lay and over their foreheads spread their abject hands as from a present deity too bright for mortal vision to conceal their eyes at length in humble phrase tigranes thus o xerxes live for ever gracious lord who do permit thy servants to approach thy awful sight and prostrate thus to own thy majesty and greatness may the power of oromasdes stretch thy sceptered arm over all the nations from the indian shores even to the waters of the western main from northern tanais to the source of nile and still from thee may arimanius turn against thy foes his malice to mankind by him even now with frenzy smote the greeks reject thy proffered clemency the morn shall see them bleed the victims of thy wrath here to his brothers turning xerxes spoke say hyperanthes does thy soul believe these tidings sure these slaves have never dared to face the grecians but delude our ear with base impostures which their fears suggest to him this answer hyperanthes formed o from his servants may the king avert his indignation greece was famed of old for martial virtue and intrepid sons i have essayed their valor and with me abrocomes can witness when our sire the great darius to the athenian shore with artaphernes and with datis sent our tender youth at marathon we found how vain the hopes that numbers should dismay a foe resolved on victory or death yet not as one contemptible or base let me appear before thee though the greeks with such unconquered spirits be indud soon as the king shall summon me to war he shall behold me in the dangerous van exalt my spear and pierce the hostile ranks or sink before them xerxes then returned why over asia and the libyan soil with all their nations does my potent arm extend its scepter wherefore do i sweep across the globe with millions in my train why shade the ocean with unnumberd sails whence all this power unless the eternal will had doomed to give one master to the world and that the earths extremity alone should bound my empire he for this reduced revolted egypt and enlarged my sway with sandy libya and the sultry clime of aethiopia he for this subdued the hellespontic rage and taught the sea obedience to my power then cease to think that heaven deserting now the cause of kings those despicable grecians will inspire with courage more than human and expunge the common fears of nature from their breasts he ceased when thus abrocomes began the king commands us to reveal our hearts then may the sun to lightning change his beams and blast my head with ruin may the king look on his servant with a loathing eye if what i here affirm be false or vain that yonder grecians will oppose our course the king arose no more prepare my car the spartan exile demaratus call we will our selves advance and view the foe the monarch willed and suddenly he hears his trampling horses high on silver wheels the ivory car with azure sapphirs shone caerulean beryls and the jasper green the emerald the rubys glowing blush the flaming topaz with its golden beam the pearl the impurpled amathyst and all the various gems which indias mines afford to deck the pomp of kings in burnished gold a sculptured eagle from behind displays its stately neck and over the monarchs head extends its dazzling wings eight generous steeds which on the famed nysaean plain were nursed in wintry media drew the radiant car not those of old to hercules refused by false laomedon nor they which bore the son of thetis through the scattered rear of troys devoted race might these surpass in strength or beauty with obedient pride they heard their lord exulting in the air they tossed their foreheads while the silver manes smote on their glittering necks the king ascends beside his footstool demaratus sat the charioteer now shakes the golden reins bold patiramphes at the signal bound the attentive steeds the chariot flew behind ten thousand horse in thunder swept the field the eastern bands so xerxes had ordained between the seabeat margin and the camp all wait imbattled all prepared to pass thermopylae to these with rapid wheels the imperial car proceeds the approaching king soon through the wide battalions is proclaimed he now draws nigh the innumerable host roll back by nations and admit their lord with all his satraps from his crystal dome raised on the bottom of the watery world thus when the potent ruler of the floods with each caerulean deity ascends throned on his pearly chariot all the deep divides its bosom to the emerging god so xerxes rode between the asian world on either side receding when as down the immeasurable ranks his sight was lost a momentary gloom overcast his mind while this reflection filled his eyes with tears that soon as time an hundred years had told not one of all those thousands should survive whence to obscure thy pride arose that cloud was it that once humanity could touch a tyrants breast or rather did thy soul repine o xerxes at the bitter thought that all thy power was mortal but the veil of sadness soon forsook his brightning eyes as with adoring homage millions bowed and to his heart relentless pride recalled elate the mingled prospect he surveys of glittering files unnumberd chariots scythd on thundering axles rolled with haughty steeds in sumptuous trappings clad barbaric pomp which tore with spurning hoofs the sandy beach while every banner to the sun expands its gorgeous folds that beamed with gold with shields tiaras helms environed and with spears in number equal to the bladed grass whose living green in vernal beauty clothes thessalias vale what powers of sounding verse can to the mind present the amazing scene not thee whom rumours fabling voice delights poetic fancy to my aid i call but thou historic truth support my song which shall the various multitude display their arms their manners and their native seats the persians first in scaly corselets shone with colors varying on the gorgeous sleeves a generous nation from their infant age their tongues were practiced in the love of truth their limbs inured to every manly toil to brace the bow to rule the impetuous steed and dart the javelin worthy to enjoy the liberty their injured fathers lost whose arms for cyrus overturned the strength of babylon and sardis and advanced the victors head above his countrys laws such were the persians but untaught to form the ranks of battle with unequal force against the phalanx of the greeks they stood and to the massy shield and weighty spear a target light and slender lance opposed on every head tiaras rose like towers impenetrable all with burnished gold blazed their gay sandals and the floating reins of each proud courser daggers from their thighs a wellstord quiver from their shoulders hung and strongest bows of mighty size they bore next with resembling arms the medes are seen the cissians and hyrcanians media once from her bleak mountains awed the subject east her kings in cold ecbatana were throned the cissians marched from susas regal walls from sultry fields overspread with branching palms and white with lillies watered by the tides of famed choaspes whose transparent waves the golden goblet wafts to persias kings no other stream the royal lip bedews hyrcanias race forsook their fruitful clime dark with the verdure of expanding oaks to ceres dear and bacchus there the corn bent by its golden burden sheds unreapd its plenteous seed impregnating the soil with future harvests while the bees reside among the intwining branches of the groves where with their labors they enrich the leaves which flow with sweetness next assyrias sons their brazen helms display thunskilful work of rude barbarians thickwove flax defends their chest and loins a buckler guards their arm girt with a falchion each a mace sustains oerlaid with iron on euphrates banks in babylons stupendous walls they dwell and over the plains where once with mightier towers old ninus reared its head the imperial seat of eldest tyrants these chaldaea joins the land of shepherds on the pastures wide there belus first discerned the various course of heavens bright planets and the clustring stars with names distinguished whence himself was deemed the chief of gods his heavnascending fane in babylon the proud assyrians raised drawn from the fertile soil which ochus laves the bactrians stood like persias bands attired though less their javelins and their bows of cane the paricanians next all rough with hides of shaggy goats with bows and daggers armed alike in horrid garb the caspian train from barren mountains and the dreary coast which bounds the stormy lake that bears their name with cany bows and scymetars were led the indians then a threefold band appeared part guide the horse and part the rapid car the rest on foot within the bending cane for slaughter held their ironpointed reeds these over the indus from the distant floods of ganges passed and left a region loved by lavish nature there the plenteous year twice crowned with harvests smiles the honeyd shrub the cinnamon and spikenard bless their fields arrayed in native wealth the warriors shone their ears were graced with pendants and their hands incircled wore a bracelet starrd with gems these were the nations who to xerxes sent their mingled aids of infantry and horse now muse recount what numbers yet untold on foot obscured the surface of the shore or who in chariots or on camels beat the loosened sand the parthians first advance then weak in numbers over the malian strand far from their lonely vales and woody hills not yet renowned for warlike steeds they trod with them the sogdians dadices arrangd gandarians and chorasmians all attired like bactrias sons to these the saces join from cold imaus drawn from oxus waves and cyra built on iaxartes brink the bound of persias empire wild untamed and prone to rage their deserts they forsook a bow a falchion and a ponderous ax the savage legions armed a pointed cask over each grim visage reared its iron cone in arms like persians the saranges stood high as the knee their buskins stretched and clung around their ham with glowing colors died gay shone their varied garments next are seen the pactyan mycian and the utian train in skins of goats all horrid bows they wield of springy reed with poynards at their sides with spotted hides of leopards all arrayed or with the spoil from tawny lions torn in graceful range the aethiopians stand of equal stature and a beauteous frame though scorching phoebus had imbrownd their face and curled their crisped locks in ancient song renowned for justice riches they disdained as foes to virtue from their seat remote on nilus verge above the egyptian bound forced by their kings malignity and pride these friends of hospitality and peace themselves uninjurd waged reluctant war against a land whose climate and whose name to them were strange with hardest stone they point the rapid arrow bows of hideous length formed with thelastic branches of the palm they bore and lances armed with horns of goats and maces strong with iron now o muse recite the nations who in helmets framed of various parts and closeconnected joints with darts and poynards shields and lances weak a feeble train attend their tyrants will all victims destined to imbrue with gore the grecian spears the paphlagonians first from where carambis with projected brows oerlooks the dusky euxine wrapped in mists and where through flowers that paint its various banks parthenius flows the mariandynians next the matienian and the ligyan bands with them the syrian multitudes who dwell near daphnes grove who cultivate the glebe widewaterd by orontes who along the extended ridge of libanus are nursed among the cedars or with foodful dates plucked from the palms

juice along the lovely side of winding jordan till immersed it sleep beneath the pitchy surface which obscures the asphaltic lake the phrygians then advance to them their ancient colony is joined the armenian bands these see the bursting springs of strong euphrates cleave the yielding earth and wide in lakes expanding hide the plain thence with collected waters fierce and deep its passage rending through diminished rocks to babylon it foams not so the wave of soft araxes to the caspian glides but stealing imperceptibly it laves the fruitful herbage of armenias meads next strange to view in

seat on strymon where in thrace it pours its freezing current for the distant shores of fishy sangar these bithynians named their habitations to the sacred feet of dindymus extend yet there they groaned beneath oppression and their freedom mourned on sangar now as once on strymon lost the ruddy skins of foxes formed their cask their shields were fashioned like the horned moon a dart and slender poynard armed their hands a vest embraced their bodies while abroad tinged with unnumberd hues a mantle flowed but other thracians who their former name retained in asia stood with shining helms the horns of bulls in imitating brass adorned the lofty crest phoenician cloth their legs infolds with brightest purple stained and through the forest wont to chase the boar a hunters spear they grasp what nations still on either side of xerxes while he passed present their huge array and swell his soul with more than mortal pride the numerous train of moschians and macronians now succeed and mosynoecians who with berries fed in wooden towers along the pontic shore repose their painted limbs the mirthful race of tibarenians next whose wanton minds delight in sport and laughter all in casks of wood with shields and lances small whose points beyond proportion lengthen then approach in garments over their spacious bosom clasped and part with javelins part with lycian bows a people destined in eternal verse even thine sublime maeonides to live these are the milyans solymi their name in thy celestial strains pifidias hills their dwelling once a formidable train they faced the great bellerophon in war now doomed a more tremendous foe to meet themselves unnervd with bondage and to leave their putrid bodies for the dogs of greece next are the marian legions furnished all with shields of skins with darts and helmets wove of strongest texture arias host protend the bactrian lance and brace the persian bow drawn from a region horrid all with thorn one hideous waste of sands which mock the toil of patient culture save one favored spot which like an isle emerges from the wild in verdure clad and interspersed with vines whose generous clusters yield a juice that scorns the injuries of time yet natures hand had sown their rocks with coral and enriched their desert hills with veins of sapphirs blue and those whose azure sparks of gold adorn these from the turbant flame on every neck the coral blushes through the numerous throng the allarodians and sasperian bands were armed with poniards like the cholchian host their heads were guarded with a helm of wood short were their spears of hides undressed their shields the cholchians marched from phasis and the shores where once medea fair enchantress stood and wondering viewed the first adventurous bark that stemd the pontic foam from argos side the demigods descended and repaired to her fell sires inhospitable walls his blooming graces jason there displayed with every art of eloquence divine he claimed the golden fleece the virgin heard she gazed with fatal ravishment and loved then to the hero she resigns her heart her magic tames the brazenfooted bulls she lulls the sleepless dragon and to greece with faithless jason wafts the radiant prize the cholchians then pursued their steps with war and now with ancient enmity inflamed or else compelled by xerxes to recall the longforgotten wrong they menace greece with desolation next in persian guise a crowd advanced who left the various isles in persias gulf and round arabia known some in their native topaz were adorned from ophiodes and topazos sprung and some with shells of tortoises which brood around casitis verge to them were joined those who reside where erythras entombed lies all beset with palms a powerful king who named of old the erythraean main the lybians next are placed in chariots scythd they sat terrific clothed in skins with darts of wood welltempered in the hardening flames not libyas deserts from tyrannic sway could hide her sons much less could freedom dwell amid the plenty of arabias fields where spicy cassia and the fragrant reed and myrrh and hallowed frankincense perfume the zephirs wing a bow of largest size the arabians wield and over their lucid vest loose floats a mantle on their shoulder clasped of these two myriads on the lofty back of camels rode that matched the swiftest horse such were the numbers which from asia led bowed down with low prostration to the wheels of xerxes chariot yet what legions more expand their mighty range what banners still the malian sands oershadow forward rolls the regal car through nations which in arms and ordered ranks unlike the eastern throng upheld the spear and buckler yet untaught to bend the servile knee erect they stood unless that mourning over the shameful weight of their new bondage some their brows depressed and stained their arms with sorrow europes race were these whom xerxes by resistless force had gathered to his standards murmuring here the sons of thrace and macedonia stood here on his steed the brave thessalian frowned there pined reluctant multitudes who bore the name of greeks and peopled all the coast between byzantium and the malian bay through all the numbers which adored his pride or feared his power the monarch now was passed nor yet among those myriads could be found one who with xerxes self in towering size or beauteous features might compare o wretch possessed of all but virtue doomed to show how mean without her is unbounded power the charm of beauty and the blaze of state how insecure of happiness how vain thou who could mourn the common lot which heaven from none withholds which often to thousands proves their only refuge from a tyrants rage and which by pining sickness age or pain becomes at last a soothing hope to all thou who could weep that natures gentle hand should lay her wearied offspring in the tomb yet could remorseless from their peaceful seats lead half the nations in a clime unknown to fall the victims of thy ruthless pride what did thou merit from the injured world what sufferings to compensate for the tears of asias mothers for unpeopled realms and all this waste of nature on his host the king exulting bends his haughty sight when thus to demaratus he began now demaratus to thy soul recall my father great darius who received thy wandering steps expelled their native home ill would it then become thee to beguile thy benefactors and the truth disguise look back on all those thousands and declare if yonder grecians will oppose their march the exile answered deem not mighty lord i will deceive thy goodness by a tale forged for their glory whose deluded minds perversely hearkened to the slandrers tongue who forced me with unmerited disgrace to tread the paths of banishment and woe nor be the king offended while i speak the words of truth the spartans never fly here with contemptuous smiles the king returned will thou who once were lacedaemons chief encounter twenty persians yet those greeks with greater disproportion must confront our host tomorrow demaratus thus by single combat were the trial vain and vainer still by my unworthy sword to prove the merit of united force which often by military skill surmounts the strength of numbers nor in fields of war the greeks excel by discipline alone but from their manners grant thy ear o king the difference learn of grecian bands and thine the flower the bulwark of thy powerful host are mercenaries these are cantoned round thy provinces no fertile field demands their painful hand to turn the fallow glebe them to the noonday toil no harvest calls the stubborn oak along the mountains brow sinks not beneath their stroke with careful eyes they mark not how the flocks or heifers feed to them of wealth and all possessions void the name of country with an empty sound flies over the ear nor warms their joyless hearts who share no country needy yet with scorn rejecting labor wretched by their wants yet profligate through indolence with limbs soft and enervate and with minds corrupt from misery debauchery and sloth are these to battle drawn against a foe inured to hardship and the child of toil wont through the freezing shower and wintry storm over his own glebe the tardy ox to goad or in the suns impetuous heat to glow beneath the burden of the yellow sheaves whence on himself on her whose faithful arms infold him joyful and a numerous race which glads his dwelling plenty he bestows with independence and when called to war for these his dearest comfort and his care and for the harvest promised to his toil he lifts the shield nor shuns unequal force such are the powers of every state in greece one only breeds a race more warlike still even those who now defend that rocky pass the sons of lacedaemon they untaught to break the glebe or bind the golden sheaves to far severer labors are inured alone for war their sole delight and care from infancy to manhood are they formed to want and danger to the unwholesome ground to winter watches and inclement skies to plunge through torrents brave the tusky boar to arms and wounds an exercise of pain so fierce and constant that to them a camp with all its hardships is the seat of rest and war itself remission from their toils thy words are folly scornful here replied the persian monarch does not freedom dwell among the grecians therefore will they shun superior foes for whosoeer is free will fly from danger while the persians know if from the allotted station they retreat the scourge awaits them and my heavy wrath conceive not xerxes spartas chief returned the grecians want an object where to fix their eyes with reverence and obedient dread to them more aweful than the name of king to asias trembling millions is the law whose sacred voice injoins them to confront unnumberd foes to vanquish or to die in silence now the banished king remained while near the straits the chariot rolled it chanced the spartans then were stationd out on guard these in gymnastic exercise employed nor heed the monarch nor his gaudy train but tossed the spear and whirled the rapid dart or met with adverse shields in single war or trooping swiftly rushed on every side with ranks unbroken and with equal feet while others calm beneath their polished helms drew down their hair which hung in sable curls and spread their necks with terror xerxes here the exile questions what do these intend who thus with careful hands adjust their hair to whom the spartan o imperial lord such is their custom to adorn their heads when with determined valor they present their dauntless breasts before the jaws of death bring down thy myriads all in glittering steel arm if thou can the general race of man all who possess the regions unexplord beyond the ganges all whose wandering steps behind the caspian range the scythian wild with those who drink the secret fount of nile yet to the breasts of spartas sons shall fear be still a stranger thus with fervor spoke the exiled king when gushing from his eyes resistless grief oerflowd his cheek aside his head he turned and wept in copious streams the sad remembrance of his former state his dignity his greatness and the sight of those brave ranks which thus unshaken stood and spread amazement through the world in arms excite those sorrows often with eager eyes he views the godlike warriors who beneath his standard once victorious fought who called him once their king and leader then again his head he bows with anguish and bedews his breast with tears in agony bemoans his faded honors his illustrious name forgotten now his majesty defiled with exile and dependence so obscured by creeping ivy and by sordid moss some lordly palace or stupendous fane magnificent in ruin stands where time widewasting from the nodding roof has mowed the column down and cleft the ponderous dome not unobserved by hyperanthes mourned the unhappy spartan kindly to his own the exiles hand he joins and thus humane o demaratus this thy grief confirms how well the greeks deserve thy generous praise who still repining do their loss deplore though cherished here with universal love but o let indignation in thy breast revive thy wrongs then bless the auspicious fate which led thee far from calumny and fraud to share the favor of the highest king as demaratus with a grateful mind addressed himself to answer persias king thus interrupted soon as morning shines do thou tigranes and phraortes head the medes and saces bring those grecians bound this said the monarch to his tent returned end of the third book leonidas book iv the argument leonidas rising by break of day commands a body of arcadians with the thespians and plataeans to be drawn out for battle in that part of thermopylae which lay under the phocian wall from whence he harangues them the enemy approaches diomedon kills tigranes in single combat both armies join battle dithyrambus kills phraortes the persians entirely defeated are pursued with great slaughter by diomedon and dithyrambus to the extremity of the pass the grecian commanders after the pursuit retire for refreshment to a cave in the side of mount oeta leonidas recals them to the camp and sends down fresh forces diomedon and dithyrambus with the plataeans are permitted to continue in the field by the advice of diomedon the grecians advance to the broadest part of thermopylae where they form a line of thirty in depth consisting of the plataeans mantineans tegaeans thebans corinthians phliasians and mycenaeans the attack is renewed with great violence by hyperanthes abrocomes and the principal persian leaders at the head of some chosen troops  laconias leader with the morning rose when thus to alpheus from arcadias bands select a thousand spears to these unite the thespians and plataeans range their lines before the wall which fortifies the pass there closeimbodied will their might repulse the numerous foe obedient to his will the appointed legions issuing from their tents with deepning ranks leonidas enclose so round their monarch in his stormy cave the winds assemble from his sable throne when aeolus sends forth his dread command to swell the main or heaven with clouds deform or bend the forest from the mountains brow the chief of sparta from the ramparts height thus to the fight the listening host inflames this day o grecians countrymen and friends your wives your offspring your paternal seats your fathers country liberty and laws have sent you hither from your infant age versed in the various discipline of mars laborious active virtuous brave and free to match your valor with ignoble foes in war unskilful natures basest dross the foes of all utility and worth and thence a monarchs mercenary slaves with spirits broke by servitude and want with limbs relaxed by sloth and wanton ease with minds debauched by vices uninspird by all thindearing cares in freeborn hearts who cold and drooping fight without a cause to whom defeat is neither grief nor shame who seek no fruit from victory but spoil these are the flower of asias host the rest who fill their boasted numbers are a crowd forced from their dwellings to the bloody field from whom till now with jealous care their lord has still withheld the instruments of war these are the people taught with patient grief to bear the rapine cruelty and spurns of xerxes mercenary bands and pine in servitude to slaves with terror sounds the trumpets clangor in their trembling ears unwonted loads the buckler and the lance their hands sustain encumbered and present the mockery of war  but every eye flames with impatient ardour and your breasts too long their swelling spirit have confined go then ye sons of liberty and sweep these bondmen from the field resistless rend the glittering standard from their servile hands hurl to the ground their ignominious heads the warriours helm profaning think the shades of your forefathers rear their sacred brows here to enjoy the glory of their sons he spoke loud paeans burst from all the host with fierce reply unnumberd shouts ascend from hostile nations thronging down the pass such is the roar of aetna when her mouth displodes combustion from her sulfurous depths and blasts the smiles of nature dauntless stood in deep array before the phocian wall the greeks closewedgd with implicated shields and spears protended like the graceful range of arduous elms whose interwoven boughs before some rural palace wide expand their venerable umbrage to retard the norths impetuous wing as over the main in lucid rows the rising waves reflect the suns effulgence so the grecian helms returned his light which over their unequal poured and scattered splendor on the dancing plumes down rushed the foe exulting in the van their haughty leader shakes his threatening lance and frowns defiance bursting from his rank diomedon with instant fury faced the impending foes meantime he loudly calls their chief tigranes whom he thus defies now thou art met barbarian would thou prove thy actions equal to thy vaunts command thy troops to halt while thou and i engage tigranes turning to the persians spoke my friends and soldiers check your ardent haste while my strong lance yon grecians pride confounds he ceased in dreadful opposition now each combatant advanced with sinewy hand they gripe their spears highbrandishd thrice they drove with welldirected force the pointed steel at eithers throat and thrice their shields repel the destined wound at length the eastern chief with all his powers collected for the stroke his javelin rivets in the grecian targe aside diomedon inclines and shuns approaching fate then all his martial skill undaunted summons his forsaken lance beside him cast his falchion he unsheaths the blade descending on tigranes arm that instant struggling to redeem his spear the shivering hand dissevers pale affright unmans the persian while his active foe full on his neck discharged the rapid sword and opened wide the purple gates of life low sinks tigranes in eternal shade the conqueror bestrides the prostrate dead then in the clotted ringlets of the hair his hand intwining from the bleeding trunk the head disjoined and whirled with sudden rage amid the hostile numbers all with dread recoil wherever the ghastly visage flew in sanguine circles and pursued its track of horror through the air not less amazed a barbarous nation whom the cheerful dawn of science never illumined view on high a meteor waving with portentous blaze where often as superstition vainly dreams some demon sits amid the baneful fires dispersing plagues and desolation round a while the stern diomedon remains triumphant over the dire dismay which froze the hearts of persia then with haughty port and sullen joy among his gladsome friends resumes his station still the asian bands with consternation motionless behold their foes with terror and suspend the fight when thus phraortes animates their breasts heavens can one leaders death appal this host which counts a train of monarchs for its chiefs behold phraortes from imaus ridge i draw my subject files with hardy toil i through the pathless forest have explored the tigers cavern this unconquered arm has from the lion rent the shaggy spoil so through this field of slaughter will i chase yon vaunting greek with ruin on his head for great tigranes slain his words revive the flame of valor through the drooping van then on the rear he brandishes his lance before him shrink the affrighted crowd and roll their numbers headlong on the grecian steel with loose arrangement and uncertain feet thus with his trident oceans angry god from its vast bottom turns the hideous mass of waters upward and oerwhelms the beach terrific stood the fierce plataean chief amid the grecian van his ample targe like a strong bulwark prominent he raised before the line there thundered all the storm of darts and arrows his undaunted train with emulating ardour charge the foe wherever they turn the formidable spears which drenched the glebe of marathon with gore the persians heap the plain diomedon leads on the slaughter from his nodding crest the sable plumes shook terror asias bands all shudder backward at the dreadful beams of that unconquerable sword which falls with lightnings swiftness over their trembling heads and reeking still with slain tigranes blood their shattered ranks oerturns the furious chief encompassed round with carnage and besmeared with sanguine drops inflames his warlike friends o dithyrambus let thy deeds this day surmount their wonted luster thou in arms demophilus worn gray thy youth recall behold these slaves without resistance bleed advance my ancient friend propitious fame smiles on thy years and gives thy aged hand to pluck fresh laurels for thy honored brow as when indud with promethean heat the molten clay respird with sudden warmth so glows the venerable thespians age with newborn vigor every sinew swells his falchion thundering on cherasmes helm the forehead clove ecbatana to war sent forth cherasmes from her potent gates he proud in hope her swarming numbers led with ariazus and pencestes joined his martial brothers they attend his doom by dithyrambus foiled their hoary sire shall over his solitary palace roam lamenting loud his childless years and curse ambitions fury and the lust of war then pining bow with anguish to the grave next by the fierce plataeans matchless sword expires damates once the host and friend of fallen tigranes him that day he joined and left his native bands of syrian birth in daphne he resided near the grove whose hospitable laurels in their shade concealed the virgin fugitive that scorned the embrace of phoebus hither she repaired far from her parent stream in fables feigned herself a laurel to have reared her head with verdant bloom in this retreat the grove of daphne called the seat of rural bliss fand by the wing of zephirs and with rills of bubbling founts irriguous syrias boast and happy rival of thessalias vale now hid for ever from damates eyes nor with unactive spears the arcadians stood gigantic clonius unresisted pressed the yielding persians who before him sunk crushed like vile stubble underneath the steps of some glad hind who visits over the plain his newshorn harvest with a fearless eye phraortes saw the general rout he sprung over hills of carnage to confront the greeks reproaching thus his own inglorious friends fly then ye cowards and desert your chief yet single here my falchion shall oppose the might of thousands raging thus he drove the deathful steel through aristanders breast him dithyrambus loved a sacred bard revered for justice for his verse renowned which sung the deeds of heroes those who fell or those who conquered in their countrys cause the inrapturd soul inspiring with the thirst of glory won by virtue his high strain the muses favored from their neighboring groves and blessed with heavenly melody his lyre no more from thespia shall his feet ascend the shady steep of helicon no more the streams divine of aganippes fount his tuneful lip shall moisten nor his hands present their offerings in the muses bower the prostrate shield and unforsaken lance now feebly grasping never more to swell his lofty numbers on the sounding string lo dithyrambus weeps amid the rage of war and conquest a swiftgushing tear finds one sad moments interval to fall on his pale friend but soon the victor proves his fierce revenge through shield and corselet plunged his furious javelin tore the persians chest phraortes sinks nor yet expiring sees with indignation persias myriads fly swift through their broken legions side by side urged by the voice of victory and fame diomedon and dithyrambus ranged so where alpheus heard the rattling car and sounding hoofs along his echoing banks two generous coursers linked in mutual reins with equal speed and ardour beat the dust to reach the glories of the olympic goal this from his lofty chariot xerxes saw he saw his numbers pouring from the straits in crowded flight then spreading over the field all broke and scattered as a river bursts impetuous from its fountain then expands its limpid surface over the pastures broad thrice started from his seat the astonished king shame fear and indignation rend his breast as ruin irresistible were near to overwhelm his millions haste he calls to hyperanthes haste and meet the greeks their daring rage and insolence repel and from dishonor vindicate our name the godlike hyperanthes through the tents obedient moves deliberate and brave each active prince he summons and with care collects the hardiest troops around him soon innumerable javelins flame his voice demands attention when he thus began now friends divide and form two equal bands one with the great abrocomes with me with intaphernes and hydarnes bold with mindus and pandates shall advance and snatch this shortlived victory from greece you abradates with pharnuchus joined orontes and mazaeus keep the rest imbatteld ready to impart their aid should envious fate exhaust our numerous ranks for o great mithra may thy radiant eye never see us yielding to ignoble flight the persian fame dishonor and the praise of our renowned progenitors who led by cyrus gave a monarch to the world think o ye princes flower of asias realms what endless infamy will blast your names should greece that narrow portion of the globe your arms defy when babylon has lowrd its towering head when lydias pride is quelled and from ecbatana its empire torn think too ye warlike bands our armys boast what deeds are asked from your superior swords you who our monarchs largest bounty share you to whose faith and valor he commits himself his queens his realms and now his fame while hyperanthes marshalled thus his host far as the extremest limit of the pass diomedon and dithyrambus hung upon the rear of persia now they turn victorious striding over the impurpled heaps of arms and mangled dead themselves with gore distained like two grim tigers who have forced a nightly mansion on the desert raised by some lonewandring traveller and died with human slaughter through the forest deep back to their coverts dreary gloom retire so passed these heroes over the crimson rock approaching now where gasping on his shield phraortes lay recumbent thespias youth advancing thus his generous soul expressed livst thou brave persian by propitious jove from whom the pleasing sense of mercy flows through mortal bosoms less my soul rejoiced when fortune gave the victory before than now to raise thee from this field of death the dying prince his languid sight unclosd and thus with trembling lips vain man forbear to proffer me what soon thyself must crave the day is now extinguished in these orbs nor shall my heart beat longer than to scorn thy mercy grecian then resign to fate he ceased the great and haughty spirit fled demophilus drew nigh the hoary chief long over phraortes corse his head inclined poised on his lance and thus addressed the slain alas how glorious were that bleeding breast had justice given the buckler to thy arm and to preserve a people bade thee die who now shall mourn thee thy ungrateful king will soon forget thy worth for thee no tears among thy native countrymen shall tell the public sorrow what to them availed thy might and dauntless spirit not to guard their wives and offspring from the spoil of war not from their walls repel the hostile blaze nor desolation from their fruitful fields but to extend oppression did thou fall perhaps with inborn virtues in thy heart which but thy angry destiny forbade by freedom cherished might have blessed mankind allbounteous nature thy impartial laws to no selected race of men confine the sense of glory fortitude and all the nobler passions which inspire the mind and render life illustrious these thou plantst in every soil but freedom like the sun must warm the generous seeds by her alone they bloom and flourish while oppression blasts the tender virtues hence a spurious growth false honor savage valor taint the soul and wild ambition hence rapacious power the ravaged earth unpeoples and the brave a feast for dogs bestrew the insanguind plain he said around the venerable man the grecians thronged attentive conquest hushed its joyful transports over the horrid field late the rude scene of tumult all was calm so when the song of thracian orpheus drew to hebrus margin from their dreary seats the savage race which haemus wrapped in clouds pangaeus cold and rhodopeian snows in blood and discord nursed the soothing strain flowed with enchantment through their ravished ears their fierceness melted and amazed they learned the sacred laws of justice which the bard mixed with the music of his heavenly string not from the field of slaughter far remote in oetas rugged side had nature clove a rocky cavern this with moss she spread and over the entrance downward from the roots she hung the shaggy trunks of branching firrs to heavens hot ray impervious from the sides the vivid laurel spread before the sun its broad and glittering foliage and above the hill was darkened with a solemn shade cast from the sable cypress this retreat cool as the grot of thetis hid beneath the vaulted ocean with the murmuring sound of waters trickling from the riven stone the grecian leaders to its gloom invites their helms they loosen from their glowing cheeks against the rock their bucklers they repose propt on their spears they stood when agis thus sent by leonidas accosts the chiefs o everworthy of undying names leonidas recals you from your toil which has already filled our mouths with praise our eyes with wonder that from yonder tower on your unequalled deeds incessant gazed to whom the bold diomedon returned go agis say to lacedaemons king as yet untird my hand can poize the spear nor hangs the buckler heavy on my arm and shall i then retire and once again shall not the sun before he sink behold the slaves of xerxes tremble at my lance to him the thespian youth my friend and guide to noble actions since thy generous mind intent on fame disdains to rest o grant i too thy glorious labors may partake and learn once more to imitate thy deeds thou gentlest agis spartas chief entreat not to command us from the field of war then interposed demophilus o friend and thou loved offspring of the dearest man who do restore my brother to my eyes my soul your magnanimity applauds but o reflect that unabating toil subdues the mightiest valor then will sigh when the weak hand obeys the heart no more yet i declining with the weight of years will not assign a measure to your strength if still you find your vigor undecayd stay and augment your glory so when time your heads shall whiten and your feeble arms round the high temples peaceful vault have hung their consecrated shields your native land shall then with honors doubled on your age requite the generous labors of your prime so spoke the senior and forsook the cave now from the bubbling spring diomedon receives the waters in his concave helm and thus addressed the genius of the flood whoever thou art whose deity presides over this fair fountain bounteous are thy streams though ill shall i repay thee for again will i this day pollute thy silver wave which mixed with gore shall tinge the malian surge so saying from his brimming cask he quaffd the clear refreshing moisture thus repairs the spotted panther to hydaspes side or eastern indus feasted with the blood of some torn deer which nigh his cruel grasp had roamd unheeding through the secret grove rapacious over the humid brink he stoops and in the pure and fluid crystal cools his reeking jaws the thespian warrior here see valiant friend leonidas has filled the pass with fresh battalions o survey yon line of plumed helms and glittering shields which emulate the midday sun what joy what ardent hope enlightens every face o let us wait no longer lest they cry our wearied limbs retard us let us arm and take our station in the glorious van thus dithyrambus the plataean chief approves the counsel and resumes his arms them as a splendid recompense he bore from grateful athens when his conquering sword her domes with great miltiades redeemed from asiatic flames the insculpturd helm now pressed his manly temples from on high a fourfold plumage nodded and beneath a golden dragon with effulgent scales the gorgeous crest illumined on his arm his shield he braced gorgonian serpents twined around the spacious verge within the form of pallas martial goddess was impressed low as her feet the graceful tunic flowed betwixt two gryffins on her helmet sat a sphinx with wings expanded while the face of dire medusa on her bosom frowned one hand supports her javelin which confounds the pride of kings the other leads along a blooming virgin victory whose brows a crown incircles laurels she presents but from her shoulders all her plumes were shorn with favored athens ever now to rest this asias terror on his mighty arm diomedon upreard then snatched his lance and thus to dithyrambus lo my friend alone of all the grecians who sustained the mornings battle still unwearied stand plataeas sons and well may keep the field they who endured the marathonian toil then charge with us amid the foremost rank thy valor shall be placed and share this day command and honor with plataeas chief the hero ceased and towered the grecian van strides with impetuous steps nor slow behind the boast of thespia dithyrambus moved like blooming hermes in celestial arms when lightly graceful with his feathered feet along scamanders flowery verge he passed to aid the incensed divinities of greece against the phrygian towers with eager speed the heroes soon the imbattled greeks attained to whom the brave diomedon began not to contend but vanquish are you come and in the blood of fugitives to stain your lances unopposd my friends behold where furthest from the malian gulf removed the crags of oeta less confine the straits there let us bend extending wide our front there with more ample scope may havoc range all with assent gave ear the various bands move on successive the plataeans first against the rock are stationd to their head is dithyrambus brought exulting joy distends their hearts and flashes in their eyes thanks to the great diomedon they cry who to our troop this godlike hero joins hail dithyrambus hail illustrious chief well do thou merit to have reaped renown at marathon amid the glorious front with conscious gladness blushing on his cheek the youth his post assumes around him crowd the hoary warriors their unnumberd scars before his sight presenting and recount their various dangers he their wounds surveys with veneration nor disdains to hear the oftrepeated tale from spartas king returning agis here the chiefs addressed leonidas permits you still to brave the hostile numbers with plataeas band if yet by toil unconquered but i see that all unwearied ask the promised fight hail glorious veterans this signal day may your victorious swords augment the wreaths around your venerable brows and make thermopylae like marathon renowned this said he hastens back meantime advanced the mantinean diophantus brave and hegesander tegeas dauntless chief with all their troops imbattled by their side the thebans form to them their native files alcmaeon and eupalamus unite last on the margin of the malian bay mycenaes youth aristobulus drew in one impenetrable phalanx stretched across the pass with closeconnected force an hundred warriors formed the expanded ranks and thirty bucklers every file condensed in strong reserve dieneces behind disposed the spartans and the locrian line there too with maron alpheus dauntless stood and godlike agis there megistias placed his blooming heir and thus his valor fires o menalippus born of foreign race yet by these heroes not unworthy deemed with them to fight for sparta lo the hour is come my son to show thy generous heart that not with thee the buckler and the spear are ill entrusted to maintain a cause so great and sacred o remember well leonidas on yonder bulwark stands who all the war contemplates and discerns the bold and fearful o propitious heaven grant me to hear leonidas this day applaud my son and let megistias die while thus he spoke the animated soul of menalippus struggling in his breast demands the fight this saw the tender sire and thus with tears rejoined remember too thy father sees thy danger oh my child to me thy honor as to thee is dear yet court not death by all thy filial love by all my cares and fondness i implore amid the combat or the warm pursuit still by the wise dieneces abide his prudent valor knows the unerring paths of glory he will guide thy youthful steps this said to spartas leader he retires now are the enemies descried the van abrocomes and hyperanthes led with them pandates intaphernes proud hydarnes mindus violent their march with sounding footsteps swept the stony way so where the unequal globe in mountains swells a river pours its thundering surge between the steeperected cliffs tumultuous roll the torrents bursting over the pointed crags the mountains roar the marble channel foams with obvious arms the intrepid greeks withstand the dire encounter soon the impetuous shock of thousands and of myriads shakes the ground stupendous scene of terror under hills whose nodding summits vaulted over their heads in unextinguishable fury joined the dreadful conflict with inverted trunks obliquely bending from the shagged ridge the sylvan horrors overshade the fight the shrillmouthd trumpet and the deeptund horn mixed with the crash of intermingling spears the clanging shields and wars discordant shouts awake the echoes through the neighboring groves and rocks and shores return the hideous sound end of the fourth book leonidas book v the argument hyperanthes discontinuing the fight while he waits for reinforcements teribazus a persian remarkable for his merit and learning and highly beloved by hyperanthes but unhappy in his passion for ariana a daughter of darius advances from the rest of the army to the rescue of a friend in distress who lay wounded on the field of battle teribazus is attacked by diophantus the mantinean whom he overcomes then engaging with dithyrambus is himself slain hyperanthes hastens to his succor a general battle ensues hyperanthes and abrocomes partly by their own valor and partly by the perfidy of the thebans who desert the line being on the point of forcing the grecians are repulsed by the lacedaemonians hyperanthes composes a select body out of the persian standing forces and making an improvement in their discipline renews the attack upon which leonidas changes the disposition of his army hyperanthes and the ablest persian generals are driven out of the field and several thousands of the barbarians circumvented in the pass are entirely destroyed  amid the van of persia was a youth named teribazus not for golden stores not for wide pastures traversed over with herds with bleating thousands or with bounding steeds nor yet for power nor splendid honors famed rich was his mind in every art divine and through the paths of science had he walked the votary of wisdom in the years when tender down invests the ruddy cheek he with the magi turned the hallowed page of zoroastres then his towering soul high on the plumes of contemplation soared and from the lofty babylonian fane with learned chaldaeans traced the mystic sphere there numbered over the vivid fires that gleam upon the dusky bosom of the night nor on the sands of ganges were unheard the indian sages from sequestered bowers while as attention wondered they disclosed the powers of nature whether in the woods the fruitful glebe or flower or healing plant the limpid waters or the ambient air or in the purer element of fire the fertile plains where great sesostris reigned mysterious egypt next the youth surveyed from elephantis where impetuous nile precipitates his waters to the sea which far below receives the sevnfold stream thence over the ionic coast he strayed nor passed miletus by which once inrapturd heard the tongue of thales nor prienes walls where wisdom dwelt with bias nor the seat of pittacus along the lesbian shore here too melodious numbers charmed his ear which flowed from orpheus and musaeus old and thee o father of immortal verse maeonides whose strains through every age time with his own eternal lip shall sing back to his native susa then he turned his wandering steps his merit soon was dear to hyperanthes generous and good and ariana from darius sprung with hyperanthes of the imperial race which ruled the extent of asia in disdain of all her greatness often an humble ear to him would bend and listen to his voice her charms her mind her virtue he explored admiring soon was admiration changed to love nor loved he sooner than despaired but unreveald and silent was his pain nor yet in solitary shades he roamd nor shunned resort but over his sorrows cast a sickly dawn of gladness and in smiles concealed his anguish while the secret flame raged in his bosom and its peace consumed his heart still brooding over these mournful thoughts can i o wisdom seek relief from thee who do approve my passion from the power of beauty only thou would guard my heart but here thyself art charmed where softness grace and every virtue dignify desire yet thus to love despairing is to prove the sharpest sorrow which relentless fate can from her store of woes inflict on life but do not thou this moment warn my soul to fly the fatal charmer do i pause back to the wise chaldaeans will i go or wander on the ganges where to heaven with thee my elevated soul shall tower with thee the secrets of the earth unveil there no tumultuous passion shall molest my tranquil hours and every thought be calm o wretched teribazus all conspires against thy peace our mighty lord prepares to overwhelm the grecians every youth attends the war and i who late have poised with no inglorious arm the soldiers lance and near the side of hyperanthes fought must join the throng how therefore can i fly from ariana who with asias queens the splendid camp of xerxes will adorn then be it so again i will adore her gentle virtue her delightful tongue her graceful sweetness shall again diffuse resistless magic through my ravished heart and thus when love with double rage inflamed swells to distraction in my tortured breast then  but in vain through darkness do i search my fate despair and fortune be my guides the hour arrived when xerxes first advanced his arms from susas gates the persian dames so were accustomed all the eastern fair in sumptuous cars accompanied his march and ariana graced the beauteous train from morn till evening teribazus guards her passing wheels his arm her weight sustains with trembling pleasure often as she mounts the imperial chariot his assiduous hand from each pure fountain wafts the living flood nor seldom by the fairones soft command would he repose him at her feet reclined while over his lips her lovely forehead bowed won with his grateful eloquence that soothed with sweet variety the tedious march beguiling time he too would then forget his cares awhile in raptures vain intrancd delusion all and fleeting rays of joy soon overcast with more intense despair like wintry clouds which opening for a time tinge their black skirts with scattered beams of day then swiftly closing on the brows of morn condense their horrors and in thickest gloom the ruddy beauty veil such woes oppressed the persians heart not softened for this day his daring valor from the bleeding van opposed the frown of adamantine mars with no tiara were his temples bound the slender lance of asia he disdained and her light target eminent he moved in grecian arms the wonder of his foes among the ionians had his strenuous limbs in war been practiced a resplendent cask flamed on his head before his face and chest down to the knees his ample shield was spread a ponderous ash with skillful hands he grasped thus armed tremendous in the front he stood beneath his might two bold phliasians died and three tegeans whose indignant chief brave hegesander vengeance breathed in vain with streaming wounds repulsed thus far unmatched his strength prevailed when hyperanthes voice recalled his fainting legions now each band their languid courage reinforced with rest meantime with teribazus thus conferred the godlike prince thou muchdeserving youth o had thy deeds with emulation warmed the frozen hearts of persia greece had wept her prostrate ranks not triumphed in our shame relaxing now the wearied fight i wait till from the camp with abradates strong the brave pharnuchus and mazaeus move and with fresh powers renew the drooping war for since surpassed in valor we must waste by endless numbers and continual toil the matchless ardour of our gallant foes he said immersed in sadness scarce replied but to himself thus plained the amorous youth still do i languish mourning over the fame my arm acquires o wretched heart thou seat of constant sorrow what deceitful smiles yet can thou borrow from illusive hope to flatter life at arianas feet what if with supplicating knees i bowed implored her pity and revealed my love wretch can thou climb to yon effulgent orb and share the splendours which irradiate heaven do thou aspire to that exalted maid great xerxes sister rivalling the hopes of asias purpled potentates and kings unless within her bosom i inspired a passion fervent as my own nay more such as might dissipate each virgin fear and unrestrained disclose its fond desire my hopes are fruitless plunged in black despair he thus revolved when suddenly the cries of aribaeus smote his pensive ear by mutual danger and by friendship joined they had been long companions in the toils of war together with victorious steps the sons of nile they chased when aegypts pride before the arms of hyperanthes fell stretched on the plain and covered over with wounds by all abandoned teribazus views his gallant friend his languid soul awakes and forth he issues from the persian line the bleeding warrior in his strong embrace swift he conveys by indignation fired fierce from the grecians diophantus rushed with loud defiance teribazus leaves his rescued friend his massy targe he rears advances high his formidable spear and turns intrepid on the approaching foe amazement followed on he strode and shook the plumed honors of his shining crest the illfated greek awaits the unequal fight pierced in the throat with sounding arms he falls through every band the mantineans mourn upon the slain the victor fixed his sight and thus reflected by thy splendid arms thou art a greek of no ignoble rank and from thy fall perhaps am i adorned with more conspicuous luster what if heaven should add new victims like thyself to grace my undeserving hand who knows but she might smile upon my trophies oh vain thought disperse ye fantome hopes too long my heart have thou in vain contended with thy woes i stand this moment on the verge of life by fame invited by despair impelled to pass the irremeable bound no more shall teribazus backward turn his steps but here decide his fate then beat no more thou troubled heart and every grief be still now at the approach of everlasting peace he ended when a mighty foe drew nigh not less than dithyrambus ever they joined the persian thus the thespian youth addressed say art not thou the unconquerable greek whose dauntless valor mowed our battle down and scattered nations to attempt thy force this day i purposed when our chiefs from fight their host withdrew that now my single arm thou deignst to meet receive my thanks and know the thought of conquest less employs my mind than that by thee i cannot fall with shame he ceased these words the thespian chief returned of all the praises from thy generous mouth the only share which justice bids me claim is that i here adventure to confront thy matchless strength believe not that unmarked were thy great deeds from you unbounded camp none yet has equaled thy victorious hand but whence thy armor of the grecian form whence thy tall spear thy helmet whence the weight of that strong shield unlike thy eastern friends o if thou best some fugitive who lost to liberty and virtue art become a tyrants vile stipendiary with grief that valor thus triumphant i behold which after all its danger and brave toil deserves no honor from the gods or men here teribazus with a sigh returned i am to greece a stranger and a wretch to thee unknown who seek this hour to die though not ignobly but in death to raise my name from darkness while i end my woes the grecian then i view thee and i mourn a dignity which virtue only bears and resolution on thy brow enthroned though grief has dimmed thy drooping eye demand my veneration and whatever be the malice of thy fortune what the cares which thus infest thy quiet they create within my breast the pity of a friend why have thou then compelled me to oppose my arm against thee while thy might supports the unjust ambition of malignant kings the foes to virtue liberty and peace yet free from rage or enmity i lift my adverse javelin victory i ask thy life may fate for happier hours reserve this said their beaming lances they protend of hostile hate or fury both devoid as on the isthmian or olympic sand for fame alone contending either host poised on their spears in silent wonder gazed the fight begins when soon the grecian lance which all the day in constant battle worn unnumberd shields and corselets had transfixed against the persian target shivering breaks its masters hand disarming then began the sense of honor and the dread of shame to swell in dithyrambus undismayed he grapples with the foe and instant seized the threatening javelin ever thuplifted arm could execute the meditated wound the weapon burst betwixt their struggling hands they loose their grasp and bare their shining swords with equal swiftness to defend or charge each active youth advances or recedes on every side they traverse now direct obliquely now the wheeling blades descend still is the conflict dubious when the greek dissembling points his falchion to the earth his arm depressed as overcome with toil while with his buckler cautious he repels the blows repeated from the exulting foe greece trembles for her hero joy pervades the asian ranks and hyperanthes strides before the line preparing to receive his friend triumphant teribazus now pressed with redoubled efforts still the greek sustains the assault defensive and at last as with unguarded fury of his strokes the unwary persian sideways swung his targe the fatal moment dithyrambus watched and darting forward with his feet outstretchd his falchion buries in the obnoxious side affection grief and terror wing the speed of hyperanthes from his bleeding foe the greek retires not distant and awaits the eastern prince but he with watery cheeks and dumb with sorrow clasps his dying friend from whose cold lip with interrupted phrase these accents broke o dearest best of men my heart is fruitful with ten thousand thoughts of gratitude and love to thee but fate denies my voice the uttrance o my friend o hyperanthes hear my tongue unfold what thou should never have known before this hour when as i open all my secret soul i may at once retire and veil my eyes in endless night nor thou presumption deem what with my dying breath i here divulge i love thy sister with despair i loved and thence perhaps untimely is my date though witness heaven without regret i bleed with honor thus in persias sight and thine he ceased the inexorable hand of fate weighed down his eyelids and the gloom of death his fleeting sight eternally oershades him on choaspes over the blooming verge his frantic mother shall bewail and strew her silver tresses in the crystal tide while all the shore reechoes to the name of teribazus lost the afflicted prince the pallid corse contemplating with tears thus in the bitterness of grief exclaims oh teribazus oh my friend whose loss i will deplore for ever oh what power to me and thee averse thus closed thy breast to hyperanthes with distrust unkind she should she must have loved thee now no more thy friendly aspect shall delight my eyes while in remembrance thy unequalled worth will live for ever to remind my grief of what i lost o susa if again thee i revisit from this hostile land far from the clamours of tumultuous war then shall my hours be vacant to complaint whole years shall thou be witness while i mourn and ariana shall assist my woes let fiercest vengeance now possess my soul he said and ardent rushes on the greek who while his noble enemy expired and hyperanthes snatched with tender arms the last embraces from his gasping friend stood near reclined in sadness over his shield and in the pride of victory repined nor marked his threatening foe when swift approached diomedon before the thespian youth aloft he raised his targe and loudly thus hold thee barbarian from a life more worth than thee and xerxes with his host of slaves his words he seconds with his rapid lance soon a tremendous conflict had ensued but intaphernes mindus and the half of persias leaders anxious for the life of hyperanthes poured with all their bands betwixt the encountering chiefs with mutual wrath they strove in vain the combat to renew so rage two bulls upon the opposing banks of some deep flood which parts the fruitful mead defiance thunders from their angry mouths in vain in vain the furrowed earth they rend wide rolls the stream and intercepts the war the fierce plataean satiates his revenge on vulgar lives before his dreaded arm whole ranks are scattered but the persian prince borne down the stress of battle gains the shore where then the brave abrocomes advanced with him orontes and pharnuchus stood mazaeus abradates famed in arms and all the boldest of the eastern chiefs begirt with fresh battalions here with speed abrocomes his brother thus bespake to intaphernes is pandates sent with charge to harrass in perpetual fight the grecians next the mountains thou with me and these unite thy valor here the flower of all our army is together drawn here all the weight of battle will impend he said the godlike hyperanthes seeks the dangerous van he heads the splendid throng of satraps princes and imperial powers themselves the lords of nations who before the throne of xerxes tributary bowed now mixed the war the inverted javelins gleam from every part and fell bellona roars who first distained with persian blood his sword eupalamus artembares he slew and derdas fierce whom caucasus had reared on its tempestuous brow the savage sons of violence and rapine but their doom great hyperanthes marks his angry lance arrests the victor in his haughty course beneath the strong abrocomes overwhelmed melissus swells the number of the dead none could mycenae boast of prouder birth than young melissus blooming as the son of maia all in radiant arms he graced the front of battle he in cirrhas vale where high parnassus from its double top oershades the pythian games the envied prize of fame obtained low sinks his laurelld head in deaths cold night and horrid gore deforms his graceful locks impatient for revenge aristobulus strides before the van a storm of fury darkens all his brow around he rolls his gloomy eye and marks achaemenes for death of regal blood derived from croesus once the imperial lord of nations him the nymphs of halys wept when with delusive oracles beguiled by delphis god he passed their fatal waves a mighty empire to dissolve nor knew the illdestind king that envious fortune watched that dreadful moment from his hand to wrest the scepter of his fathers in the shade of humble life his race on tmolus brow lay hid till roused to battle here his breath achaemenes resigns then lycis bled for horrid war illchosen he was skilled to tune the lulling flute and melt the heart or with his pipes awakning strains invite the lovely dames of lydia to the dance they graceful over the verdant level moved in varied measures while the cooling breeze beneath their swelling garments wantoned over their snowy breasts and smooth caysters wave softgliding murmured by his opening chest pours forth his entrails and supine he falls not long the grecian triumphs from the slain in all the pride of conquest as he rends his reeking javelin hyperanthes steel his knee invades and bursts the sinewy cords the mycenaeans with uplifted shields corinthians and phliasians gather round the wounded grecian with redoubled rage the conflict glows abrocomes incites each persian leader all obey his voice here abradates there mazaeus pressed orontes and hydarnes none retire from toil or peril urged on every side the greeks at length the abandoned chief resign despairing raging destitute he stands propt on his spear his wound forbids retreat none but his brother eumenes abide the dire extremity his shield defends the fainting chief till hyperanthes sword full on his arm its dreadful weight discharged down with the buckler drops the severed hand nor quits its grasp now sink the wretched pair beneath the persians unresisted steel from both their breasts the vital currents flow and mix their streams elate the persians roll their deepning legions on the foes dismayed the greeks their station painfully maintain this soon the faithless anaxander saw when thus to leontiades he spoke this is the time to aid our persian friends behold the greeks are pressed let thebes retire and yield a bloodless conquest to the king the thebans straight desert the broken line not with unpunished treachery the spears of fierce orontes and pharnuchus joined with mindus gored their shameful flight and thind their bleeding files meantime as he who ruled than jove more ancient on the throne of heaven when from the womb of chaos dark the world emergd to birth wherever he viewed the jar of atoms yet discordant and unformed confusion thence with powerful voice dispelled till light and order universal reigned so from the wall leonidas explored the various war he saw the theban rout that corinth phlius and mycenae looked affrighted backward instantly he charged the sons of lacedaemon to repair the disunited phalanx ever they move dieneces inspires them fame my friends calls forth your valor in a signal hour for you this glorious period she reserved to vindicate the spartan name he spoke on either side supported by the might of agis and of alpheus he conducts his generous troop who riveting their shields in dense array indissolubly firm confront the persians and with death repulse their scattered numbers when with efforts vain they often renewed the contest and recoiled as often confounded with diminished ranks thus hyperanthes counseled learn o chiefs from whence alone success can grace our arms these are a band selected from the greeks unlike the others whom we lately chased perhaps the spartans whom we often have heard by demaratus praised to break their line false is the hope while unarrayd and lax and wanting union singly we assail their strength collected do not we preside over asias myriads and our valor boast and martial arts above the vulgar herd let us ye chiefs attempt in ordered ranks to join our force and emulate the foe they wait not dubious soon a dreadful line from oetas mountain to the shore extends composed of all the leaders mindus bold pharnuchus and mazaeus and the strength of fierce abrocomes with each who bore the highest honors and excelled in war to these succeed a chosen number drawn from those whom asia boasts her bravest sons who from their king perpetual stipends share and stationd round his provinces by arms his tyranny sustain in every part is hyperanthes seen with active care to form the huge battalion soon they stand in just array when cautious lest their march might still relax their order persias prince amid the center of the foremost rank orontes placed committing to his hand the imperial standard whose expanded folds glowed in the air presenting to the sun the richest dye of tire the royal bird amid the gorgeous tincture shone expressed in flaming gold on this the eastern chief commands each persian stationd in the front to turn his eyes regardful and to guide his slow and equal feet by this alone retiring or advancing next he charged that every warrior through the numerous files observing none but those before him ranged should watch their motions and their steps pursue close by the standard then the intrepid chief his post assumes and animates the band illustrious warriors whose unconquered arms rebellious egypt and the libyan felt think what the splendor of your former deeds from you demands remember from the great heroic actions are a debt to fame no middle course remains for them to tread whom she has once ennobled and this hour or with fresh trophies will enlarge your praise or will for ever with dishonor blast the hero said and all to fight proceed as when tempestuous eurus stems the weight of western neptune struggling through the straits which bound alcides labors here the storm with rapid wing reverberates the tide there the contending surge with furrowed tops to mountains swells and whelming over the beach on either coast invests with hoary foam the mauritanian and iberian strand not with less rage in hideous onset meet the grecians and barbarians these preserve their foremost ranks unbroken where was drawn the prime of asias warriors and the crowd though still promiscuous pouring from behind yet added pressure to the imbattled chiefs with endless numbers like the mural strength of some proud city bulwarkd round and armed with rising towers to guard her wealthy stores immovable impenetrable stood the serried phalanx of the greeks behind their country spread their fields with plenty crowned their native walls and habitations lay with each dear pledge of friendship and of love high in the persian van the exalted lance of hyperanthes flamed beside him pressed abrocomes hydarnes and the bulk of abradates terrible in war and here the great dieneces upheld his shields expanded surface and alone firm as a memphian pyramid sustained the stress of thousands alpheus here unmoved and agis there connect their spacious orbs with menalippus wise megisthias heir in one impervious line long time the hosts maintain in strong and unrelaxd array the conflict undecided nor could greece repel the adverse numbers nor the force of asias myriads could remove the greeks but now from spartas king who soon discerned the persians new arrangement medon hastes the illustrious chief of locris from the race of ajax sprung in trojan fields renowned to wife dieneces he thus began leonidas commands the grecian line to yield before the persians and with speed to measure back some paces soon he deems the unexperienced foe in wild pursuit will break their order then the charge renew let agis joined with alpheus from the line rush with laconias troop imbattled deep and force a passage through the barbarous host thou with a strong battalion from the sons of locris drawn must follow swift and reach the spartans led by agis with the rest of locris youth shall i advance to fill your vacant station and the line maintain while in the narrow entrance where the pass looks over the malian plain on persias camp do thou arrange to intercept the foe should asia pour fresh succors from her tents then xerxes soon the slaughter shall deplore of all these thousands in the straits enclosed for sure destruction and the gods of greece behold their temples with profusion graced of splendid offerings from barbarian spoils won by their freeborn supplicants this day this heard dieneces obedient gave through every band the signal of retreat when all at once drew backward persia stopped as with amazement rooted to the earth at unexpected conquest till the voice of fierce abrocomes their minds awakes with these triumphant accents by the sun they fly before us my victorious friends delay you then to enter greece away rush on undaunted i already hear our horse and chariots thundering over their plains and view their towns involved in persian fires he said with hurried violence they roll tumultuous forward all with headlong pace wide from their ranks expatiate in pursuit disjoin their order and the line dissolve this when the sage dieneces descries the grecians halt returning to the charge with sudden onset in a moment pierced by lacedaemons chief orontes falls and quits the imperial banner this the greek in triumph waves and gives the dreadful sign at once with agis towering in the front and rapid alpheus all laconias band in deep arrangement bursting from the line bear down with irresistible career the eastern legions shattered and oerturnd with all their standards trampled on the plain as the swift vessel when a rising gale distends the canvass its resistless course impells through millions of opposing waves through the barbarian multitudes so pierced the spartan wedge invincible over hills of arms and mangled corses they impress their crimson footsteps persias bravest chiefs even hyperanthes from the line is driven and flying thousands through the pass are swept before the spartans with a locrian troop of hideous depth dieneces pursues his conquering friends and hews his purple way through asias numbers which again were closed in vain himself unconquerable leads destruction on and heaps the rock with death but on the broken foe what ruin falls from alpheus sword over all in swift pursuit was he renowned his rapid feet had matched the son of peleus in the dusty course or had he run for atalantas love he had rejected cytheraeas aid nor of her swiftness to beguile the fair before her steps had thrown the golden balls but now the wrongs the longrememberd wrongs of polydorus animate his strength with tenfold vigor guided by revenge his falchion reddens with barbarian blood the gory drops besprinkled all his shield like crimson poppies over the yellow plain as when with horror winged a whirlwind rends a shattered navy from the ocean cast the enormous fragments hide the sandy beach thus over the rock the persians lay bestrewn by alpheus raging in the swift pursuit not with severer pangs the god of day the theban queen afflicted when incensed with her proud vaunts he hurled her blooming race from youth and beauty to the pale abodes than now distracted hyperanthes soul as round him bleeding by the spartans lance his noblest friends lay gasping often he strove to turn his flying legions often the fight with abradates and his brothers force renews against insuperable foes in vain repugnant till by all around deserted mixing with the general rout he yields to fortune and the field forsakes so with relapsing waves the ebbing tide beats for a time against the shelving strand still by degrees retiring and at last within the bosom of the main subsides now at thermopylaes extremest bound the spartans checked their progress soon approached dieneces and thus began behold what numbers have we passed of perfias sons be swift my friends and form he said and filled the narrow straits with ordered files a depth of fifty warriors half on asias host half towered the pass were turned a double front where every rank with twenty javelins flamed the locrian band to agis is assigned who stands prepared to stop the flying foes dieneces himself to persias camp presents the terrors of the spartan steel now muse the wondrous stratagem display which spartas hero whose presiding care marked all the great vicissitudes of fight and ruled the course of slaughter had conceived to whelm the numerous longresisting foe in hideous death and signalize the day with horrors new to war as over the wall his constant station darting through the straits his watchful eye ever yet the battle closed he viewed the hostile myriads swarming down and nations still succeeding from the camp immense exhaustless by an horrid length of clustring helms and shields and threatening spears joined to the grecian van the wary chief lest by the longprotracted fight his greeks might yield oerlabourd from the locrians chose a thousand warriors these by maron led ascend the mountain which oerhung the pass his charge he soon reveals a thousand hands at once with restless pains assemble stones of hugest bulk and withered trunks uptorn in elder times by whirlwinds from the grove unwearied then they loosen from the rocks broad craggy fragments from the mountain hewed its venerable firs and aged oaks of wide circumference and knotted strength which of their branches by the lightning bared presented still against its blasting flame their hoary pride unshaken these the greeks roll heavy on with massy leavers heave or drag with strongknit cables till they reach where over the persian multitudes inclined the mountains edge so lofty that the voice of war below there lost its deafning roar and softened into murmurs still his post though hyperanthes from the field was driven with thronging numbers intaphernes bold beneath the shade of this incumbent hill against the fierce diomedon maintained great intaphernes progeny of kings whom over damascus and the syrian palms had xerxes seated with despotic sway his substitute this maron from on high surveys and gives the signal downward sinks the nodding pile stupendous heap of death trees rolled on trees with mingled rock descend unintermitted ruin loud resound the hollow trunks against the mountains side swift bounds each craggy mass the foes beneath look up aghast with horror shrink and die whole legions crushed beneath the dreadful heaps lie hid and lost as never they had known a name or being while around them grew a hill of ruin numbers still survive who shun destruction with impetuous flight but agis stops them intaphernes falls before his thundering arm again they turn to meet resistless ruin from behind with twice two hundred locrians agis pours meantime the grecian line so spartas king decreed had left its station and beyond the heaps of dreadful carnage was advanced there stretched from oeta to the malian bay the locrians led by medon had disposed with corinth phlius and mycenaes train their hostile phalanx over the lessening pass along the mountains side plataeas troop the mantineans and tegaeans stood an horrid length of war the unwearied swords of dithyrambus and diomedon still blazed the terror of the barbarous host before them fled the persians to the shore all in a moment by the various bands of greece surrounded from the gulf profound perdition here inevitable frowns and there incircled by a grove of spears they stand devoted hecatombs to mars now not a moments interval delays their general doom but down the malian steep prone are they hurried to the expanded arms of horror rising from the opening deep and grasping all their numbers as they fall the dire confusion like a storm invades the chafing billows loud resounds the shore and over whole troops by fell bellona rolled in one vast ruin from the craggy ridge over all their arms and ensigns deep ingulphd with hideous roar the surge for ever closed end of the fifth book leonidas book vi the argument night coming on the grecians retire to their tents a guard is placed on the phocian wall under the command of agis he admits into the camp a lady accompanied by a single slave and conducts them to leonidas when she discovers herself to be ariana sister of xerxes and hyperanthes and sues for the body of teribazus which being found among the slain she kills herself upon it the slave who attended her proves to be polydorus brother of alpheus and maron and who had been formerly carried into captivity by a phoenician pirate he relates before an assembly of the chiefs a message from demaratus to the spartans which discloses the treachery of the thebans and of epialtes the malian who had undertaken to lead part of the persian army through a pass among the mountains of oeta this information throws the council into a great tumult which is pacified by leonidas who sends alpheus to observe the motions of these persians and dieneces with a party of lacedaemonians to support the phocians with whom the defense of these passages in the hills had been entrusted in the mean time agis sends the bodies of teribazus and ariana to the camp of xerxes  in sable pomp with all her starry train the night assumed her throne recalled from war her longprotracted labors greece forgets dissolved in silent slumber all but those who watched the uncertain perils of the dark an hundred warriors agis was their chief high on the wall intent the hero sat as over the surface of the tranquil main along its undulating breast the wind the various din of asias host conveyed in one deep murmur swelling in his ear when by the sound of footsteps down the pass alarmed he calls aloud what feet are those which beat the echoing pavement of the rock with speed reply nor tempt your instant fate he said and thus returned a voice unknown not with the feet of enemies we come but crave admittance with a friendly tongue the spartan answers through the midnight shade what purpose draws your wandering steps abroad to whom the stranger we are friends to greece and to the presence of the spartan king admission we implore the cautious chief of lacedaemon hesitates again when thus with accents musically sweet a tender voice his wondering ear allured o generous grecian listen to the prayer of one distressed whom grief alone has led in this dark hour to these victorious tents a wretched woman innocent of fraud the greek descending through thunfolded gates upheld a flaming brand one first appeared in servile garb attired but near his side a woman graceful and majestic stood not with an aspect rivalling the power of fatal hellen or the wanton charms of loves soft queen but such as far excelled whatever the lilly blending with the rose paints on the cheek of beauty soon to fade such as expressed a mind which wisdom ruled and sweetness tempered virtues purest light illumining the countenance divine yet could not sooth remorseless fate nor teach malignant fortune to revere the good which often with anguish rends the spotless heart and often associates wisdom with despair in courteous phrase began the chief humane exalted fair who thus adornst the night forbear to blame the vigilance of war and to the laws of rigid mars impute that i thus long unwilling have delayed before the great leonidas to place this your apparent dignity and worth he spoke and gently to the lofty tent of spartas king the lovely stranger guides at agis summons with a mantle broad his mighty limbs leonidas infolds and quits his couch in wonder he surveys the illustrious virgin whom his presence awed her eye submissive to the ground inclined with veneration of the godlike man but soon his voice her anxious dread dispelled benevolent and hospitable thus thy form alone thus amiable and great thy mind delineates and from all commands supreme regard relate thou noble dame by what relentless destiny compelled thy tender feet the paths of darkness tread rehearse the afflictions whence thy virtue mourns on her wan cheek a sudden blush arose like days first dawn upon the twilight pale and wrapped in grief these words a passage broke if to be most unhappy and to know that hope is irrecoverably fled if to be great and wretched may deserve commiseration from the good behold thou glorious leader of unconquered bands behold descended from darius loins the afflicted ariana and my prayer accept with pity nor my tears disdain first that i loved the best of human race by natures hand with every virtue formed heroic wise adorned with every art of shame unconscious does my heart reveal this day in grecian arms conspicuous clad he fought he fell a passion long concealed for me alas within my brothers arms his dying breath resigning he disclosed  oh i will stay my sorrows will forbid my eyes to stream before thee and my heart thus full of anguish will from sighs restrain for why should thy humanity be grieved with my distress and learn from me to mourn the lot of nature doomed to care and pain hear then o king and grant my sole request to seek his body in the heaps of slain thus to the spartan sud the regal maid resembling ceres in majestic woe when supplicant at joves resplendent throne from dreary pluto and the infernal gloom her loved and lost proserpina she sought fixed on the weeping queen with steadfast eyes laconias chief these tender thoughts recalled such are thy sorrows o for ever dear who now at lacedaemon do deplore my everlasting absence then inclined his head and sighed nor yet forgot to charge his friend the gentle agis through the straits the persian princess to attend and aid with careful steps they seek her lovers corse the greeks remembered where by fate repressed his arm first ceased to mow their legions down and from beneath a mass of persian slain soon drew the hero by his armor known to agis high pavilion they resort now ariana what transcending pangs thy soul involved what horror clasped thy heart but love grew mightiest and her beauteous limbs on the cold breast of teribazus threw the griefdistracted maid the clotted gore deformed her snowy bosom over his wounds loose flowed her hair and bubbling from her eyes impetuous sorrow lavd the purple clay when forth in groans her lamentations broke o torn for ever from my weeping eyes thou who despairing to obtain her heart who then most loved thee did untimely yield thy life to fates inevitable dart for her who now in agony unfolds her tender bosom and repeats her vows to thy deaf ear who fondly to her own now clasps thy breast insensible and cold alas do those unmoving ghastly orbs perceive my gushing anguish does that heart which deaths inanimating hand has chilled share in my sufferings and return my sighs  oh bitter unsurmountable distress lo on thy breast is ariana bowed hangs over thy face unites her cheek to thine not now to listen with enchanted ears to thy persuasive eloquence no more charmed with the wisdom of thy copious mind she could no more invincible despair suppressed her uttrance as a marble form fixed on the solemn sepulcher unmoved over some dead hero whom his country loved bends down the head with imitated woe so paused the princess over the breathless clay intrancd in sorrow on the dreary wound where dithyrambus sword was deepest plunged mute for a space and motionless she gazed then with a look unchanged nor trembling hand drew forth a poniard which her garment veiled and sheathing in her heart the abhorred steel on her slain lover silent sinks in death in vain the spartan intervened with tears he viewed the prostrate lovers and exclaimed oh most unhappy heavy on your heads has sorrow fallen which over your pale remains commands this pity from a strangers eye illustrious ruins may the grave impart that peace which life denied and now receive this pious office from a hand unknown so saying from his shoulders he unclaspd his ample robe and strewn the waving folds over the pale dead then turning he bespake the slave who stood beside him thou who ledst thy queen illdestind to the fatal tents of lacedaemon now returning bear her bleeding relics to the persian lord thou and these captives whom i free from bonds art thou a spartan interrupts the slave and do thou counsel me to seek again a clime unblessed where freedom never dwells no bear me to leonidas alone shall he decide if wretched as i seem i may not claim protection from this camp whoever thou art amazed the chief replies thou may indeed a better lot demand than i a stranger to thy hidden worth unconscious offered thy ignoble garb concealed a virtue which i now revere and since thy suffering soul has long endured the gloom of bondage and the hated face of tyrants viewed now change the horrid scene here freedom reigns and justice come and seek with me their great protector ending here swift he conducts him to laconias king when agis thus leonidas addressed lo far superior to the name which marks his habit with dishonor one who sues for thy protection here the slave subjoined i stand thy suppliant now thou soon shall learn if i deserve thy favor i entreat to see the assembled leaders of your host for i am fraught with tidings which import the weal of all the grecians agis straight appointed by leonidas convenes the various leaders to the tent they throng amidst them placed the stranger thus began o alpheus maron hither turn your sight and know your brothers from their seats they start from either burst with tears of transport mixed the name of polydorus on his breast each fondly strives to rush but he withstands while down his cheek a stream of anguish pours from his dejected eyes in torture bent on that vile garb which shamed his freeborn limbs at length these accents intermixed with groans broke from his heart while all stood wondering round you first shall know if this unhappy slave yet merits your embraces now approached leonidas before him all recede even alpheus self and yields his brothers hand which in his own the generous hero pressed then with majestic goodness thus bespake the afflicted youth and mitigates his pains forbear to mourn thou unexampled youth thy friends thy country all on thee shall gaze with veneration whose unshaken mind the chains of asia never could debase lo every breast is open to thy worth each tongue prepares to hail thee with applause who have thy country honored even in bonds he ceased when alpheus with an eager hand divests his brother of his base attire and his own mantle over the shoulders threw of polydorus agis too advanced with friendly arms infolds him and began now in thy native liberty secure smile on thy past afflictions and relate what chance restored thy virtue to the greeks then polydorus to the listening chiefs i was a spartan when my tender prime on manhood bordered from my native shore snatched by phoenician pirates i was sold to ariana sister to the king and hyperanthes fortune there was kind my bonds committing to that gentle hand yet was i still a captive and estranged from lacedaemon demaratus often with friendly sorrows would my lot deplore nor less his own illfated virtue mourned lost to his country in a servile court the center of corruption where in smiles is envy painted treachery and hate and rankling malice where alone sincere the dissolute seeks no disguise where he who all possesses that a king can give is far less happy than the meanest son of liberty and grovelling as the slave who serves his cruel pride yet here the sun ten times his annual period has renewed since polydorus has in bondage groaned my bloom now past or else by pining care untimely withered i at last return and to my native land the tidings bear of instant desolation here in grief he paused when thus leonidas proceed though from thy lips inevitable fate to all be threatened thou art heard by none whose dauntless souls can entertain a thought but how to fall the noblest thus the chief the rest in speechless expectation wait such was the solemn silence which overspread the shrine of ammon or dodonas shades when anxious mortals from the mouth of jove their doom explored nor polydorus long suspends the grecians but resumes his tale as i this night accompanied the steps of ariana ever we reached the straits before our view then opening one appeared with hasty feet now traversing the way now fixed intensely toward the grecian wall then on a sudden starting would renew his restless pace as nearer we approached he by the moon which glimmerd over our heads descried us when advancing he demands where bent our midnight course i knew the voice of demaratus to my breast i clasped the venerable exile and replied our purpose ask not spartas camp we seek and oh farewell for ever he rejoined thrice happy polydorus thou again shall visit sparta to these eyes denied upon your paths may heavens protection smile soon as you mix with yon triumphant tents say to the spartans whose unconquered arms defend those rocks you saw their exiled king say though their blind credulity deprived the wretched demaratus of his home from every joy secluded which awaits the parent and the husband from his wife his offspring torn his friends and native gates him from his virtue could they never divide say that even here where all are kings or slaves amid the riot of flagitious courts not quite extinct the spartan spirit glows within his breast though grief has dimmed its fires remembering this to lacedaemons chief report that newly to the persian host returned a malian epialtes named who as a spy had sought the grecian tents he to the tyrant magnified his art which with delusive eloquence had wrought the greeks to such despair that asias king had been ever now their sovereign master owned had not the spirit of their single chief by fear unconquered and on death resolved restored their valor therefore would the king trust to his guidance a selected band they soon should pierce the unguarded bounds of greece led through a secret passage over the hills where no leonidas should bar their way meantime by him the treacherous thebans sent assurance of their aid the assenting king at once decreed two myriads to advance with hyperanthes with abrocomes and bold hydarnes every chief besides whom youth or valor or ambition warms roused by the traitors eloquence attends from all the nations fired with eager zeal the first to enter greece in silence now the youth remains tremendous from his seat uprose plataeas chief his eyes were flames and thus on trembling anaxander burst the furious accents from his livid lips yet ever we fall o traitor shall this arm to hells avenging furies sink thy head all now is tumult every bosom swells with rage untamed and vengeance half unsheathed diomedons impetuous falchion blazed but as the cholchian sorceress renowned in fables old or circe when they framed a potent spell from erebus to wake the dead in dark and fleeting forms to glide before the moons dim twilight with their charms smoothed all the sea and silenced each rude blast till not a billow heaved against the shore nor even the wantonwinged zephir breathed the lightest whisper through the magic air so when thy voice leonidas is heard fell discord listens rage with sacred awe subsides in silence while confusion slept withhold this rashness interposed the king before we punish let us find the guilt not yet has persia overturned our tents not yet her barbarous shouts our ears alarm we still have time for vengeance and to know if yet our swords destruction may repel or how to die most glorious then arose dieneces and thus the greeks bespake ever yet they pass our borders xerxes host must learn to conquer and the greeks to fly the spears of phocis guard the secret pass let instant messengers be thither sent to know the persians progress alpheus here leonidas behold my willing feet shall to the phocians bear thy great commands or climb the hills to mark the approaching foe thou active son of valor thus returns the chief of lacedaemon in my thoughts for ever present when the public cause demands the swift the vigilant and bold go and surmount the rocks aerial height and while around dieneces conducts an hundred spartans to the phocians aid thou from the hills observe the persians march before the purplewinged morn the night retiring warned their conference to cease they all disperse when hastening on his course and ready now to climb the lofty crags o polydorus alpheus thus exclaims long lost and late recovered we must part once more and now for ever thou return and kiss the sacred soil which gave thee birth which calls thee back to freedom dearest youth i should have tears to give thee  but farewell my country chides me loitring in thy arms this said he quits his brother and ascends while polydorus answers alpheus no i have the marks of bondage to erase my blood must wash the shameful stain away we have a father maron interposed thy unexpected presence will revive his heavy age that childless else will mourn here polydorus with a gloomy smile ill should i comfort others view these eyes faint is their light and vanished is my bloom before its hour of ripeness in my breast grief as a native will for ever dwell nor yield to time unceasing shall my soul brood over the dire remembrance of my youth in servitude thus wasted life with me has lost its savor then in silent woe he hangs his head his brother pleads in vain he answers only with repeated groans now in his view dieneces advanced with spartas band on them his eyes are fixed immovable and thus his mind revolves i too like these in lacedaemon sprung instructed once like these to poize the spear and lift the ponderous shield illdestind wretch thy arm is now enervate and would fail beneath the bucklers weight o cruel heaven who did compel my freeborn hand to change the warriours arms for ignominious bonds would thou compensate for my chains my shame my ten years sorrows and the black despair which on my youth has preyed propitious once grant i may bear my buckler to the field and known a spartan seek the shades below he ceased and sudden turned his steps aside to find the tent of agis there the youth with grateful sorrow ministers his aid while with a kind and hospitable hand the gentle agis by her lovers corse on one sad bier the pallid beauties laid of ariana he from shackles frees two persian captives whom his generous arm that day preserved from slaughter then began to you i give that freedom which you sought to snatch from me this recompense i ask and this alone transport to asias camp these bleeding relics bid the persian king weep over this flower thus blasted in its pride then say the alljudging gods have thus ordained thou whose ambition over the groaning earth leads desolation over the nations spreads calamity and tears thou first shall mourn and through thy house destruction first shall range thus charged to asias host the captives bend they soon attain the phocian wall where now was dithyrambus stationd he perceives the mournful bier approach to him the fate of ariana was already told he meets the captives when with weeping eyes on teribazus turned he thus exclaims o as thy arms present thee had thou been indeed a grecian then thy generous heart its valor never had wasted to support a kings injustice then a gentler fate had blessed thy life or bleeding thou had known how sweet is death for liberty a greek this friendly wish affords thee though his head had lost the honors gathered from thy fall when fortune favored or propitious heaven smiled on the better cause illfated pair whom with this stream of pity here i lave but that my hostile hands imbrued with gore must be ungrateful to your loathing shades from all the neighboring valleys would i cull their fairest growth and strew your hearse with flowers yet o accept these tears and pious prayers may peace attend your ashes may your shades pass over the silent pool to happier seats where tyrants never can enter to molest the blissful region but are far removed to realms of horror where from righteous heaven they bear those pains they merit from mankind he ceased in tears the captives leave the wall and slowly down thermopylae proceed end of the sixth book leonidas book vii the argument the bodies of teribazus and ariana are brought into the presence of xerxes soon after a report had reached the camp that half his navy was shipwrecked the persian monarch quite dispirited is persuaded by argestes one of the satraps to send an ambassador to the spartan king argestes himself is deputed who after revealing his ambassy to leonidas in secret is by him led before the whole army and there receives his answer in the mean time alpheus returns and declares that the enemies were possessed of the passages in the hills and were hastening to thermopylae upon which leonidas offers to send away all the army except his three hundred spartans but diomedon demophilus dithyrambus and megistias refuse to depart he then dismisses argestes informs the grecians of his design to attack the persian camp in the night and making all the necessary dispositions retires to his pavilion  before the tent of xerxes now arrived the persian captives on with solemn pace and slow they move the monarch from afar descries their sad demeanor they approach nor he forbids that morn had rumor told the loss of half his navy dashed on rocks by angry blasts or buried in the surge thus when his bleeding sister met his eyes already sunk in sadness he had lost his kingly pride the parent of disdain and cold indifference for others woes nor even beside his sisters nobler corse her humble lover now his scorn awaked in tears the captives mournful tale he heard and then first knew compassion but ever long those traces vanished from the tyrants breast his former gloom redoubles for himself his anxious bosom heaves and now he fears lest he with all his numbers should be cast a prey to fortune near the monarch stood the spartan exile whom he thus bespake o demaratus what will fate ordain lo fortune turns against me who shall know how far her daring malice may extend which rages now so near me and has made my house the seat of ruin i have sent from my unshelterd side my bravest chiefs and choicest troops to pass the desert hill led by this malian may not there the greeks with opposition more tremendous still and ruinous than yester sun beheld resistless hold their craggy post renew their stony thunder with augmented rage and send whole quarries down the rocky steep again to crush my legions oh unfold thy secret soul nor hide the harshest truth say what remains to hope the exile here if truth unblamd may issue from my lips too well imperial xerxes you presage what may befall your legions if the greeks arrangd within thermopylae a pass accessible and spacious could repel with such destruction their unnumberd foes what scenes of havoc must the untrodden paths confined among the craggy hills afford immersed in care the monarch silent sat amid the incircling peers argestes stood a potent prince on sipylus he reigned whose lofty summits overlooked the waves of hermus and pactolus either stream enriched with golden sands its tribute bore to this great satrap through the servile court yet was there none more practiced in the arts of mean submission none more skilled to gain the royal favor none who better knew the phrase the looks and gesture of a slave in soothing words he thus the king bespake if xerxes will to spare his faithful bands and not exert the terrors of his power more gentle means of conquest than by arms nor less secure may artifice supply renowned darius thy imperial sire great in the spoil of kingdoms long in vain the fields of proud euphrates with his host overspread at length confiding in the wiles of zopyrus the mighty king subdued the babylonian towers but who shall count what numerous states by policy have fallen and let corruption once her aid impart not one shall stand what race of men possess such probity and wisdom whom the veil of craft may blind not nor corruptions charm seduce o xerxes thou whom heaven has raised to more than mortal greatness can thou find through all thy empire which from indias shore shall reach eurotas soon no dazzling gift to gain the grecian leader o dispel the cloud of sadness from those sacred eyes and proffer straight to lacedaemons chief what may thy own munificence declare and win his sword to aid thee xerxes here roused from his trance of sorrow swift replied wise are thy words and counsels go repair my faithful servant to the grecian chief fall down before him bid him join our arms and he shall reign over all the grecian states at once argestes leaves the monarchs side he now approaches to the phocian wall thence dithyrambus leads him to the tent of lacedaemons king retreated there alone the hero meditating sat on future woes to persia at his feet prone bows argestes and begun thus low before thy awful presence xerxes wills that i should bend me prostrate to the earth and thus accost thee great and matchless chief by fortune favored and beloved by heaven thus says the lord of asia join our arms and we reward thee with the sovereign rule over all the powerful states of haughty greece and o illustrious warrior heed my words think on the bliss of royalty the pomp of courts their endless pleasures trains of slaves who restless watch for thee and thy delights with all the glories of unrivaled sway look on the ionic and aeolian greeks from them their fantom liberty is flown while in each province raised by xerxes hand some favored chief presides exalted state which envious freedom gives not on his head he bears the gorgeous diadem and sees his equals once now prostrate at his throne yet how much greater thou whom general greece that teems with mightiest states shall call her lord thee only worthy how will greece rejoice around thy throne and hail the auspicious hour when thou selected by the persian king to bless consenting nations with thy sway did calm the fury of unsparing war which else had deluged all with blood and flames he said the chief replies not but commands the thespian youth who near the tent had watched to summon all the grecians he obeys while from his seat the hero moved and bade the persian follow he amazed attends surrounded soon by all the grecian bands when him the godlike spartan thus bespake here persian tell thy ambassy repeat that to obtain my friendship asias lord bids me accept the sovreignty of greece then view this band whose valor shall preserve that greece unconquered which your king bestows and strew your bodies on its crimson plains the indignation painted on their looks and generous scorn shall answer for their chief the hero ceased when suddenly returned the speed of alpheus all suspended straight on him direct their sight who thus began ever i could join the phocians from the hill which overhung the close defile i viewed the powers of persia down the narrow strait no sooner gleamd the innumerable spears but by our angry destiny misled or some cursed demon enemy to greece the phocians quit their station through the pass an inundation of barbarians pours the traitor epialtes is their guide and to thermopylae directs their course he here concludes unutterable fear in horrid silence wrapped the listening throng aghast confounded silent too were those who knew no terror yet with wonder mute thickwedgd enclosed leonidas around who thus with calmest elocution spoke i now behold my destiny complete and how at last leonidas must die here with the spartans shall i rest behind while you my faithful brave allies retreat then art thou near thou glorious sacred hour which shall my countrys liberty confirm all hail thou solemn period thee the tongues of virtue fame and freedom shall record and celebrate in ages yet unborn then o farewell megistias wise and brave thou too experienced venerable chief demophilus farewell farewell to thee invincible diomedon to thee unequalled dithyrambus and to all you other dauntless warriors who may claim praise from my lips and friendship from my heart you after all the wonders which your swords have here accomplished shall enrich your names with fresh renown your valor must complete what we begin here first the astonished foe a dying spartan shall with terror view and tremble while he conquers then by fate led from his dreadful victory dismayed against the phalanx of united greece by your unconquered spears himself shall fall here interposed the fierce plataean chief by the twelve gods enthroned in heaven supreme by my fair name unsullied yet i swear never shall thy eyes leonidas behold diomedon forsake thee first let strength desert my limbs and valor shun my heart did i not face the marathonian war have i not seen thermopylae o fame what more can thou bestow or i receive where can i living purchase brighter praise than dying here a more illustrious tomb where can i gain than underneath the heaps of persians fallen the victims of our sword he ended when demophilus subjoined o king of sparta pride of human race whom none ever equaled but the seed of jove thy own forefather numbered with the gods lo i am old with faltring steps i tread the prone descent of years the winged hours by me as one unequal to their speed who can no more their fleeting joys attain unheeding slide my youth my country claimed my age no more can serve her what remains what eligible hope can wisdom form but to die well upon this glorious earth with thee unrivaled hero will i close the eve of life so spoke the hoary chief when dithyrambus next o first of greeks me too think worthy to attend thy fame with this most dear and venerable man for ever honored from my tenderest age even till on lifes extremity we part nor too aspiring let my hopes be deemed should the barbarian in his triumphs mark my youthful limbs among the gory heaps thence may his fears be doubled when again he meets in fields hereafter to be known the grecian standards trembling at a foe to whom the flower and blooming joys of life are less alluring than a noble fate to him demophilus will thou too bleed my dithyrambus  but i here withhold all counsel from thee who art wise as brave if then thy magnanimity retain thee too with great leonidas to fall at eithers side our limbs shall press the ground and drop together in the arms of death so if the attentive traveller we draw to our cold relics wondering shall he trace the different scene and pregnant with applause o wise old man exclaim thou well have chose the hour of fate and o unequalled youth who to thy country did thy bloom devote may thou remain for ever dear to fame may time rejoice to name thee and may peace with gentlest pinions hover over thy urn this said the hero with his lifted shield his face oershades and drops a secret tear not this the tear of anguish but derived from fond affection grown mature with time which in a feebler mind to pain had turned but in the thespians firm and virtuous breast alone a manly tenderness awaked unmixed with pity or with vain regret megistias last addressed the spartan chief thou whom the gods have chosen to exalt above mankind in virtue and renown o call not me presumptuous who implore among these heroes thy regardful ear to lacedaemon i a stranger came you there preserved me there with honors clad nor have i yet one benefit repaid that now the generous spartans may behold in me their high beneficence not vain here to their cause i consecrate my breath not so megistias interposed the king thou and thy son retreat again the seer forbid it thou eternally adored o jove confirm my persevering soul nor let my fear neglect this happy hour to show the spartans i deserved their care thou menalippus hear the kings command and my paternal tenderness revere do thou withdraw thee from me to my hand thy arms resigning fortune will supply fresh toil for valor vanquish then or find a glorious grave but spare thy fathers eye the bitter anguish to behold thy youth untimely bleed before him grief suspends his speech and interchangeably their arms impart their last embraces either wept the hoary parent and the blooming son but from his temples the pontific wreath megistias now unloosens and resigns his hallowed vestments while the youth with tears the helmet buckles over his snowy locks and on his breast adjusts the radiant mail while such contempt of life such fervid zeal to die with glory animate the greeks far other thoughts possess argestes soul amaze with mingled terror smote his heart cold drops distilled from every pore bedew his shivering limbs his bosom pants his knees yield to their burden ghastly pale his cheeks pale are his lips and trembling such the minds of slaves corrupt to them the beauteous face of virtue turns to horror but the chief of lacedaemon now the wretch bespake return to xerxes tell him on this rock the grecians faithful to their post await his chosen myriads tell him thou have seen how far the lust of empire is below a freeborn mind and tell him to behold a tyrant humbled and by virtuous death to seal my countrys freedom is a good surpassing all his boasted power can give he said the persian hastens through the pass but now once more diomedon arose wrath overcasts his forehead while he spoke yet more must stay and bleed inglorious thebes never shall receive her traitors back but here shall they atone their perfidy by death even from their swords to whom their abject hearts have sacrificed their faith nor dare to hope ye vile deserters of the public weal ye coward slaves that mingled with the heaps of those who perish in their countrys cause you shall your shame conceal whoever shall pass along this field of glorious slain and trace with veneration every nobler corse his soul though warm with generous applause a while shall curb the transport to repeat its execrations over your impious heads on whom that fate which gives to others fame is infamy and vengeance dreadful thus on the pale thebans sentence he pronounced like rhadamanthus from the infernal throne when with inexorable frowns he doomed the guilty dead to everduring pain while phlegethon its flaming billows rolled before their sight and ruthless furies shook their hissing serpents all the greeks assent with clamours echoing through the concave rock forth anaxander in the assembly stood and thus began with indignation feigned if yet your clamours grecians are allayed behold i stand before you to demand why these my brave companions who alone of all the thebans under my command durst force their passage through dissuading crowds to join your host should now be traitors deemed accused by one alone a banished wretch whom lacedaemon in her anger drove far from her confines one who meanly sought a servile court for shelter has he drawn such virtues thence that sparta who before held him unworthy of his native soil should trust him now before auxiliar friends injurious greeks we scorn the thought of flight let asia bring her millions unconstrained we wait the conflict and for greece will die thus in the garb of virtue he adorned necessity deluding every greek except laconias hero he perceived through all its fair disguise the traitors heart so when at first mankind in science rude revered the moon as bright with native beams some sage that walked with nature through her works by wisdom led discerned the various orb itself was dark in foreign splendours clad now unexpected with his troop returned dieneces and thus to spartas king i need not tell thee that the persian powers have passed the secret strait this night they halt but with the morning will invade us here we come to die with thee united thus our strength a fiercer contest shall maintain whence a more bright example to our friends and stronger terror of the grecian name he said when thus leonidas began o spartans hear and all you other greeks whose matchless virtue shall inroll your names in times eternal records and inhance your countrys luster lo the setting sun inflames the broad horizon all retire and in your tents invoke the power of sleep to aid your vigor and to give your limbs unwearied patience of continued toil but when the second watch begins let all with mutual exhortation rouse to arms for soon as cynthia from the vault of heaven has hung her shining lamp through asias host shall death with horror and amazement rage their camp is open to our swords deprived of all its chosen warriors but i charge all even the spartans who are maimed or weak to pain or toil unequal from our camp this hour to hasten you our brave allies of corinth phlius with the arcadian bands and mycenaeans must not yet return but here while we repose in arms remain when we our tents abandon then depart he said all heard obedient and dispersed while to his tent the godlike chief repairs and with him agis whom he thus bespake o agis hear and mark my last command with wary skill dispose the nightly guard that no deserter from the theban tents may reach the camp of asia or ascend to those now halting on the neighboring hills nor yet with us the faithless band must join not with such base associates must we trust our great design their perfidy might soon find means to rouse the unsuspecting foe and all our glorious enterprise confound then o my faithful agis ever we move while on the solemn sacrifice intent as lacedaemons sacred laws ordain our prayers we offer to the tuneful nine do thou in whispers charge the theban train slow and in silence to disperse and fly this said they parted on his couch alone reclines the hero where he thus revolves my fate is now impending o my heart what more auspicious period could i choose for death than now when beating high with joy thou tell me i am happy if to live or die as virtue dictates be to know the purest bliss if she her charms display still beauteous still unfading still serene to youth to age to death whatever be those other climes of uncorruptive joy which heaven in dark futurity conceals still here o virtue thou art all our good then what a black unspeakable reverse the wretched offspring of injustice prove what in the struggle of departing day when lifes last glimpse extinguishing presents the unknown inextricable gloom of death but can i paint the terrors of a breast where guilt resides leonidas forego the horrible conception seek again thy own untroubled heart and grateful bow to those benignant powers who framed thy mind in crimes unfruitful never to admit the black impression of a guilty thought else could i fearless thus relinquish life no such unshaken calmness from the unjust is ever absent often in them the rage of some prevailing passion for a time suppresses fear often hurried on they lose the sense of danger when dominion power and purple pomp their dazzled sight enchant yet still the joys of life alone they seek but he who calmly meets resistless fate when glory only and the general good invite him forward must possess a soul which all content deducing from itself can by unerring virtues constant light discern when death is worthy of his choice the man thus great and happy in the scope of his large mind is stretched beyond his date even on this shore of being he in thought supremely blessed anticipates the good which late posterity from him derives the hero closed his meditation here the swelling transports of his mind subside in soft oblivion while the silken plumes of sleep envelop his extended limbs end of the seventh book leonidas book viii the argument leonidas rising about three hours before midnight relates to an assembly of the leaders a dream which is interpreted by megistias he then arms himself and marches in procession with his whole troop to an altar newly raised on a neighboring meadow and there offers a sacrifice to the muses he invokes the assistance of those goddesses he animates his companions and then placing himself at their head leads them against the enemy in the dead of the night  scarce was begun the second watch of night when his pavilion agis left and sought the chief of lacedaemon him he found spread on his tranquil couch while over his face diffused a glad serenity with smiles his slumber painted like an evening sky yet streaked with ruddy light when summer suns have veiled their beaming foreheads transport filled the eye of agis friendship swelled his heart and veneration on his knee inclined the heros hand he kissed and thus began o thou with more than human virtues great accept this homage and may gentle sleep yet longer close thy eyelids that unblamd i thus may bow before thee thus he spoke and prostrate bent his godlike friend revered whose eye the shades of slumber now forsake so when new rising heavens resplendent orb illumines first the sable skirts of night the whiterobd magi or the indian seers are seen from ganges or euphrates side before the emerging glory bowed to hail the radiant emblem of the immortal mind both heroes rose and mixed their friendly arms and now to agis had the spartan king disclosed his soul when lo the grecian chiefs all roused advancing with the sudden gleam of armor pierced the twilight shade with joy leonidas accosts them o thrice hail my virtuous friends approach and all attend while i relate and you with wonder hear this night no sooner sleep oppressed my brows but over my head the empyreal form of my great sire alcides seemed displayed i saw his magnitude divine his voice i heard his solemn mandate to arise i rose he bade me follow i obeyed up to a mountain whose ethereal brow the involving clouds divided we ascend ever long we rested suddenly the howl of wolves and dogs the vultures piercing shriek the yell of every beast and fowl of prey within my ears discordant broke i turned when lo a surface all with gore deformed beyond my view illimitable stretched one vast expanse of horror there a corse which with its huge dimensions seemed to hide the unbounded plain lay weltring red with wounds delvd in the enormous limbs which bleeding gorged the vultures famine wondering i beheld when from behind i heard a second sound like surges trembling over a craggy shore again i turned an ocean there appeared with riven keels and shrouds and shivered oars with arms and mangled carcases bestrewn innumerous the billows foamed with blood and whelmed a crimson deluge over the strand but where the waters unobserved before between two adverse shores contracting rolled a stormy tide upon the beach forlorn one of majestic stature i descried in ornaments imperial often on me he bent his clouded eye balls on my name with imprecations often he called aloud then rent his splendid garments and his head in rage divested of its graceful hairs impatient now he eyed a slender skiff which mounted on the curling foam approached with indignation and reluctant grief once more his sight reverting he embarked amid the perils of the frowning waves o thou whose virtue ranked thee with the gods i here exclaimed instruct me what produced this desolation when the god returned let thy astonished eye again review what thou did late abhor i looked and saw a land where plenty with disporting hand poured all the fruits of amaltheas horn where bloomed the olive and the clustring vine with its broad foliage mantled every hill where ceres with exuberance inrobd the pregnant bosom of the fields in gold where spacious towns whose circuits proud contained the dazzling works of wealth unnumberd shone the strength and splendor of the peopled land then in a moment clouds obscured my sight and all was vanished from my waking eyes thrice we salute the omen thus began the sage megistias in thy mystic dream i see the grecian victories the earth the deep shall own their triumphs and the tears of asia and of lybia shall bewail their offspring cast before the vultures beak and all the monstrous natives of the main those joyous fields of plenty shall be greece enriched with conquest and barbarian spoils and whom thou saw in regal vesture clad print on the sands his solitary steps is xerxes foiled and fugitive from greece megistias thus while every bosom felt enthusiastic rapture joy beyond all sense and all conception but of those who die to save their country here again leonidas the exulting chiefs addressed since happiness from virtue is derived who for his country dies that moment proves most happy as most virtuous such our lot to this the gods shall add eternal fame but now go forth megistias and with speed prepare the victim and the sacred flames that to the muses as the spartan law commands our prayers and offerings may be paid ever to yon camp our hostile feet we bend but o remember from the solemn rites let every sound be absent not the pipe nor even the musicbreathing flute be heard meantime ye leaders every band instruct to move in silence nor with shouts alarm the midnight stillness mindful of their charge the chiefs depart leonidas provides his various armor first the breastplate arms his ample chest over this the hero spreads the mailed cuirass from his shoulders hung the shining belt infolds his mighty loins next on his stately temples he erects the plumed helm then grasps his ponderous shield where nigh the center on the swelling brass the inimitable artist had imbossd the shape of great alcides whom to gain two goddesses contended pleasure here won with soft wiles the attracted eye and there the form of virtue dignified the scene in her majestic sweetness was disclosed the mind sublime and happy from her lips seemed eloquence to flow with looks serene but fixed intent upon the son of jove she waved her hand where winding to the skies her paths ascended on the summit stood fame and protended her eternal trump incumbent on a trophy near to heaven the youth attentive to her wisdom owned the prevalence of virtue while his eye with all the spirit which redeemed the world from tyranny and monsters ardent flamed not undescried by pleasure where she lay stretched on a gorgeous carpet which bespread the meadow with magnificence around were flourets strewn and wantonly in rills soft streams maeanderd all relaxed her limbs nor wanting yet solicitude to gain what lost she feared as struggling with despair she seemed collecting all her power of charms and with excess of sweet allurement smiled in vain for virtue swayed alcides mind hence all his labors traced with various art they filled the surface of the spacious targe this portraiture of glory on his arm leonidas supports then forth he towers from his pavilion with their troops arrayed the chiefs attended flaming torches blazed in every hand and now with silent pace all to the solemn sacrifice proceed first polydorus with the hallowed knife and barley strewn with sacred salt advanced diomedon beside him in his grasp a weighty mace sustaining like the rest all bright in armor with his shield and spear megistias followed an unspotted priest and dauntless warrior from on high his helm with wreaths around the shining crest revealed his sacerdotal honors by the horns where laurels twined with alpheus maron leads the consecrated ox and lo behind leonidas approaches never before with such transcending majesty he trod nor his own virtue as that hour enjoyed then venerable moves the thespian chief and great dieneces to them the bloom of dithyrambus glowing with the sense of future praise succeeds with graceful steps the generous agis next the thebans last repining and inglorious then slow march the host all mute nor shake their brazen arms not from thermopylae remote the hills of oeta yielding to a fruitful dale within their side halfcircling had enclosed a fair expanse with verdure smooth the bounds were edged with wood oerlookd by snowy cliffs which from the clouds bent frowning from a rock above the loftiest summit of the groves a tumbling torrent wore the shagged stone then gleaming through the interwoven shade the valley watered over the level shone its glassy bosom and with placid waves the smiling lawn divided near the banks which flowers made various newerected stood a rustic altar which a chosen train appointed by megistias raised with turf cut by their falchions from the verdant mead broad was the surface high with piles of wood the plenteous tribute of the adjacent groves all interspersed with laurel here a vase filled with the briny waters of the sea more pure than every stream or fountain deemed was placed beside the altar there with wine unmixed capacious goblets stood arrangd here is the victim brought megistias straight his helm unloosens with his hoary head uncovered round the solemn pile he treads and with a branch of laurel scatters wide the sacred moisture of the main his hand with mingled salt and barley next bestrews the altar and the victim over the horns the inverted goblet foaming with the grape diffused the rich libation now advanced diomedon megistias gave command down sunk the victim with a deathful stroke nor groaned megistias buries in the throat the hallowed steel a crimson deluge flows swift from the limbs the fuming hide is torn the flesh disseverd on the altar heaped now smoaks the pile then sudden flames abroad a burst of splendor dissipates the dark greece throngs around each lifts a sparkling brand with beaming javelins intermixed and shields and polished helms which multiply the blaze meantime the great leonidas drew nigh and stood before the altar there his helm unclaspd to agis he commits his shield and spear to dithyrambus then his arms extending thus in supplication spoke harmonious daughters of olympian jove who on the top of helicon adored and high parnassus with delighted ears bend to the warble of castalias wave and aganippes murmurs if from thence we must invoke your presence or along the ridge of neighboring pindus if your steps now wander through your consecrated bowers thence turn ye muses nor for once disdain each with her beauteous form these hills to grace and stand the immortal witness of our fate but with you bring fair liberty whom jove and you most honor let her sacred eyes approve her dying grecians let her voice with exultation tell the earth and heavens these are her sons then strike your tuneful shells and with our praise bid harmony rejoice record us guardians of our parents age our matrons virtue and our infants bloom and glorious bulwarks of our countrys laws who shall enoble the historians page or on the joyous festival inspire with loftier strains the virgins choral song then o celestial maids on yonder camp let night sit heavy and a sleep like death weigh down the eye of asia o infuse a cool untroubled spirit in our breasts which may in silence guide our daring feet through all the paths of slaughter nor affright the dark with tumult till the dying groans of gasping tyrants into horror wake the midnight calm then turn destruction wild bid terror and confusion revel round and in one carnage heap the barbarous ranks their horse and chariots let the spurning steed imbrue his hoofs with blood and shattered cars crush with their brazen weight the prostrate necks of kings and purpled chiefs incircled round by nations fallen  you countrymen and friends my last commands attend your genrals voice once more salutes you not to rouse the brave or minds resolved and dauntless to confirm too well by this expiring blaze i view impatient valor flash from every eye but temper well your ardour and your lips close on the rising transport lo how sleep has folded millions in its black embrace no sound is wasted from the unnumberd foe the winds themselves are silent all conspires to this great sacrifice where thousands soon shall only wake to die perhaps our swords this night may send even xerxes self to lead the innumerable train of persian ghosts to plutos dreery shade unless reserved from all this ruin to lament his shame and future flight when greece confounds that power which we will shake but now the second watch is verging to its period and the moon prepares to glimmer on our darksome steps let each his head distinguish with a wreath of twining laurel then the goblet crown and share the victim take your last repast for with your fathers and the heroes old you next shall banquet in the blessed abodes while thus the hero through the thronging files presenting round a hideous depth of war all shook with ardour their erected spears thick as the fruitful growth of lofty pines which from high pelions cloudinvested brow to heavens blue vault their stately honors bear megistias soon through all the band divides the sacred laurel snatched with eager zeal by every hand and round each helmet wove it blends its verdure with the floating plumes then is the victim portiond while the bowl flows with the vines impurpled stream aloof the theban train in wan dejection mute brood over their shame or cast a frighted eye on that determined virtue which unmoved at fates approach with cheerful lips could taste the sparkling goblet and with joy partake that last and glorious banquet even the heart of anaxander now forgets its wiles its fear no more dissembling agis here for ever mindful of his friends command mixed with the thebans and in whispers thus leonidas permits you to retire while in the rites of sacrifice employed none heed your motions separate and fly with silent steps at once the theban troop its ranks dissolving from the greeks withdraws unseen it moulders from the host like snow which from the mountains in ten thousand rills soon as the sun exerts his orient beam descends softtrickling while the hoary heap insensibly decays the grecians soon conclude the solemn banquet and their chief now reassumes his arms before his step the crowd rolls backward in their gladdend sight his crest irradiate with the uplifted brands its purple splendor shakes the towering oak thus from a lofty promontory waves its majesty of verdure while with joy the sailor marks its heavnascending pride which from afar directs his foamy course along the pathless ocean so the greeks exulting gazed as down their opening ranks their chief proceeds from whose majestic grace a soul like thine o phidias might conceive in parian marble or effulgent brass the form of great apollo when the god won by the prayers of mans afflicted race in arms forsook his lucid throne to pierce the monster python in the delphian vale close by the hero polydorus waits to guide destruction through the asian tents as the young eagle near his parents side in wanton flight essays his vigorous wings ever long with her to penetrate the clouds to dart impetuous on the fleecy train and dye his beak with gore by spartas king the injured polydorus thus prepares his arm for death and feasts his angry soul with promised vengeance his impatient thoughts even now transport him furious to the seat of his long sorrows not with shackled hands but now once more a spartan with his shield and dreadful spear to lead his countrys bands and with them vengeance nor the rest of greece neglect to form their helmets now unite their various plumage as the intwining boughs mix their broad foliage in dodonas grove or like the cedars on the syrian hills which with their shady texture as with night the gloomy soil overcast in ordered ranks while thus they stand behold a warlike form in gleaming arms slowmoving through the shade led by a slave approached laconias king and thus addressed him o leonidas thou see before thee eurytus a name to thee and every spartan not unknown thy ruling voice forbade the maimed to stay i whose dark orbs no longer know the sun immersed in sudden blindness since our march from lacedaemon with the rest withdrew not to revisit sparta but resolved to meet the persians in the public way i sat not long before the increasing sound of trampling feet alarmed me which i deemed were persias numbers rushing from the hills i started upward grasping in my hand my spear and buckler by my slave withheld who told me they were thebans lo i bear the tidings of their flight and now my chief and countrymen farewell do you proceed with death and terror fill the hostile camp while i the fury of the exulting foe descending from the mountains here await to yield the last remains of tedious life now to my country useless and to me and close these shaded eyes in endless night he ceased when thus leonidas began then stay my faithful soldier and obtain not the least honors in this glorious night and you my brave associates all exult one spirit now inspires us from our band doubt fear and treason with the thebans fly while all with mutual confidence advance and equal fires this said once more the king on the deep phalanx his attentive eye reverts and through the ruddy gleam descries one face of gladness but the illustrious van he most contemplates agis alpheus there megistias maron and plataeas chief dieneces demophilus are drawn and dithyrambus they their fixed sight on him too bend with inexpressive joy with love and veneration till they hear his last command when instant to the earth are cast the extinguished brands on all around drops sudden darkness on the hills the woods the silver stream the rocks and floating main it now was midnight to the hostile camp with steps composed and silent down the pass the phalanx moves each patient bosom hushed its struggling spirit nor in whispers breathed the rapturous ardour virtue then inspired but all await the moment doomed to give the barbarous millions to their deathful steel so lowering clouds expanding from the north a while suspend their horrors destined soon to blaze in lightnings and to burst in storms end of the eighth book leonidas book ix the argument leonidas and the grecians penetrate through the persian camp to the very pavilion of xerxes who avoids destruction by flight the barbarians are slaughtered in great multitudes and their camp is set on fire leonidas conducts his men back to thermopylae engages the persians who were descended from the hills and after numberless proofs of superior strength and valor sinks down covered with wounds and expires the last of all the grecian commanders  the waining moon displayed her gleaming horns when over the unguarded bound of asias camp now passed the grecians through the unnumberd tents where all was mute and tranquil they pursue their silent march the eastern world around lay stretched in slumber motionless and deaf wrapped in the dead security of night nor marked the steps of fate the wary greeks by polydorus guided still proceed even to the center of the extensive host unseen they pierced when now the imperial tent yet distant rose before them wide around the proud pavilion stretched an ample space where myriads might imbattle here a band of chosen persians watchful round their king held their nocturnal station as the hearts of anxious nations menaced with the waste of meager famine and the ruthless sword sink in their frozen bosoms while despair sees fearingenderd fantoms in the sky aerial hosts amid the clouds arrayed which seem to shake the firmament with war portending woe and death the persians thus are smote with consternation as the moon by her faint beam discovered from afar the glimpse of grecian arms with sudden cries they waken horror which to xerxes couch and over the astonished host swiftwinged flew dispelling sleep and silence all the camp pours forth its numbers naked pale unarmed wild with amazement blinded by dismay to every foe obnoxious when at once plunged in ten thousand breasts the grecian steel reeks with destruction deluges of blood float over the field and foam around the heaps of wretches slain unconscious of the hand which mows them down by legions from his couch the lord of asia and of lbia st amaze affright distraction in his look and sees in thought united greece advance where then was fled the empty pride of kings the hope of glory and the lust of power what then availed the innumerable range of thy huge camp save only to conceal thy trembling steps o xerxes while thou fliest leonidas before the grecian van through bleeding thousands hews his dreadful way before him terror strides gigantic death and desolation at his side attend with all the furies of insatiate war to xerxes tent the hero speeds nor finds his victim ardent throngs of grecians fill the stately mansion to the ground are hurled the glittering ensigns of imperial power the diadem the scepter late adored and feared by millions underneath their feet with mingled rage and scorn the grecians crush a sacrifice to freedom now return the furious bands leonidas exalts for new destruction his resistless spear when sudden night oershrouds the spangled heavens and clouds condensing intercept the moon black over the furrowed main the raging east in whirlwinds sweeps the surge now roars the coast the crashing forests and the cavernd rocks swift through the camp the hurricane impells its dire career when asias numbers veiled amid the sheltering horrors of the storm evade the spartan lance the grecians halt by great leonidas restrained and wait near xerxes tent their mighty leaders will beside the high pavilion from the time that xerxes near thermopylae had drawn his numerous bands perpetual fire had shone before whose sacred light the persian lord was wont among his magi to adore the power of oromasdes piles of wood lay nigh prepared to feed the constant flame these on the altar by the greeks are strewn so wills laconias hero while the winds excite the blaze his phalanx he divides four bands are formed by dithyrambus led by alpheus by diomedon the last himself commands the word is given the greeks press to the fire soon shrink the burning heaps destructive flames they brandish and enjoined to reassemble at the regal tent by various paths the hostile camp invade resistless desolation now involves the malian fields as over the eastern tents from different stations flew ten thousand brands hurled by the greeks unrespited the winds with violence redoubled breathing round tempestuous rage exasperate the blaze the conflagration like a sea expands collected now from every part it forms one waving surface of unbounded fire in ruddy volumes mount the curling flames to heavens dark vault and paint the midnight clouds so when the north emits its purpled lights the undulating radiance streaming wide as with a burning canopy invests the ethereal concave oeta now disclosed its forehead glittering with eternal frost while down the rocks the foamy torrents shone far over the main the pointed rays were thrown night snatched her mantle from the oceans breast the billows glimmer from the distant shores but where ascends a pillar huge of smoke with wreathing flames incircled horror there and death on great leonidas attend he bade the exulting polydorus lead where asias horse and chariots stood arrangd there at his word devouring vulcan feasts on all the tribute which thessalias meads yield to the scythe and riots on the heaps of ceres emptied of the ripened grain a flood of fire envelopes all the ground the cordage bursts of every blazing tent down sink the roofs and overwhelm the throng of wretches panting from the spartan sword closewedgd with fear the libyan chariot burns the arabian camel and the persian steed bound through the fiery deluge wild with pain they shake their singed manes with madding hoofs dash through the blood of thousands mixed with flames that rage augmented by the whirlwinds blast meantime the sceptered lord of half the globe through the wide tumult like a guilty slave from tent to tent precipitates his flight dispersed are all his satraps pride itself shuns his dejected brow despair alone with pale confusion and with frantic fear wait on the imperial fugitive and show as round the camp his eye distracted roves no limits to destruction now was seen aurora mounting from the eastern hills in rosy sandals and with dewy locks the winds subside before her darkness flies and streams of light proclaim the cheerful day when now at xerxes tent the grecian band was reunited what could fortune more to aid the valiant and to gorge revenge lo desolation over the persian host has emptied all its horrors even the hand of languid slaughter drops its crimson steel nor nature longer can sustain the toil of everduring conquest yet what power among the grecians once again revived their drooping warmth newbracd their nerves and called their wearied swords to deeds of brighter fame what but the inspiring hope of glorious death to crown their labor and the auspicious look of their heroic chief which still unchanged still with superior majesty declared no toil had yet relaxed his matchless strength nor worn the vigor of his godlike soul down to the pass with gentle march he leads the imbattled warriors there behind the shrubs which near the verdant feet of oeta sprung beside the entrance of the straits the greeks in ambush lay the tempest now was calmed soft breezes only from the malian wave over each grim face besmeared with smoke and gore their cool refreshment breathed the healing gale dispells the languor from their harassed limbs which swell with strength returning after all the incessant labors of the horrid night through flames and war continued they prepare in ordered battle to confront the powers of hyperanthes that selected band from asias numbers destined with the morn to pass the mountains in triumphant march with strength unwasted and with souls elate not long the greeks in expectation stood impatient sudden with tumultuous shouts like niles swift current where with deafning roar prone from the steep of elephantis falls its sea of waters hyperanthes pours his rapid legions over the grecian camp down from the hills precipitant no foe is found to stop the torrent on they roll with thundering footsteps over the sounding pass that night no sooner had the theban train thermopylae forsaken but their course they bent along the mountains till they met the powers of xerxes dusky twilight still prevailing persia with misguided rage assailed her friends unknown the impetuous spear of hyperanthes clove the faithless heart of anaxander on the hero pressed and spread destruction through their bleeding ranks nor checked his ardent valor till he heard the name of thebes in suppliant cries proclaimed the persians then receive them in the front as guides they place them and amazed to learn that daring greece should xerxes camp invade haste from the mountains rush along the pass and now tumultuous issue from its mouth at once laconias leader gives the sign when as the impulsive ram with dreadful sway oerturns the nodding rampart from its base and strews a town with ruin so the band of serried heroes down the malian steep an hideous depth the blended numbers swept of thebes and persia there no waters flow but horrid rocks present their craggy sides there dashed whole legions from their mangled limbs a tide of blood rolls foaming to the sea again thy voice leonidas is heard the grecians turn against the opening pass they point their wheeling phalanx on they rush astonished persia stops in full career even hyperanthes starts with terror back confusion drives fresh numbers from the shore whelmed in the malian slime the undaunted king of lacedaemon entered now the straits and ranged for battle hyperanthes soon recalled his chosen warriors from their fear swift on the great leonidas was bent a grove of darts the incountring armies closed whom first whom last great spartan did thou foil what rivers heard along their echoing banks thy name in curses sounded from the lips of mothers wailing for their slaughtered sons what towns with empty monuments were filled for those whom thy unconquerable sword this day to vultures cast first bessus died a haughty satrap whose tyrannic hand despoiled hyrcania of her golden sheaves and laid her forests waste for him the bees among the branches interwove their sweets for him the fig was ripened and the vine with rich profusion over the goblet foamed then dinis bled on hermus side he reigned and long had sought with unavailing love great artemisia famed in xerxes fleet the martial queen of caria she disdained the lovers soft complaint her dauntless ear was taught to mark the tempest while it raged her sight was practiced from the rolling deck to brave the chafing billows doomed to meet that day of horror when the weeping eye of xerxes saw the blood of nations flow and to its bottom tinge the briny floods of salamis whence she with asia fled she only not inglorious low reclines her lover now on hermus banks no more to sound her name nor tell the vocal groves his fruitless sorrows then madauces fell a paphlagonian born amid the sound of dashing surges and the roar of winds who over the unhospitable euxine waves was wont from high carambis cliff to watch the illfated bark which cut the pontic stream then with his dire associates through the deep for spoil and slaughter guide his hostile prow with these tithraustes far from medus fallen his native tide with blooming strength indud and manly grace lilaeus who had left the balmy fragrance of arabias fields and babylonian tenagon expired his bravest friends on every side overthrown with indignation hyperanthes viewed and in fierce haste his dauntless arm opposed to spartas hero each his lance protends but thousands rush with interposing shields such sacred lives all anxious to defend or thither fortune urged the tide of war their term protracting for augmented fame so when two galleys laboring through the foam present for battle their destructive beaks the billows often by hurricanes impelled with mountainous commotion dash between and either bark in blackning tempests veiled waft from its distant foe but fiercer burned thy ardour mighty spartan while in blood thy falchion raged unwearied now the steeds of day were climbing their meridian steep and over the persian camp the shouts of war burst from thermopylae pharnuchus heard who from his couch beyond the malian plain roused by the tumult in the neighboring tents to aid his lord had left thessalias fields with syria cholchis and armenias bands the assyrians and chaldaeans asias camp was still the seat of terror and despair as in some fruitful clime which late has known the rage of winds and floods when now the storm is heard no longer and the deluge fled still over the wasted region nature mourns in melancholy silence through the grove with prostrate glories lie the stately oak and elm uprooted while the plains are spread with fragments swept from villages overthrown and round the pastures flocks and herds are cast in weltring heaps of death so persias host in horror mute one boundless scene displays of desolation half devoured by fire its tall pavilions and its warlike cars hide all the field with ruin here in gore its princes lie and nameless thousands there here legions bleeding by the grecian steel there persians slain by persians still declare the wild confusion of the direful night when wanting signals and their leaders care they rushed to mutual slaughter xerxes tent on its exalted summit when the dawn first streaks the glowing sky was wont to bear the golden form of mithra closed between two lucid crystals to the barbarous host an awful signal all in arms to leave their crowded tents and numberless to wait their monarchs presence this pharnuchus rears high on the proud pavilion at the sight their consternation is at length dispelled and through the assembling nations hope revives pharnuchus then from all the number forms a chosen train thermopylae he seeks their march in loudest clamours is proclaimed his phalanx soon leonidas commands to circle backward from the malian shore their order changes now halforbd they stand by oetas mountains guarded from behind with either flank united to the rock as by the excelling architect disposed to shield some haven a stupendous mole framed of the grove and quarrys mingled strength in oceans bosom penetrates afar there stands the pride of art against the weight of seas unmoved and breaks the whelming surge so when pharnuchus with innumrous powers thermopylae had filled the unyielding greeks opposed the hostile deluge and its rage unshaken stemd amid the foremost rank leonidas his dreadful station held before him soon an horrid void is seen through persias legions and the proud remains of noblest chiefs the insanguind rock bestrew pharnuchus glowing with revenge and wrath discharges full at lacedaemons chief his ironstudded mace aside it glanced turned by the massy shield and prone to earth the persian fell alcander to the rock transfixed the prostrate satrap through the reins himself receiving in the unguarded side the lance of hyperanthes low he lies the only theban who by spartas king abode intrepid and to greece preserved his faith untainted a physician sage who from cithaeron each benignant herb was wont to gather and expatiate over the heliconian pastures where no plant of poison springs but such whose healing juice expells the venom from the vipers tooth filled with the sweetness of the soil divine him all who languish on the bed of pain him most the wretch whom want and sickness spreads on earths cold breast neglected shall deplore on him the brave artontes sinks in death renowned through wide bithynia now no more the clamorous rites of cybele to share while echo murmurs through the hollow caves of berecynthian dindymus the hand of alpheus sent him to the shades of night ever from the dead he disengaged his spear huge abradates glorying in his strength surpassing all of cissian race advanced to grapple with the victor near him now his foremost step the persian plants his hand grasps at the spartans shoulder alpheus once at nemeas games the wrestlers crown obtained his art he summons and his rapid foot obliquely strikes against the persians heel he falling seized on alpheus neck and dragged his foe upon him straight an hundred darts of thronging persia cleave the grecians back to abradates breast the weapons pierce and rivet both in death this maron saw and polydorus who with victims fallen before their vengeance hide their brothers corse at length the generous blood of maron warms the lance of hyperanthes on the spear of polydorus falls the ponderous ax of sacian mardus from the yielding wood the steely point is severed undismayed the spartan stoops to rear the knotted mace of slain pharnuchus but thy fatal sword abrocomes that dreadful instant marks to rend his opening side unconquered still swift he discharges on the sacians front an horrid wound that reached the bursting brain down his own limbs the while a torrent flows of vital crimson smiling he surveys his sorrows ending and his spartan name renew its luster sudden to his side springs dithyrambus through the uplifted arm of mindus pointing his impetuous dart against the bleeding spartan he impells his steel resistless polydorus now stretched his cold hand to thespias friendly chief then bowed his head in everlasting peace and mindus wasted by his flowing wound beside him faints and dies in ninus old had his exalted ancestors sustained the assyrian scepter now to persias throne a tributary lord he ruled the vales where tigris swift between the parted hills of tall niphates draws its foaming tide impregnating the glebe at once a crowd of ardent persians seize the conqurors lance an hundred arms infold it thespias youth with one strong hand maintains the struggling spear the other bares his falchion through his foes with lightning winged it scatters wounds and death artaphrenes in torture feels his arm lopt from the shoulder zatis leaves his hand yet twining round the longdisputed lance on pherons neck descends the ponderous blade down drops the severed head the vital stream spouts from its purple sluices mardon strides across the pointed ash his weight oercomes the wearied grecian who resigns his hold yet cleaves the exulting persian to the brain but now the fierce abrocomes approached and louring shakes his dart the wary greek with his broad buckler intercepts the stroke and closes with the persian then what aid of mortal force or interposing heaven preserved the eastern warrior lo the friend of teribazus eager to avenge his loved companion and at once to guard a brothers life beneath the sinewy arm that instant raised for slaughter plunged his lance in dithyrambus side the vital strings at once relax nor fame nor greece demand more from his valor and supine he lies in glories ripened on his blooming head him shall the thespian virgins in their songs record one loveliest of the youthful train the good the gentle generous and brave now fallen his countrys grace and parents pride so sinks the cedar which in verdant bloom high on the top of libanus had stood the mountains boast and glory of the grove then to adorn the mansions of the great or dignify some gods highvaulted fane uprooted lowrs its heavnaspiring head diomedon bursts forward round his friend he heaps destruction what a troop of ghosts attend thy shade fallen hero long unmatched prevailed his vengeful arm and persia bled till four assyrians on his shelving lance ever yet extracted from a prostrate corse their ponderous maces all discharge it broke yet with the truncheon of his shattered spear the greek sustains the contest through his eye the shivered fragment penetrates the brain of one bold warrior there the splintry wood infixd remains the hero then unsheaths his falchion broad a second views aghast his entrails falling while plataeas chief from the gashd belly draws his reeking sword prone sinks a third beneath the falchions weight though with the furious stroke the yielding blade flew from the hilt and left the greek disarmed the fourth that instant lifts his knotted mace it falls resistless on the battered helm and low the great diomedon extends his mighty limbs so weakened by the force of some tremendous engine which the hand of mars impells a stately turret spreads its disuniting ramparts on the plain joy fills the assailants while the battles tide whelms over the widening breach the persians thus over the latefeard diomedon had rushed and swept the greeks before them when behold leonidas at once their ardour froze he had a while within the orb retired oppressed by labor now with strength restored he pours fresh ruin from the spartan front as long retarded by the unmoving calm soon as a rising gale freshbreathing curls the surging main again the vessel bounds with all her opening sails the hero thus his buckler huge and formidable spear advancing through the asian files renews his course of slaughter destiny compells the bold hydarnes to the unequal fight who proudly vaunting left his weeping bride to mourn his absence on the distant verge of bactrian ochus victory in vain he parting promised wanton hope no more round his cold heart delusive sports nor paints the imagined pomp of triumphs gorgeous spoils and trains of shackled greeks the spartan pierced his shield and bursting corselet from the slain the victor draws his ironpointed spear bent and infeebled with the forceful blow meantime within his bucklers verge unseen amphistreus stealing in the unguarded flank his poniard struck with swift effusion gushed a crimson torrent but the scaly mail immediate death repelled the indignant king gripes with resistless might the persians throat and drags him prostrate none in xerxes court was more corrupt with insolence more base with rancour more fallacious phrygia pined beneath the oppression of his ruthless sway was there a field once fruitful or a town once populous and rich the horrid change to want and desolation there declared the cursed amphistreus governed as the spear of tyrian cadmus riveted to earth the poisonous dragon whose infectious breath had blasted half boeotia so the chief of lacedaemon trampling on the neck of fallen amphistreus fixes to the rock the gasping tyrant and his broken lance leaves in the panting corse meanwhile thy wound incessant flows great hero and augments the hopes of persia thou unyielding still sustainst the contest while unnumberd darts are shivered on thy buckler and thy feet with glittering points bestrew the cholchian sword and persian dagger leave their shattered hilts bent is the caspian scymetar in vain the sacian wheels his falchion and their mace the strong chaldaeans and assyrians raise thou standst unshaken like a thracian hill like rhodope or haemus where in vain the thundrer plants his livid bolt in vain the glancing lightning cleaves the incrusted snow and winter beating with eternal war shakes from his dreery wings discordant storms chill sleet and clattring hail but now advanced abrocomes and aimed his deadly spear against the forehead of laconias chief not unperceived the spartans active hand his sword opposing upward rears the blade against the threatening javelin over his crest its fury wastes in air while swift descends the ponderous falchion on the persians knee at once the bone is severed prone he falls crushed on the ground beneath ten thousand feet the gallant warrior breaths the last remains of tortured life the spartan thus maintained the unequal combat with his single sword but agis calls dieneces alarms demophilus megistias they from heaps of allarodian and sasperian slain haste to their leader and before him raise the brazen bulwark of their massy shields the foremost line of asia stands and bleeds the rest recoil but hyperanthes strides from rank to rank throughout his various host their dying hopes rekindles in the brave excites new valor and the freezing heart of fear revives astaspes first obeyed the heros voice a fierce chaldaean lord vain of his birth from ancient belus drawn proud of his wealthy stores and stately domes but now more proud by conquest since his might had foiled the strong diomedon he seeks the front of battle his victorious mace against the brave dieneces he bends the weighty blow bore down the opposing shield and crushed the spartans shoulder idle hangs the buckler now and loads the inactive arm deprived of all its functions agis bares his vengeful blade and severs from the foe his hand exalted for a second stroke the dying fingers with convulsive grasp the falling mace infold a sacian chief springs on the victor iaxartes banks to this brave savage gave his name and birth his looks erect and fierce deportment spoke a bold and gallant spirit but untamed with dreery wilds familiar and a race of rude barbarians horrid as their clime the hostile spear against his forehead aimed glanced upward and oerturnd his iron cone the blow renewed his bursting chest divides the undaunted sacian writhes along the lance which griding passes through his breast and back a barbed arrow from his quiver draws deep in the streaming pap of agis hides the deadly steel then grimly smiles and dies from him fate hastens to a nobler prey for lo the brave dieneces presents his breast obnoxious to a thousand darts the shield deserts his unsustaining arm and slides to earth a grove of javelins rose on his broad bosom still for every wound he hurled a persian to the infernal gloom but life at length forfook his riven heart and over the rock the gasping hero stretched his dying limbs in gore who now can stand the torrent of barbarians agis bleeds his spear is irrecoverably plunged in iaxartes body low reclines dieneces in gore the spartan chief himself oerlabourd of his lance disarmed the rage of death can exercise no more one last and glorious effort age performs demophilus megistias join their might and stem the floods of conquest while the spear of slain dieneces to spartas king the fainting agis bore the blazing steel in that dire hand again for battle reared blasts all the persian valor back in heaps they roll confounded by their leaders voice in vain exhorted longer to endure the ceaseless waste of that unconquered arm so when the giants from olympus chased the inferior gods themselves in terror shunned the incessant streams of lightning when the hand of heavens great father with eternal might sustained the direful conflict over the field awhile bellona stills the rage of war when thespias leader and megistias drop at either side of lacedaemons king beneath the weight of years and labor bend the hoary warriors not a groan molests their parting spirits but in deaths calm night allsilent bows each venerable head like aged oaks whose deepdescending roots had pierced resistless through the mountains side and there for three long centuries had braved each angry gust of eurus and the north till sapless now by times despoiling hand without a blast their mossy trunks recline before their parent hill by spartas chief none now remains but agis who implores the last kind office from his godlike friend the sacians arrow from his pap to draw this done life issues with the sanguine tide thy comely features agis now are pale cold are thy graceful limbs and dim thy eyes which now no more with placid beams reveal the native virtues of thy gentle breast the noble corse leonidas surveys fate yields him one short interval of peace to know how lovely are the patriots wounds and see those honors grace the man he loved but hyperanthes with his single spear forth from the trembling ranks of asia towers his countrys glory to redeem or fall the spartan worn by toil his languid arm once more uplifting waits the dauntless prince the heroes now stood adverse each a while restrained his valor and his godlike foe admiring viewed such majesty and strength to fierce pelides all incircled round with trojan dead and such to priams son by struggling virtue and by manly shame from flight recalled great homers fancy gave o thou exalted over the laureled train high as the sweet calliope is throned above each vigin of the tuneful hill now let one beam of thy celestial light dart through my laboring mind lest freedom mourn her chosen son dishonored in these strains now hyperanthes and laconias king with brandished points and targets high upreard commence the fatal combat which must close the longcontinud horrors of the day fixed with amaze and fear the asian files unmoved and silent on their bucklers pause thus over the expanse of indias wilds contend the elephant and horned rhinoceros earth groans beneath them as with wrath untamed each hideous bulk in dire encounter meets with distant terror gaze the savage throng prolonged by varied art the dubious fight the great event suspended on the foe his wellaimd spear at last the spartan drove and pierced the shield inexorable fate that moment hovered over the eastern prince when with unmatched celerity aside he swung his buckler underneath his arm unstained with blood the hostile javelin passed meantime with joy and ardent hopes elate of fame and conquest sudden he impelled his rapid lance against the spartans throat but he with wary skill his target raised and over his shoulder turned the glancing steel for one last effort then his scattered strength recalled and wheeling with resistless force his massy buckler dashed the brazen verge against the persians forehead down he sunk without a groan expiring as overwhelmed beneath a marble fragment from its seat heaved by a whirlwind sweeping over the ridge of some aspiring mansion generous prince what could his valor more his single might he matched with great leonidas and fell before his native bands the spartan chief now stands alone in heaps his slaughtered friends all stretched around him
