the triumvirate or the authentic memoirs of a b and c  in quibus fuit propositi semper a nugis ad bona transire seria unde nescio in two volumes volume i  london printed for w johnston in ludgate street mdcclxiv  to his grace the duke of bedford my lord i take the liberty of laying these volumes at your feet as it was owing to your graces generous and voluntary patronage that i have enjoyed either spirits or leisure sufficient for undertaking or executing a work of this nature  your grace will i hope find amusement at least in these writings and i entreat the honor of your kind acceptance of this small tribute of his duty the services of whose life were he capable of performing any which might ever deserve that name ought in justice and gratitude to be dedicated to your grace  i am my lord with the highest respect your grace s much obliged and most obedient servant the author  the preface nothing has surprised me more than to find that novels and romances still maintain their ground in the libraries of the fair mistakes and prejudices are wearing daily away in other things to the great improvement and enlightening of mankind but with regard to female education some customs have been abrogated which had better have remained as they were on the safe side even supposing them to have been errors while this among others stands still unrepealed though the slightest sense or reflection might have exploded it long ago nay should have stifled the chimaera in its very birth  what has been urged in favor of these kind of writings is that the extraordinariness of the adventures and the variety of the incidents are fitted to induce young ladies into an habit of reading at first which may afterward be directed to more profitable studies that the personages in romances are of the most exalted ranks and their characters of the most perfect kinds and that therefore the conduct and sentiments of such examples might be proper to imbue young minds with refined precedents and elevated notions that novels serve to afford them a general knowledge of life without the hazard of their own experience which may teach them a prudent diffidence in their own strength and a safe caution against the arts and intrigue of the world  against this plausibility i argue that history supplies us with as extraordinary events and as entertaining incidents as any which can possibly be met with in fiction that the characters in the latter being but ideal lose the full influence of example and that the sentiments consequently become deficient in the authority of precept that in the former there are many real characters as brave as noble and as perfect as any to be met with in romance and the sentiments maxims and reflections of persons who did really exist upon occasions which did actually occur have infinitely more spirit beauty and moral in them than all the imaginary ones that ever have been framed by the sterile labor and puerile genius of novelists or romancers and with regard to the knowledge said to be gained from the study of novels i cannot imagine what benefit young women may be likely to draw from repeated memoirs of eloping daughters frail mistresses or faithless wives  nay if polite readers would have something still more interesting than novels or romances than even any history or biography already extant modern writers may well supply themselves with cotemporary materials for such a work from public annals and private anecdotes as far as orondates is exceeded by scanderbeg does not frederic excel him again in every quality which marks the king the soldier the scholar and the philosopher the present age has presented us with an hero who gives the appearance of veracity to ancient fable and will convey the air of fiction to future history are not the tales of boccace put out of countenance by the lives of the empresses and these exceeded again by the modern memoirs  not yet published  of lady  and lady  i forget their titles  it was upon such reflections as these that i have undertaken on the credit of an historiographer to publish the following memoirs every particular of which except the names of persons and places can be authenticated by living testimonies insomuch that as each separate fact may be in course recorded one man shall say openly i bear evidence to this another i can answer for that while some ladies shall tacitly cry i could vouch this that or the other  if i durst and so of the rest and yet to the great good fortune of those who delight in fiction the whole will nevertheless bear the air of a novel not from any manner of address in the publisher but from the incidental circumstances and extraordinary contingencies of the real story  but should it be still objected by any of your overscrupulous lovers of truth that many of the characters herein represented carry somewhat the appearance of composition let them but only reflect a little upon real life and they must certainly recollect to have frequently met with genuine peculiarities contradictions foibles and absurdities among mankind more outrees or extravagant than any of the caracaturas of the dramatis personae even though the stage like a gallery is allowed to exhibit figures larger than the life  how i happened to become possessed of these memoirs is not at all material to the public however i have really so much complacency for so respectable a body that i would satisfy their curiosity even in this trifling article if i could limit the discovery to that particular only but it is surrounded and connected with so many and such various wellknown circumstances that it would be impossible for me to reveal it without making at the same time too full a discovery of myself which might lay me extremely open to the just censure of the republic of letters that a person of my deep erudition extensive thought and comprehensive judgment should throw away his genius and learning so idly and unprofitably in digesting a parcel of insignificant events and obsolete morals into a consistent series or digest while any hearsay of the cabala remains unexpounded or that the points of hebrew vowels continue still to be a point in question  as to the inaccuracies which perhaps some minute critics may observe upon in the following pages i do not think them worth amending in a work of this kind i write always without book and just as if i was speaking to you suppose now for instance that you and i were occasionally conversing together upon some literary topic or other would it not be extremely pedantic in me to interrupt the discourse till i went into my study to settle the olympiad of an historic fact or would any body now give a farthing difference whether it was augustus caesar or asinius pollio that reprehended the patavinite of titus livius see the first note in chapter xxxv   writing and correcting like saying and doing are very different things and the latter i take to be by much the more tedious and laborious now i think that either of them is even full trouble enough for one person therefore i really never do more myself than write and leave the world to correct they have more dull time on their hands it relieves their idleness and gratifies their malice for some readers would loose half their pleasure if they did not meet something to find fault with it sets them in some sort above the writer and i yield them their advantage freely  most of these volumes have been wrote at inns or in the midst of business or company and indeed the best way in my opinion as well as the easiest too is never to form any plan for writing at all for it gives a constraint and stiffness to the work which betrays the lamp too much the great beauty of the ancient authors may be owing perhaps to their having wrote entirely without rules while the modelling moderns endeavor to cramp even what little genius they have left in the first you perceive the free stroke of the pencil in the latter is discovered the restraint of the compass or compare if you please the confined mincings of a gocart with the unspancelled strides of manhood  however this formal age may possibly find fault with me for the mixed matters the tragicomic manner of writing in these volumes they urge that all works should be consistent or of a piece either serious or comical learned or unlearned pious or profane but sir richard steel says it is the misfortune of our time that people think it as easy to be critics as politicians here he spoke ironically for they are both equally difficult there are arcana literae as well as imperii which if a person is not let into the mystery of he may frequently find fault in the wrong place in both instances  in a work like this designed for the public at large there must be something in allusion to dramatic writings to entertain the three different classes of auditors pit box and gallery the stage of athens from whence your learned but ignorant critics frame their drama was chaster than ours because their audience was all of a piece insomuch that plato being asked by dionysius now i am not certain whether it was plato or dionysius whom he would recommend as a preceptor for his son replied send to athens and take the first man you meet with in the streets but modern readers and audiences are in an unhealthful state and must sometimes be indulged in unwholesome seasonings to help them to digest proper food  this then may seem to have been the design of that anomalous heteroclite genius the author of tristram shandy whose principal end i hope and believe was to inculcate that great magna charta of mankind humanity and benevolence  a tale may catch him who a sermon flies  it is true indeed that he has given us according to the vulgar phrase rather more sauce than pig and this not sufficiently seasoned with attic salt neither but he seems to have wrote more for the present age than the future ones judging like aurelius though in a far different sense that surviving fame is but oblivion what is posthumous fame meat blown up in a shamble  a dead body puffed up with the breath of the living modern writers seem perfectly indifferent how soon their works die provided they themselves can live and may be compared to butchers who thrive the better the more they slaughter  his third part is better that is not so bad as his second there is a good deal of laughable impertinence in it he has repeated the same empty humor there of an unlettered the marbled paper page and has given us a carteblanche in this last page     vol    whatever is neither quite sense nor absolute nonsense is true shandeic however through the whole there is some entertainment for a splenetic person though none at all for a rational one  qui tristram non odit amet rhapsodias rablais but there are some things in that work which ought to be more severely reprehended though it is folly rather than vice that tempts people to speak in a gross manner while others relish it in general more for want of taste than virtue it requires genius to be witty without being wicked at the same time but the most vulgar parts may serve for obscenity it is easier to make one laugh than smile and when dullness would be witty it lets fly bawdry as it does something else satisfied to raise a laugh though it does a stink also loose expressions in a woman are a double vice as they offend against decency as well as virtue but in a clergyman they are treble because they hurt religion also  but to his graver works  his sermons yorics sermons are written professedly upon the divine principle of philanthropy and there are two apostrophes in them which are both striking and affecting in the midst of a most moving description of a complicated family distress he suddenly interrupts himself with this humane exclamation look down o god upon their afflictions and then proceeds with his narrative sermon  d page     again he is telling the story of the good samaritan and after these words by chance there came by a certain priest he cries out merciful god that a teacher of thy religion should ever want humanity sermon  d page     for my part were i a bishop i would not indeed prefer him to a cure though i am glad that he does not want one because of his tristram but i would certainly make him my vicar general on account of his yoric  as to those few free passages which the reader may find interspersed throughout these writings of mine if rightly apprehended in context with the whole they may be compared to the anamorphosis in painting which is an innocent art of drawing a picture so equivocally that according to the light it is viewed in may present you either with a satyr or a saint or like minervas ring which could render ulysses handsome or ugly just as he found it expedient to carry on his purpose  vita verecunda est musa jocosa mihi ov or dixero si quid forte jocosius hoc mihi juris cum venia dabis  hor   or sit lasciva licet pagina vita proba est mart all which apologies i do here most cordially invite mr stern to take share of with me for by all accounts his private character deserves it  and really if i did not interlope now and then to the great relief of my readers what would these two volumes be good for would they defray the printing no  would they lie on the toilet as untoiled as the bible yes  what a preciseness of moral a decorum of manners a purity of sentiment stuff mere oldfashioned stuff truly one might imagine to himself a parcel of antique portraits suddenly inspired with a faculty of speech and conversing together through their oval frames or a set of hewnstone stoics declaiming from their niches  some few perhaps who prefer old books to new might buy this  but after all prithee tell me who are even those few why possibly the king might read it  i mean king george the third  for as he has neither idle nor ignoble avocations he can afford leisure from his great public duties to indulge his taste and virtue in literary and moral amusements i think too that the king of prussia would relish it if voltaire doctus utriusque linguae would translate it into french after his brave and rebounding spirit having restrained the vain ambition of universal monarchy within the prescribed bounds of balanced empire shall have left him at liberty to exalt the hero permutatio foelix to the philosopher perhaps mr pit also might dip into it after he has resolutely fought out a peace and given himself leisure to refine politics into morals this preface was wrote in the year sixtyone   here indeed are a triumvirate whose glory dims the luster of that ancient title under such a patronage would that my a b c were placed but then in the mean time prithee what would pay the printer if it was not for honest triglyph who steps in among ye now and then with a slap dash that sets fools a staring tickles the small wits quickens the sale and quits all scores at once  i am gentlemen your obedient servant and ladies your most devoted slave biographer triglyph  prologomena to the subscribers as i had never published any book before i had not attained the least knowledge in the arts of puffing off a work and as i had seldom conversed except among the learned and good i had consequently but few acquaintances i was therefore alarmed at the certain expense of an impression at my own suit on the precarious hazard of a sale upon which i determined with myself to have a subscription solicited in order to defray the charges of printing  the trouble of this business i left entirely on the hands of my booksellor upon whose counter also i laid the manuscript to be dipped into here and there by the subscribers in order to afford them some specimen of the work and while this scheme was going on it has amused me often to sit unnoticed in some obscure corner of the shop attending to the questions and observations which the customers used to throw out when the proposals happened to be put into their hands  the triumvirate  very well  pray mr folio is this the triumvirate of caesar augustus caesar  anthony and lepidus or  neither sir no no i see now it could not be that for though a and c may very well stand for anthony and caesar we cannot possibly squeeze lepidus out of b nay nor can it mean the former triumvirate neither for stronger reasons still of the same kind caesar pompey and crassus why really sir replied mr folio i do not think that there is the least mention of any one of those antiquated gentlemen from one end to the other of these writings the persons here intended may be walking about the streets every day for aught i know and it is odds but you might know one or other of them yourself if mr triglyph would but suffer me to publish their names for those of a b and c you must understand sir are but their incognomens  i think that this was the expression mr triglyph made use of  when people have taken up the manuscript it has often entertained me to hear the several remarks which have been made upon looking into it some have cried out zounds what a world of moral stuff is here by the lord a man may as well sit down and read the bible  every whit indeed sir replied sober folio what the devil have we got here says another opening in a different place o by mars bacchus apollo and virorum too this scene licks shandy all to nothing  nay now d  n my eyes tristram but this thrusts your nose out of joint worse than the forceps  another critic upon looking into the several parts of the book pronounced with a precise and dogmatic tone that it wanted the true simplex duntaxat et unum and that there was such a variety of characters subjects styles sentiments and manners mixed together in this multifarious work it could never be one mans money that is pos  and therefore the impression would certainly never bring a sale  upon this hint i carried home the manuscript and drew out specimens of the different species of writing subjects characters etc and gave them to mr folio to select one or other of them according to his particular knowledge of the respective genius of each subscriber who taking it for granted that the entire work would be carried on in the same strain might the more readily enter into a subscription  this device produced a most sudden and lucky effect and my friend folio very soon received cash sufficient to put these sheets into the press to which i think proper to prefix a list of the subscribers in the very manner i copied it out from his books when i was settling accounts with him upon this article in which catalogue you are to observe that where he has put down the names as in the first column it was of such persons only who without knowing any thing in particular of the work subscribed merely at the request of a friend or to encourage the freedom of the press to fill up a gap on their shelves or for the pleasure of seeing their names or titles in print that where the subscribers were too modest to have their names mentioned or too numerous to be inserted they are classed under character as in the second column the specimens which engaged their respective patronage are entered down in the third and the fourth contains the numbers of the subscribers  as for example names characters parts subscribed to numbers this column

beville and carewe the initials of a b and c were objected to in the manuscript as being too abstracted and fitter for geometry than novel that they did not distinguish the persons sufficiently in the memory nor impress the ideas of them strong enough on the mind in compliance therefore with this indolence of attention in my gentle readers i have embodied thought and thickened shadow into substance for them by supplying the above names throughout the remainder of this work   giving to airy nothing a local habitation and a name    et in medias res non secus ac notus  hor  chapter i his horse grew tired before he had earned half his hire so that it was late at night before mr carewe had reached the inn at scarborough the reader must have been a lucky traveller if he does not know that the beast whether through sympathy electricity contactity or any other word quod exit in y communicates its own fatigue to the rider as if marriage or centaurlike they were but one flesh and indeed in many other instances in life the tedious urging of a person to an unwilling act is often more tiresome than the doing twice as much oneself mr carewe eat a poached egg drank a pint of negus and retired to bed  the next morning he went down early into the kitchen to order his breakfast where he met with several persons on the same errand and the landlord among them he enquired of this latter where or how near the town one mr andrews lived who he was informed had lately come to reside in that country the host replied that he was settled as well as he can be settled on the northern road about a mile from the town that he was but little known in the country for that all his neighbors looked upon him to be mad as he lived entirely at home and spent all his time in reading of books  a gentleman who stood by and had endeavored to interrupt this declamation addressing himself at last to mr carewe said you are not to take the character of that gentleman sir from the description of our host here for he may be one of the many who are incapable of distinguishing between a common and a peculiar character and fools said he are apt to impute every thing to frenzy which rises above the ordinary level of dullness  mr beville then proposed to mr carewe that they should breakfast together as he should be extremely pleased to cultivate an acquaintance with any person who might have the least social connection with his amiable friend mr andrews mr carewe bowed with that ease and complacency that was natural to him and stretching forth his hand toward the door said in effect sir i am ready to attend you  during breakfast they conversed familiarly together upon general topics of politics and letters and did not like attorneys proceed immediately to the purpose of their meeting there is in ingenuous minds under the advantages of a liberal education a certain native freedom and a wellbred ease which at first sight render perfect strangers as familiar as if they had been old and intimate acquaintance  at length mr beville said that he had come that morning from mr andrewss house as he usually did every day to drink the waters and bathe in the the sea for a disorder which he had been for some time subject to namely the scurvy which insulars are generally afflicted with and is the root whence all the rotten branches of distempers peculiar to nations surrounded by the ocean usually spring he then asked mr carewe where and how long he had been acquainted with mr andrews  he told his name and was proceeding to give him a particular account of his acquaintance and attachment to mr andrews when he was interrupted by an exclamation o sir i have you all by heart already i have frequently heard our friend mention you with the highest fondness and esteem lament of late his not knowing where to direct a line to you and often wish after his warm manner that some fortuitous concourse might happily throw us three together in some retired scene where we might mutually know approve and rejoice in each other this fortunate crisis added he has at length arrived and i am impatient to make the welcome present to my friend  mr carewe bowed they embraced discharged their bill and walked away together to the farm as it was styled where they found mr andrews reading in an arbor in his garden having just retired from the heat of the day after pointing out some works to his laborers  chap ii i would here describe the meeting of mr andrews and mr carewe but for the following reasons you have seen two friends meet therefore to you it would be superfluous or more probably you might never have seen two friends together any way in your oldest life so that to you it might appear improbable for it was not like two merchants meeting upon change it was not like two justices saluting at a sessions nor even like two neighbors shaking each others arms out of the sockets at a fair in short it was not like any thing you may have ever seen except you have had the extraordinary chance of being present on the meeting of two friends there was speech in their dumbness language in their very gesture they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed or one destroyed a notable passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing could not say if the importance were joy or sorrow but in the extremity of the one it must needs be winters tale   but then you are to observe that by this expression i do not mean such connections as the moderns by way of composition with morals are reduced to ascribe that high title to but such friends as may be quoted from among the ancients in this dull age scarce understood buckingham upon this subject in his ode on brutus between whom and the present race there is as much difference as between the man that diogenes was searching for at athens and those who ignorant of the reproof laughed at his extravagance diogenes observing that the whole state of athens had sunk into debauchery and corruption and meaning to reproach them for having dwindled from the original dignity of human nature walked through the city at noon with a lighted torch in his hand and being asked what he was in search of answered i am looking for a man  david simple too a character in a modern novel  who sought through the two great cities of london and westminster in quest of a friend proceeded exactly upon the same errand with the philosopher for a true man is a real friend but the qualities which are requisite to constitute this character have been so long lost in the world that cicero cries out even in his time haec genera virtutem non solum in moribus nostris sed vix jam in libris reperiuntur chartae quoque quae ilam pristinam severitatem continebant obsoleverunt  epicurus in his morals prefers friendship before any other virtue st evremond says that justice is only a moral established for the convenience of human society it is the work of man whereas friendship is the work of nature one might imagine that the saint had love rather in contemplation in this definition i carry the subject higher and deem friendship to be an angelic virtue nay higher still for friendship proceeds farther than the having care over us it will induce us to sacrifice even ourselves for its sake and therefore approaches nearer to the excellence of a god  a god who died for us  and here i confess that i feel so strong an impulse upon me to acquaint my readers with my own situation in life with regard to this particular that i cannot refrain from letting them know one and all of them which i hope in other words will be every one who can read english that i have sufficient reason from a long experience of my own joined to the accounts i have occasionally received from others to affirm that i have been all my life placed under the patronage of all the real and disinterested friends in these kingdoms  and as a just sense of my obligations upon this account calls on me here for proper acknowledgements the thread of my story pressing me at the same time not to discontinue its weft i shall beg leave to refer the curious reader to my appendix to this volume pages first and second for a full and true account of this matter and in the third and fourth pages ditto appendix he will find a catalogue of the many and great benefits which i have myself received and which others may also derive from such advantageous clientcies  chap iii after the usual questions and unusual transports were over mr carewe desired mr andrews to show him his demesne his husbandry and improvements which he replied he would do without stirring out of the spot and taking out a pocketbook he opened a map of forty perch to the inch in which he showed him the whole farm neatly laid down divided and denominated as the wheatfield the meadow the pigeonpark etc  after mr andrews had fully instructed him in the topography of the draught you may be surprised perhaps said he at this concise and figurative manner of answering your request but in general people propose this question more out of complaisance than curiosity while others accord it out of ostentation rather than good will and as vanity is ever more active than civility i have sometimes known an old gouty fellow fatigue his grandson in leading him round an improvement of his own making and yet after all his sweat and toil think you added he that he would know so much of the matter or be able to describe the place so well to others as he might from such a diagram as this without moving any thing more than a finger or an eye  but with regard to the plan now before you continued he i must observe one thing to you which otherwise might require your going to the several closes to inform yourself of you would naturally imagine from the different denominations that the pigeonpark had a dovehouse in it that the meadow supplied my stables with hay the wheatfield supported my family with bread and so of the rest  but not one syllable of all this i assure you sir these divisions indeed i suppose had been originally named from respective merits of the kind and like other titles these are still retained though the qualifications which formerly gave rise to them have long since surceased and in truth added he i have generally considered all the parade of heraldry in the same light for respecting qualities not quality i am apt to style some peers of the realm in allusion to my own demesne by the cognomens of pigeonpark meadow wheatfield etc who as sir richard steel says of a grubstreet paper can produce no merit beyond the title titles which distinguish not merit are but nick names as a deformed man or woman are in derision styled my lord or my lady  chap iv the house was situated exactly as the learned dr cheyne recommends in his essay on health and long life fronting the east to receive the full benefit of the first sun on the side of a gravelly hill that the foundation may be dry over a running water to give a motion to the air and unincumbered with trees which are apt to confine the damps and keep them hovering about the mansion  the house was what was styled a batchelors lodge but so well contrived that if mr andrews should ever double his condition he might at the same time double his house too without having occasion to alter any part of the building for his was not a small house but rather half a large one i here freely make a present of this distinction to the ingenious modern architects of chinese orders and as terms of art are necessary toward the conciseness of sciences i shall dub it with the technic of dimagdome which i have most learnedly compounded from the words dimidium magnae domus vel domi   a neglect of this sort of economy is too generally seen in most of the villas of young men of fortune who are apt seldom to frame any purpose beyond the present expediency which subjects them frequently as future contingencies may happen to the aukwardness of disproportioned additions the inconvenience of returns or traps for whirling eddies the expense of altering what has been already built or of rasing the whole to begin again anew in economy as well as morals the frolic of the season should never be inconsistent with the scheme for life  the furniture was perfectly simplex munditiis and according to the precept of marcus varro in his essay on entertainment rather neat than fine elegant than rich the bedsteads chairs and tables were all of oak or walnut because of our own growth and the curtains seats and hangings of stamped linen because said mr andrews it is our own manufacture looks handsome at first and that the being obliged to have it washed sometimes renews its freshness and gives employment to the poor  such was mr andrewss expression and quite in his manner who constantly took advantage of every opportunity of inculcating the godlike virtue and soulsaving moral of charity and benevolence here now had i been inclined to have swelled my volume by notes i might have introduced the word philanthropy in this place instead of benevolence which would have afforded me the opportunity of informing the generality of my polite readers that philanthropy is a plaguey hard greek word which in downright plain english means nothing more than a love of mankind  but in the first place the writer of these memoirs is far above such bibliopolist arts and in the next the word philanthropy would not have sufficiently comprehended the full scope of mr andrewss benevolence for his was not confined to human nature alone but extended itself throughout the whole animal creation from the leviathan of the deep to the emmet of the field and in order to awaken such sentiments among his domestics along with other devices for the same purpose he had placed this text over his stable door a righteous man regards the life of a beast  chap v when they came into the parlour they found dinner served which was a true monastic meal only one joint of mutton and a sallad but they were all in health eat heartily and conversed cheerfully together mr andrews observed upon the frugality of his board but assured his friends that this economy proceeded more from epicurism than parsimony for that he had always perceived an higher relish to one dish than to many and that various meats were apt to perplex the choice and weaken the appetite by dividing its taste  mr beville took occasion from this hint to philosophize upon this subject by remarking that single objects are better observed by the eye than plural ones that variety in prospect like many angles in architecture distracts the vision instead of filling the sight and that the sea engages the attention of the mind as much from its uniformity as its vastness in fine that variety in general rather diverts than satisfies the eye  mr carewe wrought the subject still higher by running the analogy into a moral saying that in love as well as food a craving for variety was the certain sign of a sickly appetite that temperance and constancy were the best preservatives of health and vigor and that as providence pursues its several purposes by uniform means it might not be unreasonable to conclude that a fondness for change was more consonant to a state of depravation than of nature  after this manner did they coverse together in the spirit of ancient symposiacs during their meal a bottle of wine and a pot of coffee after which mr andrews asked mr carewe whether he chose to play cards to which he replied that he had no particular inclination to any amusements of that kind but was always ready to comply with the disposition of his company and desired mr andrews as master of the revels to appoint the entertainment for his guests no sir interrupted mr andrews i do not understand the punctilio in that sense for i consider a man in his own house to be a master to his domestics only but to his friends a vassal however as you say sir added mr beville that you are ready to comply with the humor of the company i shall make so free as to acquaint you that neither mr andrews nor i choose play of any kind  agreed replied mr carewe for my part it is compliance and not choice that ever induces me to sit down at a cardtable there are three things requisite to a gamester a love of play a knowledge in its mysteries and a fortune to support it  or better no fortune to lose in every one of which i am myself deficient nay i must always play at a disadvantage even upon equal terms for the winning of fifty guineas could not make me happy and the losing of them might render me uneasy i have portioned out my income in a certain even proportion and think that it would be extremely indiscreet in me to stake any part of it upon a hazard which might injure my economy without improving my fortune for fifty guineas are more than i want and are at the same time more than i can spare  chap vi upon which they retired to the library where after some general conversation which the scene both hinted and inspired mr carewe repeated to mr andrews the discourse which had passed in the morning at scarborough between the host and him mr andrews smiled and replied that most of his present neighbors as well as some former acquaintances in life had conceived the same notion of him because he had generally sequestered himself from the world and mixed not in their sports or entertainments their races cockfightings huntingmatches or play  in all things of an indifferent nature said he one should certainly conform to the manners of the world in order to avoid the unsociable and affected character of singularity but in reality added he these things are by no means indifferent to me and i am so far from having any manner of taste or passion for such amusements that i rather feel a disrelish to some of them and an absolute aversion even to horror to others  i have continued he made experiments upon every article in life which bears the name of pleasure and the first thing that disgusted me was a crowd i ran headlong into all manner of public places with that giddy eagerness of youth which is natural before one has given themselves leisure to enquire either into the ends or motives of their actions but after having sustained much squeezing sweating and jostling at balls feasts shows and masquerades for many years i began to find out the true definition of a crowd to be a certain combination of an indifinite number of persons to render each other mutually uneasy henry in the series of letters says i will forgive none but a pickpocket for loving a crowd   and besides with regard to the boisterous and unmeaning mirth one is generally stunned with in large companies which may be styled not the conversations but the convulsions of society i have always looked upon laughing without sentiment to be merely histerical and needed the aid of assa foetida i have sometimes imagined that in the days of ancient philosophy when men used to give rational rebukes but after an absurd manner as in the instance of diogenes and his torch mentioned just now and many others one of the sages would have brought a wet mop into such a merrymaking assembly and have twirled it in their faces as supposing them to be falling into fits risibility has been made a character of rationality the conclusion then must be fairly this that none should laugh without a reason otherwise looking asquint might be as distinguishing a mark as some philosophers have made it  with regard to horseracing besides the crowd and noise which attend it there is something much more abominable in it for not to insist merely upon the cruelty of straining a beautiful and useful creature beyond the extent of its powers and running the poor animal with whip and spur for many miles in blood which is the jockeys expression is it not an encouragement to the idleness of the lower classes of people who are the riches of a nation are not the bettors generally either dupes or sharpers and is not the immorality of such proceedings freed by custom even from the restraint of shame for are not the most flagrant impositions qualified by the title of a jocky stroke and justified by the laws of the turf etc  cockfighting too makes a barbarous sport of courage wounds and death does the generous animal win an hard fought battle at the expense of blood or limb what is his reward to have his head wrung off after his bravery has rendered him unfit for fighting any more but the trial or cutting down of cocks is too shocking for humanity to describe  as for hunting i have always thought that the only rational creature that pursues this sport is the hound for he follows his instinct i excuse the huntsman because he is acting in his profession i pity the horse as he is pressed into the service but i despise the squire having neither compulsion vocation or natural impulse to plead the only plausible apology i ever heard given in defense of this diversion is that it conduces to health by inducing to exercise but is not this rather worse than giving up the argument entirely is it not in effect to say that a man cannot do a rational thing without having an irrational motive for it  gaming i need not expatiate upon many writers of sense and morals have already done so and without effect even in its most simple state it cannot be said to be innocent but merely idle it is a misapplication of accountable time pereunt and imputantur and apt to awaken passions which had much better remain asleep herodotus tells us that play was invented first in lydia at the time of a great famine by way of diverting the pressing calls of hunger and has it not long since returned back again to its primitive institution by supporting an infinite number of persons who have no other trade merit profession or visible fortune to keep themselves from starving without the relief of such handicraft or moyens de vivre  the conversation here took another turn and was carried on for the remainder of the evening upon various topics till they were called in to supper where the same frugality appeared as at dinner a roasted fowl and a bottle of whitewine which they diluted with spawater completed the repast they parted at eleven and retired to bed  chap vii the next morning mr andrews and mr carewe met at breakfast but mr beville had gone off as usual to drink the waters at scarborough after they had taken a few turns in the garden and returned into the study mr carewe put mr andrews in mind of a promise he had formerly made him on their parting at islington of relating to him the history of his life if ever they might happen to meet again  mr andrews acknowledged the debt and said that he would take the lucky opportunity of mr bevilles absence to discharge it as it would supply him with an occasion of introducing his friends most excellent character and also of mentioning some circumstances which would revive his grief as they will necessarily do my own added he with a sigh his tears flowing fast at the same time he remained for some minutes unable to compose himself and then after having made mr carewe acknowledge that the obligation was mutual between them in this particular he proceeded thus  the story of mr andrews and mr beville when i was at school said he i had conceived a particular attachment toward one of my condisciples for an odd reason indeed but it is such a one as makes mothers often fond of sickly or ungracious children merely for the trouble they give them he happened however to be my chum which first accidentally led me to distinguish him from the rest he was arch lively and idle but as his humor had a peculiar charm for my gravity i used frequently to make his exercises for him furnish his themes and assist him in the construction of his lessons  as he was quick of resentment and wellspirited he had frequent boxing bouts upon his hands and seldom waited to consider the odds against him but whenever i saw him overpowered i used to enter the lists in his defense and as i was by much the biggest and strongest boy in the school none of the rest would venture to cope with me but used to cry out class class upon such occasions and then a whole form would rush down pellmell against me  you will pardon me sir said mr andrews for this puerile detail but one has naturally a fondness for dwelling upon those early scenes of life and renewing their youth as it were by the recollection of past aeras haec olim meminisse but i shall now pass on to our riper years after having made this philosophic reflection that it must certainly be nature and not habit which has given men a greater bravery than women for boys universally decide their quarrels by boxing even before education can have pointed out their distinguishing characteristic and girls show their resentments by frumps or scoldings only  chap viii the intimacy between this friend and me continued after we had quitted school i still retained the same fondness and attachment toward him though without any manner of esteem he was a character he had wit and humor but was dissolute and capricious he had cheerfulness and goodnature but was passionate and illtempered he would sacrifice his fortune for you to day and tomorrow refuse you a guinea in fine he was a good companion but a bad friend and one of those whom one is generally pleased at meeting with but never regret the parting from  our different manners of life not less than our separate vocations would frequently divide us from each other sometimes for many months together but whenever his frolic or extravagance as was often the case happened to involve him in any difficulty his first resort was to my counsel and assistance i have bailed him out of goals released him from the watch and redeemed him out of bagnios i have been his second in some encounters and his marshal of honor in others  in fine his giddiness and debaucheries drew upon me so much trouble hazard and scandal that i have frequently resolved to withdraw myself entirely from any manner of connection with him and should certainly have done so but that i knew he had no other friend either willing or sober enough to guard him from scrapes or to relieve him out of them his other associates being at least as idle and thoughtless as himself and some of them even more so and yet he generally kept what the world is too apt to style the best company  he was placed by his guardians at a college in cambridge where he loitered away his time for about three years and used to make frequent elopements to london where i resided at that time with my father while he remained at the university he used to write often to me and as there was some wit spirit and whim in his letters i have kept most of them by me which i shall entertain you with some other time added he looking out at the window for i now perceive our friend mr beville returning from scarborough and well go out and meet him if you please and inquire what news he may have picked up in that gay idle scene of dissipated life  these three friends passed the remainder of that day in the same kind of liberal converse as before and the next morning after mr beville had walked away to town in course and as soon as breakfast was over mr andrews reassumed as follows  chap ix we were interrupted yesterday said he just as i was going to show you some of my condisciples letters which i here present you with in an heap together without regard to dates as of no manner of consequence in writings of this kind so saying he put a parcel of papers into mr carewes hands and the first he took out to read was the following  letter i dear andrews cambridge the grace they repeat here is about five minutes long how much must the gross ideas of beef and pudding impure the hungry students devotion during that interval i have often thought the marriage ritual too tedious for the same pious reason but to make a ceremony of a thing which in itself is the farthest from ceremony of any thing in the world is most catholic nonsense surely  long prayers vigils fasts and penances are certainly most dangerous institutions if the devotee be a cool person they abate his zeal to lukewarm and if one of strong passions he is inflamed to enthusiasm which are either above or below the proper temper of true devotion religion is love and all its acts should be short and exstatic  i was hurried into this expression my dear andrews and would have corrected it for your prudery but that i happened to recollect doctor tailor in his severe treatise on holy living and dying speaking on the imperfection of all human pleasures introduces among his instances the married virgin led by her paranymphs to uneasy joy bridemen or bridemaids indifferently used   a certain reverend dean also in his christian philosophy keeping up to the same strain of arch piety in order to fix our affection i suppose upon things above and not upon things below says that the highest of mortal pleasures is attended with a sort of fainting  but indeed were you to read st austin st ambrose st bernard and others of the saintly fathers you would find them somewhat more than arch for in truth they often speak not only like fathers but like mothers too you must not however think me so stupidly learned as this last paragraph seems to hint me for all i know of these rums is from the several curious passages selected out of their works by lord bolingbroke in his philosophic writings that is a charming book i think i am now a match for a parson at least  adieu  i perceive from this letter said mr carewe the briskness of your correspondents character he enters upon the subject without preface and quits it again as abruptly is he not in the right of it the limits of a letter afford no room for exordium or peroration one may compare most modern epistles to a frozen flask of wine  cold at both ends and all the spirit in the middle i love the con spirito in wit as well as music i thank you for these letters i like his writing and am sure the remainder will entertain me let us see the next to hand  chap x letter ii cambridge i am impatient to acquaint my dear mentor how well i have extricated myself out of a difficulty for the first time without his assistance you may remember the cambridge lass i used to toast to you when i was last in london and prefer to all your belles on the mall since my return my love my constancy have been amply rewarded i called her amaryllis she styled me celadon i vowed and she believed  our amor remained not long a secret between unguarded innocence on one side and giddy youth on the other we suffered some indiscretions to escape us leading to the door of truth which alarmed her father an huge hulking fellow who dwelt on gogmagog hills with a sour beetle in his brows a stoop in his shoulders a stride in his gait and a damnable swing in his arms  methought when he rushed into my chambers he appeared as tremendous as my own quinbus quinbus flestrin or the manmountain in gulliver  when he used to pour down in my defense at school however this was too difficult a point of honor to suffer me to cry out class upon so i listened with most christian resignation and patienee to his charge but wishing ardently all the while that you were standing by my side though to what purpose you would not lie for me  no damn it and i scorn to lie for myself either  but for a simple equivocation in defense of passive innocence where is it forbidden  thus fortified in my moral i immediately made the father this reply if the account yon are come to call me to sir be of satisfaction my sword shall answer your waked wrath but if of justification my oath is at your service dear sir answered old six foot high taking advantage of my own distinction if you justify her honor you perfectly satisfy mine right sir cried i out and taking him by the hand you seem to have the true moral sense of this matter and i here tender you my oath that your daughter is a very vestal for me  my equivoque lay here  there was a temple at athens dedicated to the goddess vesta where the fire was preserved by widows alone virgins being excluded from administering the fuel as they did in the one at rome erected to the same divinity is not this same learning a fine thing he accepted my terms  they satisfied him  but i dont know how the whole of this business not indeed any part of it does not quite satisfy myself it vexes me sometimes to find that i can neither be perfectly good nor perfectly bad from which imperfection i can be neither completely happy in this world nor the next but feel in my present hellmilitant warfare as if i was serving the devil upon halfpay a plague on your musty morals which has raised this struggle in my nature  farewell however my worthy philosopher chap xi letter iii cambridge you know how ill i left london with a nephretic cholic i reached my first stage with difficulty in writhing pain i detest drams they are dangerous anodynes they are apt to captivate and their effect is so sudden that one has not leisure to make a compromise with their senses wine gives sufficient warning  this proceds by sap the other by storm drinking is only simple fornication but dramming is  the devil   however having soon got a surfeit of martyrdom i was prevailed on by mine hostess to swallow a large glass of geneva as she told me she did herself every now and then whenever she found herself choleric well it is an ill wind etc as the proverb says for this cordial very soon afforded me ease enough to mount my horse carrying on its carminative and diuretie operations all the way till i reached college  i think it might be an excellent expedient to carry a provision of this liquor to sea in case of our being at any time becalmed and the fable of ulysses having got the winds tied up in a bladder may be literally understood of a borachio filled up with your right good aeolic holland gin  una eurusque notusque ruunt  now between you and me monsieur rollin this interpretation of that story is not one bit more strained than yours where you say in your life of hannibal that the article of his having cut a passage through the alps with the help of vinegar is to be figuratively understood to mean only that he recruited the strength and spirits of his army during that cold and difficult march by frequently priming his soldiers with drams of vinegar among the lives of plutarch which are said to be lost was hannibals and mr rollin has supplied it but in the kings library vide casleys catalogue there is a translation of plutarchs life of hannibal by henry parker lord morley written in the reign of henry the eighth surely the original cannot have been lost since that era when literature was beginning to revive in england   farewell  mr carewe was extremely entertained with the spirit and humor of these letters and spent the rest of this morning in perusing the remainder of the collection while mr andrews walked about his grounds but i shall not insert any more of them here because i would not interrupt mr andrewss story any longer and that i design soon to publish the rest of them in a distinct volume from this work if i shall find that my readers give me sufficient encouragement by their relish of the foregoing specimens  just as mr carewe had finished the reading of these letters mr beville walked into the room the remainder of the day was passed in family incidents not of sufficient consequence to relate or in conversations which the generality of readers preferring narrative to sentiment would excuse the recital of that i may be the more at liberty to file the thread of my story without any further interruption therefore i shall just dine them sup them and put them to bed and tomorrow morning after i have sent off mr beville to scarborough messieurs andrews and carewe shall retire to the library of which i have myself a master key and will suffer the reader to slip in after them incog and overhear their whole conversation for be it unto all men known i keep no secrets  but my own   chap xii about a year before my friend became of age continued mr andrews he quitted college and came up to london to consult the physicians about his health which appeared at that time to be in a dangerous state inclining to a decay while he remained in town he lived entirely with me at my fathers and restrained himself within a very regular and abstemious course which i complimented him upon as his then invalid condition had been brought upon him by free living and riot to which he replied after his lively manner that there was a moral in excess as it induced sobriety more than a folio upon temperance  when he began to recruit a little in london the physicians ordered him down to windsor for the air here his health was established in about six months most of which time i spent with him there administering his medicines with my own hands and restraining him within the bounds of his regimen which was no easy matter after his strength began to be restored again  i took the advantage of this interval to inculcate some sober reflections with a due sense of religion into his heart and mind and my lectures seemed to produce their proper effect so far as they could support themselves upon philosophic principles but whenever i happened to touch upon faith or system he would cut me short by crying out more of your argument good mr orthodox and less of your doctrine  in vain i used to urge that faith was necessary to religion as well as works and that system was framed upon articles of belief not at all would he reply after his quick manner faith is merely constitutional and a man can no more believe than lift a weight beyond his natural strength and what are your systems after all added he but the visionary fabrics of metaphysical dreams divines take a text as dido did a hide and by quibbling slicing and straining force it to enclose an area large enough to build a city upon but delenda est carthago is my motto as well as catos  the occult qualities in physics are laughed at he would run on in metaphysics the entities and quiddities are exploded also the heart is placed right in anatomy and all science has been purged by the reasonings of the latter philosophy it is in religion alone that prejudice still keeps its ground which makes it in danger of losing its own and that error is sanctified even to blasphemy addison says very justly that an ignorant devotee affronts the divinity more than an atheist for it is better to disbelieve a deity entirely than to form any notions of him unworthy of the infinite perfection of his nature  in fine concluded he there can be no merit in ignorance nor any virtue in error and whatever contradicts the common principles of sense or science can never be any part of a divine revelation for philosophy like jacobs ladder mounts us up step by step into the very presence of the deity but metaphysics resemble the laputan method of building a house from the top to the bottom  here mr andrews and mr carewe entered into a disquisition upon these subjects carewe taking part with the condisciple and andrews arguing in support of system but as their conversation on such topics would not much edify or entertain the reader i shall here leave mr andrews at leisure to continue his memoirs without any further interruption  chap xiii soon after we had gone to reside at windsor pursued he we happened to become acquainted with a young lady who lived in the town of a good family and character but of no fortune her father had an employment at the palace of about three hundred pounds a year had a wife this daughter and a son who is our worthy friend here mr beville i passed most of the evenings at their house that i could spare from my invalid and when he was able to go abroad he used to come along with me and frequently accompanied us upon little parties about the country  miss bevilles stature was rather below the middle size but she was finely made and well fashioned she had a clear brown complexion fine hair and teeth a lively eye with a great air of sensibility through her whole countenance she had read most of the polite english and french writers and was perfectly accomplished in music and dancing her sense was of the right feminine kind for it consisted rather in a quickness of apprehension and a delicate taste than a strong judgment  she had a great ease and freedom in her manners but at the same time such a nicety and decorum in all her behavior that our invalid upon receiving a rebuke from her one day for some liberties he had attempted upon his returning health styled her a raketrap and with his usual briskness asked her how the devil shall a man know how to conduct himself toward such a woman as you are who like a cunning gamester leads one in by suffering a trick or two of no consequence to pass and when he thinks the stake his own pops the tenace upon him good breeding sir replied miss beville should conduct you  whoever has arrived at that polite character will need no formal rules and without it the whole academy of compliments will not be sufficient to instruct you  they had frequent squabbles of the same kind together while i continued always to behave toward her both in speech and action with that propriety and respect which modest women of all ranks have a right to challenge from the prince to the peasant which conduct apparently gained me the preference in her regards and esteem before my friend though he was younger handsomer more lively and had a very considerable fortune  as soon as he perceived himself restored to health he retired down to his estate in cornwall and from that time several years elapsed before i heard any thing more of him he residing all the while at his seat in the country without making the least overture toward a renewal of our former correspondence having it seems less leisure to spare from his sports than he had from his studies but though he had a lively warmth and earnestness in his manners he had a certain coldness and indifference in his nature which rendered him insensible to fond or friendly attachments chance caprice or convenience forming and dissolving all his connections  chap xiv when we were parting continued mr andrews he to go take possession of his estate and i to return to london our fair friend gave me some slight commissions to execute for her among which i received a letter to deliver to her brother who was then in town and in whom i had before met with all that i had ever wished in man a sobriety of manners a refinement of moral a liberal mind a spirited heart and an universal benevolence of affections besides which a perfect agreement in all our general notions of philosophy politics or religion united and stamped us friends for life the approbation and esteem which i had marked toward his sister rendered our union still more tender i loved him yet more because he was her brother and he became fonder of me for the polite regards i had always paid to her  when i had executed miss bevilles commissions i took the liberty of giving her an account of them by letter i wrote to her with gaiety and galantry but kept quite clear of the least hint or expression tending toward passion in the first place my affections had not arrived to such an height as might have excused a freedom of that kind and next my fortunes depended too much upon the caprice of another person to suffer me hastily to form attachments on my own sentiments  in this letter however i endeavored to court her into a correspondence merely to exchange the news of town and country with each other but this she declined she answered my civilities in a letter to her brother and paid some compliments to my character and manner of writing adding that she would be both pleased and flattered with a continuance of my epistles but that as there ought never to be any kind of mystery between us to which mr beville need be a stranger she hoped that i would always accept of her acknowledgments in paragraphs of her letters to him  i was pleased at her delicacy upon this point and continued the correspondence on her own terms while mr beville remained in london and when he returned to windsor she was prevailed upon so far at his instance as sometimes to write paragraphs to me herself in his letters  chap xv we both of us found this amusement extremely pleasant for a time and exerted upon those occasions the highest spirit and address we were capable of on each side but without any other view than what we might have had on playing in concert together to preserve time and harmony and mutually exchange compliments upon each others performance  but i would never advise any person to enter into such an intercourse with the other sex before some farther consequences shall have been fully weighed and considered of the having one object constantly in contemplation is even more dangerous than the having it always in view we are not apt to keep such a strict guard over our reflections as we do upon our actions and when the mind once surrenders itself up to the fond persuasion of a separate pleasure the heart soon begins to grow jealous and if it should happen to be a fit object for its occupation steals slily in for its share  i made frequent excursions to windsor and perceived that each time i returned from it with more and more regret my passion commenced unknown to me and increased by such insensible degrees that its empire was established in my breast before i even suspected its invasion nay such is our blindness or our vanity that i actually began to perceive her regards arise before i discovered my own and when her marked preferences her petits soins her manners free to others constrained toward me had first alarmed my honor i forthwith determined to withdraw myself from an intercourse which might perhaps end fatally to one or other of us possibly to both  i formed this resolution on the instant one morning at windsor and returned to london with that precipitation with which one is apt to execute an irksome purpose hurrying away to have it over and it was on this retreat and not before that i first perceived my affections to have been a long time praeengaged however frequent reflections upon the expediency of the measure i had resolved upon helped to support me through the difficulty of it  i considered that i had no fortune independent nor any profession to render myself so and that all my prospects in life were founded on the will of a severe father who having made his own establishment by a lucky marriage might be the more apt to resent an indiscretion with regard to this particular than in any thing else especially as he was wont frequently in some of his elevated moods to vaunt himself highly upon his own success and hint often before me that a man of spirit and address might meet with many opportunities of pushing his fortune more easily and expeditiously by marriage than by the slow means and dull labor of any trade art or profession whatsoever i therefore opposed prudence to passion and balanced duty against romance  chap xvi when i arrived in london i told my father that i was weary of spending an idle dissipated kind of life and begged he would purchase some commission for me in the army he replied that since he found i was inclined to that profession he was in hopes as fresh troops were then levying every day of being able to obtain me one by the interest of his friends without the expense of buying  i appeared satisfied with this answer at the time not so much from any sanguine expectations i had conceived either from the good will or exertion of any of his friends but it afforded me an occasion which i thought it became me to lay hold of for taking leave in form of the too dear miss beville whom i thought it extremely ungalant to withdraw myself from so abruptly and entirely without any apparent reason or necessity accordingly i wrote her a letter conceived in cool but civil terms acquainting her with my present destination representing it in a more forward situation than it was likely soon to be by saying that i expected every day to be commanded over to germany and so concluded my letter with taking leave perhaps for life which was my expression  about this time a friend of mine who had been my schoolfellow came into the possession of a large fortune by the death of his father and had also a considerable interest in a certain county which gave him a weight with some persons in the ministry i soon after paid my compliments to him upon his accessions and was received with great politeness and friendship by him he asked me some questions with regard to myself and i let him into my present scheme of life without or hope or design  in a few days after i received a letter from this gentleman acquainting me that he had obtained a cornetry for me from his friend the minister wishing me success and assuring me of every future service in his power i was much elated at first and still continued to be so but from a more generous motive i considered that i had two younger brothers who having never received any manner of education were but in an hazardous situation in life their helpless and unprovided state lay heavy on my mind as well as my own and apprehending that i might have better advantages than they to push my fortune i determined to cede the commission to the eldest of them i waited on my patron accordingly the next day expressed my gratitude and urged my sentiments upon this subject he appeared much surprised at first but afterward he applauded my motives and had my brother immediately nominated in my stead  about half a year after this event my good friend called upon me one morning and told me that he had been just appointed to a considerable patentemploy in which he had the power of naming a deputy with a salary of one hundred pounds a year and had been so struck with the generosity as he was pleased to term it of my former motion that he was resolved to ease my mind of the second encumbrance also which was accordingly done  chap xvii my friend mr beville continued mr andrews had taken a farm in hertfordshire soon after i had quitted windsor and was so wholly occupied about it that all intercourse of letters as well as visits had dropped between him and me for about eight months during which time i had not the least opportunity of hearing any manner of account about his dear still dearer sister which afforded me full exercise for my usual resorts in every difficulty or uneasiness of the mind  books and philosophy  after this interval i happened one morning accidentally to meet a neighbor of mr bevilles in london whom i had often seen at his house in windsor and asking him in a seeming careless way about that family i was told that miss bevilles manners and behavior had been remarkably altered of late that from gay and cheerful she had grown grave and retired that she never stirred abroad except to church where she attended indeed rather more stictly than usual and spent her time mostly in reading shut up in her chamber which account he concluded in a laughing way by telling me a reflection about her that was made by the curate that either love or learning he was afraid had turned poor misss head  these particulars rendered me extremely uneasy i began to apprehend that what i had imagined in her to have been only the slight tokens of a commencing passion might have been rather the certain proofs of a confirmed one may not my charming fanny said i to myself have been unwarily led into the same error in this particular that i had fallen into myself might she not have perceived my passion before she had suspected her own and thus have ennobled her affections by the generous principles of gratitude and compassion  i then began to blame the indiscretion of my own dalliance lamenting the effects of it in her breast as well as in mine my philosophy had bravely withstood my own passion but was overborne by hers all considerations of father fortune or expediency dwindled into mere words upon this just sentiment that though prudence should restrain our affections it ought never to control our honor after these reflections i repaired immediately to windsor in order to satisfy my scruples upon this truly interesting occasion  it was at this interval continued he while i was struggling both with my heart and fortune that i had the happiness of becoming acquainted with you my dear carewe i tried approved and admired you there was something besides in your whole air and manner which resembled the person of my favorite condisciple but with a nobler moral and a more liberal soul mr carewe bowed and blushed at this encomium and was just going to return the compliment when mr beville happened to come into the room and gave a new turn to the conversation  chap xviii as mr andrews most certainly will not divert his narrative in this place by repeating to mr carewe particulars which he had been acquainted with before and that the reader may possibly by this time begin to feel himself somewhat interested in any material circumstance relating to these gentlemen and that this little anecdote will also furnish out a very pretty episode in the context of their lives i shall undertake to relate this extraordinary story myself but this in so succinct a manner that i will engage to have it quite finished by the time that mr andrews who is just taking horse in london shall have alighted at windsor which i hope will be a sufficient apology to you ladies who always keep such a fidgetting upon being interrupted in any part of a love adventure  the episode of andrews and carewe one evening as mr andrews was returning home to his fathers house in london he observed at some distance as he was passing through ludgate hill a gentleman defending himself with his sword against four mean illlooking fellows who drove furiously at him with staves and cudgels mr andrewss spirit and humanity made him instantly take part on the weaker side and running up quick to his assistance drew his sword and entered immediately into the lists he sustained several strokes and returned some passes at the assailants till they fled upon seeing an indignant crowd come rushing down the hill to the support of the gentlemen they put up their swords and mr andrews led off the stranger as fast as they could walk together directly to his fathers house  as soon as they had got into the parlour mr carewe embraced his gallant second and thanked him for the generous aid he had afforded him adding that he had even more than life to thank him for as his liberty which he prized dearer had been then at stake in the hands of those ruffian bailiffs who were attempting to arrest him upon a debt of five hundred pounds which alone indeed continued he would not have long confined me but the consequences of it in bringing some other demands more pressingly upon me at the same time might perhaps have rendered me tenant for life to the marshalsia but added he as soon as it is dark i shall quit this asylum and london together this night and retire into the country till some better economy or other lucky incident of fortune may hereafter place my present involved affairs in a proper state of defense  mr andrews called for a bottle of wine which they drank cheerfully together without any interruption mr carewe then desired a chair to be sent for which was directed round to a back door leading into an unfrequented lane and he retired after acquainting mr andrews with his name and assuring him that the first instant he should be at liberty of returning to london with safety his brave volunteer as he styled him should be the first person he would pay his bounden duty to  chap xix mr andrews was a good deal pleased with this adventure at first both on account of the service he had rendered even to a stranger in distress and that there was something in this gentlemans person manners and appearance which had attracted his simpathy at first fight and prepossessed him with a desire of being further acquainted with him  he was a young man of about twentythree years of age tall genteel and well proportioned his features were remarkably handsome and he had a sensible countenance quickened with spirit and vivacity he was richly dressed and had altogether the air address and mien of a person of quality and fashion  in his conversation he showed a lively wit a readiness of conception and a quickness of reply in his expression there appeared the ease style and correctness of a liberal education and on the few topics which the short interval of their tete a tete had afforded them the occasion of introducing his judgment and sentiments denoted a competent knowledge of men manners and things  but after he had leisure for his own reflections his nice moral began soon to render him uneasy at having wrested a person out of the hands of the law and defrauding perhaps a fair creditor of a just demand he deliberated upon this scruple for some time and then determined it within himself that this debt had in justice now become his own as truly as if he had originally contracted it and upon this punctilio resolved without the least regard to consequences to tender himself as collateral security to the creditor as soon as he should be able to inform himself of the person  accordingly next morning he repaired to one of the sheriffs of the city with whom he happened to be intimately acquainted and inquired from him who the plaintiff was in the writ lately issued against mr carewe the sheriff carried him to the office and upon examining the books found him to be an eminent banker in the city  upon this information mr andrews immediately waited upon the banker at his house told him who he was acquainted him with the adventure of the evening before declared his scruples upon it and at the same time offered to pass a countersecurity to him to make that debt his own if mr carewe should not discharge it within a year old cent per cent stared at him for some time with astonishment the thing perhaps might have been a new case and might possibly not have fallen within the ordinary course of his dealings but throwing off the surprise as quick as he could he replied why really sir you act but the fair and honest part it is just what i should have done myself or indeed what any body else would do in like circumstances no no sir there is no trifling with money matters a very serious thing are your money matters mr andrews therefore sir pray good sir walk into my office till i write a note to my attorney who must certainly be well acquainted with precedents of this sort and he will forthwith attend and draw up the proper article between us sir  chap xx the attorney appeared soon after and taking his place at a table opposite to mr andrews addressed him thus your christianname pray good sir henry  but pray dont you require my surname also o that i suppose is carewe  are you not a brother of mr carewes sir no sir i am not nor any manner of relation to him at all that i know of the money though i presume must have been for your use not one penny of it i assure you sir nor did i ever see mr carewe before or know any thing in the least about this matter till after the incident which happened yesterday evening on ludgate hill  here the attorney laid down his pen and was beginning to elevate his eyebrows when the banker growing alarmed at this conversation winked at him and begged he would proceed with the instrument without any further loss of time which after asking mr andrews his surname he drew up immediately and it was perfected accordingly  after the tremendous sound of sign seal and deliver was pronounced mr andrews rose up made his bow and retired the banker and attorney attending him to the door where on a hem from the latter he was laid hold of by four ruffians in arms arresting him for the riot as they termed it on the night before in which they said that one of the bailiffs as worthy a citizen as ever broke the worlds bread had been wounded by his complish one carewe a mere stapegrace of a fellow and that his life was despaired of  mr andrews according to that philosophic complexion which added a luster and a dignity to all his actions submitted himself without the least resistance or even a murmur to the arrest only just turning his eyes for a moment on the attorney to see whether he still retained an human form and directing a chair to be called in order to be conducted unseen to prison in the interim the man of money expostulated thus with the man of law that such a proceeding might possibly be very injurious to him for if the gentleman should happen to be hanged said he which very probably may be the case must i not certainly lose part of my security for the five hundred pounds and this if you will but weigh it well sir you must allow to be a very unlucky circumstance for me  i cannot help that matter replied the attorney for these honest gentlemen the bailiffs are my clients as well as you are sir nay the king himself who is higher than ye all put together is my client also in this suit as plaintiff against the prisoner and currat lex is the rule of my life sir as you may see it is the motto of my coach too said he pointing to an equipage which stood at the door and stepping into it at the same time drove away after having concluded his moral with this expression that according to his way of thinking a man who was fool enough to go bound for anothers debt deserved to be hanged for anothers crime the chair arrived mr andrews went into it attended by the bailiffs and the banker returned into his house again  chap xxi as soon as mr andrews had been lodged in confinement he sent a message to his friend the sheriff to come unto him which he immediately obeyed he acquainted him with the unhappy consequences of his romantic honor and inquired in what condition of danger the wounded bailiff was at that time he replied that the surgeon had just then made a report at his office on that mornings dressing that the wound though dangerous was not mortal and therefore added he you may yet be admitted to bail which i would advise you to procure immediately before this hazardous affair may take a more unlucky turn or afford the surgeon cause to pronounce less favorably about his patient  mr andrews then dispatched a messenger to the banker to inquire who mr carewe was where he had lodged in london and what town or county of england an express might have the best chance of finding him in to which he was answered that all he knew of that gentleman was his having become bound for the five hundred pounds then in suit along with a certain merchant who had since become bankrupt and absconded and that he was a lodger at the widow bensons a milliner in dukestreet grosvenors square at the time of his arrest  mr andrews upon this information sent off an intelligent person to this lodging to make a particular inquiry about him but received as little satisfaction from that quarter also the landlady said that squire carewe had lodged under her roof for about the last six months past and had discharged her the very night before on the sudden without the least manner of previous warning before hand except only the sending a person to her with the rent who whispered mr carewes servant where to follow his master with his trunks which makes me timorous said she that all is not right with the poor gentleman adding that she knew not where his fortune lay of what family he was or what connections he had either in city or country having never seen any person come anear him from whom she could have picked up any sort of intelligence of this kind  she concluded her account of him with saying that to be sure and certain he was a dear gay soul of a lad but a little rakehellish or so she believed like the best of them for that he sometimes kept late hours and would at other times stay abroad whole nights together successively one after another but that without all manner of gainsay or peradventure she never beheld with her eyes a more goodhumourder affability gentleman for that he would frequently joke and romp with her daughter cicely just for all the world like one of ourselves and sometimes in good truth that a body would scarce hear their own ears for their noise  but indeed added she the good naturesome cretur left off his gamiorum a little for the last three or four weeks before he went away being timbersome of hurting the poor girl who has been for some time apprehended to be falling into a dropsy and the poticary tells me lately continued she in a whining tone that he is much afraid my dear child has got an impostor in her belly but to be sure it was the lords will that it should come there and who can help sickness i say  after this scrap of religion and philosophy she recovered her voice again and putting a bundle of papers into the persons hands said here sir i give you some malescripts that i found scattered about mr carewes closet this morning which i suppose are no signifies by their being left behind but perhaps you sir continued she may be able to find out some hints or antidotes among them which may serve to direct your search after mr carewe and dear sir added she if ever you should happen to get the least tidings of my worthy guest i prithee acquaint me with it for poor cicely there within is breaking her heart after him just like a child that had lost its plaything because of his goodhumouredness and comicality and in truth sir concluded she even myself thinks the house itself begins to appear but pure and lonesome after him all this morning  chap xxii when mr andrews had got these papers into his hands he looked eagerly through them to see if he could receive any manner of information about his dear bought friend but was disappointed they were only a collection of reflections and observations upon life pleasure and virtue as they were entitled on the back thrown together after the manner of paschals thoughts without order or digestion  however the admirable turn of moral which appeared throughout these notes afforded poor mr andrews some hope in mr carewes honor that he would redeem him as far as the laws might admit from the twofold difficulties he had been involved in upon his account but then how to come at him or acquaint him of them  but it at last occurred that though he did not know where to convey a private notice to him a public hint might reach him in any part of the kingdom upon which thought he immediately directed a paragraph to be inserted in all the newspapers setting forth that a person who had accidentally rescued a gentleman from an assault on ludgate hill on such an evening had been the next day involved in a severe misfortune upon that account and that if his unknown friend should be inclined to afford any assistance toward relieving him out of his present difficulties he might send a line to mr h a at the woodstreet compter  he then sat himself down to recollect all those persons in london who had ever received obligations from himself or his family or who had ever declared particular friendships for him through life and after he had formed a list of about three or four and twenty names within such connections he dispatched a letter to the first upon his paper setting forth his situation not in the least doubting his ready assistance as he was a young gentleman of considerable fortune to whom mr andrewss father had been guardian and acquitted himself of the trust to the perfect satisfaction of all his friends with regard both to his health education and estate and with whom he had himself lived in a fond and free manner even from their earliest years to that time  the answer he received to this letter was that as a person of his fortune in life must necessarily have a large number of friends he thought it would be an imprudent step in him to afford a precedent for so many others to call upon his goodnature in like circumstances he therefore begged to be excused he acknowledged indeed some few obligations to his father but concluded at the same time with saying prithee what after all has he done for me more than the law would have exacted from him  if the sins of the fathers be visited upon the children why not their merits also but it seems that do all we can we shall be deemed still but unprofitable servants here as well as hereafter this too truly is no uncommon reasoning among men and nothing for nothing is this worlds motto  chap xxiii this disappointment shocked poor mr andrews but did not discourage him he sat down again and wrote a letter directly to the second upon his list who was a gentleman every way qualified to serve him at this crisis both from affluence credit and interest in the city he had these reasons to expect it too that they had been schoolfellows together that an intimate friendship had ever since subsisted between them and that he had lately at the hazard of his life rendered him a most signal piece of service the story was this  they had supped together at a tavern one night with several other persons when an absurd illtempered fellow in company took it into his head to fasten i think that is the phrase upon this gentleman without any manner of provocation but solely to indulge his own spleen and finding him to be too slow of resentment proceeded to bear him down in the most bullying manner  mr andrews felt compassion for his friend and taking advantage of his looking toward him though with a most timorous countenance rose up saying yes sir i understand you but i can by no means suffer this matter to become personal that gentlemans behavior is an equal insult to the whole company and as all tavern reckonings are paid by club i expect that every man here will join me in obliging this disturber of the peace to ask pardon of the whole room or in treating him as a person whose manners have placed him below the character of a gentleman  reader dont you think that this would be the proper method of dealing with your bucks or bears to make a general rising against them at once for surely it is an hard case that one man must venture his life merely because another does not value his  the whole company one and all some through spirit and others through shame rose up in arms at the word poor sneaker now as forward as the best and insisted on his making a general submission or leaping out of the window the easier conditions were accepted of and all was peace and harmony for the rest of the night  it is now full time to acquaint you with the answer which mr andrews received to his second embassy which in few words was this that he would be extremely glad to oblige his dear friend in any other way he could require but that he had made it an invariable rule to himself upon his first entrance into life never to become a bondsman for any person whatsoever  concluding his letter with this passage out of proverbs he that hates surety shall be sure  cowardice betrays a narrowness of soul and a man can no more be generous than brave under such mean circumstances of heart and mind  chap xxiv i have now said mr andrews to himself had repeated ill luck by proceeding in a regular course and taking my friends one after another as i had noted them down in the roll perhaps i may meet with some success by selecting them here and there according to the rank they hold in my opinion of their virtue or the degree which i think myself entitled to in their regards  upon this reflection he moved his eye slowly and considerately over the list and at last fixed upon a person whose character life and fortune had at once been attacked by popular slander suits at law and criminal prosecution mr andrews unknowing him and without any other connection except the ties of humanity and benevolence but persuaded of the malice and injustice at that time raging against him had generously became a volunteer in his cause retrieved his character by public writings and defended his life and fortunes from the virulence and oppression of his enemies  he dispatched a billet to this obligee and waited in perfect acquiescence of his justice honor and gratitude till the messenger  say rather the friend himself returns it would be impossible to convey an adequate idea of this correspondents response to the reader without giving him a literal transcript of the letter which was verbatim as follows my dear andrews how cruel is it in you to put my assured friendship for you to so severe a shock how irksome to the generous mind to be asked what it must deny a burnt child they say dreads the fire and my own danger is still too recent in my mind to suffer me to run the hazard of incurring so soon again the public censure and the resentment of the courts by thus openly abetting a person who has had the misfortune for my friendship will not suffer me to call it by an harsher title of violating the laws of his country in two such flagrant instances as a rescue and a murder  this would be to involve myself in your imputed guilt and by looking too like a mutual compact to support each other in iniquity be apt to endanger anew that injured character which you have already so generously and successfully defended  i wish you however both safety and happiness and am as in duty bound my dearest andrews your truly sincere friend and most obliged humble servant     gracious heaven that a person should attempt to forge arguments for his ingratitude out of those very incidents of his life from whence arose a claim to the highest demonstrations of friendship should it not rather have excited a transport almost bordering upon vice of rejoicing at so lucky an occasion of acquitting oneself of such pressing obligations ingratitude is a detestable thing for besides the vice there is a meanness in it also which disgusts  there is certainly a most hellish turn of wit in the above letter and i could wish with all my heart that the story was not quite so abominable lest the indignant reader may suspect its veracity but upon the faith of history i affirm it to be fact in every the minutest circumstance and whenever i shall be at liberty to publish a key to this work and declare the real personages throughout the whole i do hereby promise that the original letter shall be lodged in mr folios hands with the names subscribed at length in order to be perused by the curious along with several other choice manuscripts which i hope soon to have the permission of communicating to the public  chap xxv well what is to be done now mr andrews was a good deal cast down upon this third and least expected disappointment and now despairing of success resolved to make no farther essays of this hopeless kind i have already said he made experiments upon three of the strongest anchors i had and they have failed me to pursue the trial longer would be to betray less reason than a dog which foiled in one or two attempts to get at food will never again assail the latticed grate philosophers urge this article among the instances of that animals rationality whereas say they were he guided by appetite or instinct merely he would still continue the attempt till his strength failed him   however as he had always a way in any matter of consequence of trying every method probable or improbable possible or impossible to compass an end not indeed acting from his own judgment but in order to satisfy the officious queries of unassisting friends why did you not do so and so or this or that or the other he sent a person round to the remainder of his list inviting them all together to come and spend the evening with him but without giving the least hint of the request he had a design of making to them imagining that though one or two might think the obligation too great a score of friends might possibly join to divide the load among them  his messenger had the good fortune of meeting every one of the guests at home and having acquainted them that their friend mr andrews had desired their company respectively to consult together upon a certain difficult matter which he would communicate to them at meeting they each of them most readily accepted of the invitation what honest andrews cried one no business on earth shall detain me from him i would run an hundred miles on foot to serve him says another he deserves every act of friendship in the world from me cried a third and so went on the rest  but when the suspicious scene of appointment came to be named their brisk countenances were overcast on the sudden they made some kind of inquiries how it was and how it happened and then dismissed the messenger with their condolements and best wishes to their worthy friend mr andrews who might rest assured that nothing except some business or other of consequence might chance to intervene should prevent them the pleasure of waiting upon him in the evening  this answer began to revive his drooping spirits and he said in soliloquy that one should always make use of every kind of means in difficult cases as it sometimes happens that the most unlikely ones succeed where the best concerted may sail he walked about his chamber for an hour or two in longing expectation of seeing a groupe of friends rushing together into the room and his honest heart sprang with joy at hearing the sound of a number of hasty steps come ecchoing up the stairs he threw open wide the door and his arms at the same time but received into them only a parcel of sweaty porters with each a billet in his hand  you have read the story of the invited guests in scripture  if not i beg you will immediately turn over to it my wife says it is in luke the fourteenth chapter and eighteenth verse first paragraph for this will save me the trouble of repeating a score of apologies to the unfortunate mr andrews from so many modern friends  chap xxvi a person thus forlorn of all foreign aids generally betakes himself to philosophic resources that is with deference to the porch to melancholic reflections for what are all the arguments of seneca or epictetus though in truth this last advises sometimes to hang oneself the door is open says he that fate is inevitable that what will be will be that we must submit where we cannot defend that the best have suffered and that life itself is but an appointed state of trial  and so forth  what is all this i say but holding our misfortunes the more steadfastly under contemplation and superadding a further weight from despair would a physician mean to raise your drooping spirits by pronouncing you past hopes  i heard once of a french surgeon who most happily expressed the whole spirit of stoicism in one word for upon probing a wound and being asked by the patient his opinion of his case replied courage courage monsieur  for begar you die in one half hour this i take truly to be but an epitome of inevitable fate what will be will be where we cannot defend we must submit etc courage cries old forceps for begar you die in one half hour  but mr andrews had a much better manner of conducting himself upon all such occasions for whenever he felt or even apprehended any kind of difficulty he immediately sat himself down to ruminate on every means which prudence or activity could supply to obviate or remedy the evil but from the moment that he had digested and applied his expedients he directly applied himself also to reading with such an attention of mind and study that he could for the time exclude all thought or reflection either upon the misfortune or the means till the crisis or the cure had awakened his recollection again  and this method of avocation i take to be a much better way than to sit brooding over misfortunes or the hardiness of attacking them to take arms against a siege of troubles with the weapons of philosophy for what is generally imagined to be a strength of mind is often little more than a command of features which enables us to put a good face upon bad matters and only suffers misfortune like the most dangerous wound inwardly to bleed zeno founder of the stoic sect hanged himself at ninety for a whitloe it certainly was not so trifling an ailment that overcame his temper but his mind might be compared to a balance with philosophy in one scale plumb and misfortunes dropping into the other one by one till they came both to poise in equilibrio and then a feather turned the beam  i have always thought stoicism both an absurd and a mistaken pride expressions and demonstrations of grief are as natural as those of joy and arise often from nobler sentiments and more generous motives and yet we manifest the one without reserve and conceal the other till our proud hearts break shakespeare has given us a beautiful image of this unequal struggle between philosophy and misfortune in his twelfth night   she never told her grief but let concealment like a worm in the bud feed on her damask cheek she pined in thought and with a green and yellow melancholy she sat like patience on a monument smiling at grief    to weep is womanish weakness they cry but there are tears which become the bravest man sighs are the effect of sorrow as well as laughter is of mirth and both equally designed by nature to discharge certain humors in the mind springing from their respective sources which if not suffered to evacuate themselves might ultimately affect the body if you backen a tumor you corrupt the blood  there is another vulgar error too which has often surprised me that gravity should still impose upon the world as a sign of wisdom is it because an owl was the arms of athens and the bird of minerva we seem to have accepted the emblem literally which the mythologists tell us was designed rather as a caution against being imposed upon by outward appearances gravity generally proceeds from a defect of natural spirit in youth or a decay of it in age when real it is the effect merely of constitution or stupidity and if assumed it is either to conceal weakness or to cover pride  that gravity is an imperfection may fairly be deduced from the natural causes of it grief misfortunes sickness or old age but sense is the parent of cheerfulness  addison joins virtue for to the wicked may justly be applied that sarcasm of solomons they are mad when they are merry in fine good humor is to morals what the sun is to nature whose light not only gilds the objects but whose warmth improve their virtue also and in imitation of carneades who styled beauty royalty without force i shall define cheerfulness to be philosophy without reflection  chap xxvii mr andrews remained in this irksome situation during almost four days when on the last of them about seven oclock in the evening a person came limping into the room and delivered him the following letter dated london two oclock the hand unknown  my gallant generous but unhappy friend how shall i accost you i met with a paragraph in one of the public prints last night about twelve oclock and above fourscore miles from hence it shocked and alarmed me so extremely that i instantly took horse and have rode post hither where i lie concealed at my attorneys house he has informed me of both the particulars relating to your distress  i cannot go on  i leave him to say the rest  for none but a person hackneyed in the ways of men can speak without emotion upon such a subject as this adieu adieu  charles carewe   this letter said mr andrews to the person who had delivered it to him refers me to you sir for those particulars which relate to the business of it and as time presses hard upon us at present i beg that you will execute your commission without any manner of preface or delay i shall obey you sir replied the attorney and will deliver myself in as few words as the nature of the subject may admit pray proceed  you must know then sir that my first acquaintance with mr carewe was  dear sir cried mr andrews since i must know that very interesting particular i promise you to attend to it any time you please when we shall be more at leisure it cannot possibly be necessary to relate at present therefore pray good sir proceed and so i would sir if you had not stopped my mouth then as i was saying my first acquaintance with mr carewe  indeed sir i require not the least account of your first acquaintance with that gentleman all i want to know at this time is what your last conference with him was why really sir replied the attorney i was coming to that point directly if you had not twice interrupted me and if a man of law is once shuffled out of the regular course of business do you take me sir he will not readily again be able to bring on matters properly to an hearing do you mind i ask your pardon sir replied mr andrews i pray you go on sir in your own way  for i was born to suffer aside  well then as i said before sir continued old tautology my first acquaintance with mr carewe who by the by is a very worthy client of mine and indeed in other things too the man bears a good sort of character was his lodging five thousand hard pounds in my hands with directions to purchase for him into the four per cent funds to make short work of the matter for i perceive that you dont love long speeches sir i actually did lay out this same five thousand pounds sterling for him in the said four per cent funds as i told you before he had given me commission to do  well sir  upon my presenting him with the debentures what consideration he gave me for my honesty diligence trouble and dispatch  for i did not keep him long in suspense sir  is not by any manner of means do you mark me material at present but i believe sir that i may venture to let you so far into the secret as to inform you that it was no trifle no trifle i assure you sir for indeed mr carewe as i think i told you already is a very worthy gentleman  a gentleman every inch of him believe me sir  and he was certainly much in the right of it too for there is no surer thing in the world than that if you would have your business well done you must pay for it well live and let live is the true maxim in trade sir but that is neither here nor there do you mind to the present matter in hand therefore you will give me leave to have done with that part of the story i presume sir  most willingly indeed good sir  but to make a long story short in order to have done with it quite and clear and not to detain you any longer from the business in agitation sir there was one thing and only that one thing i ever knew him guilty of which gave me but a slight opinion of him i speak above board sir for they call me old telltruth among my friends and those that are free with me  and that same thing sir in a few words was this  oh aside  chap xxviii mr carewe employed me once continued he to prosecute his servant man or man servant as it is termed in the law books for robbing him of a good new spic and span suit of clothes some shirts and other movables to a considerable value for mr carewe sir was always a most tearing beau i had the villain set and taken as nimble as he was and lodged him in this very house as safe as you are yourself sir at present  but what would you have of it sir when the rogue was brought upon his trial no mr carewe appeared to swear to the goods found upon him not in the very least sir no mr carewe appeared though called upon his recognizance three several times by the crier with a laudible voice sir and when my younker did not come and appear to save his fine the judge immediately ordered his forfeited recognizance to be forthwith estreated into his majestys exchequer and the rogue was discharged for want of prosecution  i went off sir hot foot from the court to mr carewes lodgings to see whether he was alive or dead and who should i find there but my young dilly dally gentleman in his nightcap and slippers sitting by the fire and reading some conjuring book or other that i could make neither head or tail of upon which i up and told him a piece of my mind very roundly asking him why the devil he had not come to court and done justice against his hangdog tim but all the satisfaction the dainty gentleman gave me was that a woman with a parcel of children at her heels had kept bawling and roaring in the hall all the morning and that as he had ever a mortal dislike to the crying of brats he could not possibly think of stirring out of his room while they remained below pray did you ever hear now so foolish a reason in all your life mr andrews for not going to do what the law directs i believe you might not have understood him sir  not i truly sir nor could any body else i think who had either sense or reason but so this foolish affair ended after having cost us a good round fine of fifty pounds sterling in shining cash sir besides my own bill of costs which i warrant me totted to ten or twelve pieces more a pretty business this truly you will say sir  i say nothing sir and could wish for charity sake that you had done saying also i must have done now sir for i have nothing further to add upon this subject that i can now recollect said he pausing  oh sir for mercy sake proceed immediately to the business you have been sent about or i shall be obliged to dispatch a messenger directly to mr carewe to get that part of his letter which relates to your errand explained by himself sir there need be no manner of occasion for all that hurry sir replied the attorney for i will deliver it every word to you myself from first to last without the least delay or adding to or diminishing from sir  but first i must beg you will be so kind as to order me up a bottle of wine sir for i dont know how it is but i am a little dry and hoarse at present but i was hurry scurry there sir and hurry scurry here sir and then talking away so fast to get plump to the matter in hand that this may be the occasion of it perhaps sir  very likely sir  chap xxix the wine and glasses were laid upon the table and after the attorney had swallowed down half a dozen bumpers running well sir continued or rather commenced he the upshot of the matter is this mr carewe came to my house about two oclock or rather before this day muffled up in a chair and without staying even to ask me how i did inquired of me whether i had heard any thing so and so as how he had been arrested on ludgate hill had been rescued by a gentleman what was the consequence and so forth  i told him that the whole story was then current in the courts for that the plaintiffs attorney a very acute creditable man had told every body he met with as how one mr andrews who i presume was you sir after having delivered him from the bailiffs was fool enough i ask pardon sir to go to the creditor and join himself in security for the money in suit and how he nabbed him there in the very fact on account of one of the honest fellows that had been desperately wounded in the fray and that he was then held to two thousand pounds bail which was the restriction the court had laid him under in resentment for their affronted laws  poor mr carewe said he dropped tears at the first part of this story though i really saw no such crying matter in it but he turned pale and fell into a chair by the time i had come to the latter part of it overcome i suppose by the fatiguing journey he had told me he had rode all the last night and this morning mr andrews was much affected at this recital  mr carewes distress augmented his own for his compassion extended itself even to the person through whom his own misfortune had fallen upon him however he quick recollected himself and entreated the attorney to proceed who thus went on  as soon as mr carewe had a little recovered himself he pulled the very identical five thousand pounds worth of four per cent debentures out of his pocket and putting half of them to the amount of just two thousand five hundred pounds into my hands run fly said he in a perfect agony to my generous and unhappy friend mr andrews summon the sheriff on the instant deposit with him instead of bail two thousand pounds of these securities to set that worthy gallant man at liberty  and oh send him quick as lightning to my grateful arms  i have have entrusted you before cried he all in a breath with my whole fortune  and there indeed perhaps he was right  how much higher a confidence do i repose in you now  but this last expression i could not for the very blood of me comprehend the meaning of when i had actually but half of the debentures in my hands at the same time  but he really seemed to be a little non com himself the man did while he was speaking to me for you verily never did see any creature in such a hurry combustion in all your life just for all the world in such a twitter as a girl going to be married exactly run  fly  was the word at every hands turn  nay he would not even suffer me to stay to eat a poor morsel of dinner neither which was just then coming upon the table an excellent fowl bacon and greens with a piping hot shoulder of mutton sir all of the very best meat that the markets could afford for my crest has always been sir win gold and wear it in faith nothing less sir as i was saying would serve my gentleman but out i must go directly or there would be no living in the house for him  so after i had settled a few papers in my desk sir and had put on my hat gloves and cloak looking for my cane for some time which my son tommy had carried up to the nursery for a hobby horse  young things will play mr andrews  mr carewe fidgetting and fidgetting about the parlour all the while i sallied out of the door without any manner of delay exactly as it struck three oclock sir  chap xxx three oclock cried out mr andrews and looking at his watch  it is now just eight and allowing an hour for your coming to this point without any manner of delay since you came in what in the name of prolixity and the law could you have been doing sir during the other four hours  why there now again sir you may easily perceive from hence the hurry and confusion that both mr carewe and you had thrown me into for it had made me near forgot one very material article of my errand which this question of yours now started has made me recollect again i told you before sir that mr carewe had given me debentures to the amount of two thousand five hundred pounds sterling  the first two thousand you know already how that is to be applied but now for the odd five hundred  why this sir mr carewe desired me as soon as i should have dispatched you off to him to post away to the banker with to release his bond with your counterobligation and bring them to him directly that he might have the honest pleasure as he expressed himself of delivering them up cancelled to you himself sir  well sir  when i had now gotten into the middle of the street safe and sound out of his clutches and found myself at liberty of thinking and acting according to my own judgment or experience of matters and things i began to consider with myself that my best way undoubtedly would be first to hye me to the bankers before i came to you sir arguing the point pro and con in my own mind thus should i defer this business till the evening i may possibly miss of my chap for he may be gone abroad but as for mr andrews i shall be sure of finding the gentleman at home at any hour for he must necessarily stay till i call upon him ay ay bonum securum is the word there at dinner is the surest time of meeting with a man of business at his own house and i can also by this means kill two birds with one stone and pick up a meal for myself at the same time in spite of all mr carewes hurry and fluster  i judged the thing for the best i thought taking every circumstance together and so without any more ifs or ands away i hied me to the bank as fast as my legs which are none of the best could carry me i found the gentleman at home as i surmised i told him my errand he was overjoyed invited me to sit down at table with him and indeed to do him justice made as much of me as man could do  while we were at dinner continued he the banker sent one of his clerks to the attorney acquainting him with the business and desiring him to attend immediately and see very thing performed according to law he came on the summons and after i had paid the money and that we had taken our jolly bottles apiece and a peremptory i acquainted them with the other commission i was going to transact and so came off hither without stop or stay only just calling upon a client of mine for about half an hour as it happened to lie directly in my way business must be done you know sir but for all my hurry i did not neglect the main chance you see added he throwing two papers on the table for there are the girth and circingle my boy  five hundred pounds sterling with interest and costs which latter by the bye mr carewe owes me yet was a plaguey dear purchase truly for such dirty scraps of paper  but law is law sir  mr andrews lost all manner of patience by this time and ringing the bell sent off directly for his friend the sheriff entreating him to come immediately and take the securities from the attorney as he dare not venture to let this tedious impertinent go to the office to make the deposit himself or suffer him one moment out of his sight till he might be at liberty also to issue forth along with him  chap xxxi the sheriff returned with the messenger on the instant but brought this unwelcome piece of news at the same time that about half an hour before a certificate had been lodged in the office by the surgeon who attended the bailiff that upon that evenings dressing he had found the wound to have proved mortal after which notice added he i am sorry to acquaint you that it is not in the power of our office to accept of bail without a special order of court  mr andrews then turning toward the attorney said with a grave but dejected air i thank you sir for this and i hope that mr carewe will reprove you too with the same temper i understand you sir replied he but having done every thing for the best as i told you before i am not to be chargeable with the consequences do you mark business let me tell you sir because you really seem to be a perfect stranger to it business i say is not to be scuttled away as fast as this man or that man or the other man take it into their wise noddles as if they thought of nothing all the while but their own convenience forsooth but i find that i have no more business here at present sir and as i hate loitering where i have nothing to do i shall even pack up my awls and return home to mr carewe again with his two thousand pounds safe and sound out of all manner of jeopardy  i am sure my delay was lucky for him at least so saying he took up his hat gloves cloak cane girth and circingle filled up a brimmer drank the clerk of the crowns prayer to mr andrews and hobbled down stairs  the sheriff who was really a very good kind of man staid for an hour behind him to console his friend and told him he had hopes even if the bailiff should die from former instances of the same kind that upon its appearing to be a sudden thing merely accidental and without any manner of malice praepense on your part said he together with the remarkable sobriety and excellence of your character the crown may be induced to make a favorable distinction upon the representation of the court between the accessory and the principal  i thank you sir replied mr andrews for your kind wishes but free from guilt i am devoid of fear i would not yet die because nature seems yet unwilling to release me  but if providence shall think fit to supersede her laws heavens will be done and i shall submit without repining  the spirit and virtue of these expressions drew tears from the sheriffs eyes  and so they would have done from the hangman farewell most excellent young man said he embracing him and retired  chap xxxii just after he went away the following letter was delivered to mr andrews my dearest friend this vile attorney has rendered me a most shocking account of his principal commission but who can one trust who depend upon a common porter would have been a better though not so proper an agent i could have stabbed him but your danger has made a coward of me fear not however notwithstanding the unpromising appearances of this night i have a scheme in resolve which may set you free tomorrow my life and fortunes are dedicated to you farewell amen  c c     this letter appeared quite enigmatical but mr andrews read prayed and went to bed in expectation of the next days event no measure rested upon himself and his anxiety was therefore less than it would have been had any issue depended upon his own conduct  the next morning he was informed that as soon as the kings bench had met a counsel on the part of mr carewe had moved the court setting forth the whole story of mr andrewss accidental and unmerited misfortune confessing that mr carewe himself had wounded the bailiff before mr andrews had come up and offering on condition that mr andrews should be admitted to bail to surrender mr carewe into custody to take his trial should the bailiff die the court was extremely struck at the generosity of the proposition but saying that the laws admitted of no commutation in in such cases dismissed the motion  mr andrews himself notwithstanding the greatness of his own soul was astonished at the magnanimity of mr carewes and wept then for the first time since his confinement crying out this is a man indeed worth living for yet i may die perhaps without the happiness of any farther commerce with him say say ye learned in the philosophy of nature is there on earth a transport higher than the embrace of such a friend but i cannot fly to his arms nor dare he venture into mine  just as he had finished this expression mr carewe with a flow pace and dejected air entered the room moving up toward mr andrews who upon seeing him sprang back from his chair crying out gracious heaven sir what has brought you into this horrid place my own extravagance and vice and your virtue and misfortune replied he throwing himself at his feet embracing his knees and entreating his pity and forgiveness mr andrews endeavoring to raise him sunk into his arms  chap xxxiii i was obliged to close the last chapter somewhat abruptly because i began to perceive my generous reader too much affected myself not less so to suffer me to continue the rest of the story in description therefore for the mutual ease of both our nerves i shall conclude the remainder of it in simple narrative only  upon mr carewes having heard that his motion had been rejected by the court he walked about his room for some time like a distracted person  then sitting down for a while composed in thought started suddenly up again and on the instant rushed out of the house surrendered himself to the sheriff and was immediately conducted to the compter  the principle upon which he took this extraordinary step was this he feared that if mr andrews should be tried alone he might in all probability suffer as being the only delinquent taken for the fact but that should the principal take his trial along with him he hoped that the punishment of the chief aggressor might be deemed sufficient satisfaction for justice and incline the court to extend its favor toward the innocent and accidental accomplice oh should this gallant friend suffer for my crime cried he out what a legacy of life would he leave me i can die with courage but i cannot live with ignominy  death is but an instant  infamy is immortal i ask pardon of my readers but i am not describing i am only repeating  these pair of extraordinary friends passed some minutes together in mutual admiration of each others worth not knowing how to express their heartfelt sentiments of such unmodern virtue when they were relieved from their difficulty by the hasty entrance of the sheriff who running up and embracing mr andrews cried out in a transport of congratulation joy joy my dear friend and to you sir also turning to mr carewe for two of the most eminent surgeons in london whom i called in myself to attend the bailiffs dressing this morning have pronounced him absolutely out of danger and even in a condition to walk abroad  while the two friends attended earnestly to this discourse he thus went on i confess said he that i was much surprised last night upon finding such a notice served upon my office so shortly after my having been informed in the courts just as i was going home to dinner that the bailiff had been pronounced to be in a fair way of recovery i began to suspect from this circumstance that there had been some foul play intended from some quarter or other in this affair and therefore resolved within myself for the sake of justice humanity and friendship to call in two of the ablest surgeons in the city at my own expense to attend the dressing of my patient this morning however i did not mention any thing of this purpose to you last night added he turning to mr andrews thinking it not proper to amuse you lest the success might not have answered my hopes and expectations  chap xxxiv the former surgeon continued he who was by at this report appeared to be extremely confounded and sneaked immediately after out of the room this strengthened my suspicion and running hastily after him down stairs just as he had gained the threshold of the door i seized him by the collar pretending to have a warrant for him in my pocket upon an information of a collusion with some certain person to impose his patients danger on the court for some sinister purpose or other  his fright betrayed his guilt and upon a promise of indemnity he immediately confessed to me that the bankers attorney had called upon him in a great hurry the evening before and prevailed on him with a fee of twenty guineas to make a false return upon his patients case with a design as i apprehend said he to skrew money out of the prisoner in order to be admitted to bail  i was transported with joy said the sheriff at this fortunate discovery but resolving not to suffer it to rest here i sent immediately for a coach and carried him with the two other surgeons along with me to court ordering the wounded bailiff by their permission to follow us in a chair  i got a counsel then to move the bench on your behalf and after a thorough examination into this iniquitous affair and our producing the patient on the table the court directed a prosecution against the attorney at the suit of the crown and granted me permission to come immediately and set you both at liberty the bench having been just at that instant informed that you sir said he and turning to mr carewe had surrendered yourself up into the sheriffs office this morning upon the dismissal of your extraordinary and unprecedented motion  they all mutually embraced each other and mr andrews and mr carewe made the most grateful acknowledgments to the sheriff for his generous and active services entreating the enjoyment of his company for the remainder of the day in some safe and retired scene beyond the city wards upon mr carewes account where by the help of friendly converse they might endeavor to forget the irksomeness of their late adventure  the sheriff excused himself on account of the business of his office and mr carewe at parting put a bill of fifty pounds into his hands desiring him to discharge the compter fees to reimburse himself his own expenses of surgeons counsel etc and to give the remainder to the bailiff he answered that he would certainly execute the first and last of these commissions but begged to be excused from performing the second saying that he was no attorney and that providence had blessed him with a fortune which could afford to treat him to such acts as these mr andrews and mr carewe then took a coach and drove out to islington together  chap xxxv nothing can possibly demonstrate the veracity of these memoirs more than my two last chapters for the sudden transition from the danger of the two friends to their safety is certainly against all rules of novel whatsoever but so it happened and so i was bound to relate it it is a common thesis of school declamation whether or no it would have been a prudent measure in the carthaginians immediately after the battle of cannae to have marched up directly to the gates of rome but then surely that class which should assert the affirmative must point their court martial censure against hannibal alone who was at liberty to have done as he pleased and not at livy who was restrained by an historic fact  livy and i it is hoped the courteous reader will please to observe are perfectly alike in three very remarkable particulars  in being equally slaves to truth in the beauties of our writings and where the same courteous reader i am sure would least of all have suspected any manner of resemblance even in the very defects of them asinius pollio some historians say it was augustus caesar arraigns him of a patavinite as he phrased it in his style a sort of impureness of language contracted at patavium the place of his nativity and as i confess myself to have been born in ireland  for what irishman is ashamed i hope that the critical reviewers or selfnamed athenians a set of selfsufficient persons once erected themselves into a tribunal which they styled the athenian oracles proposing to answer every question or solve any difficulty in wit morals or physics  several ridiculous queries were proposed to them and one of them begins thus  selfnamed athenians pray let it be shown for sure it is obvious to such mighty wits why etc   will heartily impute the hibernicities in this here work to my having been indigenated in that there place  had i been at liberty to have suffered events to wait upon the leisure of invention how pleasant would it be to have locked up the reader in the goal with them for a week or ten days longer the turnkey bringing them accounts from time to time of the still increasing danger of the bailiff at length he is given over and then he dies and then they are both instantly loaded with irons  after which i might have related how as they were transmitting from the compter to newgate they were interrupted by a funeral procession which upon enquiry they found to be the aforesaid bailiff going to be buried  and how upon its taking wind no matter how among the populace that these pair of unfortunate friends were the culprits for the fact they were first insulted and then pelted so furiously with stones or brickbats no matter which that if it was not for the guard most luckily coming up in the nick firing among the mob and killing seven or eight poor innocent men women and children who had taken no manner of part in the fray but only stood gaping on  i say that was it not for this same unexpected and timely relief which favored their escape they would never have lived to be hanged you may depend upon it  well but after their rescue i might have lodged them safe and sound in the dungeon for a week on ten days longer till their trials are brought on during which interval i could have highly entertained the reader who has voluntarily confined himself to the same condemned hold along with them with the histories of the several criminals neckyoked in the same place which they might have amused themselves with to while away the time till their executions  as how one man finding another in bed with his wife did contrary to his majestys peace his crown and dignity and contrary to the statute in that case made and provided blow out the cuckolders brains with a charged pistol which he happened luckily to have in his hand at the very time that the adulteress had prosecuted and convicted him for the fact notwithstanding it had been specially argued by his counsel that jointurewives should never be admitted as evidence against their husbands because they are to be gainers by the success of the suit  how another hangdog having cogged a die upon a young heir just come of age and stripped him of a large sum of money upon being charged by the loser with the fraud and being a person of nice honor but not having the fear of god before his eyes whipped him through the guts upon the very spot with several other such extraordinary occurrences in life as swell and embellish the most of our modern novels  and after i had held the reader in pain for his two friends quantum sufficit had brought them into the dock and arraigned them at the bar i might have introduced the officious sheriff aforesaid leading in the supposed dead bailiff by the hand and making a discovery of the whole sham contrived by etc there is a twist for you now which would be the more delightful because it was quite unnatural to expect it  i say that if i had not tied myself too scrupulously down to the very facts themselves as they really did occur which forces me on a digression now and then to give a scope to fancy i could have made this work infinitely more engaging both to my fair readers and to my foul ones too for i could have exchanged sentiment for incident and have forced moral to give place to   but have a little patience good people for i hope soon to rid my hands of the confined work i am now upon and then i promise you to give myself a loose to all the extravaganza of invention and to present the public with a novel though nothing new which shall at once distress and delight all hearts  i have here already in this very chapter afforded them a sketch both of the style and manner i mean to conduct it in which i have picked up out of several successful modern performances  for it shall be a most dismal series of adventures without language reflection or sentiment but rendered perfectly easy and familiar by the il modo basso an italian phrase for lowlife expressions  for one must humor the public like a child by telling them a story of what kind no matter so you keep going for the motto of them all may be that one is good till another is told but methinks our novelists treat the old babes worse than one does the young ones for they give them the fable only but neglect the moral  and really after all what use would the embellishments of thought or expression be of to a work of this kind except to take up too much of ones attention from the narrative or action which would be just as absurd as if you were conducting a gentleman or a lady for example sake to see an execution and should suffer them to loiter at a booksellers or a pictureshop by the way  the principle upon which our fabulous biographers proceed is certainly a very just one that this world is so brimful of happiness that it quite surfeits us and it is therefore become absolutely necessary to invent tales of difficulty and distress to relieve our satiated minds with a little variety a fellow in london who hawked the daily papers about the streets upon finding them to lie on his hands toward the latter end of the day while he cried only great news suddenly bethought himself to change his tune and roaring out bad news sold more in an hour than he had been able to do the whole day before  and therefore since readers have taken up such an unnatural passion for crying i think proper to acquaint them that i have framed the plan of a novel which if it does not blind their eyes with tears first shall break their hearts with grief at last the story in short shall be this  i will join clarissa harlowe and sidney bidulph both in the same piece and after i have ravished clary and married biddy i will pack them off on a voyage together no matter why or where but in order to have them taken by pirates and sold into slavery where after they have been reravished and remarried to the end of the chapter they shall attempt making their escape from algiers and be taken in the fact tried condemned but not executed all at once  not so fast good sirs  this would be putting the reader out of pain too suddenly either for his pleasure or my profit by cutting me short of just forty entertaining chapters exactly  for in the first i will only lop off a finger and in the next a toe and so proceed alternately as often as they have fingers and toes oh oh oh till finis shall bring us an account of their tedious deaths and burials these algerines you know are a merciless sort of people and it is no matter in the least how many lies a good christian may tell of turks jews or infidels  but after all what signifies lying might it not do as well to print off any old story of a cock and a bull in onion juice which i warrant you will oblige the strongest cabletonians cabletonians  persons whose nerves are as tough as cable ropes and who have no feelings but what are simply natural to animal nature who are sensible of pain but not grief of pleasure but not joy  in europe asia africa or america to drop tears as fast as the arabian tree its medicinal gum  for certainly that kind of sorrow which arises neither from the truth of the fact nor the art of the representation must be imputed rather to a weakness than a tenderness of heart and may properly enough be distinguished from compassion by the denomination of eye grief  n b this work shall consist of nine volumes in octavo subscriptions to be taken in by the printer hereof at five guineas in hand and a guinea on delivery of the first eight books the ninth to be delivered gratis the first volume to be put into the press as soon as one thousand setts shall be subscribed for  chap xxxvi mr andrews and mr carewe dined supped and lay at islington that night mr carewe not thinking it prudent to return to london for the reasons he had already given to mr andrews for quitting it immediately after his rescue they were sensible of a mutual satisfaction in each others converse and several polite expressions were exchanged between them during the course of that evening  but when mr carewe began to compliment his friend upon the generosity of his late behavior mr andrews interrupted him by saying that it would rather humble him in his own opinion to be praised for what in honor of human nature he hoped were but common merits my first act said he was but the usual impulse of manhood and the second but the result of common honesty only  your conduct indeed upon this occasion has been truly noble   hold interrupted mr carewe since you will not indulge me sir in the real pleasure of dwelling on your praise spare me at least the awkward uneasiness of listening to my own let us rather added he since we are i hope from this day cemented friends for life contrive after some sort to commence our acquaintance earlier by mutually relating to each other the private history of those aeras which have preceded our first meeting so as in a manner to retrieve past time and thus take hands as it were together from first to last through life  with all my heart replied mr andrews but as the evening is now too far spent that you have declared your purpose of retiring farther into the country tomorrow and that i must necessarily return to prosecute my fortunes at london let us defer entering upon this proposition till we may hereafter be more at leisure together and for the present well pass the short remnant of our contracted span in a more general converse  the next morning they parted and their different avocations keeping them still at a considerable distance from each other the first place they ever happened to meet in after their separation at islington was the farm as before recited in the first chapter and now ladies i have fairly kept my word with you for mr andrews has but just alighted at windsor and i shall leave him to continue his narrative to you which i took the liberty of interrupting at the end of the seventeenth chapter  chap xxxvii the continuation of the story of mr andrews and mr carewe i dined said mr andrews at the inn and after i had changed my dress i went immediately to pay my compliments to miss beville i met mrs beville in the hall ordering some wine into the parlour where i heard a great noise of rustic mirth going forward i saluted her and enquired with earnestness how her daughter was she sighed and replied that she had been for a considerable time ill of something like a slow fever on her spirits had loathed food and declined company that a physician had been called in several times but that it had been with great difficulty she could be at all persuaded to use any of his prescriptions and that the few which she had been prevailed on to take had yet produced no visible effect upon her health  she added that for a week past she had confined herself entirely to her chamber and that though this was her birthday upon which occasion her father had invited some friends to dinner in order to tempt her down stairs to do the honors of the table she had declined it by saying after her present lowspirited manner that it would be insincere in her to affect rejoicing at her birth mrs beville then pressed me to go into the parlour but i refused it telling her that i always avoided every occasion of drinking and that since miss beville had refused rejoicing upon the present one it would certainly be extremely ungalant in me to make merry on it  after this she kindly asked me where i had been this age as she was so obliging to term it which inquiry i happily took advantage of by replying that i had been studying physic ever since adding with an affected spirit that as quacks sometimes succeed where the faculty have failed perhaps i might be in possession of some nostrum or other which might possibly restore the fair invalid to her health and spirits again she replied that she really believed poor fanny would be glad to see me for that she had always seemed pleased with my company and had also distinguished me with particular regards as her dear brothers friend i bowed and she led the way up stairs to her daughters apartment  when i entered the room i saw her sitting at a table with a pen and ink and a paper just written lying before her she appeared pale and languid and had a certain air of melancholy diffused over all her features she did not perceive me at first as her mother walked in before me i advanced to salute her and she seemed struck with surprise she rose to receive me trembled when i took her hand faltered in attempting to speak and instantly fainted in my arms  i carried her to the couch loosed her stays and bared her lovely bosom while mrs beville sprinkled water on her face and neck she at length opened her eyes with a great sigh but quickly perceiving the situation and disorder she was in before me she fell into the utmost confusion which her mother endeavored to qualify by saying never mind it my dear child for this gentleman has become a physician since you saw him last and a deshabille you know is nothing between doctor and patient  i turned immediately aside toward the table to leave her at liberty to compose her handkerchief which while her mother and she were adjusting i was tempted to run my eye hastily over the manuscript that lay open before me in which i read the following lines  chap xxxviii on my birthday though sorrow fills my swelling heart and care sits heavy on my brow yet shall i with my utmost art hail and applaud the instant now this day in times extended line was marked the era of my birth it was gods gracious will not mine that i should then first visit earth what though my cup be dashed with gall nauseous and irksome to the taste do i not know that soon i shall be from the bitter draught released then let me welcome this glad day with choral song and festive mirth which steals from life a year away and brings me near my second birth the soldier placed in time of war where mines lie hid beneath his feet welcomes the coming guard afar but till relieved dares not retreat the sensations which affected me on reading this paper are not to be described i was very near wanting the same assistance myself which had been just supplied to her where i expected to meet a birthday ode as the title had promised me i was shocked with a funeral elegy rather sadness at other times may arise from some sudden loss or transient misfortune  the grief may be but temporary  but when a season otherwise of joy shall supply occasion of melancholic reflection it betrays the ingrained complexion of the mind throughout the whole poem she prefers death to life and seems to have restrained her impatience by the consideration in the last line only  i did not appear to have taken any manner of notice of the paper which the moment she recollected she sprang forward turned upon the table and blushed at the same time which quick restored her suspended beauties and made her seem at that instant more lovely to my eyes than methought i had ever seen her before  i asked her about the state of her health how long she had been ill after what manner affected and at the same time made a physical pretense of feeling her pulse for the natural one of touching her hand she answered me every question with as much gravity as she would have done to a regular physician only that she seemed to seize with a certain quickness an opportunity from thence of accounting for her late emotion by adding that she had dreamed the night before that i was dead and the tediousness of her disorder had reduced her mind as well as her body to such a state of weakness that the suddenness of my appearance before her so little expected had struck her some how as if it had been a vision  chap xxxix mrs beville on hospitable cares intent frequently quitted the room to order in wine to the company below stairs and give the necessary directions about her household affairs which left her charming daughter and me at greater liberty to entertain each other miss beville in one of these intervals asked me what was the whim of her mother in stiling me a physician just now i repeated our conversation below stairs and told her that this was a pretense i had luckily framed extempore in order to entitle me to the privilege of being admitted to visit her in her present retired and invalid state however added i the science of physic is not so deep a mystery neither as that common sense need be at a loss upon every occasion how to prescribe and in your case madam said i it is not impossible at least that i may be able without a diploma to retrieve your health ever long  she answered that she was very willing to submit to my prescriptions adding that if faith in the doctor was an help to medicine no physician could possibly meet with better success in a patient this she pronounced with a smile but a blush at the same time  the highest charms of female beauty joined at once in one  she then inquired of me with a modest downcast look and hesitating voice to what fortunate crisis she was indebted for the pleasure of my present visit then raising up her head and voice a little hoped that i had returned from germany loaded with laurels and brought home trophies to add to the ancient and present glory of england with other railleries of the same kind  i smiled at her humor and told her as was in truth the case that i had been trifled with by my father who after several vague schemes for my establishment in life had at length left me at liberty to seek out my own fortunes but that my disappointments were at present greatly qualified by the extreme pleasure i received in being allowed to behold and converse with her once more that i began now to look upon myself to be my own master but would willingly exchange that vain prerogative for the higher privilege of becoming her slave if she had not already engaged one more worthy to be commanded  she turned her eyes quick upon me with a regard of emotion and surprise but collecting herself again in an instant replied in a low and softened tone of voice that politeness afforded men great advantages because it indulged them the privilege of speaking in a kind of equivocal style which none but women who had been bred at courts could possibly have address enough to answer i replied that though galantry might possibly admit of such hollow language it had never yet obtained a currency in friendship and that if she would but grant me permission i would explain myself more explicitly upon this subject to her brother she blushed and bowed  i kissed her hand and retired  chap xl i had come down to windsor you may remember continued mr andrews in order to satisfy myself more fully about my scruples of love and honor but perhaps you may think that i had here drawn too hasty a conclusion from the premises possibly too there may appear at least as much of vanity as of generosity in this precipitation  but you will indulge me i hope in the most favorable construction on this passage by supposing rather that the strength of my own passion might have superadded a degree of evidence to here is and that having thus wrought the matter up to a moral certainty at least it would have been most indelicate besides seeming to rate my purchase too high to have required a more explicit declaration  a delicate lover will never force his mistress to a confession  she loses a good deal of her price by such a frankness and too categorical a certainty if the expression may be allowed lessens also considerably the refinement of his own pleasures there is a subordination in love of that nice and peculiar nature that if once destroyed can never be restored and the state thenceforward either becomes anarchical without any order at all or inverted by inferiors bearing sway until the avowal a woman reserves to herself the privileges of her sex but at that instant resigns her whole prerogative nature seems to have from the first endowed them with this empire and a salique law here would be dissolute rebellion the confession humbles a woman too much and a polite or prudent lover should never suffer his mistress to abate the opinion of her own value the conferring of favors preserves the whole spirit of this passion which sickens and dies away whenever they come to be challenged as a right  besides is not the confession either needless or uncertain are there not surer tokens of a passion even than words or actions is the love which declares or the one that betrays itself the strongest and is a premeditated speech or motion or an involuntary sigh or emotion the most certain sign love is the great purpose and pleasure of our lives and yet how few of either sex are capable of that economy delicacy or address which are requisite to heighten or confirm its joys by zest or permanency  chap xli the next morning i sent a card with my compliments to the family desiring to know how they all were particularly miss beville adding that i should wait on them immediately after breakfast to learn the route to my friends lodge in hertfordshire this message was answered by mr bevilles coming down to the inn and inviting me to dinner calling me doctor andrews in a laughing way and saying that his daughter had been so much recovered by my friendly visit that she would venture down stairs that day to receive me  i readily accepted the invitation but upon this condition that my patient should not be suffered to quit her apartment so suddenly for that it had often proved fatal the having mistaken spirits for strength  that as i had accidentally assumed the character of a physician i would humor the title a little farther by directing the proper meats to be sent up to her from table and should do myself the pleasure of waiting on her in the evening to drink tea feel her pulse and receive her commands to the lodge these preliminaries were agreed to and i went to dine with the father and mother at the appointed hour  i directed some broth and a little white meat to be carried up to my patient and then ordered her a large glass of wine with very little water in it which latter part of the prescription mrs beville objected to saying that it might perhaps inflame her blood as she had not tasted any thing stronger than tea for a considerable time it is for that reason i direct it said i for in all depressions of the spirits we of the faculty madam usually prescribe high cordials in order to raise a fever and then any dispensatory can point out the cure which admirable expedient saves us madam a world of trouble in certain difficult cases  we thus amused the time during dinner which i thought a most tedious meal as i was become then more impatient of returning to my charming fanny than ever i had been before i began to consider her now in a more interesting light no longer as one who might merely fill up the vacancies or amuse the intervals of life but as the sole person who was both to inspirit the business and relieve the cares of it  at once to heighten and refine its pleasures  i soon rose from table saying that like a turk i preferred coffee to wine and that a physician should always preserve his blood in an equal temperature for fear of sometimes mistaking his own pulse for his patients then taking mrs beville by the hand i led her up stairs to her daughters apartment  chap xlii miss beville was dressed with the nicest elegance and gaiety and seemed extremely recovered since the evening before both in her looks and spirits though still weak and pale i therefore in order to save her the fatigue of exerting herself to entertain me engrossed the discourse mostly to myself by repeating to her every incident which had happened to me since we parted last to which i added all the articles of news both foreign and domestic which were then current in london among the rest i related to her the story of our adventure my dear carewe said he and she wept and wondered both at the virtue and the vice of my recital  i wrought out an occasion from some part of my discourse of comparing with disadvantage all the pleasures i had experienced in london united together to the single one i had left behind me at windsor adding that even this though the same was far transcended by the present enjoyment as the total exclusion of every wandering thought of every alien scheme of pleasure had now left this favorite one at liberty to occupy my heart and mind entire  oh my dear carewe cried he out in a rapture there is somewhat in the rich endowment of a chaste womans love which exceeds all human bliss  how low is ambition how poor are riches how insipid is pleasure when void of this enlivening spirit love cannot be deemed a distinct passion but rather the informing soul of every other sentiment or affection in the human breast it refreshes labor relieves care and gives enjoyment to pleasure it not only inspirits our moral but even religion is but cold philosophy without it i ask pardon said he for this enthusiastic digression for without experience all this rapture must appear but platonic vision  my dear friend replied mr carewe you rave not to me and perhaps i may have conceived still an higher relish for such hallowed pleasures even than you as i have had an opportunity which your purity may have denied you of comparing transient and libertine joys with chaste and solid transports some minutes now passed in sighs and silence on both sides after which mr andrews thus proceeded  after tea was over continued he i offered to read to her which she accepted and i chose to take up a play as it afforded me opportunities in the love scenes of addressing myself more personally to her giving me pretenses for sometimes seizing her hand or catching her in my arms she would oppose my transports and defend herself by saying that she must certainly acquit herself but aukwardly of a part which she had never even rehearsed before to which i replied that love was a play contrary to all others where the best performers were those who had practiced least  after this cheerful and galant manner we conversed and passed away the evening together till i thought it time for my dear patient to retire to rest i then bowed and withdrew calling upon mr beville in the parlour to inform myself how to direct my course to the lodge i then retired back to the inn got up early the next morning and rode post to my friends house about four miles beyond hertford where i arrived before dinner the same day  chap xliii he was rejoiced to see me my pleasure was double i was affected with a twofold emotion both of love and friendship i asked him a number of questions about the nature of his farm his interest in it his economy in the management of it etc i questioned him after that vague and hurrying manner in which people are apt to inquire about things they have no personal concern in and received his answers with that inattention which is natural when ones mind is occupied by reflections that relate solely to themselves  after dinner we fell into a more settled and deliberate conversation i gave him an account of my scheme and conduct since our last interview i declared my passion for his sister but with that polite reserve that i did not afford the least hint of my fond suspicion about her reciprocal affection i told him of my late visit to her at windsor that i had urged my love and wishes and had happily though only in a tacit way obtained her permission to speak more fully to him upon that subject  he seemed transported at the overture and acknowledged that he had perceived a growing passion in his sisters breast toward me for some time past and that this observation had rendered him a good deal uneasy with regard to the situation of her mind as it was certain that love always produces a more powerful effect in chaste than in dissolute minds for delicacy of sentiment like the pureness of gold increases its weight while vice like alloy renders it at once both light and fragile  he concluded this reply however with this reflection that though his mind had been now made easy with regard to that particular he apprehended some difficulties in others relating to our mutual security and happiness together for my sister said he has no fortune and i am afraid that your father has as ridiculous a notion of knight errantry as ever cervantes had  i replied that this danger might be guarded against for a time by his being the only confidant in this affair until i might be able to induce my father into a settlement at least post mortem upon the merits of having provided for two of his family already and at my own expense too but that if a discovery should happen to occur before i might be fortunate enough to bring matters to a safe crisis i did not apprehend that his resentment would extend itself beyond the present emotion for that though his character was not in some things such as i could wish it yet i hoped and believed that he had proper notions of justice for that his few failings had always appeared to me to be rather faults of error than of vice upon the whole i concluded that if he would risque the hazard for his dear sister i would adventure it myself for my still dearer wife we embraced and set out the next morning for windsor  chap xliv mr beville rode up directly to his fathers house while i alighted at the inn in order to shift my dress to one more seemly for a courtier and as soon as i was equipt i followed him i found miss beville in the parlour with her mother and brother i welcomed her down stairs and wished the world joy of her returning into it again she bowed and mrs beville replied with a smile that she wished her dear fanny had been a person of higher consequence in it for my sake that the fame of the patients cure might make the doctors fortune in a short time after my friend led his mother out of the room upon some pretense or other whispering these words to me in french as he passed by lamour et loccasion  when we were thus left alone i told her that i had waited on my friend according to her permission and had entirely explained away all ambiguity of expression in my late address toward her and that in return he had given me leave to tender her in more explicit terms the future services of my life which i here madam in the fondest and most earnest manner entreat you to accept of added i taking hold of her hand and throwing myself at her feet  she raised me up with precipitation expressing these charming words at the same time that thenceforth submission should be not only her duty but her practice also which while she pronounced a crimson glow added a warmth and richness to her beauties which inspired me with the following reflection how ill advised are women who banish blushes from their cheeks they are equally ornamental to the sinner and to the saint and supply those advantages which either vanity or virtue would desire at once both charm and awe allure the lover and rebuke the libertine  just at this instant a crisis when a polite lover and a delicate mistress wish equally to be relieved from each other mrs beville returned into the room to search for some keys i took advantage of this interruption to retire on pretense of seeking out my friend and confidant whom i found in his study employed as usual in catching the flying moment to improve himself in literature or morals i acquainted him of my success expressed my gratitude for his mediation and consulted with him upon proper measures to perfect my happiness and to conceal it at the same time  i dined at mr bevilles that day and we spent the remainder of it in conversation and reading in the evening beville took his sister aside to settle preliminaries and appoint the day for our nuptials which he told her it was necessary for herself to do as the expediency of keeping the affair a secret for some time left us not at liberty to communicate it even to her father or mother  she replied that it would by no means be decent for a young woman to go upon such an errand as this without the guardianship of some matron or other and that since it was necessary which she did insist upon that some person in that character should be confided in her duty and respect both required that her dear mother should become the party beville mentioned this to me i was highly pleased with her delicacy and consented to the proposition we then desired miss beville to communicate the matter to her mother who received the proposal with joy and in a few days i was rendered completely happy  chap xlv soon after our marriage my friend returned to the lodge and invited his sister home with him on pretense of adjusting the economy of his little household making an apology to his father and mother at the same time on account of the smallness of his accommodation i took a formal leave of the family the same day and returned to london to examine into the situation of my affairs there which finding just in the same hopeless state i had left them i repaired immediately to the lodge summoned at once by love and friendship  in this charming retreat we spent some months together in the highest enjoyments of mortal bliss love friendship conversation music and letters my dear fanny was an excellent performer on the harpsichord and had a voice and taste so very expressive that she could almost turn sound into sense her brother played finely on the fiddle and i had been well practiced on the violincello what an harmony here of sound and soul  we secluded ourselves from all other society at this place except the minister of our parish whose merit you shall hear of and were attended by dumbwaiters at our meals so that we might converse of books without the imputation of pedantry and philosophize freely without giving offense to weak minds for squires were excluded from our table and servants from our sideboard  the pleasures i enjoyed in my new state of life are not to be imagined but by one who has had the happiness both to love esteem and possess a woman of sense beauty and virtue i was then sensible for the first time of my life of a certain solid and permanent joy for the happiness of marriage like the interest of money arises from a regular and established fund libertines squander the principal and so become bankrupts  i happened to rally my wife one day about her birthday elegy as i styled it upon which she smiled and said that she had quite dismissed melpomene from her toilette and called down thalia into her place adding that as there were to be none but her first and second self by bowing to her brother and me her third one being to quit the room she would communicate one of her handmaids handy works to us immediately so saying she took a paper out of her pocket threw it on the table and quick retired for her modesty was not confined to chastity alone but formed the bloom and complexion of all the words and actions of her life  ode on cupid phoebus is styled the god of wit but i his influence deny none ever the mark of fame has hit who could loves pleasing power defy the poets and the lovers rays are sparks from one congenial flame true passion must allume the blaze which warms the heart then mounts to fame twas lydias charms raised horace verse lesbia that made catullus write twas love that decked fair lauras hearse and brought the nutbrown maid to light from eloisas plaintive tongue such tender accents never had flowed nor had we wept nor had she sung but for the little purblind god ask hagleys muse i was going to supply a note upon this passage but having neglected to mention petrarch or prior when laura and emma were introduced above i thought i might for the same reason omit the name of lyttleton here  whose lovelorn tears fell melting soft as feathered snow if titans shafts have pierced our ears or cupid launched the heartfelt bow to venus son i tune the lyre who first inspired my soul to write he kindled my poetic fire and not the feebler god of light chap xlvi in order to enjoy the pleasures of this dear society without interruption or alarming my father i soon after our marriage took a large farm in the neighborhood which i set again in divisions to a considerable advantage reserving one of the enclosures in my own hands to lay out my profitrents upon about the same time my friend took some other farms also and obtained several agencies which enabled him to enlarge his house and encouraged his father to rent his employment at windsor to a deputy and remove with his wife and family to settle at the lodge  soon after this my father summoned me up to london to assist him in raising my sisters portion who had lately received a proposal from a gentleman of good fortune in surry our sole capital stock had been derived from my mother it was a sum of ten thousand pounds in the funds but her father dying when she was a child her guardian and trustee had involved it in the intricacies of the law by borrowing some money for his own use upon it before my mother had come of age  from the time of my fathers marriage to this era the difficulty about proving the trust had continued in chancery which prevented his getting an absolute dominion over the principal though the court had permitted him all along to receive the interest and though his claim became finally ascertained in the preceding term yet the time requisite to make up the decree with some other common forms or usual delays of law obliged him to borrow the money wanted upon the present occasion  this he had engaged from a banker in the city who happened to be our former acquaintance my dear carewe said he and who having conceived a good opinion of me from my former transaction with him and which he related to my father insisted upon my joining in the bond as counter security i readily concurred but when the deeds were brought to be signed i confess that i was both shocked and surprised to find that his old attorney was the person who was employed to transact this affair i hinted it to the banker and the answer he made me was that the man was perfectly acquainted with the business of his profession and that this article was all the concern he had with him but as for morals and all that stuff said he it is a mere jest in things of this sort for attorneys will be true to their clients for their own sake and what matter is it to us how they play the rogue with all the world besides were we to enter into enquiries of this kind added he what would become of half the trade of london a person may be a good man on the change who is a very bad one in his own house whores and rogues must live concluded he or the world would be too thinly peopled  i signed the deeds and returned to the country  mr beville and i gave our whole application toward the improvement of our farms which was an exercise both to body and mind equally pleasant and healthful the constant succession of business relieves the fatigues of labor and the rich and various fruits of the earth ripening one after another present us still with something new to hope or to enjoy preventing all satiety so that the farmer may say with milton all seasons and their change each please alike  chap xlvii while mr beville and i lived together at the lodge we became acquainted with the clergyman of our parish of whom i hinted to you before he was a man of sense learning and humanity a person of strict morals and exemplary piety but at the same time so easy in his manners and polite of address that all who conversed familiarly with him would have taken him for a mere man of the world the divine or philosopher never appearing but in his actions or devotions my fanny said wittily of him one day that he certainly did himself a sort of injustice by being so agreeable for that the love and esteem which his worth alone had entitled him to the whole of was by this means divided and each merit thus defrauded of half its due  his first appointment in the church was to acuracy of forty pounds a year during which time his sister was left a dowerless widow with a great number of unportioned children he immediately fled to their relief took a house to accommodate this helpless family and opened a latin school in the parish in order to maintain them  while he was laboring under these difficulties and life wasting away in celibacy some of his friends proposed the scheme of matrimony to him but he declined it saying that till he had made provision for his present children he could neither think it just or prudent to incumber himself with any future ones why man alive these children are none of your own surely  not in a natural sense indeed answered he but in a moral one i consider them in the same light children are the gift of heaven added he and since providence has thought proper to ccmmit these orphans to my charge i will like jacob endeavor to wrest a blessing from the struggle by striving to perform the duty of a parent toward them  well but doctor are there not warm widows or snug old maids enough in your parish to feather your nest withal and no danger of incumbering yourself with a second brood as you term it but gentlemen sometimes ladies he would reply i will not mock the churchs rites and to marry without a lovers wishes or a fathers hopes is the basest prostitution surely nor would i grasp anothers wealth to enrich an alien it is enough that i forego my pleasure for my charge but too much to expect that i should sacrifice my moral also  his virtue was applauded by all the bishops and afterward rewarded by a lay patron who promoted him to the benefice of that parish which is computed to be worth about five hundred pounds a year  exactly the income of the man of ross  chap xlviii his church was always crowded for there was in his manner of preaching something which caught the attention and fixed it without either action or grimace so that many passages in his sermons used to be remembered again and quoted in conversation and often urged as authorities upon more serious occasions i shall endeavor to recollect said he some of them which my fanny used to repeat for your entertainment and to make you in some sort better acquainted with our worthy pastor  the poor mans scrip is the rich mans treasury  the perception of virtue is a sixth sense  if among the questions of scholastic philosophy it should be asked what is the strongest thing in nature i should answer piety it subdues this world and wins the next  religion is not a stoical habit of penance and selfdenial but a physical regimen for pleasure and selfenjoyment  god is the spring and ocean of our thoughts and actions every wish every purpose every deed as they arise originally from him should refer finally to him whatever design though ever so virtuous falls short of that great ultimate unphilosophically makes the means the end  this reaches not up to true religion but terminates in moral heathenism only   the exercise of virtue upon the mere score of intellectual pleasure has no more merit than the practice of temperance to give a zest to epicurism as neither of them make any part of the christian religion they cannot be entitled to the promises of the gospel  to rejoice at rain without an acre of land to redeem a debtor remaining still unknown to quench the firebrand in others haggart without a boast to wrest the dagger from an assassins hand and never inform the victim the secret transport of such acts as these can never be described equal to the feeling in this sense alone stolen pleasures are sweet in any other bitter  there is a moral precept obligatory upon all mankind to do good as well as to abstain from evil suppose that all the world should refrain from absolute ill and yet perform no positive good in what state should we remain then but in reality there can never be such a supposed circumstance in society for the declining of actual virtue is the incurring of negative guilt qui succurrere perituro potest cum non succurrit occidit says seneca de beneficiis but we have an higher authority in scripture for were not the priest and levite both censured for passing over on the other side though they took no part with the assassins  it was the opinion of the stoics long before christianity that all crimes were equal and that an offense against any one moral was the same with a breach of the whole ethic can philosophy then complain against the severity of this text he who is guilty of the breach of one part of the law is guilty of the whole  epictetus in the   th chapter of the third book has these remarkable words my childrens children will bear the punishment of my disobedience and fighting against god compare with this part of the second commandment and visit the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me  chap xlix this most excellent person both ornamented and enriched our little society and my dear fanny added he with an heavy sigh seemed to receive a more particular satisfaction in his company and conversation she said to me one evening just after he had left us how amiable is virtue in the sacred character is it not remarkable that it should strike us with an higher beauty here where it must be most expected than in any of the other conditions of life where it might appear more extraordinary is it perhaps that in proportion as the deficiency of a character might offend the perfection of it may please is it not for this reason said she that modesty is most charming in woman because it is their peculiar characteristic is it that virtue seems more immediately derived from heaven in them  that in the clergy it appears inspiration in the laiety but instruction only  what an advantage continued she must such a pastor bring to morals and religion in whom the purest virtue and most exemplary piety are shown not to be inconsistent with the easiest manners of a gentleman for it is the formality of parsons and the stiffness of mere good men which disgust the world and not their strictness or sanctity all which she concluded with this ingenious allusion that as matter endued only with its necessary properties would be a lifeless mass of uniformity so virtue without manners would be as morally unamiable  the intervals of all these transactions which i have recited to you are not at all material and indeed continued he sighing though i have dwelt long with pleasure upon the former part of my relation i shall now make amends by shortening the sad remainder of it the principal event of which i shall comprehend in the exclamation of brutus  portia is dead  he attempted to pronounce this sentence in the spirit of ancient philosophy but he was no actor and few as the words were his heart if i may use the expression failed him in the middle of them a torrent of fond and grateful tears gushed suddenly to her memory a generous sympathy affected mr carewe and mr beville coming just then into the room quick joined a brothers sorrow to an husbands grief  chap l mr carewe in order to change the subject and give a new turn to their thoughts asked mr beville what general news he had brought home from scarborough and what adventure had detained him so much longer in town that day than usual he replied that every thing of a public concern was comprehended in the london prints which he took out of his pocket and that he was delayed by taking leave of some friends of his who were setting out from scarborough for the york races which had carried off most of the company out of town and left the rooms extremely thin  suppose said mr carewe to mr andrews that you and i should accompany our friend in his walk tomorrow it will serve to shift the scene a little and diversify our ideas the emptiness of the place continued he will be lucky enough for you but for my own part i would be content to bear a little more crowding for a little more company tomorrow  why truly i could be satisfied with it myself too replied mr andrews upon your account for i would sacrifice my own ease to a friends pleasure at any time nay i will do more for you added he i will sacrifice even my pleasure to yours also by setting you at liberty to go off to the races tomorrow and mr beville i hope will be so kind as to accompany you thither for a few days as i really think that both his health and mind require a little more exercise and amusement than he takes or can possibly meet with at the farm beville bowed assent toward carewe  no gentlemen replied mr carewe  but first let me thank ye both for your politeness upon this occasion however as well as i love company i would not ride thirty miles to seek it in a crowd besides your sentiments upon horseracing said he to mr andrews have much abated my relish for that sport which i confess i was formerly very fond of as in truth i was once of every thing that had gaiety spirit and hurry in it  formerly and once upon a time you should have added my dear carewe replied mr andrews these are expressions too antiquated to be uttered by a young handsome fellow of five and twenty oh my dear friend answered mr carewe with a sigh and grasping his hand at the same time you have loved  and must therefore know that true passion renders us philosophers to all other pleasures and an eunuch to every other desire  the starting of this subject sent each of the three friends home to their own thoughts for the rest of the day which not supplying us with any thing to entertain the reader who is i assure you my principal concern throughout this work i shall conclude this chapter with just acquainting him that they read the newspapers conversed upon general topics till supper made a slight repast and then retired to bed  chap li the next morning mr beville called upon his two friends to take a walk with him to scarborough according to the purpose of the night before but their spirit for the frolic had subsided in sleep and they suffered mr beville to pursue his course alone after breakfast mr andrews led his friend to take a walk with him along the sea beach and thus reassumed his memoir  i had brought my story to a short period yesterday morning continued mr andrews for two reasons the first because it gave me pain to dwell for any time upon a circumstance that whatever has already or may hereafter befall me of loss or sorrow i may venture to style by way of eminence the only misfortune of my life and next that as i had turned toward the window to hide my eyes from from yours i perceived mr beville coming up the avenue and i would spare his grief as well as my own  but as there remain some particulars yet to be mentioned to complete my own history i shall relate the last article again more at large during our present leisure and the sorrows which it must necessarily renew will in some sort be relieved by the pride and pleasure i shall at once receive in letting you a little farther into the beauty and delicacy of that amiable woman my lost fannys character  our marriage had been kept still a secret from her father till my wife had become with child and as he then lived in the house with us it was not possible at least my nicety about her same rendered it improper to make a mystery of it to him any longer and he was therefore admitted to be a member of our privy council he received the news but coolly he was naturally warm and proud he at first resented his not having been made a confidant from the beginning and then seemed mortified at the necessity his daughter was reduced to of carrying on a clandestine commerce to the hazard of her reputation and the humiliation of his own pride  he had a precipitate manner of resolving and acting he took his resolution on the instant and without communicating his design wrote a letter that very evening to my father informing him of our marriage saying that he had been a perfect stranger to it himself until a few hours before adding that he had already pardoned the breach of duty on his daughters part hoping that he might do the same on his sons and concluded his letter with saying that he would readily join his interest with my fathers to compass some preferment or civil employ for me to make amends for his daughters want of fortune which he with justice indeed affirmed to be the only merit in which she could be deemed deficient  to this indiscreet epistle he received no answer but i did my father enclosed it back again to me with a few lines in the cover declaring that he had that day made and perfected his will and had cut me entirely out from all chance of inheritance for ever of any part of his present or future fortunes  chap lii i happened to be at my farm when the post came in and as i had always indulged my dearest fanny in the amusement of opening my letters in my absence she had the unhappiness of receiving this shock which i would have saved her from as long as it might have been in my power if the letter had fallen first into my hands  when i returned to the lodge that day i perceived a remarkable alteration in her countenance though she received me with the same tenderness as usual i appeared alarmed and taking her fondly by the hand asked her with some emotion whether she had been taken ill during my absence the softness of my manners affected her she fell into tears and took the letters out of her pocket i read them hastily over and after making this short reflection that the indiscretion of a friend may sometimes do one as much mischief as the malice of an enemy i caught her eagerly in my arms crying out with hope and fondness that heaven had for virtue more fathers than one  we then agreed not to mention any thing of this affair to her father or mother in order to preserve peace and harmony at home her brother had been accidentally made acquainted with it before as he happened to be by when she opened the letters and snatched them up as they fell from her trembling hand i endeavored to reassure her spirits for the present by this philosophical reflection that as i had long despaired of any manner of assistance from my father during his life it was too soon to grieve till we should first feel the effects of his resentment  such turns of thought as this have frequently assisted me to parry or postpone several uneasinesses in life but my dear fanny had not the least particle of stoicism in all her composition she was all delicacy feeling and sentiment this event therefore preyed constantly on her spirits and finally affected her health and mine also in a great measure along with it for though i am an excellent philosopher for myself i am the worst in the world for another my mind indeed is masculine but my heart of the true feminine gender my sympathy is stronger than my nerves and i feel misfortunes as one does heat weak in the direct line but forcibly from reflection  chap liii she labored under a depression of spirits till she delivered a son to my arms and then fell into a fever from which however she recovered but with so slow a progress that i was alarmed about her declining into a decay and to increase the danger of which her fond mother her first connection in life both of duty and affection expired in her arms of a disorder she had contracted by her constant watchings and assiduous attendance upon her beloved child during the course of her late and present illness  about this time mr beville the father received an account from windsor that his deputy had failed and imbezzled his revenues which obliged him to return and try what measures he could pursue in order to vindicate his right and recover his employ again my wife remained with her brother who spared no manner of expense in physicians or medicine for the reestablishment of her health while i did every thing on my part that tenderness love and duty could suggest to assist her remedies and expedite her cure for oh i loved her to the last moment of her existence with tenfold the ardour with which i first received her virgin sacrifice to my longing arms for where true virtuous passion is the torch of hymen but singes the wings of cupid and anneals his arrows  our difficulties were soon after considerably increased by the falling away of bevilles agencies one after another by minors coming of age and others for whom he was employed returning from abroad to reside upon their own estates while in the midst of these streights and gloomy prospects my family was increased by the birth of a daughter which threw the dear mother back again into her former weakness from which she had for some little time appeared to be tolerably well recovered  just at this interval her aunt by the mothers side became a widow with a good jointure she had been made acquainted with our marriage as soon as the veil of secrecy had been withdrawn and as she lived within twenty miles of our residence we had had frequent intercourse of visits while my dear wife was able to ride abroad  soon after her husbands death i waited upon her to pay my compliments of condolance and on my informing her of our apprehensions about her nieces relapse and danger she very kindly offered to carry her with her to spa whither she was advised to repair immediately on account of her daughter and only child a very handsome young woman about twenty years of age who had been for some time in a very precarious state of health  i expressed my thanks in the most grateful and affectionate manner and returned directly to the lodge to acquaint my dear wife of this kind and opportune invitation she at first declined accepting of it but after some reluctance and her being informed by her physicians that those waters were absolutely necessary toward the recovery of her health with a religious exhortation too upon this subject from her favorite divine she was at length prevailed upon to prepare for her journey  in a few days after her aunt and cousin called upon her  i put her into the coach  i saw her then for the last time  chap live i returned to her apartment threw myself on the bed and felt infinitely more wretched than at any interval of my confinement in the compter for now i had her life to fear for as my eyes wandered about the room i perceived a manuscript paper lying on her table which apprehending to be some necessary memorandums she had forgot to take with her i hastily arose read kissed and wept over the following lines  a soliloquy i have been the child of sorrow or of care ever since my first reflections dawn my heart was early taught to melt at others woe by feelings of its own in my first spring of youth i sought for wisdom and dulled the roseate bloom upon my cheek by searching for her sacred lore the midnight taper often has been extinguished by the radiant sun which found my sleepless eyes unwearied  yet then did vanity intrude and youthful spirits mounting to my heart whispered that all this philosophic pride was fruitless the means were pleasant but the end was endless and that in love alone was happiness supreme the trial soon was made  i loved and was beloved again but oh what anguish did that passion cost my timorous heart fear entered with it and held the alternate empire of my breast for many a tedious day without the latter how unsafe the first and with it what a slavery to sustain  at length what can be found of happiness in love was mine the object of my choice with generous tenderness and reciprocal flame approved me his and left me no ambition sorrow and fear now vanished for a while but to return with allied strength attended by pale poverty they came and to extend their cruel power have with a double barbed arrow pierced me for on their iron darts are graved the tender names of husband and of children  how then can i defend my unshielded heart or vindicate the empire of my soul when these dear ties the nearest and the best give added force to every wound and rise auxiliaries against me yet sure there is a strength superior still to theirs and oh endow me with it heaven a resignation to thy allwise decrees a calm dependence on thy paternal providence and grace to say thy will my god not mine be done amen  f a  chap lv enter mr beville in a hurry beville the chidren are come   andrews springing from his seat my children   carewe let us fly to embrace them   exeunt a b and c manent triglyph and the reader read pray now sir shall not we follow them too and have the pleasure of seeing the dear little prateapaces also which i must confess i long to do extremely from the affection and esteem you have taught me to conceive for their father and mother   tri i do not choose it at present sir and i will tell you why i have been all my life afflicted with a certain praecordial weakness which the cabletonians before mentioned style nervous see the last note chapter xxxv  i saw mr andrews and his children meet once  that was enough for my disorder believe me mr reader that for all the money i expect to make of you and your whole fraternity i would not review such another scene  to see the storge to perceive the workings of the father when he placed little harry on his knee but the looks the emotions the tears when he snatched up la petite fanchon in his arms so like her mother eternity i have bought you with her loss  and then we should be plagued at the same time also with the nonsense of the nurse this is daddys eye and that is mammys lip this is daddys this thing and that is mammys the other thing now master harry walk up strait to your uncle there  ah mr beville isnt he the very gunterpart of his father and miss fanny too pray hold up your head miss and drop a daisy there for the gentleman  the mothers air as i am a sinner to a tilly    read you are a whimsical man mr triglyph and shift so suddenly sometimes from serious to comical that i declare one does not know how to accommodate themselves to your humor for you possess a certain art of setting the upper part of the face a crying and the lower a laughing so histerically at the same time that i am sure i must at this instant make as drole an appearance as a whipped school boy eating a tart while tears with syrup mixed run down his chaps together   tri indeed sir you happen to mistake both my talent and my character my cast is entirely grave nor do i mean to jest even in those parts of my writings where i sometimes speak in humourous images but i happened to have learned my philosophy in the porch of democritus and it is a certain though a ridiculous truth that after one has been taught to laugh at the follies of mankind it becomes morally impossible for him ever after to preserve a serious countenance but then mr reader this is not mirth nor is my moral the less severe upon this account for human frailties do not divert but tickle me and extort a smile through pain   chap lvi the next morning mr beville staid from scarborough to play with the children and mr andrews was as great a romp as the rest but lest this particular might be apt to sink the characters of these philosophic gentlemen with a certain class of readers i think proper to acquaint them that agesilaus used frequently to amuse himself with riding hobbyhorses with his children in the nursery some have hobbyhorses and others have hobbyasses  mr carewe assisted in the tumult for a while but not being actuated by the same parental feelings his spirit soon began to flag and he retired alone to the seashore where he spent the rest of the morning in walking with folded arms and musing in deep melancholy till he was called in to dinner  there was something in this charming young mans distress that had a nobleness a generosity a virtue in it which in my opinion must interest the mind even more than the misfortunes of either mr andrews or mr beville for i shall just hint here that the latter had some to lament distinct from those of the former but the reader must suspend his curiosity about these matters till the regular course of this history shall in their proper places introduce the several stories both of mr beville and mr carewe  their conversations for the rest of that day and indeed all their evening entertainments were extremely ingenious and polite i must confess that i have been several times tempted to interrupt the narrative in many places where i thought that i could make the reader sufficient amends by introducing him to amusements of a more refined nature but those who may have a true relish for such reading as this might afford them will be perfectly capable of imagining to themselves in a more lively manner than i could possibly represent it what an elegant and elevated society three such persons of talents virtue literature and taste whose minds had been softened by adversity and disappointments and who were mutual friends to each other must be capable of forming together o noctes caenaeque deum  and as for the rest of my readers who may not have been blessed with a genius for such delicate enjoyments they will very readily excuse the interludes in order to pass more immediately on to the catastrophe of the action i shall therefore suffer the representation to proceed without intermission except where i shall think that any of the passages in the story may need to be illustrated or explained  the next morning every thing went on as usual mr beville walked away to scarborough the two other friends retired themselves after breakfast into the library and mr andrews thus pursued his adventures in context with those of mr beville  chap lvii about a year before this event my worthy friend mr beville who though a reading and contemplative man had a great spirit for adventure had engaged himself in a certain manufacture in order to carry on which with effect it was necessary to borrow a considerable sum of money and for which purpose i recommended him to our old banker before mentioned my dear carewe who in order to judge of his security sent his same attorney down into the country who staid a week with us to inquire into the circumstances of mr bevilles fortune the interest of his farms the nature and progress of the manufacture with the responsibility of his character about all which particulars having received sufficient satisfaction he drew up the deeds paid the money for his client and returned back to london  while he remained with us in the country he appeared extremely pleased with all the improvements made both upon mr bevilles farms and mine but said that it was a pity they were not held jointly by the same tenant for as one was moist and the other dry they would yield a double profit and convenience together to the value of both separately occupied  he seemed to be charmed with the situation of the lodge the gardens orchards fish ponds and the accommodation of his offices and said that it would be an happy scene of retirement for any wearied citizen from the hurry and bustle of a town there to pass in peace and religion the remainder of his days rejoicing in the fruits of honest industry and enjoying the fullness of a wellearned fortune  some time after my dear wife had gone off to spa leaving her brother and me in the highest of human afflictions despairing from the many symptoms of her disorder with some dark expressions dropped by her physicians of ever seeing a person return to us again whom we so tenderly loved and so deservedly esteemed we received a private intimation one day from the sheriff of our county that executions against our bodies goods and lands had been lodged in his office that morning by the bankers attorney aforesaid  we then both of us too late perceived the unguarded weakness of putting ourselves or fortunes into the power of a person who lay under the dangerous and wicked influence of one whose malice and revenge we had reason to apprehend might have instigated his avarice and extortion to injure and oppress us but we soon exchanged reflection for action having but just time enough to secure our persons from arrest by flying up to london together with what bills and cash we could muster up between us at that time and of which we made one common purse amounting to about an hundred pounds  chap lviii our farms stock and furniture were soon after put up to sale and in these difficulties we  nonnulla desunt   the above hiatus shall be supplied in the second or third edition for there is a peculiar nicety in this article which requires some time to be able to accommodate for public view  biographer triglyph    i wrote also to my father continued mr andrews entreating that he would take some speedy measures to stop the execution and relieve my slight and unpatrimonial fortune from the heavy weight of a family debt which rested solely upon him to provide for this letter i sent to him by his own attorney who informed him likewise of the bankers malice in this affair  his answer was perfectly calm and temperate for he was a great philosopher in his own way he replied that i had very romantic notions in some things but vulgar ordinary ones in others that my first dealings with the banker and my marriage were instances of the former and the seeming now to consider my sisters portion for whom i was by the laws of reason and virtue equally obliged to provide as his sole debt was an instance of the latter but that as the laws of the land had made the same distinction that i did i was welcome to recover the debt against him as soon as i should have discharged it myself and had the judgments assigned over to me by which time he hoped by the finishing of his own suit to be in a condition to answer mine  multa desiderantur   here the three following chapters in which are contained some curious anecdotes must sleep some time in manuscript for the reason already given above so i shall pass on to  chap lxii after these disappointments i wrote to the principal tenant on my own farm to come up to town and give us an account of the transactions which had passed in the country with regard to our unhappy affairs he was an intelligent person and had attended the sheriffs sale both of poor bevilles effects and mine he told us that every thing had gone off at a third or fourth of their value as they always do upon such unhappy occasions except my wifes picture and mine which having been bid for by our honest friend the clergyman dropping some indiscreet expressions of regard at the same time were raised upon him to a considerable price by the attorney who was present at the sale and took the hint from his earnestness  he then added a large encomium upon our friend and concluded with an expression the simplicity of which forced a smile from both beville and me even in the midst of our distress that the doctor was certainly a primitive christian if ever there was one he told us also that the attorney had purchased the interests of both our farms at a very trifing value as the subsheriff immediately declared the sale as soon as he began to bid for them  i settled accounts with this man for his rent and the balance in my favor which was forty pounds i directed him to pay into the hands of his worthy pastor to whom i also wrote a letter of thanks begging him to keep that deposit in his hands to defray the current expenses of my dear childrens nursing who were rearing in his parish i offered him the money he had paid for the pictures and told him where he might find us incog if his occasions should summon him up to london before we might have determined upon any scheme of life or rather of living  about a week after a carrier called at our lodgings left a letter for me with a large deal box and went away directly without waiting either for payment or an answer the letter was from our friend the clergyman and i give it to you here to read added he just as i received it excepting a bill for forty pounds which was enclosed in it mr carewe took the letter and read dear sir according to your order i have received the money from your tenant which i take the liberty of returning into your hands again because i think that you are a much fitter trustee for your children than i can be besides as their nurse is my tenant it will be time enough in all reason to discharge her wages when i call upon you for them  i have also sent up the portraits you desire but must beg the favor of being excused from accepting payment for them did i part wholly with these dear relicts i might perhaps be induced to settle a more sterling account with you on this article but while you entrust the living miniatures of these prized originals to my care i shall by looking steadfastly to that precious charge be overpaid for parting with these faint resemblances  pray make my most affectionate compliments to my amiable friend mr beville and here let me most cordially entreat you both that as soon as the situation of your affairs may admit of your returning into this country you will both of you accept of my roof till you shall be able to establish yourselves in some happier scheme of life for by assisting me in my endeavors for the good of mankind you will be justly entitled to a right of sharing that income which providence and the church have vested in my hands for no other purposes  adieu    chap lxiii after mr carewe had made proper reflections upon the polite address and truly christian spirit of this letter mr andrews reassuming his story with an heavy sigh a flowing tear and hesitating voice i am arrived now said he to the last period of my life  to my first death at least  to the last event that can ever be of moment to me hereafter except so far as i have revived again in my dear children and renewed my fondness on those living relicts  i wrote every packet to my dear fanny but without giving her the least account of our misfortune for fear of disturbing her mind in the present state of her body and had received some letters from her in which she informed me that she had got a severe cold in her voyage which had greatly increased her disorder but that the physicians at spa had put her into a regimen and that she would do every thing in her power to keep up her spirits and assist her medicines  in the midst of these difficulties while poor beville and i remained in privacy together mutually assisting each others philosophy by moral reasonings and religious arguments scheming from day to day some new project or untried adventure toward rescuing us from our present forlorn condition i received a letter from our aunt at spa that my dear fannys cold had fallen so heavy on her already exhausted strength and spirits that the physicians had almost despaired of her recovery  the next packet brought me a black seal  chap lxiv as mr andrews will not be inclined for some minutes at least to continue the remainder and less interesting part of his story i shall make use of this interval to verify the authenticity of these memoirs by observing to the reader that no writer in the world who had either sense taste humanity or virtue could possibly think of dispatching the amiable mrs andrews off the stage so abruptly without bringing about any other catastrophe but her own to be at such expense of beauty wit sentiment love and delicacy merely to render a man of worth miserable during his surviving life sed parcae vocant the relentless fates have snatched her from us and the severity of history admits of no redemption  you have now before you two unhappy men of virtue and merit laboring under a complication of misfortunes which so far from having been incurred by any vice or folly of their own were brought upon them rather by their very sense and virtue and therefore may more properly be styled afflictions by way of contradistinguishing them from inflictions being such as neither forecast could foresee nor prudence might prevent  the changes of this life have been frequently observed to be so extraordinary so contrary to the allowed designs of providence so much beyond even the mere fortuitousness of events that the ancients were induced to worship a deity under the title of fortune quite distinct from providence an intelligence of caprice only  i think it was a goddess timoleon built a temple and dedicated it to her   thus one man shall be attended with a constant series of success during his whole life quibus dormientibus dii omnia conficiunt while another employing the same means diligence and virtue shall be unlucky through the whole course of his some are fortunate or unfortunate during certain periods of time and the changes are seen frequently to shift without any manner of alteration in the persons own conduct even at play where every thing seems to be left to blind hazard alone how often have we seen ill luck stick to one particular seat for a whole evening together while at other times it has pursued one person quite round the table in spite of all the shifting cutting and shuffling of the night  this subject has just now brought to my memory a speech that i once heard pronounced by a certain fellow of a certain college as he was commonplacing on the changes and chances of this mortal life at the university single misfortunes said he seldom come alone and the greatest of evils are attended by greater this person was afterward made a bishop and died an archbishop must it not be to chance alone for it was not in gotham that he owed his preferment  chap lxv poor beville continued mr andrews restrained his sorrow and did every thing in the power of good sense religion and friendship to strengthen my mind and support my spirits under our mutual calamity while i in tenderness to him used to turn aside to mourn and endeavor to conceal a womans heart under a stoics mask and this generous attention toward each others grief was of more real service to us both than all the bravery of philosophy  but one day after i had brought myself tolerably well to the preserving of appearances at least an unlucky incident happened to occur which occasioned me to relapse again into all my former indecencies after dinner mr beville drank off a glass of wine to my health and taking me by the hand at the same time dear brother said he this is your birthday  the first expression conjured up almost to view my blushing fanny in her bridal robes and the last brought instantly to my mind that triumphant that transporting scene which i had exulted in at windsor upon such another era memory like lightning shot quick through every interval of bliss till the last fatal close my spirits were hurried on too fast i grew sick my manhood failed me i fainted suddenly into my friends arms  when he had recovered me to sense again i just hinted to him without daring to dwell upon it the groupe of thoughts which had overpowered me he lamented his expression though innocent and we passed the remainder of the evening together in mutual silence sighs and tears  we immediately removed the wine after my emotion being both of us of opinion as well from our own experience as from a general observation upon others that there never was a more fallacious maxim than that which has been too often imposed upon the already too unhappy that wine is serviceable to banish care when the body is oppressed by fatigue sickness or pain high cordials may relieve or assuage but where the mind has caught the infection water is our safest potion wine but augments the disposition it encounters sinks dullness into stupidity raises mirth into madness and aggravates melancholy to despair  chap lxvi toward the hour of rest having composed my spirits a little a kind of parallel still running in my mind between the two birthdays i took the pen and wrote these lines said he opening his pocketbook and presenting a paper to mr carewe which you will find to be expressed in the very same gloomy strain of thought and sentiment with those i repeated to you before of my dear fannys  on my birthday on each revolving year i am pleased to see that hour approaching which by fates decree is doomed the last of my mortality life is a race still verging to a post which he who soonest reaches gains the most but if precipitate the prize is lost compare this line with the last of those upon the same subject in chapter xxxviii but till relieved must not retreat  men should with years as hosts do at a feast welcome the coming speed the going guest till night comes on and then rejoice in rest then farewell nonage welcome ripened years which but emancipate and make us heirs instead of earthly of celestial spheres i could not close my eyes all night and the next morning i found myself in an high fever i continued ill for about three weeks ten days of which my life was despaired of during the whole time mr beville lay on a pallet by my bedside and our worthy friend the clergyman upon receiving an account of my danger by a letter from mr beville came up immediately to london and staid in town till i was quite recovered visiting praying and reading by me every day  how often and how ardently my dear carewe continued he have both mr beville and i wished for the high relief of your friendly converse during our confinement here but i knew not where to enquire for you nor dared i venture abroad to search for you in coffeehouses or on the public walks  and this restraint was perhaps not the least part of my difficulties in this situation for so great is my love of liberty that though i seldom stir from home and usually through choice pass most part of my time in my study i believe that there are few persons alive who can brook imposed confinement less than i could  chap lxvii the clergyman remained in town for a few days after my recovery he had taken a lodging near ours and spent most part of his time with us among other subjects of conversation happening to speak about our late misfortune in the country he told mr beville that as is generally the way a few pitied his distress but many blamed his conduct for with mankind said he it is crime enough to be unfortunate and in your present unhappy circumstances censure has pursued you even for merits because unsuccessful  this is by no means uncommon replied beville for the world like women never pardon an attempt  if you fail  but prithee dear sir said he what are the charges produced against me and in what particulars is my conduct reproached in the country  why in the first place answered the clergyman that you turned your mind to extravagant projects animum habuit semper ingentia semper infinita expetentem secondly that you had once an opportunity of establishing your fortunes by the management as they term it of seven or eight thousand pounds a year his agencies  and yet have nothing to show for it as is the expression and lastly that you have lived above your fortune till you finally ruined it  in answer to the first of these indictments replied mr beville i hope it will be accepted as a sufficient plea that as i never had patrimony profession trade or employ my life of necessity must have been a life of adventure project or starve was certainly in this case my motto in such a situation as mine to live itself required a scheme  necessitas ante rationem for life has long since ceased to be a sinecure  spontaneous fruits rise not at present from the earth as in the garden nor does manna now drop from the heavens as in the wilderness  with regard to the second charge i do confess that i have known many persons thrive forgive the expression here upon far less advantages who have raised fortunes by purchasing some their neighbors some their employers estates and sprung from dungcarts into a coach and six all this indeed i know to be true  i had like to have said too true  too true alas for themselves i fear  to take advantage of one mans misfortunes to overreach anothers weakness to wring from the hard hand of peasants their vile trash by any indirection were arts my pride disdained my moral started at i have a sympathy in my nature which like the cameleons hue catches the complexion of occurring objects  i rejoice and mourn for feelings not my own  what should i gain then by anothers distress when by augmenting his i must increase my own with what a ravening hunger must that wretch be seized who eats one morsel in anothers wrong i should deem myself unhappy to have inherited a fortune so dearly earned  how much more wretched then to be the guilty purchaser yet much i fear there are who could revel in a sacked city and reckon plunder among the goods of fortune  the last objection said he i need give but a short answer to  it has been urged that i have lived above my fortune  but in reality i never did i never could do so i never had any  i have therefore only lived above no fortune which the most thrifty person alive must do in like circumstances  i entered the world  i must repeat it  without patrimony profession trade or emyloy i have unportioned and unpensioned maintained the post and character of a gentleman ever since i have entered into life and had i not experienced the misers gripe had i not felt oppressions weight i could now walk uncaptioned on the exchange with a thousand pounds in my pocket let any man first show a better economy and he shall then be free to censure mine  i cannot choose my life continued he all that rests upon me is to make the best of it as it occurs my desires are reasonable  above dependence but below ambition and i despair not of providence should even this whole world fail me my hopes remain unabated still nay rise in measure to my disappointments here the business of life is so to live as not to fear to die this once secured anxiety is over  the rest be heavens care amen  chap lxviii mr carewe appeared charmed with the spirit and virtue of mr bevilles justification and acknowledged to mr andrews that the generous warmth with which that gentleman had expressed himself upon this occasion had stamped an higher character for him in his mind than any thing he had yet seen or heard of him till then had been able to raise  in fine said he i think that both he and you have revived the credit of the ancient philosophy and restored to poverty its former dignity in your single and singular characters regum aequabat opes animis i wish you could also added he bring back the golden patronage as happily that some pollio or macaenas might seek you out amidst sequestered groves and beckon modest merit from the shade in the mean time as pliny says est quidam vera felicitas felicitate dignum videri  mr andrews bowed and returned him equal thanks for his encomiums both upon his friend and himself and then replied that he had never considered poverty in the abject light that the world is too apt to do there are two sorts of pride said he with regard to this point one the ancient and philosophy spirit which chose and gloried in it the other the modern and beggarly one that avoids and is ashamed of it  but poverty in itself is so far from being mean that it requires certain accidents to render it so ignoble birth servile office low condescensions vulgar manners dishonest actions or poorness of spirit any of these particulars indeed may debase poverty to meanness but will they not at the same time diminish the grandeur of riches  poverty continued he hurts our credit only on the change yet even there character alone has raised a fortune but considered singly excludes us not from a court the opulence of plato enriched not his philosophy but the indigence of socrates has reflected a luster upon his is there then a soul so poor as not to prefer a pedigree from the latter to the whole lineage of attalus  just as mr andrews had finished this expression mr beville and the children came rioting into the room to acquaint them that dinner was on the table they passed the remainder of this day more cheerfully together than any of the former except a sigh or furtive tear which would often escape involuntarily from andrews and sometimes from beville also  chap lxix here give me leave mr reader to offer you a further proof of the authenticity of these memoirs from an observation i shall make upon some parts of the two preceding chapters and first there is a very obvious personality perceivable in the warmth feeling and lively resentment which mr beville has expressed in his defense so different from the natural coldness of composition that must certainly to a critic manifest some real and peculiar adaption in it and sufficiently evince these writings to be genuine  but the particular which most eminently points out the ingenuousness of this whole performance is the high encomiums which mr carewe bestows upon the characters of both mr andrews and mr beville supposing this triumvirate to be three real and distinct persons such politeness might very fairly have passed between ingenious persons and friends but upon the hypothesis of its being merely a novel where every thing that is said in whatsoever character is to be directly imputed to the author such selfapplause admissible in no case whatever except the testimony of a clear conscience would certainly be most abominable  for though the commendatory verses which one often sees prefixed to the works of several modern writers seem to savor a good deal of this vanity yet still they are but the compliments of others though published by themselves and notwithstanding the express eulogies which some of the ancients have left us of their own works as the non usitata nec tenui ferar penna biformis per liquidum aethera vates  of horace the exegi monumentum aere perennius regalique situ pyramidum altius of ditto the jamque opus exegi quod nec jovis ira nec ignes nec poterit ferrum nec edax abolere vetustas of ovid what hesiod tells us that the muses had given him a white wand and a branch of laurel had breathed into him a divine song and taught him to celebrate things past and prophesy things to come what homer in his hymn to apollo boasts of that when it shall be inquired who is the sweetest singer among men you may make answer dictating to the god it is the blind bard who dwells in chios and whose songs excel all human harmony nay even the modest virgil has his ille ego too with other similar passages of flattering authority might seem to warrant a presumption of this kind yet these are to be considered as prophetical vaunts or poetical licenses only which have never yet been indulged to vulgar prose and therefore can by no means be justified in an humble writer of simple memoirs who pretends not the least claim to inspiration of any kind for i speak as i think and i think as i please  chap lxx just about this crisis and after an interval of five years silence i received the following letter by post directed to my fathers from my old acquaintance and condisciple whom i mentioned to you before dear andrews cried mr carewe you cannot imagine what pleasure it gives me to have that careless lively fellow brought upon the stage once more he comes in critically here too said he to relieve your mind and give a new turn to your thoughts and will at the same time treat me too with a little variety and satisfy my longing to be somewhat farther acquainted with this irregular genius but the letter the letter  the letter old friend i may well call you so for it really seems an age since we parted i never forgot you however but thought of you as often as i could of any thing in the dissipated kind of life i have ever since led it was what you would have styled perfect squirely  but i have lately taken one thought into my head that will probably last for life and am very busy at present in collecting my scattered affections together to place them all upon a single object  in fine i am to be married without reprieve on the tenth day of next month and as it is usual for the dearest connections to attend the departure of a friend i entreat the favor of your flying to me directly on the receipt of this summons to accompany me at my approaching execution  here now i expect that you will throw one of your systems at my head what to open the solemn nuptial scene at once without an amorous prologue but methinks in this instance i act the philosophers part better than you would do  you guided by your passion  i governed by my reason i wanted her fortune to improve my estate and her alliance to strengthen my interest  the deeds are engrossing and i expect you  adieu p s my affectionate compliments attend our windsor friend will beville and i beg the favor of him to accept this postscript as an invitation to afford me the pleasure of his company along with you       the same man still i find said mr carewe not the least alteration replied mr andrews on the receipt of this letter my former fondness for him began to revive i needed exercise and amusement myself in my then weak and solitary state and was also pleased at an opportunity of releasing poor mr beville from his heavy confinement so we both of us agreed in his own phrase to attend him took leave of our amiable friend the clergyman and accordingly set out together in about a week after the receipt of this letter  chap lxxi he received us with his usual briskness and seemed particularly pleased to see me his character ran through his whole economy his living was extempore a market at six miles distance supplied him with every thing in his house and his demesne was overrun with deer and horses within all hurry and no order and without a number of improvements begun but nothing finished  for his way was whenever he resolved upon any thing he immediately commenced it and if any other whim came into his head before he had completed the first he took off his hands directly to enter upon that also for fear he should forget it so that his whole demesne was but a confused heap of memorandums and might not improperly be styled notes for improvements  before his house was laid out a mile avenue of fifty yards long behind it a caspian sea with an hogshead of water in it on one side was an obelisk three feet high and on the other a rialto of half an arch his garden was but half enclosed in one corner of which stood the four seasons huddled together in a groupe as in the chaos and in the midst of them were seen time and a sundial lying in wait for their pedestals  i found my friend much impaired since i last saw him both in his looks health and manners his face was emaciated his hand shook and instead of that free disengaged air which used to give the grace of youth and fashion to all his words and actions he had contracted a stiffness in his gesture a constraint in his address and a certain mediocrite throughout his whole appearance  i essayed him a little upon literary topics but he soon cut me short by acknowledging that he had not read one crabbed line as he termed it ever since we had parted and why after all said he should we idle away our time after the concerns of the past world when the present supplies us with sufficient occupation for our whole lives i perfectly agree with you my dear friend replied i that the current world may very wisely employ the full measure of our time provided that we consider it not as a distinct interval but as a commencement of the next  i know doctor said he smiling on me that theological philosophy is always for blending of systems but i hope that i do not separate these two myself when i declare that i take the whole duty of man both absolutely and relatively considered to consist in these three things fear god honor the king and pay twenty shillings in the pound which in my opinion added he fully comprehend the scope of all our religious civil and moral obligations  beville and i strolled into his study the morning after our arrival and took a survey of his books they were but few about a dozen volumes of plays novels and miscellanies boltons justice with hobbes woolstons tindals and chubbs works shaftsburys characteristics and bolingbrokes philosophical writings composed his whole library  at length the nuptial morn arrived our friend dressed himself in the gayest manner for the occasion and we all took coach together to wait upon the bride  to commence that fatal course of the supremest bliss or deepest misery  chap lxxii we got thither about two oclock at noon and were accosted with a great deal of rustic hospitality by the parent squire and two familiar cousins of the family sack and cakes were immediately called for and the father filling up an halfpint rummer presented it to the bridegroom crying pop down this primer my young soldier for a man must make but a feeble assault on it that has not a dram of courage in him ha ha ha good good damned good that cried the cousins  my friend excused himself from the draught saying that he needed no such auxiliary that he should not be found bashful on the field of battle that he had seen pharsalia etc pharsalia pharsalia cried the old gentleman why that is not my wenchs name do you mind me she was christened ethelinda i remember very well  her godmother was an old romantic maiden lady and had picked up that unchristian name out of some heathenish book or other  that may be sir said i winking at my friend but lovers claim an ancient privilege styled poetica licentia of giving their mistresses a sort of poetical baptism and of borrowing names from history or romance  very good very good replied the squire but prithee says he who was this same  what is the word pharsalia replied i ay this same pharsalia that i find is now become my daughters nickname  that is a name replied i well known in ancient story at whose relentless feet many thousands have died in strife to win her a cruel jade a cruel jade quoth the squire  the beauties of your outlandish times continued he were terrible people terrible people indeed sir but thank our stars they are all of them distinct now dead and gone and rotten too for all their conceit i dare say long before this and there is no dying for love nowadays not in the least not in the least sirs no more dying for love i assure you gentlemen so my gallants you may set your hearts at rest for the future believe me ha ha ha  dont you think continued he addressing himself more particularly to me that we are much wiser now than your old people were formerly i cannot tell sir said i for i never was in company with any of them and i never pretend to judge of persons characters by hearsay  very right very right good sir replied the squire as they are not heretofore to answer for themselves it would not be quite fair to be too hard upon them you really seem to have good notions right notions indeed sir added he taking me by the hand and bruising my knuckles when luckily a servant came in to my relief by annoncing us that dinner was upon the table  chap lxxiii the squire led the way and we followed him into the parlour where we saluted the ladies and took our places i was struck with the whole air and person of the bride altogether but did not fix my eyes upon her attentively enough to distinguish her beauties out of regard to good breeding as the looks of a stranger might have thrown her into confusion at such a delicate crisis as this  and indeed this politeness i soon found to be but common humanity toward her for she had a world of sorry mirth to sustain from the vulgar facetiousness of her father and cousins who exhausted all the commonplace jests and railleries that are usually thrown out by merry dullness upon such occasions  the bridegroom too joined in the same stupid humor though i said every thing i could to restrain him from it i hinted to him in french that though in the rest it might be ill breeding only in him it was indecent also he replied that he had a design in it for coyness was troublesome and that he always observed when womon once became familiar with ideas they were seldom apt to start at things i answered that he must not only be an indelicate but an indiscreet husband too who would desire to lessen a wifes modesty but to call in foreign aid for that purpose added i is gross indeed  the father still went on blundering in sense and mistaking in expression while the familiar cousins made more than amends by speaking rather too plain arresting every innocent word that was uttered by any of the ladies and torturing it to confess a double entendre  among all the improper behavior of men toward women i think that the wresting a single to a double sense is the most inexcuseable a rape upon their persons may have some temptation but one on their words can possibly have none and the violating an innocent expression into an immodest sense may justly be censured under this harsh appellation  there is certainly in some men such a malady as grossness of ears which like a dull medium gives a bluntness to the acutest sounds i would have the aures asini affixed to such an head which like midas prefers a satyrs voice to the melody of apollo and that may be compared to blisters which extract only the foulest humors immodest wits may be resembled to beggars who betray their poverty by exposing their nakedness  chap lxxiv during the entertainment the parlour door was left open to stun us with the noise of shrill fiddles and hoarse hautboys which supplied still fresh occasion of insipid mirth by affording opportunities of calling for certain tunes with arch names but at the same time they served to drown a good deal of the ribaldry that was bandied about while the dinner lasted which therefore in some sort reconciled me to the interruption for that time  but i have generally thought the introduction of music at meals to be a most absurd entertainment friends are more particularly selected and assembled at these times to be cheerful and sociable together it is therefore most highly improper to suffer any kind of avocation to intrude upon such jovial occasions which may either divert the attention or lay the free circulation of familiar converse under any manner of difficulty or restraint is there a scold an evil spirit or a tarantula in company  when a person treats his guests with music at meals he should always provide each of them with a speaking trumpet to fill the concert lest the vocal should be found too weak for the instrumental at least i think that the company ought to converse together in recitative only  i met with a sign once in ireland that was perfectly emblematical of such an absurdity it was a cat eating a mouse and playing on the bagpipes at the same time is this an irish blunder no  it is there only that it is not one for music may not improperly be blended with conversation where most people speak with a tune  pere le compte describing the manners of the chinese says that they eat and drink to a certain measure which is marked by a person who stands at the sideboard and bea  during the dinner he farther adds that they never speak a word during meals but that their whole address of compliment is performed by gesture and grimace only music would not be impertinent at such festivals as these and might likewise have not been improperly introduced at belshazzars impious feast where all the guests were struck dumb at once  socrates in the protagoras reprehending the sophist for quoting poetry in a philosophical argument compares it to certain ignorant people who for want of sense to entertain their company have their feasts accompanied by music  chap lxxv about six oclock in the evening we were summoned into the drawing room to tea where we found the parson ready to perform his office after the ceremony was over every one saluted the bride in course and when the squire gave her his blessing perceiving that she trembled a good deal he cried out hey girl are you falling into a panatic look ye there look ye there said he pointing to her mother she had the same frantics in her time wench and yet you see that she is still alive to tell the story  the cousins the parson and the footmen laughed  after tea the music struck up again and the ball began the father and mother led up i excused myself from mirth beville danced with the bride the bridegroom with one of the paranymphs first cousin with the other the parson with my ladys woman and second cousin with a chair  these six couple jigged it away as one of the cousins termed it for the rest of the evening with a great deal of rustic mirth and jocularity the only part of which that i remember was what the parson said on their first setting out exulting at the preference he had obtained over poor second coz who stood next under him what mr tom said he are you tired already tired sir tired prithee how came such a crotchet into your nobb mr parson why really mr tom replied he is it not natural to suppose that a man is so when he takes a chair here a loud laugh  ay but doctor doctor parson upon dorothy i have this advantage over you again that when i am tired i may rest myself in my partners lap which is a liberty you dare not take for your cassock doctor  here a louder laugh   mr beville entertained his fair partner with his usual good breeding he talked to her of indifferent matters in the gay and polite world of plays music and dress  not upon any particular modes of the latter but treating it only as a general topic and exposing the improprieties and extravagancies of certain fashions where caprice reigned alone from whence he took occasion of comparing taste and wit together which however they may strike upon the fancy at first are equally false said he if one be not founded in sense and the other in nature  he found her extremely attentive intelligent diffident and modest he treated her like a rational creature notwithstanding her youth and beauty and was so perfectly polite all the evening as to keep quite clear of every subject hint or expression which might even glance or seem to allude to the circumstances of her present situation  during supper he and i both concurred in the same sentiment and endeavored as much as possible to parry all the rude merriment that was thrown out upon this occasion the chaplain though pressed us hard for he showed himself indeed most truly orthodox  in all the mysteries of weddings and christenings  which by the warmth of his imagination he joined so close together in his expressions that in a bottle or two more i believe he would like the projector in tristram shandy have proceeded to baptize the infant slap dash in potentia rerum  our difficulty with regard to this gentleman lay here that we could not tell how to reprimand a person under his character without saying some things at the same time too severe for good breeding or the laws of hospitality we contented ourselves therefore with taking him in the groupe and giving a turn to their prolific ein of conversation by entering into country politics in which none of us were in the least concerned or abusing the ministry  because they had never provided for any of us with such other squirely topics in which the rest of the company engaged with modern patriot warmth in some manuscripts the expression is party rage and in others petvaliant fury  to moderate the ardour of which we frequently interluded with quibbling upon words or retailing joe millers jests choosing rather to be silly or stupid than loose or profane  and in this turn too they equally joined us with native humor and most mortifying applause  the stocking thrown we retired  chap lxxvi when mr beville and i were lest alone we commented upon the incidents of the day and agreed together that none of the men wanted understanding within their own sphere but yet from an ignorance of the rules of good breeding and decorum had rendered themselves either ridiculous or absurd during the course of the whole entertainment  we then pursued this subject up to a general reflection and mr beville very justly observed that some of the characters which had distinguished the ancients seemed to be quite lost among us at present we have neither a socrates nor an alcibiades now said he the good are formal the wise severe and the learned pedantic while the young show little spirit but against religion the gay are profligate and the unlettered unmannered also  abroad continued he we hear that appearances at least are still preserved and as charity is said to cover a multitude of sins so politeness has the address to conceal a number of faults and it is some merit certainly to be able to palliate a defect in morals with the decent substitute of manners  from this reflection we carried our observations up to the british constitution both of church and state by taking notice that the freedom which we are too apt to indulge ourselves in of framing the councils both of our god and king gives a certain bravery perhaps to our speech and actions which may possibly render us greater heroes in a state of war but are quite incompatible with a state of peace our ebullient spirits become impatient of inactivity and where a foreign enemy does not unite our prowess we are too prone to create a sort of civil discord among ourselves and set one half of the nation at strife against the other either by the sword or by the pen  by this means the ingenuous arts of life become neglected the generous emulation of genius subsides all civil commerce is interrupted among us that traffic chiefly encouraged which tends merely toward luxury and profuseness and merit is allowed no other test but that of party only thus do we grow invalids from too much health and even our wealth but furnishes us with means of impoverishing ourselves again  we then parted and retired to rest the next morning we escorted the bride home to her new empire the father mother paranymphs first and second coz with the parson forming our cavalcade who all returned back again the next day  chap lxxvii when we had passed a week together mr beville and i attempted to take our leave but were pressed by our friend to pass at least the honeymoon with him as he styled it in which invitation the fair ethelinda joined him with such an air of hospitality and politeness that we readily consented to their request  she was tall finely proportioned fair and of most captivating beauty she had a grace and decency in her air motion and gesture with so remarkable a mildness and modesty in her countenance that one might imagine nature had infused no more blood into her body than what was just sufficient to blush in her cheeks in fine there was something in her look and manner altogether which won ones friendship at first sight and i may pronounce that whoever saw her even once with a heart not preingaged could scarcely have it to offer but at second hand to another  i attended to her sentiments and conduct during the time i remained in the house and observed that she was possessed of a disposition singularly compassionate and humane her charity was extensive but i have known it sometimes restrained by the fear of having it taken notice of her moral was curbed by her modesty alone  my friend and condisciple was a most unfit character to be yoked with hers he was very inconsistent had a princely grandeur in some things and a pedling meanness in others his mind might be compared to an old mansion house with a few large rooms but crowded with closets  his temper too was uncertain for caprice good humor and passion used to shift so quick upon you that there was no prescribing to oneself any certain measure of conduct toward him his cheerfulness resembled the air pent up between two hills which in the calmest day is subject to be disturbed by squalls  he had no steady principle of action neither he would strike his dependents this hour and make them presents the next he often gave charity but repented of it as often so that he impoverished his purse without enriching his soul  he was indefatigable at all country diversions without understanding any of them and might literally be said to be a slave to his sports for he was master of none so that i have sometimes known him to lounge away whole evenings on the couch like a tired postboy lamenting the fatigue without resenting the pleasure he used to drink hard though it always made him sick and seemed generally to prefer inferior company which appeared too visibly in his manners he who ever affects to be the highest of his company will probably become in time to be the lowest of it  he had been but little conversant in polite life for want of which he had contracted an uncouthness in his manner and a freedom in his speech and behavior that must be extremely disgusting to a woman of delicacy or breeding joined to all which he had fallen under the common prejudices of weak or vulgar minds namely a gross suspicion of female chastity and an ignorant contempt of all womens understandings the fair and polite ethelinda soon saw felt and mourned her disappointment  chap lxxviii she had no visitors while we staid in the house for it was in the months of november and december the nights dark and the roads impassable so that all the compliments she received upon her coming into the country were only cards of congratulation on her marriage and postponing visits till the spring  her husband used to spend his mornings in hunting or shooting and his evenings in carousals or sleeping on the couch so that her whole time was left entirely at her own disposal which she used to divide between working reading painting and music during which occupations mr beville and i would relieve or assist her by turns  we used to read to her while she was employed at her pencil or her needle and accompany her at the harpsichord which concert she much improved by the addition of a fine voice we used at first to call upon our friend to take his part as i remembered he had formerly been a good performer on the violin but he had only one in the house which he resigned to mr beville and showed so little relish to an entertainment of that elegant nature that he would not even send into the neighborhood to borrow one  in these amusements though he would sometimes interrupt us he would stride across the carpets with dirty boots give his wife a rustic smack then a stroke of his whip over her petticoats and cry these jessamin philosophers girl will turn your head knitting and pastry are fitter occupations for a housewife knowledge was the first thing that destroyed your sex my dear and the devil has never so sure an hold of a woman as when he makes her learned with other such commonplace sarcasms as these  the greatest difficulty that mr beville and i had at first to struggle with here was to get ourselves excused from drinking but as our host had remembered that we had both of us always declined the least excess of this kind he would after this glass or that bottle or clear the deck or just take what is in the room with such other dalliances of debauchery suffer us to make our escape which i take to be the justest expression in all the peculiar phraseology of drinking  chap lxxix after this manner did we pass the honeymoon together till toward the latter end of it mr beville began to grow silent thoughtful and disturbed neglected his favorite studies and used to take long and solitary walks in the wood i quickly perceived the change and spoke to him upon it he replied that he had lost his spirits rest and appetite of late and apprehended that some disease was undermining his constitution by slow degrees  his danger together with a languid and dejected look which he cast upon me at the same time resembling the last view i had had of his dear sister produced such a sudden effect in me that i could not recover myself again for the remainder of the evening i retired soon to my apartment and passed the night in fruitless tears and vainer wishes  the next day my dear friend found himself unable to leave his room i sent immediately for a physician but he was with difficulty prevailed on to see him he prescribed some medicines which he refused to take with an obstinacy which i had never before observed the least symptom of in him in two days he was confined to his bed in a raging fever  i got a pallet into his room and attended him solely myself not suffering even a servant to enter his chamber on pretense of the danger of communicating his distemper to the family but more on account of some symptoms in his disorder which greatly alarmed me with regard to the cause of it  he raved much and in his deliriums would frequently repeat the name of ethelinda sometimes he would cry out in an ecstasy o she is all angel nothing but air voice and color we can but see hear and breathe her an anadyomene have a little patience reader and i will answer you to that question by and by but in the mean time i must caution both my belle and beau readers not to mistake this word for anno domini for i do assure them that it was in being long before that era  an anadyomene o had ulysses seen but such a seanymph or scipio taken such another captive at other times well i am a a king now but where is my queen what is a world without her with many other extravagancies of the same kind  the physician attended regularly but i always took care to keep him waiting in the antechamber till i found my dear unhappy friend was composed to rest that he might have an opportunity of feeling his pulse and prescribing for him according to the changes in his disorder without the hazard of suffering a secret to escape which had already given me such complicated uneasiness and might farther be attended too with such unhappy consequences  in a few days he began to recover his reason and in ten more was pronounced out of danger though his spirits still continued extremely low i constantly kept up the appearance of cheerfulness in his company and whenever i found my art begin to fail me i used to select books of the highest wit and humor i could meet with in the fair ethelindas study to entertain him serious or religious writings would have been improper for him at that time  i took not the least notice of his raving hints to him nor did he remember any thing of the matter himself or let me any farther into the secret except by such involuntary intimations as sighing at the sound of her name in a message to inquire his health or by a visible emotion upon hearing her voice as she walked under his window with such other unequivocal signs of love more certain than the most explicit declarations of passion  chap lxxx as his fever was not inflammatory i did not confine myself so closely to his room after his delirium had ceased but used to go down to meals and during the intervals of his rest i found the tender and humane ethelinda extremely concerned at mr bevilles indisposition and very assiduous about his cure she measured the proportions and compounded the medicines herself and appointed her servants to relieve each other by turns in sitting up every night in the antechamber  she also entreated the favor of her husband not to bring home any of his jolly blades during mr bevilles illness as his chamber happened to lie directly over the dining parlour he complied indeed with her request by staying generally abroad with one or other of them  the first two or three days after i had used to come down out of the sick room the weather happening to be unfit for sports the condisciple and i passed most of our time in her dressing room which he employed chiefly in discountenancing her from reading holding lectures upon huswifry and passive obedience or in speaking or romping with her after too free and course a manner before her maids or me  i quickly perceived how much she was disgusted at such sentiments and behavior and using the privileges of long and early friendship i reprehended him for it sometimes in private and sometimes before her as the occasion happened to urge or that i found her to be affected  this piece of good breeding rendered her at length so much at her ease before me that she used to speak to me with the same freedom as she might to a brother which joined to the open and ingenuous frankness of her nature without the least reserve in her manners but what modesty or politeness had inspired led her to address me thus one evening just after my friend having thrown her into confusion by speaking to her somewhat too indecently before me had quitted the room and was rating at a footman in the hall  pray sir said she what is the reason that there should be so remarkable a difference in the manners of men while i am in mr bevilles company or yours i am sensible of both the pleasure and the pride of considering myself as a rational and independent creature a person of some rank or character in life but in the presence of my father or my husband i feel the humiliation of finding myself dwindling by turns into an housekeeper or a puppetdoll  i have continued she had but little opportunity of becoming conversant with polite life i have indeed sometimes read the characters of it in books but in comparing them with those of my father cousins the chaplain and our neighboring squires though all of them very good sort of men in the main i have hitherto been apt to impute the descriptions i had met with entirely to the wanton imagination of romance and used to rank such chimeras in the class of geniis and centaurs but some observations which i have lately had an occasion of making added she and bowing toward me have convinced me that good breeding is not purely ideal and that men may be possessed of sense manners and virtue without being above the stature of others or having the power of rendering themselves invisible  i bowed in return thanked her for her too polite compliment and replied that the disadvantages of not being born to rank or fortune were sometimes compensated by advantages in other things for that the observations and decorums which were necessary to conduct such persons upon equal terms through life were things which their superiors in these articles too frequently looked upon themselves dispensed with from paying a sufficient attention to  i instanced this matter in courts where it has been observed that the most polished manners were generally met with among the second or third classes rather than in the first i quoted also from history that the most shining characters had often risen from privacy to the purple and then concluded this climax of heroes with his present majesty of prussia who though born a prince was bred a private man till his accession to the throne  however added i this observation is not universal as in the instances of the chaplain and your cousins for it is not every one who is born with elasticity enough to spring under a weight but they on whom this gifted energy may have been bestowed should only with humble gratitude enjoy the blessing and not with arrogance assume a merit from a grace your argument is just and fine replied she but though your modesty may reduce the merit it can never abate the excellence of such a character  chap lxxxi one evening after ethelinda and i had dined alone and that mr beville had sat up for two or three days she proposed to me that we should drink tea together in his apartment this alarmed me i did not think that his state either of health or mind was sufficiently valid at that time to stand such an interview  besides the kindness and condescension of it too might possibly i feared every thing have too much flattered his hopes i knew his honor and his moral perfect and had conceived as high an opinion of her innocence and virtue but then again he had passion and she sensibility  upon these considerations i declined the proposal saying that mr beville would be extremely distressed at receiving a visit from a lady whom he had so much respect for in his present deshabille never mind a punctilio of that kind she replied i have visited the sick often before my fathers gout has made nursetending familiar to me and if i am willing to dispense with forms said she surely neither of you can possibly have any reason to be difficult about them  i then thought it proper to assume an higher key and told her that my apprehension was by no means that mr beville would not be pleased with the honor of her visit but that i feared he might perhaps be too well pleased with it which last words i pronounced with a look and emphasis that sufficiently marked their import  the lovely ethelinda blushed and cast down her modest eyes at this expression i found myself too far advanced to retreat i therefore hurried on as fast as i could to rid myself of a subject which i so little cared to dwell upon i gave her then an account of every particular since my having first observed the change in mr beville just in the same manner i have now recited them to you  she was silent for some minutes and then replied with a sigh i confess sir that i am both concerned and surprised at this misfortune of your friend but as mr beville has shown so much good breeding and respect toward me as never to have given me the most distant hint of his improper passion it would be injustice in me to express any manner of resentment upon an accidental discovery of so unhappy an event  but your own good sense and prudence sir continued she lifting up her head must certainly think it extremely proper to remove your friend as far as may be from this unlucky scene whenever the safety of his health may permit i wish him every success and happiness that his merit deserves or his virtue can desire i approve his manners and esteem his character  my circumstances in life forbid me to say or even to think more but even thus far sir said she with a severer air you must not be at liberty to pronounce for what has escaped me in justice to your friend might not perhaps in honor to myself be proper to repeat  i bowed respectfully and having passed my word that i would never suffer the least hint of this conversation to transpire to mr beville i went up to his chamber and found him moving about the room by the assistance of the tables and chairs trying his strength as he told me with a design of beginning his journey on the next day if possible  i was pleased at this motion arising from himself but told him that i was afraid his health would not permit him to set out so soon to which he replied that he was pretty certain he should be able to perform the first days journey in our friends coach and that if he should not have strength enough to continue his route on horseback he would much rather linger at an inn than where he was for that he began to feel himself extremely uneasy at the trouble and difficulties his disorder had subjected the family to adding that he had stronger reasons still for removing himself even at the hazard of his life from that too fatal scene of his present misery  these words he pronounced with an heavy sigh and faltering accent which however i did not seem to take the least notice of but replied that i would speak for the coach as soon as our friend should return home that evening then shifting the discourse to general topics i remained with him till he retired to rest and then went immediately down stairs  chap lxxxii when i came into the parlour i found our friend just returned home he was much fuddled told us that he had spent a jovial day among a parcel of  of the first head but was somewhat afraid that the wine had not been quite sound for it began to make him sick already and that he would with my leave retire immediately to bed  i advised him to take an emetic first which he promised to do and went away desiring his wife to stay and entertain me at supper which just then came upon the table but she excused herself saying that duty should ever take the lead of civility then desiring me to drink the healths of all my sick friends walked up stairs to her chamber along with him  i had no manner of inclination to sit down alone and would have declined it but from a nicety about giving offense to the hospitality of my hosts i therefore went through the supper with an appearance of appetite and then filling up a bumper drank with a truly sincere heart the double toast which our fair landlady had recommended to me joining her health and happiness along with it  thus left alone i began to reflect as usual upon the unhappy circumstances of poor bevilles fortunes and my own i revolved many schemes in my mind but what signifies reasoning without premises at length i resolved upon this measure that we should both join our little fund and application together toward assisting mr beville the father in vindicating his rights against his deputy and then live with him till my father should have extricated his fortune out of the courts and afterward enter jointly into some project of life together upon the fund of two thousand pounds which i had paid for my sisters portion and which was confessedly my due  while i was revolving these thoughts in my mind the post arrived and the packet of letters was laid upon the table among which i saw one directed to myself i opened it and found it to be from our worthy friend the clergyman beforementioned the contents of which were these continued mr andrews taking a letter out of his desk and presenting it to mr carewe to peruse  chap lxxxiii the letter london dear sir i staid a few days here after my good friends mr beville and you had left it the minister of st martins in whose parish i found out that your father lived was my old acquaintance and cotemporary at oxford i paid him a visit renewed my intimacy with him entered into the subject of your situation and circumstances and got him very readily indeed to concur with me in jointly employing our good offices and address toward bringing your father into a proper sense both of your merit and his own duty  my friend invited me to dinner the next day and introduced me to your father without dropping the least hint of my profession having before directed me to lay aside my clerical habit upon that occasion telling me that mr andrews though a most rigid churchman had from some personal disgust conceived a strong prejudice against the private character of a clergyman and that one moral sent spoken by a layman would have more weight with him than fifty pronounced by an hireling as he is apt to style a parson  we spent the day very cheerfully together and i played off his own character so successfully against himself by helping him to roast the parson who pretended sometimes to be serious upon it in order to heighten the sport that i won his affections so far as to be invited to dine with him the following day which i most readily accepted of  the next day after dinner i asked your father what had possessed him with such a resentment against the clergy considered personally while he appeared at the same time to have a very orthodox belief of their appointment and a just sense of the high importance of their office  he replied that his father and brother had been both clergymen the first disinherited him in favor of a second wifes children and the latter had left him involved for five hundred pounds which had given him a mortal aversion to the cassock this story i had been apprised of before by my friend and only led him into it in order to supply an occasion of exclaiming loudly against the injustice of his father toward him which i did  yes sir said he and if you will consider at the same time that i was not on my part guilty of any one act of disobedience to provoke him to such a diabolical partiality no sir i replied that is a circumstance which i can by no means admit into consideration in such a case as this for no conduct of a child which does not contradict the laws of god or man can possibly be pretended as a palliation for so unparental a severity  i pressed this subject no farther at that time because i did not choose to let him perceive my design too abruptly so i shifted the subject to indifferent matters and soon after took my leave having first engaged him to spend a few days with me in the country telling him that the parson there would escort him i fixed the time afterward with my friend and left london the next morning  they both of them came down to me according to agreement and we passed our time pleasantly enough as i exerted myself to the utmost stretch of hospitality toward my new guest i still concealed my parsonship during the remainder of the week for though we had prayers as usual morn and eve i appointed my friend of st martins to the office of chaplain during that time  i had your lovely children my dear andrews in the house with me all the while and frequently called them into the parlour to fondle with before him letting them pass for relations of my own he was struck with their beauty and used to take them often on his knee by turns i have sometimes felt myself a little awkward on account of my disingenuousness toward him but then i quickly solved it again by thinking that if ever a pious fraud was allowable it must be in so virtuous a cause as this  at length sunday morning arrived i sent off my guests to church before me and when i had put on my proper garb i followed them walking through the isle directly into the desk where my friend the clergyman had taken his place before me after having seated mr andrews in a pew opposite to the pulpit st martins read prayers and i preached that day upon a text selected for the occasion namely the fifth commandment  in this discourse i carried the duty of children up to the highest degree by showing first the general sense of mankind upon this article from the earliest account of nations and among even the most savage race of men and then wound up my doctrine by confirming this great natural and moral obligation with the express command of god  i then proceeded to consider on the other hand the great and alarming duty of parents toward their children which point i carried even higher than the former for after having first inculcated it from nature morals and universal concurrence i pleaded even the silence of the decalogue in this article as an argument to confirm it  we have said i a command not to kill but none against suicide we have also a precept to love our neighbor but none to love our child and this because it was thought superfluous to frame injunctions for or against things whereof the passion or aversion had been so strongly rooted already both in our reason and our nature  upon the whole i concluded that an unkind parent must be considered as a reprobate both to reason to nature and to grace and i preached the sermon with that natural and most persuasive kind of eloquence exceeding all the arts of oratory with which a person is endued upon a subject where his mind is convinced and his heart affected  during the duties of this morning i did not attend to any particular which did not relate immediately to the offices of the day therefore i could not perceive what manner of effect either my unexpected appearance under a new and solemn character or the arguments of my doctrine might have produced upon my most immediate object next to god but on my descending into the isle and saluting mr andrews in the midst of the congregation he seemed to be in a sort of confusion and received my address with a certain distant respect and awed obeisance which gratified me extremely  not from cleric pride but christian charity  as we walked home together from church he asked me why i had concealed my profession from him all this while to which i answered that in general i neither took pains to reveal or conceal it but would however rather choose to suffer that particular always to remain a secret among strangers because said i should they happen to be good and formal epithets too frequently joined the awe of it might possibly throw some restraint upon the freedom of conversation and if profligate and illbred which are terms as often coupled it might tempt such characters to become rather too free we should be christians every where said i turning toward our friend of st martins but parsons only in our pulpits  during the remainder of the day i behaved toward your father with the same ease and freedom as usual but perceived that he on his part seemed to hold a greater reserve over his speech and manners than before i took notice of this particular to him and he ingenuously confessed to me that he could not readily got the better of the surprise which had seized him upon seeing me walk through the isle in the sacred habit and take my place at the desk before he had been in the least apprised of my profession and that the suddenness of the transition from my supposed to my real character had struck him somewhat like a divine vision and impressed his mind with a certain religious awe which he could not for that day at least nor desired during his life ever to get the better of  in the evening i brought your dear infants into the parlour in my arms and placing them on their little knees before him said since this has been a day for discovering of secrets sir i shall now acquaint you with one which is of infinitely greater moment to you than that which you were let into this morning  here sir are your grandchildren  whose mother your cruelty has already sent weeping to the grave has reduced their father to a wandering exile and driven these lovely innocents these peculiar favorites of our redeemer crying to a strangers gates for bread  the strength of my expression with the sternness of my look and the voice of authority which i thought proper to assume upon so justifiable an occasion threw mr andrews into the utmost confusion and i could perceive a certain mixture of shame horror and selfcondemnation in his countenance at the same time  i turned carelessly aside to leave him at liberty to collect himself and indeed in order to hide my own disturbance also upon which he hastily laid his hands on the childrens heads crying in an hurry god bless you god bless you both then saying he was not very well he suddenly quitted the room and retired to his chamber i then snatched up the children in my arms kissed them and wept while the sportive innocents sat smiling at each other and clubbing their little mischief together to throw off my wig upon the floor  mr andrews came in to supper and after the cloth had been removed he addressed himself to me thus you accosted me this evening sir said he with such a suddenness and severity that i must confess myself to have been totally deprived of all power of vindicating my character from so heavy a charge  i am truly sorry for the fatal consequences you have mentioned to me but then sir i hope you will admit that these have arisen solely from my sons own undutifulness and cannot therefore be in the least imputed to my cruelty as you were pleased just now to style it he married without my consent and without a portion and as my fortune is in my own power i have but exercised my right in making a will which in proper time may show the gentleman my just resentment against so high an act of disobedience  sir said i whatever the tenor of our lives may be we ought to be more particularly careful of the last than about any other act of it a will sir though perfected at any time of our lives as it is not to take effect till after our death ought certainly to be considered in this most interesting light and we should therefore never attempt to sit down to so tremendous a work but in such a temper of charity and forgiveness as we would perform any other action in our latest moments this point was enough for the clergyman to insist on upon this occasion but marcus aurelius carries the moral farther by advising to consider every action of our lives as if it were to be our last   sir said he all this may be very ingenious reasoning for any thing i know but as the laws of the land have invested me with an absolute dominion over my fortune i think that no person whatsoever can possibly urge a claim of right against me a petition of favor is the utmost they can pretend to and my eldest son by disobedience has forfeited even this pretense  dear sir i replied we are not here litigating this point according to law but merely debating it agreeably to justice your absolute dominion i dispute not but heaven is not a court of law but of equity before which dread tribunal a suppliant is required to do justice first himself before he can be entitled to receive it and believe me sir continued i with a steadfast look that whoever has not virtue sufficient to distinguish between a right and a power is a casuist for the devil  these last expressions seemed to startle him he immediately appeared to retire into his own thoughts and a dead silence ensued on all sides for some minutes till the bell rang for family prayers which i administered myself and had the sincere pleasure to observe that mr andrews joined in them with a more emphatical devotion than usual  our supper passed away in general subjects but a good deal constrained and the next morning mr andrews took his leave and returned back to london i desired my friend to found him on the road and try what effect my lectures and experiments might have produced upon him  he did so and wrote to me the next post acquainting me that mr andrews seemed to have been a good deal awed was more thoughtful than usual had several times repeated to himself the words right and power and had treated him all along though a parson with somewhat more of decorum than he was wont to do but that with regard to the point in question his only answer when pressed to it was that resentments which had been gradually growing warm must be allowed time to become cool by the same degrees again  thus far my dear andrews had i written to you a month ago but delayed sending the letter upon my friends last hint in order to wait the final result either to be able to afford you a successful account of my interposition altogether or not to interrupt your resignation and philosophy with fruitless hopes  last monday i came up to london in order to feel my patients pulse again and accordingly waited upon your father the next day i found him in an high fever but perfectly in his senses and much pleased to see me he told me my reasonings had wrought a most salutary effect upon his too hasty notions of right and wrong and that if i would but take the trouble of drawing up a few lines according to my own sentiments of justice he would most cheerfully subscribe to them this was immediately performed  i prayed by him and took my leave  the next day and the following his fever increased and last night   i have left every thing in charge with my good friend of st martins and am just returning to the country again to embrace my dear little adoptions i was young and now am old yet never did i see the righteous forsaken nor their seed begging bread  adieu chap lxxxiv this letter continued mr andrews affected me extremely in various ways i was charmed with the active virtue of my friend i rejoiced at the proper though late moral of my father and do declare that the first and principal pleasure i received from this fortunate event was in the reflection of his having been brought at length to a just and equitable sense of his parental obligations i resented the grant more than the gift and was sensible of a certain pious transport in thinking that this last act of my fathers had retrieved his character and sealed his merits  but oh my friend what a torrent of tears rushed from my eyes at the thought of my dear wifes death just then occurring to my mind at the instant of these reflections how did i lament her missing of that virtuous transport which would have affected her fond heart and generous soul at seeing her husband and her children thus securely placed beyond the scorn of fools and spurn of fortune in fine i was struck with such a complicated emotion of filial gratitude conjugal grief and parental joy that it was late before i could compose myself to prayer or rest  the next morning i lay so long that mr beville impatient to fly that fatal scene had come into my room and asked me whether i had prepared every thing ready for our journey i told him that our host had returned home the night before so much out of order that i did not think proper to mention our going just at that time but as i had received a letter from our friend the clergyman last nights post with an account of my fathers illness i thought it might afford a fair pretext for quitting the house so abruptly and that i would immediately rise and send in a message to borrow the postchaise  poor mr beville was still so weak that even his short walk across the gallery to my chamber had fatigued him so much that he was forced to lay himself on the bed by me i did not think it prudent in such a state of health to acquaint him with the full contents of the letter as the pleasure it would have afforded him might possibly have had too sudden an effect upon his present low condition of strength and spirits  i arose immediately and as soon as i heard my condisciples bell ring i sent mr bevilles compliments and mine to inquire how he was acquainting him with the summons we had received and desiring the favor of his equipage to convey my friend the first days journey at least as his health was not sufficiently established to venture on horseback so immediately upon quitting his chamber  he returned his compliments said he had discharged his stomach by an emetic the last night found himself pretty easy that morning but was just going to take a medicine which would prevent him the pleasure of seeing us he ordered the postchaise wished us a good journey and added that he would be glad to see us both again as soon as our affairs might permit  the fair ethelinda too sent us her compliments and desired that we should take the chaise on to london with us if we found it either necessary or convenient but from a very becoming nicety which confirmed my opinion and esteem for her neither joined in her husbands invitation nor came down to breakfast on pretense that her attendance on him required her staying above  mr beville and i breakfasted together and immediately after set out upon our journey  chap lxxxv during the first days stage i avoided all particular conversation with my friend speaking chiefly upon general topics pointing out to him the several beauties of the country through which we passed which were so strong as to manifest themselves even through december snows  it was now near christmas  i made reflections upon that hallowed season and took notice of the remarkable goodness wisdom and economy of providence in appointing that great festival to fall upon a time of the year when the husbandmans labors are suspended and that nature had already ordained a vacation to rejoice in at the most gloomy period of the year to send us the most glad tidings that ever yet have reached the sons of man  i do not recollect mr carewe said andrews that these remarks have been ever made before by any of our divines they occurred to my mind upon this occasion for the first time they warmed my heart amidst december frosts and i endeavored to communicate the same fervor from them to my friend in order to dispel his melancholy and elevate his thoughts to a sublimer passion to a love equally void of satiety or despair and which contrary to all other objects of desire we are nearer the fruition of in age than youth  he joined in my reflections with that religious and philosophic turn of mind which was natural and habitual to him and which gave me strong reason to believe that if i could detain him in some distant scene where he might never see or even hear the name of the too lovely ethelinda more his heart would soon recover its former spring again for without hope passion subsists not long and i knew that his virtue forbad him even to frame a wish which might serve to keep it alive  when we had been settled for the evening at our inn he asked me what scheme of life i had planned out for us both for you were more at leisure than i said he with a sigh for such contemplations during our late visit in the country  i told him of the purpose which i had framed just before i received the letter and added that i had some encouragement from my friend to hope that all matters would be accommodated between my father and me as soon as we should arrive in london how should i rejoice at such an event replied he but much i fear that misfortune has marked us for her victims such extraordinary incidents such uncommon adventures  we made a slight repast went early to bed and pursued our journey the next morning in the chair he seemed to be much recruited in health but still too weak to venture to ride or even drive post so we traveled together at his leisure through the whole journey  this second day i found him continue thoughtful and melancholic and imagined from the hint he had given me when he pressed to quit the country with some others which he had let drop the night before that he would be pleased to be questioned upon this subject though his delicacy seemed backward to propose it in a more direct way himself  i considered also that it is a great relief to a mind oppressed to be at liberty to communicate its uneasiness to a friend and being myself also sollicitous to know how high his passion might have arisen or what kind of sentiments he had himself about it i resolved to enter upon the subject with him at our next stage and accordingly after dinner accosted him thus  chap lxxxvi my dear friend and brother the disorder which you have been lately affected with has given me most extreme apprehension and concern which is however rather increased than abated by your recovery if we may style it one while it leaves you still subject to the depressed and melancholic state which your mind and spirits seem ever since to have labored under  and yet even this is by no means my principal concern about you for the most obstinate distempers are still within the dominion of physic but i am much afraid from some expressions which have escaped you in your ravings with others that you have thrown out since the recovery of your reason that your principal malady may be of that nature which ovid says non est medicabilis herbis  he blushed and appeared in confusion but quickly asked me with great emotion after what manner he had exposed the secret or betrayed his passion during his delirium i soon made him easy with regard to this particular by assuring him that no ears but his own and mine happened to have been within the reach of his voice on his first extravagance and then acquainting him of the precaution i had used during the remainder of his distraction  o then cried he out in a transport my alarmed mind is again restored to peace and this secret shall be now entombed with me for i may truly say that it has not yet escaped me since you alone my second self are the only master of it yes my dear andrews i confess the passion but deny the guilt it was not my choice it is not my acquiescence  it was my fatality and is my misfortune  my dear beville i replied the slightest suspicion either of your honor or your virtue has never yet rested on my mind but in this unhappy affair you must give me leave to be somewhat diffident of your prudence or discretion at least for love whatever the poets may have written of that passion is a fair and open enemy and always affords us sufficient warning for a retreat it is by dalliance alone that we are conquered and after we have delivered ourselves over willing victims to the soft persuasion we would defend our own weakness by pleading of its strength the bravest who stand their ground may be oerpowered but the fugitive was never yet oertaken  i entreat my dear friend replied he that you will be so charitable as to suspend your judgment till you have heard my defense and though i trust that i shall be found an object of compassion rather than of censure yet i must confess that the fond nicety which i have ever had about preserving your favorable opinion toward me oppresses me notwithstanding at present with a kind of generous diffidence on my defeat though conquered by surprise  even as a general before his mistress for having lost a day though the odds a million  chap lxxxvii when first i beheld the fair ethelinda continued mr beville i was struck with admiration at her transcendent charms her form her grace her air her features the contemplation of beauty in whatever subject is natural to the mind of man and not defended by the most severe philosophy i indulged myself therefore in this sublime delight while i found the chaste pleasure not yet descending from the refinements of taste  when i became acquainted with her mind was conversant with her understanding had considered her virtues and observed upon her manners i found myself affected toward her with a warmer sentiment indeed but still of the same platonic kind for the beauty of morals and of nature are reciprocally analogous and we may become susceptible of a sensation for either quite distinct from passion  again when i began to observe upon the uncouth manners and indelicate behavior of her husband toward her seeming totally devoid of the least taste or sentiment for her mind or beauty was it not virtue to lament her fate this was humanity  not desire i grudged him an happiness which he seemed unworthy to enjoy but this was envy and not jealousy  thus were my admiration of her beauty my esteem of her merits and compassion for her misfortune restrained within the precincts of innocence and virtue  as disinterested and pure as is a brothers love under such chaste and delicate sentiments as these had i passed the first three weeks of our acquaintance without receiving the least hint from my passions which might have alarmed my virtue or have warned my prudence  i endeavored often though obliquely to reform his manners but without preferring my own and have upon some occasions even restrained my own politeness toward her where i imagined that the contrast might have been too strongly marked my sole desire was to have reclaimed his conduct and my warmest wish breathed for their mutual happiness  a father might have felt such sentiments  an angel might have loved her so  but  chap lxxxviii one morning i happened to take a long and solitary walk through the woods ruminating upon our past misfortunes my dear andrews said he and forming visionary schemes for future life when returning dispirited and fatigued i strolled into the green parlour and there threw myself upon the couch where perceiving my wearied senses disposed to rest i loosened the cords of the suspended curtain and letting it fall carelessly about me folded my arms and resigned myself to slumber  after some time i was awakened by persons coming hastily into the room and from under part of the veil where the cord had happened not to have run to its full length i perceived the lovely ethelinda issuing from the warm bath which lay within this apartment attended by her maid who laying down a parcel of clothes upon the carpet before the fire retired immediately out of the room locking the door and carrying off the key  i felt myself in the utmost confusion upon this adventure but had no retreat and before i could possibly have resolved upon what measure of decency to observe the charming fair let fall her loosened wrapper to the ground and at once revealed her naked beauties to my ravished view o my dear friend she was ipsa forma induiter formosa est exuiter ipsa forma ovid  indeed were the anadyomene a famous picture of venus rising naked from the sea of apelles but half so bewitching how happy for the world it was so early lost  she dressed herself in haste and every attitude exposed some new some hidden charm to my racked sense  in me tota ruens venus i gazed  i doated  a sudden fever rushed through all my frame  my senses were intranced  reason in vain opposed the fond delirium  i could as well command a dream  religion was suspended  chastity swooned away  i quick lost all reflection and pigmalions statue new informed with life was equal mistress of its passions  when she was dressed she rung the bell for her maid and retired out of the room without having perceived me i immediately arose and stole out to the woods again how did i feel my mind was disturbed my frame disordered i walked through the groves like a frantic person now with a quick now with a slow pace the bell tolled  i returned to the house  the dinner was served  i entered the room with confusion  i avoided even your eyes  i dared not look on him but when she appeared  what a twofold emotion equally of shame and passion i felt a convict  imputed a crime to accident and like a rifled maid found myself shocked at the unhallowed pleasure even of a guiltless deed  oh i could never think of her from that moment without the most turbulent affections my admiration of her beauty my esteem of her  my compassion for her misfortune were deprived at once of all platonics and became new fuel to my flame whenever i saw her i felt as if i had injured her  and when her husband happened to occur to my mind methought i had wronged him too  such passion with such conflict such desire with such scruple soon my friend oercame me i pined i raved i drooped  i betook myself to my bed a double fever seized both mind and body  the rest you know  o spare my weakness and assist my virtue tears forced their passage through his eyes  he threw himself into my arms we embraced  chap lxxxix i shall really be under a good deal of uneasiness for ye ladies while ye are reading the foregoing chapter you had certainly a natural right to have expected somewhat more of adventure in so critical and opportune a scene a young fellow in health and vigor a lovely woman in flower of youth and beautys pride naked and alone  a couch  the door safe locked and the key in the very bottom of abigails pocket had mother behn or grannam heywood the handling of this passage they would have satisfied your curiosity at once without even waiting to have raised it  now let us frame an hypothesis in this very crisis by way of argument only suppose i say that the very moment she had slipped her bagniane he had slipped also into her arms  she could not in decency have done less than faint he lays her on the sopha and applies his best endeavors to awaken her senses she revives and resents his services  by looks and struggles only  for she certainly could not have the assurance to have cried out and expose herself in so suspicious a situation and such unseemly circumstances  in all difficult cases one is apt to govern themselves by precedent and as she was a lady of great reading she must surely have known that throughout all history sacred or profane there are but two examples of female chastity upon record and between you and i ladies queer ones enough they are  susannas coyness could possibly supply no rule of conduct here for in the naked ethelindas case there happened to be no elder lucretias story indeed was the very case in point and how did she acquit herself i pray ye why she first most heroinely yielded to save her fame and then wickedly destroyed herself to revenge her adultery now though the chaste ethelindas discretion might possibly have induced her to the first her religion lucretia was an heathen it is to be hoped would have saved her from the latter since i had wrote the above i have been informed by a lady of severe example that there is a third instance of female chastity in history which ought to be taken notice of here in honor of the sex this was margaret countess of richmond and mother to henry the seventh of whom bishop fisher gives the following curious anecdote in the funeral eulogy he preached over her remains and which i shall here present you with in his own extraordinary words she obtained a license to live chaste from her third husband whereupon she took upon her the vow of celibacy so that according to the bishops opinion the dues of marriage are a breach of chastity  but perhaps he might have meant second or third marriages and in this sentiment many scrupulous persons agree with him   but poor mr beville was verily in a most awkward situation as he describes himself i mean for such a sort of man as he was he might truly be compared to tantulus viewing the staking font and the forbidden fruit with unquenched thirst and appetite unallayed and as listeners are said seldom to hear good of themselves so is there a proverb also that folks generally pay for their peeping the story of acteon is known by every schoolboy  coventry tom too of prying memory is the second instance in history and the unfortunate william beville is now put upon record as the third example of this fatal curiosity  chap xc mr andrews continuing his narrative said i really felt a most extreme compassion for my unhappy friend sense and virtue add strength to love the same vigor of mind which exerts itself in reason takes equal hold of passion and refined affections like purged waters preserve their properties longer than foul  i therefore endeavored to reconcile him to himself by acquiescing in his justification i condoled with him upon the unluckiness of his adventure and concurred in the virtuous and manly resolution which he seemed to have taken of exiling himself from the object of his fatal passion and of excluding from his mind all manner of fuel which might serve to nourish his unhappy flame  i then thought it might relieve his spirits a good deal to let him into the entire secret of my late letter from london and accordingly laid it before him for his perusal saying my dear beville though fortune has used us sometimes for her sport you see she has not quite marked us for her victims yet  the reading of this letter had the desired effect it diffused a cheerfulness over his countenance and he confessed to me but with an ingenuous shame that he was sensible of perhaps a quicker kind of pleasure in having my fortunes established by this sort of revolution than possibly it might have done to have had them even augmented through any other medium for besides my concern for your misfortunes my dear brother added he i have also labored under a certain delicate distress from the reflection that your alliance with my family had been the occasion of them  i then took an opportunity from this expression to mention a sentiment to him that my heart had for some days with difficulty restrained which was that the alliance he hinted at was not dissolved but devolved only and that i hoped he would henceforth consider himself as heir in his dear sisters place to share an equal benefit in my fortunes  he bowed but quick replied that he could not possibly think of accepting a thing he had no claim to in a case where even the gift could not confer a title as his sister he rejoiced to say it had left more rightful and more worthy heirs behind her  to which i answered that as i had in the first instance already dedicated my fortunes to love i could not think in the second of excluding friendship its younger brother from its share of the portion and that as virtue forms stronger connections than nature the fond tie which had once allied us would induce me ever to look upon him as a real brother if that title were not already comprehended under the higher and nobler one of friend  at length after several days traveling we arrived in london he recruited by the journey and i fatigued with the delay we passed the evening at the inn together the next morning he went down to windsor to wait upon his father and i called on the minister of st martins to settle with him about the effects committed to his charge  he came with me to the house and delivered me the will and keys the scene affected me i dropped tears of filial duty and felt my heart fill at the same time with pious gratitude toward the great dispenser of all earthly as well as heavenly blessings  chap xci upon looking into the situation of my affairs i found that the family suit which had subsisted for so many years had been ended the preceding term and the debentures for ten thousand pounds were lying on the desk with about three hundred pounds more in bills and cash  the will had bequeathed the entire fortune to me except two legacies of one hundred pounds apiece to each of my brothers the eldest of whom had been lately promoted to a troop of horse and the younger besides his employment had a little time before been married to a merchants daughter in the city with a fortune of four thousand pounds my sister had died in childbed about six months before  both my brothers happened to be in london at this time and came to condole with me upon our late loss i had always loved them affectionately and was much rejoiced to see them i laid the will before them and they very generously acquiesced in the disposition of it without the least jealousy or murmur they were both of them already well established in life and acknowledged the entire merit of it to be owing to my disinterested and fraternal kindness  i then paid each of them their legacy and made a present at the same time to my married brother of all the family plate which might be in value about an hundred pounds promising the captain also to pay him a like compliment whenever he should do me the pleasure to invite me to his wedding  in a day or two after my friend beville returned from windsor and told me that he had found his father in the greatest distress for his attorney had informed him that the laws could not possibly afford him any manner of relief for as he had disposed of the income of his employ during his life he could not possibly recover his office again and that as his deputy had sold his interest and retired to holland there was no remedy to be had against him neither  my friend left his father all the money he had about him and seemed to be extremely depressed upon this additional misfortune though i said every thing that friendship could suggest to support his spirits by entreating that he would suffer me to consider us all as of one family adding that in this instance too i might challenge it as a right as i had the honor of claiming his father as mine also  chap xcii i was impatient to see my dear children and to return my most grateful thanks to my valuable friend the clergyman but i could not think of revisiting any of those once happy scenes again which had prevented me from paying my duty at windsor also i therefore wrote a letter of acknowledgment to my friend entreating the favor of a visit from him at london and at the same time sent down a coach and four to bring him up with the children  they all arrived in town the next day and in this fond society the pleasures i enjoyed were so blended with those i had lost that i might be said to have truly felt that sad luxury to vulgar minds unknown so that i had but little advantage in this particular by shifting the scene while such strong remembrances stood still before me  poor bevilles health and spirits recruited not so fast as i had hoped for he was frequently absent in company and would sometimes suffer a whole morning to pass unmarked away without books or music and when he did play it was always in the andante pastorale or amoroso strain and when he read ovid catullus or petrarch were his studies  i took notice of this turn of mind to him and he seemed so alarmed at it himself that he laid aside music entirely as he acknowledged that harmony of any kind might be a dangerous solace in the present disturbed situation of his mind for that the soft airs but soothed his passion and the bolder ones served only to elevate its transports  he then began to apply himself to his former and severer studies but was soon interrupted in them by an illness which had the appearance of a milliary fever the physicians were called in and determined it to be a scorbutic humor which had been thrown into his blood by checking his late disorder too suddenly and suffering him to come abroad at so inclement a season before the dregs of his disease had been sufficiently purged away they prescribed him medicines and recommended the scarborough waters and seabathing to him as soon as the weather might permit  i took a hint from this advice to propose to my friend to take a journey with me immediately to scarborough and fix ourselves in some convenient situation near that town before the concourse of sick and gay who are generally so oddly coupled at all spas might render our accommodation difficult or inconvenient he readily accepted my proposal and after i had set off my house and disposed of the furniture by auction we set out together for this country  before i left london i sent my dear children back again to hertfordshire with my good friend the clergyman to whom at parting i made a present of a select collection of books value about two hundred pounds which had devolved to my father from his father and brother who were both of them persons of learning and had formed their libraries with judgment and care  i also wrote an invitation to mr beville at windsor to come and reside with us at scarborough during the season and then to accept of an apartment in whatever mansion i might afterward fix myself during our joint lives he wrote me an answer full of acknowledgments and promised to follow us as soon as he could sell the interest of his house and parks at windsor and dispose of his other effects  chap xciii my friend and i took lodgings at scarborough and about a month after old mr beville came to us with a debenture of five hundred pounds which he had realised out of the remnants of his reduced fortune he was very ill on his arrival languished for some time and at last expired of a broken heart as he confessed occasioned by the loss of his wife and his daughter together with that of his fortune  as soon as we had got to scarborough i began to inquire whether there was any place to be let near the town for i liked this country extremely well as we rode through it and the purpose which had occurred to my mind at london was now framed into a kind of resolution of settling myself somewhere hereabout  the only counties i had ever any acquaintance with were berkshire and hertfordshire and being now selfbanished from these all other places had become quite equal to me but this one had obtained a preference in my election upon my dear friends account because of its extreme distance from the still too charming ethelindas residence  i was informed of several houses and farms to be let and rode out to see them but as none of them happened to be situated near the sea i declined them all i considered in the first instance that they could not accommodate my friend with regard to one part of his prescription and i confess also that in the second i had all my life the highest relish for seaprospects and a desire to fix myself in some situation near the coast  there is something extremely awful and commanding in a view of the ocean which enlarges our ideas far beyond the richest landscape and in the contemplation of its uses properties movements and contents our minds and hearts become naturally elevated toward the greatness and goodness of providence at the same time  but i own that there is another sentiment much stronger than this which had always induced me to such a choice of situation and it is this that i might possibly have the good fortune after some horrid storm of supplying relief to some poor shipwrecked voyagers and of defending them also from the savage cruelties and inhumanities too frequently exercised by the greedy and lawless peasants upon all coasts against such unhappy objects of real distress and commiseration  at length i fixed upon this charming spot the rent of which farm was considerably abated on account of its not having the accommodation of a house or offices upon it which consideration being computed and added to the savings of alterations and repairs brings the expenses of this building almost within a saving upon the preference  i commenced this house on the first day of march last and as it was constructed with brick and wainscot it was rendered habitable by the first day of this month july when i entered into possession of it and shall very probably here fix my station for the remainder of my life  chap xciv when mr andrews had brought his story to a conclusion mr carewe made him a great many acknowledgments for the high entertainment it had afforded him he said that there were a great many interesting events in these memoirs even to an hearer but as a friend added he i could most sincerely have wished that they had been less rich of incidents by two very affecting particulars  my story continued he which by agreement you are entitled to exact will by no means return you the same amusement either in kind or degree you are not to expect from me a continued series my life has been too dissipated and extempore to afford much chain and may rather be styled a collection of incidents than a connection of events  i have been generally too much an individual of society and till a late crisis  whether happy or unfortunate added he with a sigh remains yet within the womb of time  there was not any person in the world who could either direct or govern give a consistent tenor or steady purpose to my life and actions which for the matter of them and following after yours and mr bevilles may be considered as a lively epilogue or a merry farce after a moving tragedy  my dear carewe replied mr andrews the most trifling particulars relating to one friend are interesting to another their passions their affections the same namely a mutual resentment of each others pains and pleasures  but this is a treat which i must not churlishly enjoy alone we have secluded my dear beville long enough from our retired converse already and if you will be so kind as to suffer him to form a triumvirate with us in our mutual confidence and friendship it will double my pleasure and satisfaction by affording to that unhappy man some kind of amusement and relief from his too fatal passion which in spite of time absence philosophy and virtue seems still to ingross too much his whole heart mind and affections  i most cordially agree to your proposal my dear andrews answered mr carewe for i should think myself but half your friend were i not wholly his nor do i in the least apprehend that the admitting this very worthy person a third in our union of souls can in a sort diminish our own mutual fondness toward each other but that we may then be considered rather as a triangle whose angles though they exceed not the quantity of two right ones serve however by this division to strengthen and support each other  when mr beville had returned from the spa he was made acquainted with this plan of amusement and received the motion with the utmost satisfaction for he had conceived an high esteem and affection for mr carewe from the story of his adventure with mr andrews which had possessed him with a fond and generous concern in the smallest matters which related to him  he therefore returned thanks to mr carewe for his kind concurrence with mr andrewss proposal and in order to leave mr beville still at liberty to continue his course of bathing their future evenings were fixed upon for this entertainment accordingly after dinner that day mr carewe commenced his memoir as you will find it written in the second volume  chap xcv i think it full time here mr reader to put a finis to the first volume of these memoirs in order to give you leisure to digest the matters herein contained and afford you opportunity also for a relection for believe me dear sir that no book is worth reading once which does not both require and deserve it twice  of writing of books there is no end said solomon  but whether he spoke literally of his own times as we have no cotemporary account of them except what he has been so communicative to hand down to us himself i cannot say but he has certainly spoken prophetically at least of ours if instead of writing you will give me leave after the manner of scholiasts to substitute copying in its place  for in reality what are the volumes that load our presses nowadays but transcripts transpositions or translations most of our modern writers have the impudence to steal even in the face of the living and the most modest of them are but robbers of the dead  this imposition on the public however is nothing new among us for our fathers and grandfathers have labored under the same grievance before us let us but look back into the amass of literature for half a century past and we shall hardly meet with any thing new except the type ink and paper nothing but former writings dressed up again and republished no work of genius no useful discovery except the hardy but ingenious attack upon longinus and one or two attempts toward discovering the longitude at sea if demonstrated  what are gassendis or any of the modern treatises on morals but extracts or paraphrases on the enchiridion on seneca or tully or derhams physics but compilations or compendiums of galileo boil descartes or newton works of learning and labor indeed but not of talents or genius  a person well grounded in a college course has at present nothing new to read except a very few writings of wit or humor and yet books are printed or rather reprinted every day which but vary or transpose the pages written in former centuries and only serve to puzzle and obstruct all science by opening different avenues to the same point and by inducing students to imagine the encyclopoedia to be more tedious and difficult than in reality it is  in fine we may venture to pronounce that the wisest man even at present as was once said by a learned ancient is he who has read the fewest books  provided he has but chosen them well for learning beyond certain limits but dulls the genius confounds the intellect and multiplies study without increasing knowledge  if an ingenious society of men would take the trouble of making a critical review of the mega biblion or tautology of learning and reduce it all into a digest i dare affirm that the whole compass of science physical philosophical theological political metaphysical and moral taking in the classics and poetics in all languages with all history that is worth reading for knowledge style or observation would not compose a library exceeding the purchase of fifty pounds and the whole study might be comprehended within a seven years college course  but then indeed i shall confess that there must be an entire reform also among the professors in each several branch with regard to their present prolix method of instruction for the proverb of ars longa should be more properly changed to artifices lenti and the rapid progress which some extraordinary and uneducated persons have been reported to have made in the arts and sciences might have been owing to their having instructed themselves more by reason than by rule  nor would this scheme be of the least disadvantage to the world in general for though some laborious dunces might by this means perhaps want bread unless much better employed in sowing and reaping it yet the useful and necessary trades of printers booksellers and stationers would still continue to thrive even better than before for there would then be a thousand libraries for one we have at present as men are often discouraged from making collections for want of proper catalogues to direct them where to begin and where to end  i know many persons of fortune who have not five pounds worth of books in their studies at present and those picked up by chance or inheritance and who would not give five shillings for five pounds worth more and yet would readily lay out fifty to purchase a complete library which if once pointed out and ascertained would be then deemed one of the appendages of fortune and grandeur even to those who cannot read as many furnish stables of horses which they cannot ride  finis appendix to the first volume of the triumvirate  if they will have a may pole why let them have a may pole vide tristram shandy volume first pages    and    volume third pages     and   0 volume sixth page     i must here ingenuously resign the palm to mr shandy in the novelty of this thought nor shall i in the least pretend to dispute any merit with him before modern readers by hinting that my conceit though poor has some little meaning in it  a catalogue of the several advantages and benefits which the publisher of these memoirs has received from the patronage hinted at in the two precedent pages   it made me a religious observer of the precept in scripture never to put my trust in man   it gave me the benefit of the ninth beatitude see pope  happy is he who expects nothing for he shall not be disappointed   it made me to depend upon my own industry and not upon anothers favor   it has taught me the safest economy in the world to trust to my own fortune though ever so small rather than to anothers though ever so large   it warned me too late never to run in debt for there are no sureties for the pauper   it has made me resolve never to breed a son to the church for without patronage merit will not avail in that profession as it may in physic or the law   it has instructed me in this useful lesson that    it has informed me also that  with regard to the two last articles i must be silent for the present as the reflections upon them point too strongly at certain persons who though their friendships freeze under the pole their resentments burn under the line si quid benefacias levior pluma gratia est at si quid peccatum est plumbeas iras gerunt there are such characters but have a little patience my good readers  i may outlive them and shall then speak out  for the maxim of de mortuis nil nisi bonum is not of authority sufficient to control the privileges of an historian but enough for the present
