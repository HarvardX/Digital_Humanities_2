the british visions or isaac bickerstaff sen  being twelve prophesies for the year       entered into the hallbook of the company of stationers  printed in the north and reprinted at london and sold by j baker at the blackboy in paternoster row      price   d  the preface in the year      isaac bickerstaff esquire the prophet who formrrly prophesied and foretold you so many remarkable things viz in the year   0  all which as is well known are most exactly come to pass and having by my knowledge and acquaintance for above one hundred years with the stars and with utmost diligence applied my self to know by the aspects of heavenly bodies and other methods also what shall happen on the earth i say that i the aforesaid isaac bickerstaff esquire am moved as well by astrological vision as the especial genius of those powers which influences human bodies to make known to the world what shall come to pass  by this prophetic skill i once amongst other well known events predicted and foretold you that john partridge the almanackmaker should die and be buried on or before such a day of the month which as you all know came to pass to a moment  having therefore obtained such an undoubted skill and judgment in these most useful and advantageous things i can no longer refrain from letting my countrymen of this nation know the great revolutions of kingdoms and states and the dreadful things that shall suddenly come to pass in the earth i am also the more earnestly moved to this great and wonderful undertaking because it is revealed to me by the same wonderful prophetic skill that such great and terrible things such surprising events and such dessolations are preparing in the world and shall come to pass this ensuing year as were never seen by the eyes of any living or would enter into the conceptions of any man to foretell had they not by an extraordinary acquired skill in knowing and determining such things been foreseen by me isaac bickerstaff esquire sen  and thus honest reader being nothing doubting of thy diligent attention to what i shall prophecy i bid thee farewell  the british visions or isaac bickerstaffs twelve prophesies for the year      prophecy i i shall begin my years of wonders as the course of nature begins it councils and confederacies act all the courts and princes of europe and the time of year is only for such things but as here the seeds of blood are sown the plentiful crop that is to follow derives from and is produced by the private combinations of men and devils to disturb the world  three scenes of council shall this month discover themselves in the world what the production or effects shall be of either of them i shall farther lay open in my next these are councils in this nation councils of france councils of mahomet  the councils of this nation shall produce great strife faction and malecontent stirs with heat and animosities among the several parties that are among us to the great encouragement of our enemies and to the great discouragement of good men yet the calmness and prudence of some shall lessen or at least protract the danger for a while disputes of ecclesiastic affairs shall embroil this island and those people who regard neither god nor devil shall make the greatest stir about religion every church however safe cries out they are in danger and the debauchees of the nation learn to play the pharisee and say to their neighbor stand off i am holier than thou  let europe tremble at what is contriving now in the cabinets of princes which like the seeds of distempers in the body will quickly break out in feavors fluxes cankers calentures and all the symbals of the bodily distempers of men in the politics of nations  france consults now how to support spain embroil the emperor bring home the swede restore bavaria doze savoy fright the dutch and divide the english and he will in some measure accomplish them all  the turk consults how to humble the muscovite subject the pole and keep fast the king of sweden but the swede will make a cats foot of the turk play him a slipery trick get out of his hands and leave him to fight with the muscovites and poles where the war shall be bloody cruel successful to neither side and only useful to show gods judgments on both  prophecy ii after consultations comes preparation this takes up all europe with the return of the spring every nation struggles with themselves to make their preparations for war formidable and with one another to be first ready for the bloody work they are about  the confederates attempt vigorously to succor king charles in spain but o the success  spain not yet ripe for deliverance resists her friends embraces her enemies and struggles hard against what she believes she must at last submit to  but this is not the generation that must enjoy the fruit of this strife the chiefs fight for the possession neither part obtain it both take their long journey before the war is over and the game at chess is left to posterity to play it out philip goes first i isaac bickerstaff elder having the second sight see the famous mausoleum for the young hero of bourbon in the escurial at madrid and there lies the hope of a crown yet the french monarch with the same obstinacy supports the war maintains the breach and prompts the spaniards still to defend themselves against their own happiness philip before he dies fights three battles with the confederates and is victor in two of them but dies in may and leaves the war to be carried on with less success than before should it be left to the merits of the persons philip deserves the crown of spain far better than chs as he appears active valiant brave and unwearied in the face of his enemies however he dies king and sleeps in peace though he never reigned so  now the swedes prepare to break out of pomeren and it appears that france and the swedes are in a strict confederacy and they shall be more fatal to europe than the league with the turk  the swedes sending forces from stockholm carry the plague into pomerania from whence it spreads to the utmost corners of europe kings and emperors shall fly from this dreadful enemy but find no recess plague finds them out and as war spreads pestilence goes hand in hand and both shall consume and destroy without mercy  europe is all busy in fitting out their armies the drums beat in every kingdom for soldiers not a prince or state in this whole part of the world but shall be embarked in the quarrels of europe and be engaged in war either as principal or as auxilary  the armies of france and spain are in the field first and much blood shall be shed in spain before the end of february the confederates struggle hard but things do not answer the expense  prophecy iii the preparations for war are finished now the troops on all sides appear in the field a third battle in spain  philips forces fly in their turn though no great advantage made of the victory in march the french make two great efforts upon the rhine one to join the swede who marches toward the elbe and the french toward saxony the other toward bavaria and the germans in no readiness to receive them suffer all manner of mischiefs  the dauphin of france dies the pope sickens and is very weak the duke of savoy relapses but the king of france more vigorous than ever pushes all before him the beginning of summer  a great prodigy appears in the east two kings struggling to make it appear which was the better christian he that changed his religion to gain a crown or he that flies to mahomet to recover his crown the turks advance now in three great armies and one battle is fought before the end of march in which the king of sweden gains some ground but is wounded in the action and makes no advantage of the battle  now the miserable fate of europe approaches the war begins in poland muscovy hungary on the rhine and in spain in flanders and savoy they cannot be ready so soon  a great battle on the frontiers of portugal in which the portuguese do as they use to do viz run away the spaniards ravage portugal ruin three provinces if these were not portuguese the spaniards had not had the victory and if these were not spaniards the portuguese would be no more a kingdom but the sloth of the spaniards saves portugal till england relieve her  a great minister of state dies in the month of march  england feels great want of trade great want of money and great loss of credit which puts her to many inconveniences but let her prepare for worse things than these  prophecy iv note in this place in the original manuscript the following paragraph was inserted which the printer in the north declined to put in for fear of giving offense  the words are these the house of austria feels a blow this month which changes the measures of europe the emperor resigns to fate and the choice both of a new emperor and new king of spain takes up the consultations of all the courts in christendom  the empire feels hard things beset on every side and weak in arms as well as confused in council the swedes and the french invade bavaria the hungarians supported by the turks recover all they have lost in hungary the french make a terrible eruption over the rhine the circles of swabia and franconia suffer incredible evils and blood famine and pestilence rages over the empire  the duke of bavaria restored to his dominions by the french dies of the plague in april and the affairs of that electorate come to some settlement by the succeeding of his son who has other things to mind than war the elector of cologn brother to the bavarian goes to see his brother reinstated but lives not to return to his own principality  the emperor retreats from vienna for fear of the turks and hungarians and goes to prague but the plague gets into bohemia and separates the imperial court some great princes die of that distemper also  in the month of april a great city in flanders besieged by the french but the confederates coming on they raise their siege they are made amends by surprising another strong town in the middle of the day a bloody action in flanders between part of the armies in which the french seem to have the advantage but decline coming to a decisive battle and draw off from the field death in this battle puts an end to the ambition of two or three great men on either side bousslers lies now in the bed of honor and his grace  shall bear him company into the other world so he that was envied before shall be pitied now for want of a rival  in the same april king philips forces bombard barcelona but relief comes to king charles and in his turn he chases them now the face of things change in spain and philips fate approaches  the danes now prepare to invade snen and make another fruitless attempt upon the king of swedens countries from whence they are again beaten and bring back poverty and the plague which not only visits their capital city but makes sad havoc in their court not excepting the royal family  the king of p demits his crown in favor of his son and submits to go the way of all princes this year is fatal to crowned heads  prophecy v now europe begins to tremble the people find an employment different from the war the living having work enough to bury their dead  by the end of may the various kinds of this new plague has touched most parts of europe the swedes as before bring it to pomeren thence they carry it to saxony via brandenburgh the saxons give it to the bohemians the bohemians to the bavarians they to the grisons and they again to the smiss  the hungarians bring it another way from poland and carrying it into croatia it crosses the adriatic to italy and siezes upon the venetian from thence it pushes into milan and visiting turin it passes through rome to the kingdom of naples and in spite of the interruption of commerce by the war crosses over into sicily  innumerable numbers of people shall perish by this desolating distemper yet the world as if the hand of heaven did not or could not destroy them fast enough still make war and the kings of the earth apply themselves to their ruinous designs with as much fury as ever  the king of sweden now appears in his own colors and shall in the month of may be in full march to enter poland if not germany but his army consisting of many nations new raised and undisciplined wastes away without much fighting and he may see that heaven does not bless his ambitious designs with success answerable to his expectations three of his greatest generals and in whom was his chief confidence die of the plague and though he gains some advantage he can make no great use of it his power being lessened by the other accidents of war  the turks and the muscovite   0000 men of a side draw toward one another but the decisive stroke is not yet many bloody skirmishes happen between the tartars and the cossacks against the muscovite  the month of may lays king philip low in spain and charles triumphs over his enemy a third time but his joy like all temporal things is but of a small duration the war in spain costs much money much blood much counsel but does not fully answer our end many a brave english man leaves his bones in that country whose blood might have been better spent  another bloody action between the armies on the side of germany in which much blood is lost and both sides give god praise for being beaten  this year is a year rather of blood than of victory no bleinhim no pultowa no decisive battle happens any where on this side hungary yet more men killed than would be in many such battles  prophecy vi as the hot weather comes on mens blood grows warm this subjects and exposes them to fatal mischiefs the plague of war and the war of plague italy and germany have by this time felt the fury of the contagion and dreadful ravages have been made in all the populous nations on that side  shall britain be free flatter not your selves with expectations of it many plagues visit this nation and whole parties of men suffer the infection all sorts of men shall die some politickly some really the grave makes no distinction of whigg or tory high or low church three bishops go off the stage first dukes earls barons and privycounsellors follow a great rot falls among the courtsheep and the murrain upon the stallions of this sodomitish city the infection spares none but alas for the sheepherds of our flocks they fly and leave their flocks to be scattered  but let them remember it from isaac bickerstaffs words the sheepherds that forsake the sheep committed to their charge shall fall in their flight when those that stay shall remain in this general desolation it is not difficult for me to name you persons by titles and sirnames that shall be infected with plagues of one sort and another whose eyes shall not see the end of these things but the number is too great and you cannot bear the distinction of persons at this time  let it be sufficient then to tell you your desolation is beyond expression and the number whose carcasses shall fall in this wilderness is not to be numbered  yet for the encouragement and support of the poor heaven promises plenty in the fields and there shall be no want of bread food shall increase though not the mouths that feed on it and what the sword or other plagues shall devour shall leave room for those that remain to live with more abundance  yet for all these terrors men shall not repent or abate their divisions their animosities their wars and pursuit of blood over the earth  about this time a terrible and bloody battle happens between the swedes and the french against the germans and much blood shed but the emperors affairs are not yet ripe for deliverance and he must be a second time saved by the protestant allies or be lost for good and all the french now master several towns and large territories and if ever bavaria is restored it is now  but strange resistance is preparing against those mischiefs though no effect is seen this year the next will produce something more effectual  prophecy vii now the world ripe for action is altogether by the ears and blood rages in all parts of europe france has gone on with too much success but receives a check vomits up much of his rapid conquests and by the vigor of the confederates is made to doubt whether he can keep his own or no yet he stoops not to make offers of peace but swells with pride and revenge germany seems to be a general scene of blood and finds it next to impossible to avoid falling into the war with the turks the swedes and french insult her in their turn and make three large incisions into her most tender parts  sweden grows great war and diffassection together with want of money and strength distresses the pole yet they fight with obstinacy against all the muscovite pushes the turk in his turn and revives things on that side but this year decides not the fate of poland the protestant interest gains nothing by this cruel war either in germany silesia and hungaria yet hopes and promises support them and they despair not yet  spain lies still now the sun keeps the peace there the excessive heats give a recess from action and gives time to our ungovernable soldiers to kill themselves with eating ripe grapes drinking new wine and gorging themselves with the luscious fruits of a luxurious climate a new general and new councils produce new effects there but the army suffers much by diseases for which we supply the grave with new recruits for the antum campaign  a rich plentiful harvest in britain makes the hearts of the country glad and britain proves this year the granary of europe a great increase and a good market revives our commerce but we want this relief for we have many losses abroad and dreadful diseases at home affecting the bodies or minds of the people  prophecy viii among the several armies that range europe none escape a most bloody action but these in flanders the swedes the poles the muscovites the turks the germans make war not after the new but the old fashion and fight as it were by mutual consent wherever they meet so that every post now brings news of battles and slaughter about august the turks and muscovites fight a terrible battle victory mocks both sides and both sides mock the world with their pretenses to it yet the turks appear sooner in the field again and seem to feel the loss least tho they have most men in the roll of slaughter  if the real plague spreads near us it is this same month god preserve our populous towns from such a stroke the desolation of dantzick where yet they tell us a fifth part of the people perished will be a fleabite to what we must suffer but the prophet tells you if you escape this year you should not flatter your selves about the next  germany may expect a bloody campaign if the swedes are beaten in poland for if that monarch finds his work hard on that side he increases his stength for diversion on another denmark seems this year to borrow the old character of the muscovites neither fit for war or peace for they make nothing of their attempts any where and are beaten every where  a fruitless war upon the alps where men fight with mountains and rocks are frighted with snow and torrents of water struggle hard with nature and art and go home with little or nothing  prophecy ix spain moves again about september and the armies though weaknened by fluxes and fevers draw out now if at all charless affairs revive yet the french struggle hard and part with what they lose but by inches two bloody actions weaken both sides and they take breath a while but charless gains ground though with great loss of men  france supplies spain with men spain france with money great advantages arrive from the supplies both receive from the west indian treasures and great losses befall some people the latter end of the summer by sea to the discouragement of trade and ruin of the merchants  another terrible battle in the northern countries the muscovite grows strong by being beaten and the swede weak by victory the turk makes great havoc in europe and ravages great part of poland hungary begins to stir and the emperor feels the effects of suffering his neighbors to grow too powerful but is too weak to do any thing considerable having enemies on every side  france ends the campaign inglorious on every side and though he has not so much loss this year as he has formerly met with yet finds himself languish under the expense his kingdom wasting exhausted and gasping and makes overtures of a treaty but it comes to nothing for want of sincerity  prophecy x the flux of blood abates the season about october enclines the parties out of breath with a long campaign to draw off and give over in dauphine the germans dare not stay to act on this side the alps or the french on the other for fear of being cut off from their retreat by the snow on the mountains so they end the campaign with mutual loss mutual mischief and having mutually done nothing worth notice  the swedes push still on fighting against elements as well as enemies with invincible obstinacy and resolve to winter in the heart of poland a country wasted by war and more likely to starve the armies in their quarters than refresh them  cold weather freezes up the plague and the desolations of that kind abate but let them not comfort themselves with the notion of a deliverance from it because of an intermission  the armies on the rhine and in flanders separate and may cast up their accounts if they please they find on every side loss and decay of strength much blood much treasure spent many nations ravaged and ruined and the end of the campaign looks still but like the beginning of the war yet spain has no recess but both sides prepare for a winter war here we begin to see a new turn and king charles may bid fair for a third visit to madrid yet he keeps not all he gains and treaty rather than battle seems to be the end of that war at last  prophecy xi the generals now come home make their report exalt the merits of their own actions emulate and decry one another and the unfortunate bear the load of ill conduct according to the custom and usage of mankind  the active part of the war being quite over they stand still and take breath awhile till the winter quarters being settled the great ones come to lay their heads together for the next year  some further abortive conceptions of peace appear in the world amuse the parties a while and then vanish again yet on the one side of europe a formal treaty begins is carried on with cunning and insincerity on both sides and ends in renewing the war  spain is still the seat of action we gain ground but lose a world of men and some relief miscarries which disappointment retards the proceedings and baulks a very hopeful prospect yet they push hard and have hopes of success a great province revolts and changes hands which gives a new turn to things but want of strength delays finishing the work this year and before that defect is supplied some ground is lost again  prophecy xii now the world enters into council parliaments assemblies of estates regencies divans grand councils of war meeting of generals and mareschals take up all the nations of europe nothing of peace is heard among them but carrying on the war with vigor is the word taxes for raising money and money for raising men filling of magazines refitting of navies and recruiting armies is the language of all this part of the world  would the great men of europe bring all their accounts together would they cast up their accounts and bring the balance of the whole to one foot of profit and loss the madness of mankind would appear monstrous and be seen in its own colors a million of lives have been lost this year by war pestilence and famine vast treasures exhausted beyond the possibility of account countries wasted cities ruined villages burnt frontiers plundered yet the nations of europe prepare to carry on the furious quarrel as if nothing but the destruction of mankind was in their design in spain the war goes on still and winter gives no recess a warm action concludes the year in which both sides suffer loss the confederates have the advantage yet no great gain is made of the matter the war is pushed on with great animosity and indefatigable vigor of the commanders with great loss of blood on both sides but this year gives no view of the end  the conclusion thus have i bickerstaff the aged given you a view of this fatal year that is yet to come the sum of the matter lies in a few heads france gains at first by exerting her self with uncommon vigor but loses again both her glory and her advantages before the end of the campaign britain is at a vast expense rather gains than loses but not suitable to her occasion any more than to her expectation the muscovite suffers vast losses yet gains ground the swedes gets victory with little profit the turks makes great spoil with very little gain the poles have some advantages by which they are ruined the empire is delivered from peace the dane by want of success delivered from the war   on every side europe is afflicted plagued harassed and ravaged by the war and yet sees no end of her sorrows what shall befall her in the year to come shall be also foretold in its season by me  isaac
