letters from snowdon descriptive of a tour through the northern counties of wales containing the antiquities history and state of the country with the manners and customs of the inhabitants   toto divisos orb britannos london printed for j ridley in st jamessstreet and w harris no  0 st pauls churchyard mdcclxx  preface letter from a friend to the author sir as you desire my opinion of your letters from snowdon which you intend to publish it is a duty i owe to friendship to give it with freedom and impartiality without descending to a minute criticism on particular passages i shall observe in general upon the substance of the work and the manner in which it is written  in describing the manners and customs of the inhabitants you represent them as a strange compound of virtue and vice you describe the country as uncultivated and the inhabitants in an inferior degree of civilization than the english however just your observations and description may be yet the people of that country at least will think that the picture is not a true representation of them it will be well if you do not meet with a fluellin who will oblige you to undergo the punishment inflicted on ancient pistol by eating the leek and you may be compelled as ignominiously to say quiet thy cudgel thou do see i eat it  the asperity with which you have in some places treated the country is not the only reprehensible part of your letters your work contains some moral reflections contrary to the received opinions of mankind add to these objections that your letters are written with so much negligence inequality and inaccuracy of style that you must expect the abuse of malevolence and the scourge of criticism  if you had studied to please the taste of the public your work ought to have abounded in imitation of the modern compositions with antitheses abrupt transitions and what the fashionable writers and readers call sentiment however difficult it may be to explain what is meant by the word sentiment yet is it esteemed the criterion of merit by which every modern publication is judged sermons plays poetry history must all have enough of this ingredient to please the public it is the fashionable sal atticum which renders the composition palatable  as you have desired my opinion you must excuse the freedom with which i give it and i sincerely wish the public judgment may prove more favorable than that of  your friend and servant etc  answer to the foregoing letter sir when an author can bear with patience to hear his writings censured he gains a victory over his vanity my obligations are due to you even for the severe censure your letter contains as it will prepare me for the public opinion unfavorable as it may prove you will allow me however to say something in vindication of what you have treated with so much severity  i did not sit down to draw a caricature nor to decorate the object with beauties which it had not however deformed a portrait may be if it is like the person for whom it was intended the painter is justified in delineating the manners and customs of the country their virtues are painted as well as vices and in neither is there a deviation from truth in whatever they have merited praise i have gladly seized the opportunity of doing them justice and whenever it has fallen within my province to censure it is done with decency and candor  your observations on my language and style may perhaps be better founded i freely own that they are not written with labored accuracy i have studied neither sentiment nor wit classical purity consists in ease and perspicuity not in labored sentences and an affected rotundity of period which seems to be the present fashionable mode of writing a modern reader would not hesitate to prefer the style and manner of seneca to the purest writer in the augustan age  some of these letters are upon subjects of importance to the principality of wales and have been written with a view to engage the attention of such as are concerned the rest of these epistolary observations were written to friends for amusement only and their publication may be less owing to the authors vanity than their request  secure of candor if not indulgence no apology shall be made for their publication though an entertainment cannot be provided agreeable to every taste yet i shall continue to hope that most readers will find some gratification for their amusement or curiosity in the perusal of these letters  i am sir etc  contents letter i introductory observations on the marches of wales etc letter

letter i dear sir i have no reason to regret the length of my journey it has been embellished with such an infinite diversity of objects so enchanting to one whose prospects have been confined to the unvariegated scenes of nature unattended and unadorned by her handmaid art she appears without deceit in all her native charms sometimes in the gay attire of fertile vales and woods or in the plainer dress of mountains cataracts and craggy precipices more beautiful by change and more pleasing by variety  since i have left the busy scenes of life i have now the first opportunity of sending you the promised account of my tour into this country i will omit no circumstance that fell within my observation which i shall think may prove either curious or entertaining  in a journey of three days from the metropolis i arrived at chester on the banks of the river dee the castle which seems to have been curious neither for elegance or strength is in a ruinous condition the walls of the town are in good repair there is a pleasant walk upon them from whence we have an extensive circular prospect here we had a distant view of the welsh mountains those natural fortresses which so long secured the independence of the inhabitants these made a formidable appearance to one who intended so soon to scale their craggy summits the prospect we had from hence was a perfect contrast on one side the beautiful vales of cheshire clad in all the blooming verdure of spring on the other the cambrian hills still wearing the hoary garb of winter  chester was anciently the residence of the kings of wales its situation on the frontiers of england and wales was most convenient to repel the incursions of the saxons in the ancient british language it is called caer all the derivations of the welsh words which the reader will find in the following pages are inserted upon the authority of a gentleman conversant in the language  which signifies a walled or fortified place from whence or the latin word castrum its presumed the present name is derived long after the britons or welsh were dispossessed of england by the saxons they still retained great part of the level country on the borders of wales which was part of mercia afterward called the marches of wales  the marches of wales comprehended the greatest part of the counties of chester salop hereford and worcester they were claimed both by the saxons and the britons and possessed by either as the fortune of war prevailed they were the scenes of continual wars and devastation it was the wise policy of the times to give large estates to men of distinguished valor to preserve the frontier counties from rapine and violence who were called lordsmarchers they had great numbers of men under their command who swore fealty to them and were under their direction upon all occasions their power was so great that they might rather be considered as petty princes than subjects  egbert it is said of egbert that he was rowed on the river dee by nine kings  who reduced the saxton heptarchy took chester from the princes of wales since which time it has always been accounted as part of england in the time of king offa the welsh lost the greatest part of the marches with a view either to prevent their incursions into their frontier counties or to mark the boundaries he made a great dyke called offas dyke in the british language claudh offa which is remaining in many places at this time this was built probably with the same intent as the great wall between england and scotland and that between china and tartary offas dyke extends from the river dee at chester to the wye at chepstow its direction gives us reason to think it was intended to confine the welsh to the mountains as its general course runs on the sides of the hills  the character of the inhabitants of north wales the ordovices of the romans was even by the testimony of their enemies that of a brave and warlike people they preserved their independence for centuries against the continued attempts of a great and powerful people to subdue them whether this may with greater propriety be attributed to their natural bravery to the situation of their country or to their want of such things as tempt the ambition of conquerors i shall leave undecided certain however it is that the saxons continually made the greatest efforts to conquer them instigated perhaps more by a principle of revenge for the ravages they committed on the borders of england than by any advantages they could derive from the conquest of such a country  be this as it may they were in an almost uninterrupted state of war such an innate principle of enmity and antipathy subsisted between the two nations that the cruelties perpetrated by either side as the chance of war decided equalled those of the most savage nations this enmity is traditional and the common people in a great degree retain it inveterate to this day whenever they speak of an englishman whom they still call saes or saxon they always join some opprobious epithet  it is not certain at what time the britons were first called by the name of welsh nor from whence the word has its derivation some historians say that wallia wales wallia comes of the saxon wealh which signifies peregrinus for the saxons so called them for in troth they were strangers to them being the remains of the old and ancient britons a wise and warlike nation inhabiting the west of england vide lambert this derivation seems not improbable and it may be remarked in confirmation of it that wealt signifies in the welsh barbarous or wild comes from italia as the britons were descendants of eneas others that welsh come from gaulish as they were descended from the gauls nothing is more uncertain than etymological learning especially if we have no other foundation than similarity of sound it is the disgrace of science i shall not risk even a conjecture upon the subject from whatever origin the word welsh may be derived it is not unreasonable to suppose it to be a term of reproach fixed on them by the saxons as they never call themselves by that name but always cymry some likewise are weak enough to derive the word cymry from cimbri imagining that they originally descended from that people all these derivations i look upon as vague and groundless conjectures i choose to avoid adopting any such for in my opinion the names of different nations are generally more owing to casual events than they are descriptive of either their descent or country  in a future letter i propose sending you some historical account of this people  i am etc  letter ii you may with justice my dear friend complain of my last letter it contained observations on subjects unimportant and unentertaining to the greatest number of readers have patience sir a reader must sometimes like a traveller put up with bad as well as good accommodations if the landlord does his endeavor to please his guest ought to be satisfied if the first stage is but indifferent he must pursue his journey patiently in hopes of better entertainment at the next  at chester we provided ourselves with the necessary equipment of a welsh poney and procured a guide who likewise served us in the capacity of an interpreter we set out from chester ruminating on our intended tour and forming in our imaginations as many dangers and difficulties as hannibal met with in crossing the alps we were however agreeably deceived in our first days journey for we had an extraordinary good road and in about three hours we came to holywell as we traveled we had a prospect of the town and castle of flint with the castle of haywarden and the seat of sir john glynne neither of which in my opinion merit a particular description  holywell or as it is called in the british language trefynnon i e the town of the well is a neat small town situated on the side of a hill at the bottom of which is the famous well of st winifred from whence the town derives its name the well is surrounded with very high hills on every side to which may be attributed the amazing spring of water it flows according to the relation of the inhabitants at the rate of a ton a minute all the miraculous powers of healing attributed to these waters are ascribed to their patroness st winifred so great is the veneration in which she is held by those of the romish persuasion that in honor of her they to this day perform pilgrimages to holywell you would not excuse me were i to relate to you all the strange stories recorded of st winifred by the monkish legendary writers these serve only to show the superstition of those times and create disgust in a modern reader  from holywell we traveled through a very indifferent road to rhyddlan a miserable village situated on the borders of a very extensive marsh the only thing for which it is remarkable is a castle built by henry ii the castle is extensive not well situated nor constructed with taste or elegance and seems to have been stronger by art than nature it is more decayed than the generality of castles built in wales about the same period some authors of considerable repute have asserted that the castle of rhyddlan was built by edward i as well as those of carnarvon conway and beaumaris it is reasonable to suppose otherwise for its structure is exceedingly different from those which he built the reason that the statutum walliae or the ordinances respecting wales were enacted at rhyddlan was most probably owing to the other castles not being then finished  the fertile vale of clwyd extends from rhyddlanmarsh to the town of rhythin which is about fifteen miles it is one of the most pleasant and fertile vales in the whole kingdom it has three considerable towns st asaph denbigh and rhythin the former is not remarked for beauty or situation it is the sea of a bishop and has a good cathedral  denbigh is situated upon a fine eminence on which arise the turrets of a majestic castle it is in ruins but the very ruins are venerable great part of the hall is still standing which the rude inhabitants mistake for the ruins of a church the remains of the hall give the traveller an idea of the grandeur of the place i do not find by whom this castle was built but i conjecture william rufus as he sent a colony to denbighland  the prospect from the castle is most enchanting beneath the vale of clwyd displays her bosom profusely gay to the admiring spectator the banks of the river clwyd decorated with seats the towns of rhythin and st asaph with the mountains rising at a distance form a most delightful view  rhythin is a more populous and opulent town than denbigh and consists of better houses but in point of situation is far inferior there are here the ruins of a castle but so much defaced by the hand of time that nothing can be discerned which attracts the notice of a traveller  the counties of denbigh and flint are rich and populous the low country is very fertile and in most places well cultivated and improved the english manners and customs are pretty much adopted especially by the inhabitants of the vale country who seem to be in general of saxon and norman extraction as appears by those names being common in that country great part of flintshire was very early in the possession of the english and denbighland in the vale of clwyd was likewise colonied by some of the first princes of the norman line  the inhabitants of the mountainous country still retain the ancient british language and customs unadulterated with any foreign tongue so great is the difference between the inhabitants of the mountains and the vales that they would be taken to be natives of different countries and climates different not only in their manners and customs but even in their very complexion and persons  i have now finished the observations i made in my tour through the counties of flint and denbigh  i am etc  letter iii dear sir the character of the ancient inhabitants of this country is given us in very unfavorable terms by many historians the english in those times were almost always in a state of war with this people and were biassed by their interest and passions to represent them in the most odious colors giraldus cambrensis whose connections and descent might have prejudiced him in favor of this country failed not to pay court to henry ii by traducing the welsh what is still more extraordinary the accurate and ingenious lord lyttleton has implicitly adopted the character given of them by the false and infamous giraldus they are represented by these historians as having no kind idea of chastity promiscuous concubinage they say was in a manner allowed and no stigma fixed upon it if my lord lyttleton had consulted howel dhas code he would there have seen how highly they disapproved of even the appearances of an unlawful commerce between the sexes i shall transcribe only one passage which fully proves what i have said si faemina convicta fuerit criminis turpis cum alieno viro patrati nempe osculationis vel contractationis vel adulterii viro suo licet illam repudiare et illa omittet dotem integram sibi primitus a viro suo assignatam si tantum exosculata fuerit si a caeteris absit by the same laws if a man betrothed a woman who did not prove to be a virgin he was at liberty to repudiate her thus we see how cautiously the welsh laws guarded the morals of the women and how unjustly they were accused by giraldus and those that have asserted the same on his authority the manners of every uncivilized nation are in some degree similar sixteen hundred years ago the inhabitants of wales were nearly in the same state of civilization as the american savages are at this day we are told of joseph of arimetheas coming to britain to plant the gospel this depends upon the authority of the monkish historians who scarce contain a word of truth or probability but it is allowed that some kind of christianity was planted very early in britain before the coming of the saxons long after the saxons came over they continued pagans whilst the britons according to these historians enjoyed the light of the gospel before these britons were converted to christianity one would think it was necessary to convert them from savages to men from the accounts that i have read by their conversion to christianity no more is meant than their being baptized without so much as the imparting of any kind of faith or knowledge this is precisely the case with the modern missionaries who send accounts of the conversion of thousands who have only been ceremoniously baptized without christian instruction  in the time of henry ii the inhabitants of wales were so deplorably dark that they could not with the least propriety be called christians and many of them even professed pagans the donquixot archbishop with his sanchopancha giraldus went upon an expedition to convert these heathens the archbishop preached to the poor welsh in latin they were baptized kissed the cross and so the mission ended to their no small edification  so late as the reign of elizabeth if we may believe penry there were but two or three that could preach in the whole principality of wales some of late years have greatly promoted the cause of religion by the translation of pious books into that language and distributing them among the poor there is still great room for improvement as they are not only in want but desirous of religious knowledge  in former times the inhabitants of wales were described to be a nation of soldiers every man being obliged to take up arms in times of distress thus though a small country they could bring large armies to the field they used very lightarmour as they carried on the war by incursions and forced marches and conquered their enemies rather by surprise than strength or courage  they had only a small target to defend their breast and used the javelin as a weapon of offense thus armed and thus defended they were no way equal to the english in a pitched battle who fought with heavy armor helmets and targets and armed at all points  they always fought on foot like all undisciplined soldiers they made one furious onset which if resisted they were immediately put in confusion and could not be rallied they fled to the mountains where they waited for another opportunity to fall upon their enemies  they despised trade and mechanical arts as they in general do to this day though they had no money among them yet there were no beggars in the country for they were all poor they are described to have been impetuous in their disposition fickle revengeful and bloody but let it be remembered that this character is given them by their enemies  their superstition was excessive they paid the greatest veneration to their priests and looked upon them and their habitations as sacred  i have endeavored sir to give you some short account of the manners of the ancient inhabitants of this country as described by the most authentic historians i must now conclude etc  letter iv dear sir in a former letter i gave you a description of my journey from chester to denbigh permit me now sir to proceed in the account of my tour  from denbigh we traveled through a hilly country till we arrived at conway which is about twentyfive miles distant conway castle was built by edward i and is the admiration of all that see it for situation elegance strength and grandeur it is perhaps unrivalled it is situated on a high rock above the sea and moated on the land side there are ten round towers in the castle and four turrets that are considerably higher than the towers the walls are battlemented and are from twelve to fifteen feet in breadth when we enter into the castle we are struck with the view of a grand arched hall with handsome niched windows this hall is entire it is a hundred feet long thirty wide and thirty high and the roof supported by nine arches of stone the external part of the castle remains entire as in edward i time except one tower which has tumbled into the sea by part of the rock giving way on one side of the castle is a high hill covered with a fine coppice of wood on the other we have a prospect over the river of some considerable seats which make a beautiful appearance the whole town is surrounded by a wall and so strongly fortified was this place that before the invention of cannon it must have been absolutely impregnable  i must not omit acquainting you that the inns at conway are the worst and most extravagant upon this road which hint may be of service to you in case you should travel this way  the town of llanrwst is about ten miles distant from conway the road to it leads through a beautiful little vale environed by mountains that scale the heavens  llanrwst contains nothing remarkable except a bridge built by inigo jones this town claims the honor of being the place of his nativity the elegant structure of the bridge leaves us no room to doubt the masterly hand of the architect  from conway we passed over that stupendous rock called penmaenmawr the road passes along the side of the mountain both beneath and above the road there are horrid precipices with fragments of rock impending over the terrified traveller such roads appear tremendous to one who has been used to travel a level country but the inhabitants make nothing of riding on the very brink of a precipice after a thaw of snow or a heavy fall of rain the loose rocks sometimes give way and roll with convulsive ruins into the sea carrying with them the wall built for the travellers security a considerable part of this wall was thrown down when we passed it is said that a road is soon to be built under the mountain through the sea for which two thousand pound i am informed is granted by parliament  such as travel from chester to holyhead sometimes go by a place called bwlchyddaufain thereby avoiding conway and penmaenmawr this is nearer by six or eight miles but an exceeding bad mountainous road and which i would not advise the traveller to take  bangor is about twenty miles distant from conway at low water we have a pleasant ride over the sands it is a small town agreeably situated in a little vale there was anciently a friary near this town where the monks retired from bangorissacoed in denbighshire upon the massacre the remains of the friary are converted into a free grammar school which is pretty well endowed and is in a very flourishing state it is said that the famous owen glendowr was buried in this cathedral and his grave is shown there at this time  the town of carnarvon so called from its situation caer arfon i e a walled town opposite anglesey is about eight miles from bangor and stands pleasantly situated on the banks of the menai it has a noble castle built by edward i where his queen was brought to bed of edward ii they show the queens bedchamber to all travellers that visit this castle it is built in the roman style of architecture it has one tower eminent above the rest called the eagles tour from an eagle carved upon it the town is surrounded by a wall and seems to have been well fortified for those days i have heard it remarked that there are few gentlemen but a great number of widows that live here in this country the women in general survive the men and the reason of it does not seem to be very problematical  i am sir etc  letter v virtue my dear friend is not the inhabitant of whoever denies this position let him read the account of the hottentots the tartars and the savages of asia and america when first discovered uncivilized countries she is not confined to scenes of solitude nor always found in the unfrequented vales of rural retirement virtue is a plant that flourishes not in the untoward soil of nature uncivilized and is often more an exotic in a country village than in the crowded streets of populous cities  the innocence of manners described by the poets in the primaeval ages of mankind had existence only in their own imagination man in a natural state has no other desire or thought but the gratification of his wants he feels only the impulses of nature and yields to those feelings if we my define virtue to be a resistance in a certain degree to the force of our natural propensities he knows not nor acknowledges any such power nature alone is his empress he feels her sway and pays obedience to her commands  the ideas of beauty and merit the one arising from personal the other from mental accomplishments depend upon abstract reasonings and comparisons formed in the mind the farther we are removed from a state of civilization the less capable are we of forming these ideas love therefore in its refined state kindled by the flame of beauty and founded on the solid basis of personal merit must consequently be peculiarly the characteristic of civilized nations hence the very meaning of the term considered as the tender sympathy of congenial souls is never known in many countries the asiatics africans americans and dutch are altogether strangers to any such idea they car fix no other signification to the word love than that passion which nature wisely implanted in all animals preventive of the annihilation of their species they have no predilection for any object the person is no consideration with them if the end nature had in view is answered they are satisfied thus they avoid all those inquietudes arising from personal predilection the prolific source of jealousies and animosities which disturb the peace of society  these observations may not be altogether inapplicable to the people whose manners i am describing i do not find that either of the sexes are capable of forming any violent attachment or personal affection all are to them indifferent except where fortuitous external causes have destroyed their equality  in all countries custom has established some forms previous to connubial connections in many places custom acts the part of an inexorable tyrant whose rigid commands we must implicitly obey here she bears a milder sway i will not offend the ear of delicacy with a description of what had better be concealed i may say that in general the women discover such prognostics before they enter into the marriage state as denote they will not be unfruitful members of society nor does custom stamp the opprobious stigma of infamy upon such an appearance  the ceremonies attending the marriages of these people may afford you some entertainment as they are different from any thing of the kind that may have fallen within your observation  the bridegroom on the morning of the wedding accompanied with a troop of his friends as well equipped as the country will allow comes and demands the bride her friends who are likewise well mounted on their merlins the welsh word for a little mountain horse  give a positive refusal to their demands whereupon a mock scuffle ensues between the parties the bride is mounted on one of the best steeds behind her next kinsman who rides away with her in full career the bridegroom and his friends pursue them with loud shouts it is not uncommon to see on such an occasion two or three hundred of these merlins mounted by sturdy cambrobritons riding with full speed crossing and jostling each other to the no small amusement of the spectators when they have pretty well fatigued themselves and their horses the bridegroom is permitted to overtake his bride he leads her away in triumph as the romans did the sabine nymphs they all return in amity and the whole is concluded with festivity and mirth  let us now view the women in the very essential characters of wives and mothers you would naturally suppose that a young woman who had wihtout fear or restraint enjoyed an almost unbounded liberty in a single state would not be easily debarred from enjoying the same in the married but the case is the very reverse infidelity to the bed of hymen is scare ever known or heard of in this country adultery is a weed that grows in the rank soil of a court fostered by luxury and vanity  mankind form an untrue judgment from external appearances those are esteemed virtuous who have had their education in a boarding school or nunnery persuaded i am the case is quite different the greater number of shackles with which we fetter human nature the more she strives to gain her native freedom forbidden pleasures are coveted whilst those within our reach are neglected the various methods of confinement in foreign countries makes their taste for illicit pleasures more poignant and incites them to run risks for their gratification when you indulge them in the power you in some degree take away the temptation to vice  in the character of wives the women of this country are laborious industrious and chaste in that of mothers they nurture their robust offspring not in sloth and inactivity but enure them early to undergo hardships and fatigues  let the fair daughters of indolence and ease contemplate the characters of these patterns of industry who are happily unacquainted with the gay follies of life who enjoy health without medicine and happiness without affluence equally remote from the grandeur and the miseries of life they participate of the sweet blessings of content under the homely dwelling of a strawbuilt cottage  adieu my friend etc  letter vi dear sir in giving a general description of the manners of this country i would always be understood to except many individuals who happily cannot be included under the general character during my continuance here i have met with some possessed of every virtue that can adorn humanity such as do honor to human nature in all countries are but few when compared to those that disgrace it here the number is not less proportionate  however my respect for a few individuals might incline me to speak partially of the country the sacred regard i bear to the cause of truth stops my pen she commands me to represent them as they are nothing extenuate nor set down ought in malice  the country gentlemen in england or rather let me say esquires an appellation they esteem more honorable and i own more suitable have been generally represented not unjustly as a set of beings who have no other employment or diversion except that of the chase and the glass they spend the whole morning in the one and the evening in the other without learning and without knowledge their minds like their estates lie fallow and unimproved the entertainment of the animal is their only business while the man is neglected the fable of the centaurs is literally verified in this class of beings for the beast runs away with the man as the objects of their attention are confined so are their ideas and the topics of their conversation  i will not say the squires in wales differ materially from those of the same rank in england except that they are more devoted to the jolly god for like the thracians of old when a stranger comes among them they will do him the honors of the house in every house that i visited in wales they had a capacious horn or other enormous utensil which they obliged every man to drink that came filled with cwrw the welsh word for strong ale  by obliging him to drink intemperately and will at least expect him to make a compliment of his reason in return for their hospitality they have however some good qualities in a greater degree than the english they keep better houses employ a greater number of poor are less avaritious and far more charitable  the clergy are in general the only people that have any knowledge of letters to qualify them for orders they have the advantage of a good school education and spend a considerable time at the university it is the general and i believe well founded complaint of the country that they return from thence very little improved in their morals or learning a certain air of pedantry accompanied with vain assurance and the acquisition of some fashionable vices are too often the only means of distinguishing such as have had an university education  an academy under proper regulations in the country would i think be a more suitable place for instructing youth for the church it would be attended with less expense and greater care might be taken of their morals and religion the principal object  most of the clergy have two or three churches each to serve and consequently it is impossible the duty should be properly discharged evening prayers are seldom read and in many places they scarce ever preach the benefices are for the most part of pretty considerable value being a decent maintainence for a clergyman except in a few towns and on the borders of england the service of their churches is performed altogether in the welsh or old british tongue  the yeomanry and peasants are very civil and obliging in their behavior they have not the ferocious disposition which characterises the english flowing from that spirit of liberty and independence which animates the soul of an englishman they are shrewd and artful in their dealings they have an inveterate rooted antipathy to all foreigners especially english and irish if a stranger is so unfortunate as to go and live amongst them they look upon him with a jealous eye as one who comes with an intent to deprive them of their subsistence  the manner of living of the lower class of people is extremely poor the chief of their subsistence being barley and oat bread they scarce ever eat flesh or drink any thing but milk they are not of that passionate and choleric temper as the english describe them but slow deliberate and wary in their speech and conduct and submissive in their disposition i know not whether to attribute it to their manner of life or to the great power the squires exercise over them certain it is that the people of this country in general have no greater idea of english liberty than the peasants of france  i am sir etc  letter vii dear sir in my two last letters i endeavored to give you some idea of the manners of this people i shall reserve the disagreeable task of finishing the portrait till another opportunity let us now vary our subject and contemplate the face of nature which however rugged her appearance may be affords a more pleasing prospect than the rude and uninformed heart of man  from carnarvonshire we crossed over the menai into the island of anglesea it is called the river menai though in fact it is an arm of the sea seperating anglesea from carnarvonshire in the narrowest part it is about the same breadth as the thames at westminsterbridge the principal town in the island is beaumaris it received this name in the time of edward i who built the castle and is derived from the french beaumarais beaumarais signifies in french a fine marsh the situation of this town exactly corresponds with this derivation part of paris which is situated very low is called dumarais i e of the marsh  which language was then prevalent and is descriptive of its situation a fine green lawn before the town from whence we have a charming prospect of the carnarvonshire mountains with a haven of the sea renders this place delightful the town is in a declining condition before liverpool became so great a mart this place carried on a considerable trade which it has now entirely lost it consists of two or three good streets better built than the greatest number of welsh towns the castle is not to be compared to those of carnarvon and conway for beauty though perhaps nor inferior in point of strength  baronhill the seat of lord bulkeley is situated upon an eminence about half a mile distant from the town it commands an extensive and very beautiful prospect the house is not to be admired but i prefer the situation to any that i have seen in wales  from beaumaris we traveled through the whole extent of the county till we came to holyhead which stands on a promontory in the remotest corner of the island this little town is a seaport where the dublin packets are stationed it is a place of considerable resort populous and in a flourishing state  we had a very unpleasing journey from beaumaris to this place the roads were exceeding deep our horses sunk into the clay so that it was with the utmost difficulty we traveled but the turnpike roads in this county are not inferior to any in the kingdom during our whole days journey we scarce saw a tree or a gentlemans seat the face of the county affords a disagreeable and melancholy prospect though the land is said to be rich and fertile  curiosity induced me to view the seat of the ancient british princes aberfraw but how much were my expectations disappointed it is a little country village without any remains of grandeur or monuments of antiquity that i could discern  i was told that part of the wall of the kings palace was converted into a barn it is astonishing how the princes of north wales could have chosen such a situation for their residence eligible for no reason that can now be conceived  from aberfraw we crossed the sands and came to a corporation town called newborough this place had a right of returning a member to serve in parliament which they have lost for some years it appeared to me to be an exceeding poor place but i was told that the inhabitants were all so industrious that there was not a beggar in the whole place and indeed we did not find that any one asked alms of us a circumstance not very common in little country towns  the last place we visited in the island of anglesea was the seat of sir nicholas bailey it is built in the gothic style with great elegance and state its situation on the banks of the menai with a prospect of the mountains at a distance renders it the admiration of all who see it after our tedious journey through the island we were agreeably entertained with the vicissitudes we here experienced imagination cannot form a scene more adapted for solemn meditation the sacred monuments of druidical antiquity surrounded with the thick imbowering shades of venerable oaks render this place the seat of contemplation and put me in mind of those beautiful lines in mr wartons pleasures of melancholy hail queen divine whom as tradition tells once in his evening walk a druid found far in a hollow glade of monas woods and piteous bore with hospitable hand to the close shelter of his oaken bower there soon the sage admiring marked the dawn of solemn musing in your pensive thought for when a smiling babe you loved to lie often deep listening to the rapid roar of woodhung menai stream of druids old that laved his hallowed haunt with dashing wave   adieu sir etc  letter viii dear sir it is much to be regretted that a full account of the antiquities of wales has never been published there are ample materials to employ the pen of an antiquary mr edward llwyd of the musaeum at oxford made many valuable and curious collections for such a work and likewise for a complete natural history of the country he lived not to finish so great an undertaking and the public are to lament that no one has been found who is possessed of knowledge and assiduity to finish his design the materials that he left behind him are still extant and i am informed may be procured without much difficulty by any one who will execute his plan  there were before the reformation large estates in wales dedicated to religious uses in every county are still to be seen the venerable remains of many religious houses monasteries and friaries the people of this country were formerly proverbially remarked for their superstition which makes it the less to be admired that holy church had so many domains in wales  during the few months i have resided in this country it cannot be supposed that i could minutely investigate into the history of all the religious houses and were i thoroughly acquainted with every particular relating to such a subject it would greatly exceed the bounds of an epistolary correspondence to enter into a minute description of them  during our literary intercourse i shall endeavor to furnish you with an account of all the principal castles and fortifications that are now standing the most considerable are such as were built by the english and normans i do not find that the britons built their fortifications in the manner of the english the british fortresses were of a circular form the ramparts consisted of mounds of earth thrown up with three circumvallations and fosses of a similar construction with old sarum a variety of these fortifications and encampments are to be seen on almost every hill through the country on the sea shore in every place where the enemy could with safety land the remains are still to be discerned  the great musaeum of druidical as well as other antiquities is the island of anglesea some account has been published by mr rowlands in his mona antiqua an author of no small repute amongst antiquarians and highly venerated in that country he was doubtless a man of great application and some learning his mona antiqua consists rather of an account of the antiquities of his own parish and neighborhood than of the whole island of anglesea we find in it some ingenious observations and accurate remarks but replete with illfounded conjectures and strained etymologies the most ridiculous exertion of science he derives the welsh or british language from the hebrew without any other foundation than the congruity of sound of a few words with which it has manifestly no more affinity than it has with the chinese praise is however due to his labors and i mean not to detract from his merit  the remains of druidical antiquities are very frequent over the whole island of anglesea near plasnewydd the seat of sir nicholas bailey which i described in a former letter there is a druidical altar still remaining entire in various places are to be seen the carns or more properly carnedde these are generally situated on an eminence and consist of a large tumulus of stones the vulgar attribute them to the work of giants the truth seems to be that they are the sepulchers of persons of renown when the general of an army died or was killed in battle it was usual for all who lamented him to throw a stone upon his grave the greater the tumulus the more honorable was his interment though this practice has been probably difused for ages yet it is a common expression in the country to this day to say of a man that died unlamented ni rhof i mor carreg ar iw fedd i e i will not throw a stone upon his grave mr macpherson in a book he has lately published says that in the highlands of scotland there are many of these tumuli which they call carns and that he caused many of them to be thrown down and always found under the heap some stones placed in the form of a coffin and often the bones remaining i wanted not inclination to have the experiment tried here but had neither time nor opportunity to make such a trial and i much question whether the people of the country are not so superstitious as to prevent any such attempts  besides the carnedde just described there are many orsedde or orseddfaincia and cromleche i conjecture the cromleche to have been stones where the druids sacrificed to their deities we have less doubt concerning the orsedde or orseddfaincia for it is not questioned from the import of the word as well as their appearance but that they were druidical judgment seats in those times the druids were priests lawgivers and judges the veneration paid to their sacred characters gave weight and authority to their decisions in this the britains resembled the accounts given of the germans and gauls by tacitus and caesar i shall forbear saying any thing farther at present upon this point as i shall have occasion to mention it in a future letter when i come to speak of the laws of the ancient britons  it does not appear that the welsh or british princes ever coined any money they paid their mulcts like the germans in cattle luitur certo armentorum aut pecorum numero i allow that in particular cases a fine was to be paid in gold or silver for offenses committed against the person of the king or queen for defiling the princes bed the offender was to pay a rod of pure solid gold of the thickness of a plowmans finger that had ploughed nine years in length from the ground to the princes mouth when sitting in what part of wales such a quantity of gold was then to be found is a mystery that i will not undertake to unfold  i am afraid i weary your patience on this subject and must conclude by assuring you that i am  yours etc  letter ix i have not my dear friend in any former letter described to you the place of my residence in this country the scene from whence these letters have been written  after i had finished my tour of north wales i determined to fix upon the most romantic and unfrequented situation for the scene of a few months retirement a place where i could not be interrupted with the impertinent intrusion of affected gentility or disgusted with the ridiculous ceremonies of false politeness i did not long hesitate in my choice the situation of this place and the great abundance of game the country afforded confirmed my determination i board with the curate of the parish who is the only person in the neighborhood capable of conversing with me the curate is a venerable clergyman on the eve of threescore he wears his own natural gray locks and still retains a ruddy bloom in his countenance acquired by health and exercise he has lived among these mountains for near forty years upon a curacy and a little paternal estate which he cultivates with his own hands his whole revenue amounts not to forty pounds per annum and yet that exceeds his expenses whose little store his well taught mind does please not pinched with want nor cloyed with wanton ease who free from storms which on the great ones fall makes but few wishes and enjoys them all roscommon this place is a small village among the carnarvonshire hills situated in a valley surrounded on every side by rocks and mountains through which a river a winds its irriguous course we are never at a loss for rural diversions earth air and water vie with each other in furnishing us entertainment our table is spread by our industry the same exercise contributes to our health and our amusement and at the same time that our exercise gives us an appetite it procures us also the means of satisfying it our craft and subtlety is not employed as it is among the greatest part of mankind against our own species we carry on an innocent war against those animals over which the bountiful creator gave us a sovereignty  various were the conjectures of the country people concerning me when first i came to this place what commenced in suspicion was likely to terminate in antipathy but by the proper application of a few pieces of glittering ore and the knowledge of a few welsh words i soon became highly respected and they all obey my commands as readily as any monarch is obeyed by his subjects  i had long a desire of visiting the welsh alps the summit of snowdon snowdon comprehended formerly the counties of merionydd and carnarvon and the mountainous part of denbighshire it is now confined to a mountain of that name  the curate was so much devoted to me that i did not employ my rhetoric long before i prevailed upon him to accompany me in the expedition we set out from our hermitage in the month of july we arrived in the evening at a small thatched hut at the foot of the mountain near a lake which they call llyn cychwhechlyn which i leave you to pronounce as well as you are able at this hut we found a poor laboring man with five or six children the pictures of health and innocence we had brought provisions with us for our journey and we regaled ourselves in this situation the family partaking of our feast with more satisfaction and glee than i have ever found at a noblemans sumptuous entertainment  we were determined to amuse ourselves as well as we could in this dreary situation for this purpose we sent for a poor blind harper and procured a number of blooming country girls to divert us with their music and dancing there is something very plaintive and affecting in the welsh music and the manner of their singing symphonious and responsive to the notes of the harp renders it exceeding melodious it gave me infinitely more pleasure to hear this rustic concert than the finest airs of an italian opera and to see these rosy rural nymphs direct their mazy steps without the needless sumptuous apparel of luxury and pride than all the ladies at st jamess in their artificial beauty and attire  at the dawn of day we began our journey up the mountain which seemed to scale the heavens i cannot give you a better description of it than is contained in the following lines of mr pope so pleased at first the towering alps we try mount over the vales and seem to tread the sky the eternal snows appear already past and the first clouds and mountains seem the last but those attained we trembled to survey the growing labors of the lengthened way the increasing prospect tires our wandering eyes hills peep over hills and alps over alps arise   we found a great change in the temperature of the atmosphere as we ascended the mountain when we had gone half way up we found the wind rather high attended with scudding clouds but when we arrived at the summit the air was calm and serene and seemed much more subtle and rarefied less impregnated with vapors and more agreeable for respiration  hid above the clouds though winds and tempests beat their aged feet their peaceful heads nor storms nor tempests know but scorn the threatening rack that rolls below dryden how shall i describe to you the infinitely extensive and variegated prospects we enjoyed from the summit lakes mountains seas rivers plains woods and islands lay before us in the greatest diversity we saw distinctly the north of england the greatest part of wales cheshire shropshire ireland the isle of man and scotland i doubt whether so extensive a circular prospect is to be seen in any part of the terraqueous globe  as our situation was exalted above the globe so were our ideas and the nearer we were to the etherial regions the more our souls seemed to partake of their purity our minds like the serene face of the sky undisturbed with the storms of the passions became equal and composed we were inspired with sentiments of commiseration and contempt in contemplating the vain magnificence of human grandeur and the pursuits of the world for a few pieces of ore which nature prudently concealed in the bowels of these mountains  o my friend why should we return to the busy haunt of men why were we doomed to drag an existence in populous cities and the crowded forum o that it had been our lot to live among these mountains unenvied and unknown  excuse my friend these reveries i shall endeavor to atone for them by hastening to a conclusion the sun had now gained its meridian height and shot forth its noontide rays with unusual fervor when we began to descend the hill we perceived a small murky cloud rise out of the sea the cloud condensed and increased until the whole atmosphere became inveloped in darkness and night seemed to have regained her ebon throne neither house nor tree was near to afford us protection but all was one vast continued waste  in this situation we could only have recourse to the hospitable shelter of the next impending rock here we awaited with fear and impatience till the storm was spent either tropic now gan thunder at both ends of heaven the clouds from many a horrid rift abortive poured fierce rain with lightning mixed water with fire in ruin reconciled dreadful was the rack as earth and sky would mingle milton the thunder reverberated from rock to rock and the whole artillery of heaven seemed to be at once discharged amid carnarvons mountains rages loud the repercussive roar with mighty crush into the flashing deep from the rude rocks of penmaenmawr heaped hideous to the sky tumble the smitten cliffs and snowdons heap dissolving instant yields his wintry load thompson when the storm was appeased and the face of heaven had reassumed its wonted serenity we continued our journey pleased though fatigued with our excursion we regained our homely dwelling from whence i have now the happiness of writing to you and assuring you that i am  dear sir yours etc  letter x dear sir in observing the manners and customs of this people some idea may be formed of their ancestors the ancient britons they have preserved themselves almost entirely distinct from all other nations they possessed nothing that could tempt the ambition of foreigners having no allurement from a prospect of commercial advantage or the charms of opulence and fertility they remained strangers to a country which afforded no incitement to avarice or ambition thus i will not say unhappily excluded from the conflux of strangers the pure british blood flows unadulterated in their veins their customs manners virtues and even vices are preserved as a sacred depositum inherited from their ancestors and observed with religious veneration  my friend the curate of whom i gave some account in my last letter supplies me with every necessary information respecting the language manners and customs of this people whose veracity cannot be suspected  i have already described to you the different ceremonies attending the marriages of this people they are no less singular in their funerals  the evening preceding the burial they have what they call wylnos i e the night of lamentation all the neighbors attend at the house of the deceased the minister or in his absence the clerk of the parish comes and prays over the dead and psalms are sung agreeable to the mournful occasion this it may not unreasonably be supposed is the remains of the romish superstition of requiems for the souls of the deceased however there is nothing improper in the custom if conducted with decorum and devotion which is not always the case at the funeral the relations and friends of the deceased make presents to the officiating clergyman and the clerk of the parish these offerings are altogether voluntary generally proportionable to their circumstances and the respect they bear to the memory of their departed friend in some populous parishes the offerings are very considerable and constitute a great part of the profits of a living there is no doubt but that this is likewise a relict of the popish custom of giving money to their priests for praying that the soul of the deceased may be relieved from purgatory  it is a custom likewise invariably observed to make a bonfire near every house on all saints eve whether this was originally owing to public rejoicing or to some superstitious ceremony i could never be informed  among the amusements of the country the principal are the stage plays you will smile when i tell you that we have comedies and tragedies king david and solomon are often brought upon the stage and are taught to speak pure welsh these entertainments are called anterlutes which seems to be no more than a corruption of the english word interlude  my curiosity prevailed upon me to go and see one of these plays acted the stage consisted of some boards fixed at the end of a barn beneath it was the green room for it was a small enclosure made up of furze the play that was acted was king lear but so mutilated and murdered that i was told it had scarce any other resemblance to the play written by shakespeare than the name it was not unentertaining to see these brawny ploughmen act in the characters of lears daughters  the two principal characters which they never fail to introduce into every play are those of the fool and miser the former uses all kind of indecent ribaldry obscene gestures and expressions which generally prove highly entertaining to the audience this representation put me in mind of the description given by horace of the first comic actors dicitur et plastris vexasse poemata thespis  the people of this country are not inferior in superstition to the laplanders the most improbable and absurd tales of haunted houses demons and apparitions are related and believed nor can many be found so hardy as to doubt the existence of witches fairies elves and all the bugbears of a winters eve  adieu sir etc  letter xi dear sir i have heard it often asserted that mankind are the same in all countries this if true will destroy the very idea of national characters and yet experience will justify the observation that there is a very wide difference between the inhabitants of asia and europe between those of spain france and england and even between the english and irish if no more is meant by such an observation than that man in a state of nature is the same in every country i will admit it to be true but man is no longer what nature formed him education has furnished him with vices with prejudices with a certain range of ideas and mode of thinking which stamp his character hence the difference of fashion conduct and character which we observe in every country  in a state of nature the wants of man are merely physical confined to the sustenance of corporeal existence in a state of society most of his necessities are acquired at first imaginary and in process of time become real how few are the wants of the peasant who dwells in a strawbuilt but on a barren mountain which the avarice of man has not reduced to property compared to those of the lord nursed in the cradle of indolence and luxury  it was in a state of society that hobbes ought to have sought for his state of war and not in that of nature it is in society that the interests of mankind perpetually clash with each other many pursue the same object aspire to the same post or employment we all pay our devoirs to the enchanting goddess gold the supposed dispenser of all sublunary happiness the goddess smiles on some of her votaries frowns on others her discarded devotees endeavor to supplant such as share her favors every engine which imagination can invent is used to effectuate the purpose this is the box of pandora from whence all the evils and calamities of life proceed hence deceit is become a necessary art taught in the school of the world universally studied and universally admired it is the ladder of preferment and the step of ambition its perfection is called politeness and its defect rusticity in different degrees it is used by all from the courtier who pours the delicious poison of flattery into his princes ears to the rustic peasant who bows to the little tyrant of a country village  an unpolished people cannot have attained to the refinement of deceit that we find among the more civilized nations hence the idea of insincerity is always not improperly connected with the politeness of a courtier and french complaisance and deceit are joined as inseparable companions  if we would view the heart of man without disguise it is among the rude and uncivilized inhabitants of mountains too artless to conceal the dictates of their hearts the tongue reveals the sentiments of the mind hence those passions which are concealed or disguised in more civilized countries appear here in their native colors  the nationality if i may so call it of the scotch has been proverbial and it is owing to that mutual support that they have made so conspicuous a figure the natives of this country are in no degree remarked for this quality to this it may be attributed that they scarce ever rise to any considerable station or eminence in any profession or department unplaced and unpensioned they are perhaps the only part of the kings subjects who have not had some share in the profits of government and enjoyed some of the spoils of the public thus without the mutual friendly assistance of each other or the sunshine of court favor they seldom emerge from their original obscurity  o pure and immaculate friendship thou gem whose luster remains unimpaired by the desolating hand of time and undiminished by the rough storm of adverse fortune who receivest additional splendour from age and shinest bright under the severest trial art thou to be found among these desert rocks or in the fertile plains of cultivated nature  thou art not the partial inhabitant of country or clime the sympathetic feelings of the heart thy offspring exist only in the minds of the ingenuous few whose souls are cast in the same mould whose union is founded on the solid basis of merit and esteem and cemented by delicacy of manners that connection which the vulgar call friendship which arises from the participation of the same brutal pleasures is as fleeting as those pleasures which gave it birth the intimacy accruing from the society of an idle hour which had better been blotted from the hoary calendar of time or the same convivial festivity as it has its existence so it ends with the circulating glass  o thou guileless and unsuspicious youth who art now launching thy bark and unfurling thy sails to commence the difficult and dangerous voyage of life who fondly expectest the sunshine of fortune and the gales of prosperity to speed thy destined voyage but be prepared to encounter storms and tempests and know that thou may meet with treacherous and unskilful pilots who will endeavor to sink thee in the quicksands of misfortune and wreck thee on the rocks of despair steer by the helm of prudence let religion be thy anchor and industry thy pilot so shall thou stem the rough torrents of adverse fortune and bring thy vessel to the haven of peace where all thy labors will have an end  adieu my friend etc  letter xii dear sir i find you are displeased with my philosophical reveries be assured you shall be troubled with no more of them i am however determined that you shall do penance for your disapprobation not by walking barefoot to the shrine of st winifred but by having the drudgery imposed on you of reading the following letter  our journey from carnarvon to this town has been through a country the most rocky and abounding with the most romantic prospects that we have traveled since we came to wales we passed under snowdon through a village called berthgelet two considerable lakes are adjacent to the road in which the false pen of giraldus says there were floating islands and which is now affirmed by some who have as little regard to truth as giraldus this side the village of berthgelet is the famous pontaberglasslyn this is a bridge thrown over a considerable waterfall from one mountain to another contiguous to it is a salmon leap where the fish continually make efforts to leap up a rock about six yards high to lay their spawn a net is placed under the rock in order to catch them as they fall so stupendous is the structure of this bridge in the eyes of the ignorant country people that they do not hesitate to pronounce it to be the work of supernatural agency it may be curious to know upon what condition his satanic majesty would turn master builder the agreement was drawn up by one of his agents who assumed the not unusual form a lawyer and thereby it was covenanted stipulated ratified agreed and a thousand more such redundant words and the condition of the obligation was such that his infernal highness was to have the first that went over the bridge for his trouble and expense but a method was contrived to defraud him by driving a dog over which was all the pay he had for building the famous bridge of aberglasslyn why should this account be thought more extraordinary than the description we have in milton of sin and death building a bridge over chaos to this world  the situation of aberglasslyn is exceeding romantic the rocks impend over you so that you may with truth say tres pateat caeli spatium non amplias ulnas the spacious round of heaven which all contains to thee short else on earth our sight restrains drydens virgil  from hence we crossed a dangerous sand called traethmaur and came to harlech castle this is a very magnificent structure situated on an eminence beneath it there is a fine marsh of some miles extent upon which the sea adjoins it does not clearly appear by whom this castle was built though we may conjecture that it is the work of some of the first kings of the norman line  on the opposite shore of avionydd we see the castle of crycaith this is situated on a small hill washed on one side by the sea the ascent to it is very steep quaquaversally the castle is but very small in comparison to those i have already described it is not improbable but that this castle was built by some of the welsh or british princes tradition informs us that all that part now covered with the sea between crycaith and harlech was formerly a fine level country called cantrefgwaelod i e the plain of a hundred townships some manuscripts in welsh i am informed give an account of the sea overflowing this plain but at what time this happened does not appear or whether ever it was different from what it is at present i am greatly inclined to doubt  from harlech we pursued our journey to tanybwlch in the vale of festiniog here we rested a night at a small inn where we met with very good accommodations the vale of festiniog has been much admired by travelers the meanders of a winding stream the woodcapt hills with which it is environed form i own a beautiful prospect but perhaps the striking contrast between this little vale and the horrid country round it contributes most to please the eye of the wearied traveller  about fifteen miles from tanybwlch is the town of bala its name is descriptive of its situation being upon the banks of a fine lake three miles long and one broad it is famous for a peculiar species of whiting called gwinniad this lake in welsh is called llyntegid i e the fine pool teg signifying fair or fine in that language in english it is called pimblemere giraldus cambrensis in his itinerary says that the wind is always very high and that it never runs on this lake credat qui vult  about fifteen miles distant from bala is the town of dolgelle the metropolis of this rugged county it is a very irregular and badlybuilt town at the foot of a very high mountain called caderydris caderydris signifies the chair or seat of ydris this ydris according to the vulgar tradition was a giant who lived in this country  the country round dolgelle is romantic and pleasing but the town is one of the most disagreeable places i ever saw  in my next expect some account of the people who inhabit this strange county  i am sir etc  letter xiii dear sir the inhabitants of this county are more purely british than those of any other part of wales like the clans of scotland or hebrew tribes they scarce ever intermarry except with those of their own lineage through the whole county they are all cousins all of the same welsh plood and most of them of the same names  if you would ask them how they spend their lives in this part of the world they have it in their power to answer you in a few words we drink dance and are merry indeed i do not know a people so much addicted to mirth the complexion of their country one would imagine could not inspire such sentiments of festivity and joy they sing dance and drink not by hours but by days and weeks and measure time only by the continuance of their mirth and pleasure  the men estimate their strength not by feats of activity as in other places but by the quantities of ale they can drink and i am told it is no uncommon thing for a lover to boast to his mistress what feats he has performed in this way such is the mark of prowess by which the women judge of their paramours vigor and strength of constitution  from hence we may conclude that bacchus does more execution in this country than mars does in germany such whose happy poverty preclude them from procuring those liquors which are the destruction of the more opulent live to an advanced age whilst most of the gentry and squires are carried off in their youth thus the heir does not long wait for the possession of his estate nor does he long enjoy it this vice is hereditary in families and descends from father to son  uno avulso non deficit alter  et simili frondescit virga metallo the fescennine license is here enjoyed in its most unbounded extent in conversation they take the utmost freedom and liberty with each other which is generally borne in good part they are always endeavoring to frame rustic jokes not always the most delicate happy does he esteem himself who comes off conqueror in this certamen of rustic wit  unembarrassed with the pedantry of learning and the disgusting forms of politeness the good people of merionydd are free hospitable and cheerful let them enjoy their mirth unrivalled undisturbed by foreigners in security and ease they always will remain unenvied in the participation of that happiness which none but a native of that country can feel  the welsh language is here spoken with the greatest classical purity here they boast of their welsh bards the welsh word is bardd  who are poets by nature these bards are idle fellows who subsist on the bounty of the welsh gentry they and their alliesmen the harpers who form a very numerous corpse are generally invited to entertain the company at their feasts which is done by buffoonery and illiberal abusive extempore rhyme sometimes a bard comes to the door and demands admittance in rhyme he is answered by the bard within in rhyme likewise if the stranger in the opinion of the company gains the victory in this poetical contest he is admitted to partake of the feast while the vanquished bard is turned out to the formers uncomfortable situation  somewhat similar to this was the great feast which was made in south wales where bards from various parts were invited to a poetical combat and where it is said the north wales poets gained the victory  this vagabond poetical tribe were formerly a great nuisance in this country and we find diverse acts of parliament and regulations made to suppress them it is said that edward i cruelly destroyed them it may be doubted whether it was not the greatest benefit he could do to the country in henry ivths time it was enacted that no westours rymours minstrels or other vagabonds should go about pur fair kymortha ou coilage the learned author of the observations on the ancient statutes has mistaken the meaning of the word kymortha or rather cymortha the c in welsh having the sound of the english k it signifying a charitable aid or support this is the signification it has in the act of    henry viii where it is enacted that no one without license of the commissioners shall kymortha under color of marrying singing first masses etc  cymortha is a word frequently used in wales at this time a poor newmarried couple often go about the country to get something to begin the world as they call it upon these occasions they have generally wool and corn given them which they call cymortha and if i am not misinformed the briefs that are read in churches for the relief of the poor are likewise called cymortha you will excuse this criticism on the meaning of this word and believe me to be  yours etc  letter xiv dear sir in proportion as a people increase in trade in luxury in all the arts of social and commercial life their language becomes more copious and refined the wants of mankind in an infant state of society are few their ideas are few and consequently the sounds expressive of such ideas at first capable only of simple apprehension we by degrees form complex and abstract ideas the language of societies is not formed in a day it is the work of ages words are daily borrowed transformed according to the present exigency and coined when necessity requires which the common consent of mankind alone can render current  as this people have made no very considerable progress in a state of civilization we might naturally be induced to think that their language is barbarous and uncultivated but the contrary is true it is not clogged with those many inharmonious monosyllables the signs of moods tenses and cases as the english language it is much more harmonious and expressive in its numbers and formation one word in welsh frequently expressing as much as a sentence in the english of which a late ingenious writer has given abundant specimens  though this is the language of a people who inhabit a small barren spot of earth scarce known in the world unimproved in the arts of life entirely neglected and uncultivated and not spoken except by such who willingly forfeit every claim to politeness yet its variety copiousness and even harmony is to be equalled by few perhaps excelled by none  but our wonder ceases when we consider that it is not solely the language of a people confined in a little corner of this island it is the language of populous and even civilized nations the ancient celts hence its variety and its harmony it is the language of a brave people hence those sounds that roused the soul to action animated by these they despised danger and death for their country  thus some account for the policy of edward i who in order to enslave the people thought it a necessary previous step to destroy the bards who cultivated their language and poetry  this language seems to be more particularly adapted for poetry which however extraordinary it may seem to some on account of the multiplicity of gutturals and consonants with which it abounds has the softness and harmony of the italian with the majesty and expression of the greek in the formation of its poetical numbers it differs from all modern languages every line consists of a certain regular number of feet like other languages but herein it differs that it has a certain kind of rhyme giraldus cambrensis to show the nature of welsh poetry quotes the following pentameter factus es o pulcher paene puella puer the following latin hexameter of cicero with the translation by dryden may with as much propriety be adduced to the same purpose o fortunatam natam me consule romam fortune fortuned the dying note of rome till i her consuls soul consoled her doom   jingle or alliteration not that terminates the line but runs through every part of it  the poets or such as pretend to be such arrogate to themselves a most unwarrantable poetical license of coining words for the sake of sound and this they will seldom scruple to do whenever they want a word for rhyme hence the greatest part of their poetry is nothing more than melodious nonsense a perfect jargon of harmonious sounds and when translated scarce reducible to common sense this unbounded poetical license though generally yet is not universally adopted for there are not wanting many poets who seldom claim this unwarrantable prerogative of coining words ad libitum  these observations that i have made on the welsh language are the result of a conversation i have had with such as are well acquainted with the subject much more might have been added but for a more critical knowledge of it i refer you to a late accurate and ingenious publication vide historical and critical remarks on the welsh language  i am sir  yours etc nb i have sent you enclosed for your amusement some translations from the old welsh bards by my friend the curate  a fragment of a welsh poem by mirian goch mirvan goch signifies the redhaired mirvan it is usual for all the welsh bards to assume an epithet descriptive of their persons this fragment i am told was accidentally found in the ruins of an old monastery of eryri translated was it hurlech some conjecture that harlechcastle had its name from this hero  the valiant son of tyndaethwy the great shield of cymry fiercer than a lioness robbed of her whelps it was he the great terror of the saxons who consumed the descendants of offa as the fiery meteor consumes the stubble or as the northern blast destroys the leaves in the forest of buelt it was the harefooted descendant of cynan who was swifter than the eagleeyed hawk that perches on the summit of moelhebog moelhebog the hawks mountain is a high mountain near snowdon  his course was like the rapid stream of ogven that bursts through

populousness of a country depend in a great degree upon the cultivation of the land the adventitious wealth and power acquired by commerce may flow in another channel and revolt from one nation to another carthage and tire have in ancient times and venice in more modern been the emporiums of commerce these she has deserted and has taken her seat in more northern climes where her abode is precarious as in her former dominions but the advantages resulting from agriculture are permanent uncontrollable by fortuitous circumstances they depend alone upon the industry of man so kind and just is nature that she rewards the husbandman in proportion to his care and toil  in the great empire of china the richest and most populous in the world the land is cultivated to the very summit of the mountains earth is carried from the valleys to cover the barren rocks which are converted to fruitful gardens were china not thus improved could it maintain those millions of inhabitants who are employed in procuring subsistence for themselves and others  agriculture has been ever esteemed honorable among all great and wise nations the romans took their greatest generals from the plough to command their conquering armies and the great emperor of china who has perhaps more subjects than there are inhabitants in europe thinks it not unbecoming him to hold the plough thereby showing an example worthy of his subjects imitation  why should we send colonies to cut down the vast forests of america when we have so much unimproved land in this kingdom how many uncultivated heaths parks forests marshes and commons are there profitable neither to their proprietors or the public if our lands were properly cultivated the produce would be greatly increased and consequently the strength riches and population of the kingdom would be proportionably augmented  several counties of wales have made but a very slow progress in agriculture in many places bordering upon england they have in a great degree adopted the english manner of tillage in some parts of the counties of montgomery denbigh and flint the lands are well improved i have made this observation that the remoter they are from the english counties the less is there of the spirit of industry and improvement among the inhabitants  in the county of merionydd they have very little good land and they make so bad an use of that which nature has given them with so sparing a hand that some might be ready to conclude that they prefer their barren rocks to the most fertile soil in some places between the mountains there are to be seen a few acres of good land where the earth has been washed away from the hills the water generally stagnates in these places and they never take the trouble of draining them but cut them in turbaries for fuel thus in a few years they totally ruin their finest meadow land the greatest part of the country consists of barren mountains incapable of improvement they serve however to subsist a great abundance of sheep with the wool they make considerable quantities of flannel which they export this is the staple manufacture and support of the county  a considerable part of carnarvonshire and the island of anglesea is naturally a very good soil but very much unimproved what they principally want are good fences and shelter for their cattle the only enclosures that they have are small banks of earth or turfmounds thrown up these continue but a very little time as the cattle destroy them in the winter and the farmer is at a considerable expense in repairing them every spring in such places as are exposed to the sea winds the trees will not grow to any height and all kinds of quicksets are long in their growth so that the gentlemen and farmers seldom judge it worth the trouble and expense to plant but satisfied i am that in a few years it would answer and nothing would contribute more to the improvement of the country than if such a practice was generally adopted  there are extensive fens undrained and the greatest part of the country consists of nothing but furze the best land lets in general from three to five shillings an acre the price of labor about sixpence a day there is great plenty of manure easily to be had and notwithstanding these advantages the country is unimproved how shall we account for this there is a certain supineness in the greatest part of country gentlemen which renders them inattentive even to their own good they live upon their estates unsolicitous of what passes in life and provided they enjoy the dull comforts of an animal existence they are satisfied undisturbed with the spirit of enterprise and ambition they follow the dull track of their ancestors without thought and without reflection and live and die unknown  the farmers and laborers are most of them miserably poor they hold the lands generally from year to year at rackrent if one more industrious than the rest should make any improvement the landlord advances his rent or turns him out thus it is the interest of the farmer to let them lie waste as he has no certainty of a return when he is liable to be turned out at the landlords pleasure thus they only take care to get just sufficient by their industry to supply present want and let the morrow provide for itself  nothing would contribute more to the cultivation of the country than the granting of leases for life to the farmers even at advanced rents then they would have a certain prospect of profit for their labor and expense which would ultimately turn out to the benefit of the landlord the tenant and the public  i am sir etc  letter xvi dear sir from merionythshire the most barren and desolate part of wales we came to montgomeryshire which in many parts far exceeds any county of north wales for fertility and richness of soil the welsh name is trefaldwyn trefaldwyn is probably a corruption of trebaldwyn i e baldwyns town we are told by historians that montgomery was called before it was taken by sir roger de montgomery the town and castle of baldwyn who this baldwyn was i do not find recorded the english montgomery is derived from sir roger de montgomery a norman baron who had a grant of a great part of this country  montgomery is but a very small town thinly inhabited there are to be seen the remains of a castle which was built in the time of william rufus in order most probably to secure the colony of normans who were sent here to subdue the welsh under the command of sir roger de montgomery the castle is guarded by a craggy precipice on one side and a deep fosse on the other  the town of welshpool is the most considerable in the whole country it is regular well built and superior to most welsh towns about a mile from pool is powiscastle the seat of lord powis it is situated on a fine hill which commands a prospect of an extensive variegated and fertile country the vale of montgomery which we see from the castle is not equalled by any in point of fertility and beauty in wales nor perhaps in england the severn winds its serpentine course through this vale and heightens the beauties of the prospect on each side the vale the hills tower in majesty and grandeur i do not hesitate to prefer this situation and prospect to that of the vale of clwyd some even venture to affirm that it is not equalled by any in great britain  the castle of powis and the fine gardens are much neglected and decayed as his lordship does not reside here  the hills and mountains in this county are covered with verdure to their very summit being a perfect contrast to those in the counties before described where we saw nothing but craggy rocks and dreadful precipices  from pool we continued our journey through pretey fertile country between the confines of england and wales to oswestry in welsh it is called croesoswolt i e oswaldscross this was formerly esteemed part of wales but now it is included in shropshire it is remarkable that the welsh language is spoken in many parts of shropshire while it is almost entirely lost in montgomeryshire  from oswestry we visited chirkcastle the seat of mr middleton it has a magnificent appearance at a distance but it is an illcontrived house in every point of view the country round it is pleasant but upon the whole it is not an agreeable situation  a few miles from chirkcastle is the village of llangollen in a bottom surrounded on every side with high hills the village is remarkable for nothing but a fine bridge esteemed one of the curiosities of wales the castle of dinasbran is on the summit of one of the hills above the village this castle belonged formerly to the princes of powisland powis or mathrafal as it is called in welsh before king offas time reached eastward to the rivers severn and dee from broxenhills to salop by the dyke it was contracted into a narrower compass the plain country toward salop being inhabited by saxons and normans the length was northeast from pulford to llangirricbridge near cardiganshire the breadth from cefeilion to ellesmere  dinasbran is i apprehend a corruption of dinasbrening i e the residence of the king the hill upon which the castle stands is very high and steep and must have been an almost inaccessible place it has the appearance of great antiquity being probably built by some of the first british princes  in our way to wrexham our curiosity induced us to view wynnstay the seat of sir watkin williams win the house is incomplete in its structure but the beauty of the situation exceeds description  the last place that we visited in north wales was wrexham which is the richest and most populous town in the whole country the only curiosity that travelers remark in it is a fine steeple which is esteemed one of the wonders of wales  the inhabitants of this place are so perfectly englished if i may use such an expression in their language manners and customs that it bears no resemblance to the generality of welsh towns  i have now finished my description of the face of the country and conclude etc  letter xvii dear sir i have taken up my pen with the view of making some observations on the ancient and modern legal polity of the welsh  laws in every state are multiplied in proportion to the opulence the number the trade and the intercourse of the inhabitants twelve tables contained the laws of rome when in its infant state and the decalogue was the foundation of the jewish jurisprudence the laws of opulent and commercial countries such as england and china are incredibly voluminous whilst those of barbarous and uncivilized nations may be comprised in a short compass  a legislator cannot form a code of laws that will serve the state in all exigencies through succeeding generations human foresight cannot comprehend events that may happen nor if foreseen could it provide against them the ingenuity of man eludes every tie that is made to bind it hence new cases daily happen which were never foreseen and new mischiefs against which the law has no guard which must be remedied by new laws ex re nata thus they become so multifarious that it must be the employment of a life to acquire a knowledge of them  happy is that country of which it may be said as tacitus i never considered tacituss treatise de moribus germanorum intended as a real description of the germans  he drew the picture of a people in manners perfectly contrasted to the romans thereby aiming an oblique satire against his countrymen does in his admirable picture of the germans plus ibi boni mores quam alibi bonae leges valent were mankind virtuous and just there would be no forensic litigations no occasion for the coif and long robe avarice and injustice are the offspring of riches luxury and vice these introduced a necessary restraint upon human actions which we call law  in very early ages before christianity was planted in europe the priests or druids were judges and legislators among the celtic nations they decided in all controversies both of a public and private nature references being at first probably made to them on account of their sanctity and austerity of manners which gave sanction and weight to their decisions we have the concurrent testimony neque animadvertere neque vincire neque verberare quidem nisi sacerdotibus permissum  tacitus de m germ fere de omnibus controversiis publicis privatisque constituunt et si quod est admissum facinus si caedes facta si de hereditate si de finibus controversia iidem decernunt praemia paenasque constituunt si quis privatus aut publicus eorum decreto non obedierit sacrificiis interdicunt haec paena apud eos gravissima quibus ita est interdictum impiorum habentur numero caesar de bello gallico of credible historians that this was the case among the germans and gauls and i think there is little doubt but the ancient britons were a branch of the same people a great similiarity may be traced in their manners customs and language  in so early a state of society when they had no riches nor scarce an idea of distinct property there could be but few causes of altercation and animosity their laws consisted of a few oral and traditional precepts not reduced to writing but committed only to the memory  the breast of the druid was the repository of their laws the court of judicature was situated on the most conspicuous eminence in the open air here the causes were tried and judgment pronounced the remains of many of these judgment seats i have seen which are still called by that name in the welsh language orsedde i shall here give a short description of their ancient courts of judicature with an account of their manner of proceeding which may not prove unentertaining  their seats of judgment or juridical courts consisted of two circumvallations of a circular form one comprehended within the other the center was raised and seems to have been the place where the judge sat the inner circumvallation was intended for the parties and witnesses and the outer for the multitude  in early times as i have before observed the druids were the only judges but after the planting of christianity and the people being somewhat more civilized the laws which were before merely oral became reduced into writing and a regular code was formed by howel dha or the good we find at that time that all matters of inheritance were determined by the prince in person if not able to attend by his deputy the court consisted of the freeholders of the place two elders the chief judge and the ordinary judge of the court the prince sat above with an elder on each hand the freeholders next who then were and are still called by the name of uchelwyr uchelwyr signifies highmen or men in high station below the chief justice the priest sat on the right hand and the ordinary judge on the left  the plaintiff with his advocate rhyngill wrangler or if you will sergeant and champion by this it appears that in some cases trial by battle was in use among the ancient britons as it was among all the northern nations on the left side and the defendant with his advocate and champion on the right the witnesses were placed at the lower end  for what purpose the freeholders were present in court is not clear it does not appear that they were called in to act as a jury though it is reasonable to suppose so as the trial by jury was used among all the gothic nations the chief the common judge and priest gave judgment but in matters of difficulty and importance the definitive sentence was pronounced by the prince with the advice and assistance of the elders  in the formation of howel dhas code many of the saxon laws seem to have been adopted the rest are perhaps only traditional customs reduced into writing they descend to take notice of even the minutest circumstances and are perhaps the best proof of the uncultivated and barbarous disposition of the inhabitants to produce instances to corroborate what i have asserted would be needless for the whole code is probably the strangest collection of jurisprudence that ever was composed for the government of any people  historians this was likewise very much the case in england at that time for we find the barons waging war against each other without the royal assent assert that the ancient inhabitants of wales were of such an inflexible refractory disposition that they would hardly submit to any law the whole face of the country discovered more the signs of anarchy than the police of a well regulated government not only the princes of the divided parts of wales but even private persons waged open public hostilities against each other encroachments on each others estates family quarrels and affronts furnished ample pretexts for taking arms so strong were their passions and so weak was law  the custom of gavelkind contributed in a great degree to promote these hereditary feuds sovereignties as well as the estates of private persons were divided among all the male issue legitimate as well as illegitimate this was the perpetual source of civil wars and private dissentions upon the death of the prince all the sons claimed a right to the sovereignty and as among the asiatic nations the longest sword established the claim sometimes they agreed to divide the sovereignty between the sons nothing could tend more to weaken the country and render them unable to repel foreign incursions than the custom of gavelkind when applied to the government  the equal partition of private estates amongst the male issue tends to promote population and cultivation of the land in a government founded on equality and liberty it is the means of curtailing the wealth and power of individuals and reducing mankind more to a state of natural equality by nature all the issue female as well as male have certainly a right to an equal share of their ancestors property the preference given to the eldest is artificial introduced by law and not by nature the custom of lands descending to the youngest son which we call boroughenglish in preference to the other sons seems to have a stronger foundation in reason than the exclusive descendibility to the eldest or as it is called the right of primogeniture the eldest being supposed more capable of providing for himself on account of his more advanced age than the youngest who probably might be of such tender years as to be altogether unable to provide for himself on his ancestors decease  this law of gavelkind was universal in great britain before the norman conquest and remained in wales till the time of henry viii when the union commenced  there is the strongest reason to think that the feudal system never was adopted in wales there are no traces of it remaining that i could discover in the three most northern counties they have no manors nor manerial courts or rights nor any copyhold tenures or the least remains of any of the consequences of feudal tenures  in the counties bordering upon england as i have before observed some of the kings of the norman line made large grants of lands in order to keep the welsh in subjection in these territories which they had by grant from the crown they held courts which are still kept by prescription here indeed there are some appearances of the feudal system but it must be remembered that even these few vestiges are the remains of the norman policy and make no part of the ancient british constitution we may therefore conclude with certainty that the feudal system was never adopted among the ancient britons or welsh and was probably never known in this island until the norman conquest  the princes of wales had a legislative power we do not find that they had any kind of parliament they could alter abrogate and enact laws without advice according to their own will and pleasure in the exercise of this power it was their interest to act conformably to the public good for if they displeased their subjects their disapprobation was shown not by vain ineffectual petitions but by the sword petition is a word coined among slaves unknown to the ancient britons in this country as it ought to be in every other when the sovereign ceased to be deserving of his crown he ceased to be a king  letter xviii my last letter sir contained some remarks on the laws and constitution of the principality of wales before its reduction by edward i i propose now to continue the subject and to make a few observations on the execution of the laws and the present mode of administering justice  when edward i had brought wales into subjection to the crown of england his next care was to regulate the laws and judicial proceedings with this view he directed a commission vid appendix to howel dhas laws to the bishop of st davids and others to make an enquiry into the old laws and customs that prevailed in wales by the statute of rhyddlan    edward i  some of these customs are retained and some entirely abrogated  it appears that the sheriffs in those times exercised a far greater power than they now do they kept a prison in their own houses where they confined such as they thought proper in many counties the sheriffs were before the time of edward vi for life and not from year to year as at present  many and severe laws were enacted against the welsh in the times of henry iv and v on account of the rebellion of glendower and the depradations that they sometimes committed on the borders of england  no one that spoke the welsh language could enjoy any place of profit or office except a bishopric in wales nor could a welshman have any castle or house of defense and if an englishman married a welshwoman he was thereby rendered incapable of enjoying any office  in the time of henry iv a most excellent regulation was made to prevent idle rhymers minstrals and vagabonds from going about the country begging this has been looked upon by some to be a severe law and a grievance to the country but the least reflection will convince them that it was a most wholesome regulation  in the time of henry viii the act of union of england and wales and ordinances passed for the administration of justice in the principality some authors of great learning have i speak with deference to so great authority i think very improperly called this act a complete code of regulations for the administration of justice whoever will give himself the trouble of considering with the least degree of attention the mode of judicial proceedings in wales compared to that in england must immediately acknowledge the great superiority of the latter  it is true they have in wales what is very improperly called the court of grand sessions here is transacted both chancery and common law business in one of my excursions i happened accidentally to be present at their courts i requested some information concerning their proceedings of a gentleman who sat next me who satisfied my curiosity in the following terms the import of your question sir said he denotes you to be a stranger and i am glad it is in my power to give you the information you require you have heard the judge make a very elaborate speech to the jury but not one of them are capable of comprehending the meaning of a syllable of it all our common people are ignorant of the english language and we are never allowed special juries to try causes in wales where the cause of action is above ten pounds the parties may bring it to trial to the next english county thus are we frequently obliged at great expense and trouble to bring witnesses at a hundred miles distance to try a trifling cause and the more opulent have it always in their power to harrass one who is less able to bear the expense by this means what was originally intended as a benefit to the country is become a grievance and as the reason for trying causes in the next english county has ceased which was to procure a more impartial trial on account of the party faction which generally prevailed in wales so ought the practice to cease likewise the same judicial proceedings ought to take place here as in england and it would be more beneficial for the country if wales was joined to the english circuits thus there would be no partial distinction between the inhabitants of england and wales we should have the same laws the same justice the same government and in time the same language  thus concluded my new acquaintance the account he gave me and though a stranger to the subject i thought the information i received was not altogether unreasonable  the judge when he had finished his harangue nodded on the bench the jury laid their heads together to determine a matter of which they were totally ignorant and i departed ruminating upon what i had seen and heard and upon the supineness of those who suffer the country to labor under a grievance easily remedied  adieu sir etc  letter xix dear sir during my continuance in this country i have had the curiosity to enquire into their police and the execution of the law great is the discontent of the most sensible part of the inhabitants on account of the defective enforcement of the law crimes of the blackest dye frequently pass unobserved or if observed unpunished some might infer a conclusion from hence that the laws of england do not extend to this rugged spot or that the inhabitants are too refractory to be governed by law the former is not the case whatever foundation there may be for the latter  it may be said in general that the law is very defectively enforced in wales and some laws have never been adopted if i may use the expression into that country in the three most northern counties the laws respecting the game and those respecting the settlement and maintenance of the poor have never been put into execution  the game laws are restrictive of the natural rights of mankind and made for the benefit of a few individuals distinguished by the favors of fortune those for whose advantage they were enacted have alone a right to enforce them and they have a right likewise to dispense with the execution of their own exclusive privileges let them enjoy the praise they deserve for so meritorious and disinterested a conduct  the laws relating to the poor are far from being included under the same predicament by not enforcing them they do not dispense with their own privileges but abrogate the rights of others the most helpless part of mankind it is an advantage enjoyed in society that every individual who by accident or sickness is rendered incapable of maintaining himself has a right to a provision at the public expense the rights of humanity demand a support for the poor the laws of this country have provided it and the neglect of enforcing them is a shocking breach of every obligation legal moral and religious  let not these strangers to the rights of humanity as well as the laws of their country argue that the hand of charity is munificently extended to relieve distress but the distressed have not always the ability to undergo the fatigues of a mendicant erratic life it is not in the power of one depressed with the heavy burden of fourscore years to wander a desolate country to seek existence when he has spent his youthful morning and noon in labor and the service of society some support is due to him in the evening of life it is said that instances are not wanting of some who perish through want are not their unfortunate ends to be imputed to those who are delegated to enforce the laws however superficially i may be acquainted with this country i have reason to think that so heavy a charge is not destitute of foundation  is it then for want of charity that such instances happen no the hand of charity is not cold she is seldom solicited in vain it is on account of the inability of the object to seek relief and not their unwillingness in granting it  it is by some asserted that if the poor were maintained by parochial rates it would encourage idleness and that many would throw themselves upon the parish who could maintain themselves by labor i would deny this deduction  now those alone are capable of receiving the alms of charity who are able to maintain themselves the old the sick and decripit are not able like the healthy and strong to seek a precarious existence by roving about the country for subsistence the alms given to vagrants of whom they have no knowledge would more than support such as are really indigent  if each parish or district was to maintain its own poor work might be found for such as were capable of working and it would be more profitable for the farmer to furnish them with employment than to maintain them in idleness  some perhaps may argue that in many parts of england great abuses have crept into the execution of the poor laws and conclude that therefore they ought not to be enforced in wales it cannot be denied but that the wisest human institution may be perverted we ought rather to consider the advantages that may be derived from their proper execution than the abuses resulting from their improper enforcement  in large populous manufacturing towns and countries the poor are very numerous this may be as much owing to their luxurious manner of life as to the number of inhabitants in wales there are comparatively few that stand in need of charity and their number would be greatly diminished if proper means were used to excite industry  the lands are uncultivated the wool unmanufactured here would be employment as well for the youth and the aged as those in the vigor of life many of whom to the disgrace of the country wander about begging and pilfering the means perhaps the most effectual to provide for the poor would be to erect a workhouse in every county for the infirm and aged thus would charity be properly and effectually applied beggary eradicated and industry encouraged  the care of doing this is incumbent upon those that are delegated to enforce the laws of their country were i to address them it would be to diverst themselves of the prejudices they have imbibed to show by their conduct that they enjoy their offices neither for emolument or gratification of vanity that their attention is not solely confined to the indulgence of their pleasures and that the welfare of their country is at least a secondary consideration  i have now sir finished all i have to say of this country except some observations on its history which shall be the subject of some future letters  i am sir etc  letter xx dear sir all nations boast of their high descent and origin some have traced their genealogies from heroes and demigods others from the gods themselves  it would be a matter of wonder if this nation proverbially remarked for their pedigrees should not put in an equal claim to antiquity and high descent accordingly their historians affirm with great gravity that they are descended from one brutus the son of silvius son of the goddessborn pious aeneas  thus you see how easily they trace their pedigrees from venus and old father jupiter to prove this genealogy they say that brutus and britains are so very similar that the latter must necessarily be derived from the former  other historians assert with no less confidence that they are descended in a direct line from gomer from whom they are called cymry thus gratifying their vanity at the expense of their understanding  let their genealogists seek for their origin with as little success as they would the fountain of the nile it will be sufficient for us to determine that they are a branch of the ancient celts this is evident to demonstration from their manners customs and language  it is probable that they emigrated in colonies from the continent to seek settlements and were the only inhabitants of this island till they were first conquered by the romans afterward by the saxons when they were obliged to take refuge in the most remote and inaccessible parts of the country it is probable from the celtic words now in common use in those counties that many of them continued to reside in cornwall and the north of england long after the saxon conquest but they have for some ages been incorporated with the english so that scarce any vestiges can be traced of their different origin in wales they have had but little intercourse with foreigners by which means they still continue a distinct people  a minute detail of all the wars and depredations of the welsh and english from the era of the saxon conquest to the time of edward i would be as unimportant as those of the different tribes of indians their wars were equally bloody and both nations in those times were as savage and ferocious each as the scale of fortune preponderated filled the others territories with massacres and devastation and destroyed with fire and sword  such histories disgrace the annals of humanity and had better been left unrecorded  what i propose in this and my next letter is only to draw the most remarkable outlines of the history of wales  cadwalader was the last of the ancient british kings who reigned in england being driven out by the saxons he took refuge in armorica or little britain in france where a colony of britains were then settled  from the time of the saxon invasion to rhyddarch or roderick the great as he is called the britains had no settled government but were ruled by several petty kings or lords of whom nothing very memorable is related roderick was king of all wales which he divided between his three sons north wales to his eldest south wales to the second and powisland to the third with an injunction that they should owe allegiance to the eldest  this division of wales continued not long for it was again united under howel dha or the good who was grandson to roderick he is distinguished with the eminent title of the good as he was the great lycurgus of wales the code of laws which he collected for them are still extant of which i have taken some notice in a former letter  after the death of howel dha wales was again divided ihto three parts and continued so to its conquest by edward i without much interruption this want of policy in dividing the principality was the chief source of all their misfortunes distracted by civil commotions they were unable to repel the attacks of the danes by sea and the english by land  during the interval between the time of howel dha and gruffyth ap llewelyn we read of nothing very memorable except intestine commotions and invasions by the danes to whom they were compelled to pay tribute  gruffyth ap llewelyn reduced all wales under subjection to him he was very successful in his wars against the english in the time of edward the confessor he is the first if not the only one of the welsh kings that had a navy and is highly celebrated for his power and valor by the welsh historians harold the english general provoked by the continual incursions and depredations made by gruffydd in the frontier english counties fell upon him unprepared and obliged him to fly abroad leaving his country naked and defenseless the enemy conquered the greatest part of wales in the absence of gruffydd and left monuments of their victories with this inscription hic fuit victor haraldus we are told by giraldus cambrensis that these monuments were extant in his time but as i have before observed the veracity of these monkish historians is not always to be credited  when gruffydd returned after this base desertion of his country they were so justly irritated at his conduct that they beheaded him as a traitor and sent his head to harold  william the conqueror marched with a powerful army into wales which so intimidated them that they were kept in subjection during the whole of his reign in the time of the conqueror and william rufus many settlements were made in wales by the normans a plan which if it had been thoroughly executed must have effectually kept the welsh in subjection  among these was roger de montgomery earl of arundel and shrewsbury who took the town and castle of baldwyn and called it by the name of montgomery which it has retained to the present time  gruffyth ap conan who was at this time king of north wales in conjunction with the princes of south wales falling upon the normans routed them with great havoc and destroyed their castles and two large armies which william rufus raised against them gruffydd ap conan was afterward compelled by henry i to submit to him and make compensation for the ravages he had committed in england in the time of king stephen he took advantage of the civil wars then in england when he and his sons committed great depradations and slaughter on the normans who were settled in wales after a reign of fifty years gruffydd ap conan died he was revered and beloved by his subjects and dignified on account of his valor and victories with the distinguishing title of the defense and shield of wales  upon the death of gruffydd his territories were divided between his sons according to the custom of wales who owed allegiance to the eldest owen gwynedd owen was the first who had the title of prince of north wales before his time they were all called kings he was a man of a martial but savage disposition in these barbarous times as in the modern asiatic nations castration and loss of eyes was often the hard fate of such as had the misfortune to be related to the reigning prince a punishment which owen inflicted on his nephew cunethe son to his brother cadwalhon  he used his relations with great injustice and cruelty his brother cadwalhon he deprived of his estates and forced to fly abroad and seek asylum with henry ii at the instigation of cadwalhon henry made two or three expeditions into wales in which he was generally unsuccessful owing to the situation of the country of which owen always took advantage  after owen gwynedds death his eldest son jorwerth drwyndwn i e edward the noseless was set aside as improper to govern on account of that defect and the government devolved to his brother david ap owen who was afterward dethroned by llewelyn son to jorwerth drwyndwn madoc the youngest son of owen gwynedd it is said by the welsh historians went abroad and discovered the continent of america that part of it which is called florida upon his making this discovery he returned to wales and carried away a colony of his countrymen to make a settlement  this improbable story is universally believed among the welsh at this time and in confirmation of the truth of it they say that the welsh language is still spoken among some of the indian tribes who are the descendants of this madoc ap owen gwynedd thus do the welsh arrogate to themselves the honor of the first discovery of america in preference to the great columbus  under the conduct of llewelyn ap jorwerth and his son and successor david ap llewelyn the welsh carried on war with various success against the english defeating them in skirmishes and falling upon them unawares in narrow passes and when defeated flying for refuge to their natural impregnable fortresses  llewelyn ap gryffydd succeeded his uncle david ap llewelyn and was the last prince of wales of british blood he was slain unarmed in bueltwood where he had retired to meet some lords of the country and his head was put on the tower of london thus were the welsh at last conquered by edward i after they had maintained their independence for so many centuries  i have drawn the outlines of the history of this country as concisely as the subject would permit in my next letter i shall give some account of the means that were used to secure their subjection and their union with england which will conclude my observations on this country  i remain yours etc  letter xxi dear sir after the tragical end of prince llewelyn the politic kind edward took every prudent measure to secure his conquest he granted lands in wales to his followers thereby incorporating the english with his new subjects the woods which served as fastnesses to secure and conceal the enemy he ordered to be destroyed and caused several strong castles which i have before described to be built and garrisoned them to keep the country in subjection  the welsh having experienced the cruelty and rapaciousness of the english governors were unwilling to submit to edward and called upon him to give them a prince a native of their country we are informed by historians that for this purpose he sent his queen to carnarvoncastle where she was delivered of edward ii who had the title of prince of wales conferred upon him thereby complying with the literal import of their request at the same time that he avoided the spirit and intention of it  notwithstanding this politic concession and the more prevailing argument of force which the english used many of the welsh from the hopes of plunder or antipathy to their conquerors were still inclined to commit outrages there were many insurrections in wales after the death of prince llewelyn which were soon quelled the most considerable was that of owen glyndowr who was so called from the lordship of glyndowrdy his real name was owen ap gryffydd vaughan  the cause of this insurrection was an enmity that subsisted between owen and reginald lord gray of rhythin on account of some encroachments which reginald made on the lordship of glyndowrdy  owen had received his education in the inns of court and was in great favor with richard ii when richard was deposed he lost his estate at court and reginald lord gray presuming on this encroached upon his lands owen made application to parliament for relief which proved ineffectual and when the bishop of st asaph acquainted the parliament of the danger of irritating the welsh they returned this haughty answer se de illis scurris nudipedibus nil curare  owen not meeting with redress from the parliament had recourse to arms took reginald prisoner and destroyed the lordship of rhythin  this success induced many to follow owens fortunes he afterward gained a complete victory over lord march and the herefordshire men lord march was taken prisoner by owen in this battle and upon application being made to henry iv he refused to pay his ransom irritated by this lord march joined with owen and they entered into a confederacy with the earls of northumberland and worcester against king henry and it is said that they even signed deeds to divide the kingdom henry had the good fortune to defeat the designs of this powerful confederacy for he attacked them at shrewsbury before all their forces were joined and gained a complete victory over them the battle of husk afterward put an end to owens aspiring hopes and the lives of fifteen hundred welshmen who were killed on the field of battle this was the last struggle and unsuccessful effort made by the welsh for the recovery of their liberties the english now having entirely subjected them treated them rather as slaves than subjects they were prohibited from enjoying any offices purchasing any lands and even penal laws were enacted to prevent the english from intermarrying with them thus did the english parliament rather widen the breach which subsisted between the two nations than heal the wounds occasioned by the late insurrections  in the reign of henry vii who was descended from owen tudor of penmynydd in anglesea and from the princes of north wales the welsh experienced greater favor and by his son and successor henry viii the union of england and wales was happily and politically effected thus were united under the same laws and same government a people hitherto distracted with continual wars and enmity and it is hoped by every person that understands the real interest of the principality and wishes to promote it that every distinction between england and wales whether arising from a difference of manners and customs the mode of administering justice and executing the laws or even in the language may be entirely removed  i have now brought to a conclusion what i originally intended in my account of the manners customs history and state of the country at the same time that i omitted no circumstance that i thought would render the subject agreeable yet my principal view has been to take notice of such things as materially affect its interest however defective and improper the execution of my plan has been it has the merit of being justified by truth and impartiality which alone is a sufficient atonement for its faults  adieu sir etc  finis
