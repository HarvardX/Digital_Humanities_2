in the poultry and ralph smith at the bible under the royal exchange in cornhil   0   to the reader we could possibly have found out a patron had it been thought necessary under the protection of whose name this stranger might have come abroad into our english world but as we look upon dedications to be for the most part empty formalities as little minded by every one else as what is said in em is believed by the writer so we doubt not but this book will every where meet with a becoming reception seeing it is sent out on such a friendly errand as to heal our sores and pour oil and wine into our wounds  surgery in consideration of the antiquity the usefulness the necessity and excellency thereof has ever been in the highest esteem among all these other arts that were invented for the service of mankind for the improvemant of this noble profession the author of the ensuing treatise has been at no small pains having these twenty and eight years labored therein in some of the most celebrated countries of the world with an unwearied diligence and assiduous application the fruits of whose care and fatigues the courteous reader is here presented with  several of the learned and ingenious not only of this but also of some former ages have been very sensible that this art was far from having attained unto that perfection whereof it is capable yea that abuses had slipped into practice which were unknown to these renowned persons who at first were famous in this faculty it was this consideration that produced that learned and elaborate treatise of caesar magatas doctor of physic and professor thereof in the university of ferrara entitled de rara vulnerum tractatione and turundarum abusu to the same also we owe many other chirurgical composures that from time to time have appeared in the world some finding fault with one thing and some with another in the ordinary way yea some have gone so far as universally to reject it  it is not fitting and would be extremely unjust to say any thing in disparagement of the works of such as have endeavored to oblige the public by their labors only this we think may be said without offense to any that the book of caesar magatus is written in latin rare to be found and very long and consequently of no use to the english reader and as for others they have either superficially only and transiently complained of the imperfection of their art or then having signified to us in general the defects of the common medicines and method dont enter into a detail of the reasons that make them miscarry in particular cases or make known unto us either the name nature or composition of these other remedies which we are to use in the place of the former  the following treatise which was altogether designed for the reformation and improvement of surgery is without any of these inconveniences herein the author has discovered to us the disadvantages of the usual remedies and method in the differing cases that occur by particular reasons drawn from the nature and essence of the things whereof he discourses he not only describes to the life the way he would have us to take but also as to wounds and some other cases points it out to us clothed with all the most minute and requisite circumstances in particular instances of cures of all sorts done on all parts of the body he gives us an account of the names natures and compositions of the simple and easy remedies he uses and which he has found attended with constant success not confining himself or others to one or two only but exhibiting as was convenient a competent variety when he blames the ordinary practice and substitutes a better in the place of it he accompanies his invincible reasons with several authorities of the most considerable authors moreover he has taught us how to evite the exfoliation of bones and has given us a new way of dressing after performance of the operation of the trepan with an instrument of his own inventing  he seems to have hit upon the right way of carrying the knowledge of the art he professes to the furthest extent it can go which is is by giving an exact history of what he has learnt therein by experience without vouching upon the credit of others whether ancients or moderns what himself has not proved by a sufficient number of trials had this course been hitherto taken in all the arts and sciences they had not remained at this day of the dwarfish stature we find em neither had the world groaned under the bulky lumber of an infinite number of useless books which for the most part are but imperfect and mangled transcriptions from the works of others had physicians done so their art had not been still termed conjectural nor had the ill success and jarring opinions of by far the greatest number of those who bear that hounourable name exposed it to contempt and rendered it so abnoxious to be slighted even by the vulgar  but to return to our author all we will further say of him is that he is an unfeigned lover of mankind conscientious sincere and communicative of his knowledge without reserve and all this accompanied with an unusual modesty the truth of which desirable character his book will abundantly justify  we will no longer detain the reader in the entry only it is convenient he should know that this treatise in the original is printed with the approbations of some of the most eminent physicians and surgeons in france which are omitted in this english impression that was designedly contrived into this small bulk for the greater convenience of the reader of whom all we have to demand in behalf thereof is that he would read try and judge  the preface i am sufficiently convinced of the truth of what is delivered by hippocrates in his aphorisms that life is short and art is long and indeed it appears extremely difficult for one man righly to acquit himself in the practice of all the parts of surgery the capacity of the mind seems too limited to be able entirely to grasp so extensive an art though i have for these eight and twenty years past practiced surgery under different climates and in diverse hospitals of the army yet i am so far from thinking to have attained unto the knowledge necessary in this art that i own my self scarce to have had the time to improve and make some remarks on the curing of wounds to which chiefly i applied my self  however having had many opportunities of discovering the mischiefs occasioned by the use of tents and by the long and painful manner of dressing the wounded and often uncovering their wounds i was moved to compassion by their sufferings and thought my self obliged in conscience to give my advice herein besides seeing all men are allowed the liberty to speak their mind concerning these arts they profess i see not why i should be abridgd of that priveledge which others also assume to themselves possibly on much slighter grounds  it is not to be questioned but among the great number of surgeons wherewith france abounds some will applaud the excellency of my method but i am apt to think it will not please all i hardly ever knew any that practiced surgery as i do and there are few of all the celebrated authors we have that deliver any such doctrine which being contrary to the practice of many surgeons will not from the most part meet with the reception it merits  it is a noble thing said a wise philosopher to be evil spoken of for doing well there is no cause then why any should be ashamed to communicate to the public what he has learned when the world may reap any advantage thereby nothing is so inconsistent with christian charity and that love we owe to our neighbor as to refuse to let him light his taper at ours knowledge like light may be imparted and not lessened  it is not my design by this method that possibly will appear to be new to destroy the foundations and principal rules left us by the ancients concerning the curing of wounds i am willing only to make known my observations on this subject and to point out what i have perceived to be pernicious in the ordinary practice and withal to show what is certain and useful in that method i my self have followed for several years which i hope will be found so much the more advantageous and reasonable that it is founded on the principles of the circulation  i know it is a pretty bold attempt to go about to suppress tents that have been used for many ages and i am not ignorant that custom on many occasions has the force of a law but notwithstanding of all this i design to maintain the privileges of nature and to show beyond contradiction that reason and experience are on my side though at the same time i run the hazard of being universally censured for the newness of my method  i dont altogether condemn those who were the first inventers of tents dilaters and setons they have had their reasons for using them as i have mine for laying them aside many things have formerly been employed in physic and surgery which now are no more in use the received rules the order of curing and also the application of remedies have been changed from time to time that which is new at this time will one day be ancient as what to day is ancient was once new  it is true that the ancients did lay the foundations of surgery they have said many things but not all neither was their knowledge commensurate to the subject they had the honor of inventing but have left that of bringing to perfection to posterity however it is not to be doubted that they took all requisite care to avoid being deceived and to inform themselves of the truth but if they had done all nothing had been left us to do  add to this that if that prepossession in favor of the ancients and the blind submission to their dictates had not been laid aside we had not seen that great number of skilful physicians and surgeons which this age has produced who after having shaken off the tyranical yoke of antiquity found out things no less necessary than curious that otherwise would have remained till now in obscurity and had possibly been unknown to posterity  wherefore it is not impossible that in the active part of physic also which is surgery frequent experiences and continual diligence may have discovered abuses that were crept into practice and authorized by custom  it cannot be denied that what belongs to the fabric and constitution of the body of man always was but yet it has not ever been equally known the new discoveries have made a considerable change in the knowledge the judgment and in the cure of inward distempers and i see no reason why there ought not also to be some alterations in the cure of outward diseases and especially that of wounds which depend upon the same principles and have the advantage of the same new inventions  i suppose it will not be thought strange if after i have labored for the space of fifteen or sixteen years in hospitals of the army i have made some discoveries in the curing of wounds for usage we know compleats a workman i have formerly seen the most part of france i have traveled over a part of germany and all italy but have hardly found any place where tents were not in use several there are who find fault with them but few will give themselves the trouble to lay them aside some before me have written against em but i believe i have been the first my self who has had the boldness entirely to suppress em in practice excepting only in case of excessive bleeding and in some first dressings  hippocrates galen celsus fabricius ab aquapendente and many others cited in this treatise have been very near of my opinion and i have adducd some passages of these famous authors that countenance my method i have alleged some places out of ambrosius pareus being a well known author and celebrated for the cure of wounds but it appears by the remarks i have made that he is inconsistent with himself in many places of his works which cannot choose but perplex the mind of the young surgeon  jacobus marcus in his preface to the summary of bandages quotes septalius a famous physician of milan and caesar magatus a renound professor in the university of ferrara who as he says condemned the use of tents and the too frequent dressing of wounds and that to this they had suited their practice in these two cities for a very considerable time  i know it is not length of time that can give a value to things it is only their own excellency and every thing must once have a beginning i hope therefore if my reasons are approved and some credit given to my experiences none will judge it necessary to wait yet till an age is expired before they will list themselves upon my side i know not whether my reasonnings will be of force enough to persuade but the infallible proofs i have given of the goodness of my method in the great number of cures i have wrought thereby will i hope suffice to convince the public  i grant it is difficult at first to come over to the opinion of another when it is contrary to our own but when the life of men is concerned we ought not to delay one minute to free our selves from error and to put off these prejudices that often hinder us thoroughly to penetrate into the truth of things the opinions we receive in our younger days and the most part of the maxims we take upon trust from the ancients are ordinarily the cause of the false steps we make in the chief obligations of our calling the life of the wounded is indeed in the hands of the surgeon who has him under his care wherefore he ought to give all diligence not only to attain a competent measure of skill but also to find out the most sure and the most speedy way of curing wounds  it will be objected to me that a great number of wounded persons have been and yet are every day cured with the use of tents and also by following the ancient method in all its circumstances i answer it is true and indeed if all those who are dressed after this manner were in certain danger of being lost it would be downright malice and cruelty to use it neither had my endeavors been at this time needful to suppress it since it would have been rejected long ere now but this i affirm after i have made trial of both the one and the other method and have carefully considered the difference between em that those who are cured by that of the ancients have need of a healthful and vigorous constitution besides that it is never without danger much pain and requires a tedious length of time all which inconveniences are avoided by embracing that which i propose  in this hospital we have by this method happily cured wounds of diverse sorts yea of as many various kinds as there are different parts of the body having had wounds of all these under our care wherefore this happy success cannot in reason be ascribed to the temper of the air which in some places is favorable to certain parts of the body as has been observed by guy de chauliat who speaking of wounds in the head averrs that they are more easily cured at avignion than at paris and that these of the legs on the contrary are cured sooner at paris than at avignion the air i confess where i am because of the situation of the place is not so replenisht with gross parts as in plain and low grounds yet is it notwithstanding ever hurtful to wounds both by reason of the niter wherewith it is stored and also because of its activity and penetraction but i have never yet been able to remark that it was either more beneficial or hurtful to one part than to another and i have always used all possible precaution to hinder its access to all wounds whatsoever as will appear by the sequel  i shall not in this treatise discourse of the natures and differences of the diseases that belong to surgery this is already sufficiently done to my hands by others and the learned m verduc doctor of physic has lately obliged the public with a complete piece of surgery i will therefore concern my self only with my own practice and if any thing else chance to fall from my pen it will be only what i thought necessary for understanding my subject  though in many places of this book i advise the use of general remedies and a suitable course of diet among the diversions necessary in the curing of wounds yet i dont pretend to assume to my self what peculiarly belongs to physicians whose part it is to order these things and according to whose directions they ought to be used but i wrote in an hospital where the whole ordering of the wounded was altogether committed to me it shall ever be law to me especially when the occasion will allow to keep my self within the bounds of my profession that man who would acquit himself in his employment as becomes him will find enough to do though he keep himself to what properly belongs to surgery and those who pretend to know all things most commonly know nothing at all but after all i judge it highly advantageous for a surgeon to know on certain occasions how to make a seasonable use of general remedies as well as of topics vulnerary drinks etc for opening of a vein a potion or a clyster when seasonably ordered and timously administrated may save the life of a wounded person or at least prevent a great many accidents  i have divided this little treatise into three parts in the first i treat of tents and of the mischiefs that continually accompany the use of em and after i have made it appear that the air is pernicious to wounds i add on that occasion a dissertation on uncovered bones and then i describe my way of dressing after performing the operation of the trepan with a new instrument of my own invention  the second part contains a collection of some cures that i have done according to my method with a reflection after each which i justify by authority adducing some citations there would be reason indeed to think that i had accommodated nature to my own sentiments and the success of my practice might justly be called in question if i had not related many very important experiences and such as were publicly performed for without doubt the establishing of a new method as i have already said is a pretty bold attempt especially in a time when france seems to have advanced surgery to the highest pitch of splendour but particularly paris to which i owe my birth and education knowing therefore that experience is for the most part much more convincing than reason i have quoted several cases and given a brief but very particular account of several cures which i have related in a manner as natural as possible  the third and last part will be no less useful to the young surgeon than the two others it is a general idea of my practice with some observations and a description of the simple remedies that i use in the cure of wounds and other diseases belonging to the province of surgery their goodness is sufficiently attested by the advantageous effects which they produce and the great number of patients cured by their means ought to gain them some repute  i have done what i could to give this book a plain and easy style if the language is not fluent nor the expressions inviting and agreeably ordered it ought not to be surprising simplicity and plainness best becomes the truth a book written in an hospital in the middle of the alps without any assistance or advice and which is bottomed only upon practice neither can nor possibly ought to be attended with the vain embellishments of eloquence in a word i expect to persuade not so much by what i can say as by what i have done i hope the reader will take in good part this essay and will not condemn a design whose only aim is the glory of god the comfort of the afflicted and the perfection of surgery  the contents part i

mischiefs of a contrary practice with a discourse upon discovered bones and a way to dress with a new instrument of the authors invention after the use of the trepan  chap i of the four ends proposed in the using of tents the use of tents in wounds being reputed of so long standing in surgery and but too much approved on by the universal practice at this day it will be necessary for us before we deliver our own method to give our thoughts thereon which also we will confirm by reason and authority  fabricius ab aquapendente in his eighth chapter of wounds reckons up only three uses of tents but many after him make mention of four one is to keep open the orifice of the wounds another to carry the required medicines to their bottom a third to further the coming away of extraneous bodies and a fourth is to drink in as it were and to contain the filth and excrements therein generated  our design is at present to consider whether these ends so far as they are expedient may not be obtained without the assistance of tents for i would not be thought without reason to make any change of the order received in managing of wounds nor rashly to lay aside any thing that might conduce to the relief of the wounded or facilitate and shorten the cure  chap ii of the first end of tents it is unquestionably certain that natures endeavors are ever bent toward the supplying of what has been taken away by violent means from our bodies and uniting the divisions made therein we ought not therefore to keep open the orifice of a wound but if needful it may be widened at the first dressing and thereby what is designed in the first use will be sufficiently attained however i dont altogether disapprove of the use of dilaters and sometimes of tents when they are required to contain and support astingents to stop the bleeding or to hinder the reunion of fresh incisions that sometimes are necessary in the first dressing of gunshot wounds especially when there is any suspicion that extraneous bodies are lodged in the wound or some splinter of a bone that nature is not able to reunite but if once the first two or three days are over tents are not only useless but extremely hurtful particularly in gunshot wounds that of themselves are oftentimes sufficiently enlarged by the coming away of the bruised flesh commonly called the escar before which we need not fear the closing up of the wound  it was seldom ever known that a wound did fill up while any foreign body remained within it now the escar is an extraneous body in regard of those parts to which it immediately adheres and must therefore of necessiy be separated from them moreover nature cannot effect a reunion of the flesh till first she have freed her self of what keeps asunder the parts to be joined  fabricius ab aquapendente is of the same opinion part i book   chap   where he says that nature never cures a wound so long as any thing is in it that offends her  i do believe there is no body but will grant that the separation of the escar is a work of nature that is most spedily performed where the natural heat is most vigorous now seeing new flesh is bred easiliest at the bottom of the wound it is there also where it first begins to fill up and therefore the orifice is last of all freed from the escar and supplied with new flesh for which cause we have no reason to fear its too sudden closing neither does there appear any necessity of using tents to avoid that inconveniency  as for wounds made by sharp instruments they have no need of tents seeing they dont want to be dilated but only to be closed up now what thwarts natures intention not only may but ought to be laid aside  finally contused wounds cannot be united till first what is bruised is removed either by the force of the natural heat or the application of dissolving medicines or by suppuration and consequently it appears that in this case also as well as the others tents may be forborne and so the first end proposed in using them is not to be allowed  chap iii of the second end of tents there will be no need of a great many reasons to demonstrate that it is an easy matter to make the remedies pass to the bottom of a wound without the assistance of tents for to this purpose nothing more is required than to give a pretty soft and thin consistence to these ointments balsams and other such like remedies as are commonly used in curing of wounds  when a simple division is made in a healthful and well tempered body nature stands not in need of any thing else but the natural balsam of the parts or the nutricious juice in order to procure a reunion especially if it is in fleshy parts in which case the tents and ointments do only irritate the parts cause fluxion of humors putrify the flesh alter the nutricious juice and so occasion long and very great suppurations which rather hinder than promote the cure  chap iv of the third end of tents that the discharge of extraneous bodies is at all furthered by tents is a thing not to be imagined yea on the contrary we have more reason to believe that they conduce very much to retain them for supposing that any thing remains in a wound as a bullet pieces of bone of clothes or wad etc it is almost impossible ever to draw it forth at the same place by which it entered unless it be at the first or second dressing and this happens very seldom though never without great pain and much time or trouble  there is no probability that a body so heavy as lead can remain for any considerable time in one place unless it stick in some bone or joint the flesh has not solidity sufficient to detain the bullet but gradually yields to its descending weight and supposing it did not stir of it self yet so far would a tent be from furthering its coming out that it would rather fix it faster and push it deeper into the wound now the matter ever follows the bullet and makes to it self one or more cavities it gathers together increases ferments and commonly brings on a fever the part is weakened the body wasted and in fine the wounded person frequently is brought to an untimely end the like accidents may also be produced by the splinter of a bone or some such other thing after the same manner hence it is that on the least suspicion whether from the complaint of the wounded or any other appearance of a foreign body remaining in the wound search is made thereinto with instruments and with the fingers but for the most part to no purpose as i have often seen and all this to satisfy themselves and to show to the bystanders and to the patient that no diligence has been spared to further the cure this method is no less hurtful than cruel and by exasperating the parts causes fluxions and brings on putrefaction yea oftentimes incurable fistulas but when all these foresaid means fall short of success then a lower part is sought out therein to make a counteropening which sometimes when the patient is of a strong constitution effects the cure  pieces of garments of wad of linen etc are often carried by the bullet into the wound and there remain after it is drawn out being deeper lodged these things are but too capable of occasioning troublesome accidents and tents conduce not a little to keep them there obstructing the passage whereby they might be expelled it is certain that a tent always swells in the wound and filling up the orifice keeps in the matter which not being longer to be contained within the narrow bounds of the wound spreads it self into the neighboring parts glides between the muscles and carries along with it the extraneous bodies which are there corrupted and putrified and infecting the wound occasion mortifications or abscesses very hard to be cured  i say then to conclude this chapter that it is altogether in vain to use tents with a design thereby to facilitate the discharge of foreign bodies and that they rather conduce to keep them in than assist in furthering their passage but if by chance it should fall out as sometimes it does that the wound close up when there is some extraneous body within it will occasion an abscess either under the ancient escar or somewhere else more convenient for nature by the opening of which only whatever is hurtful and improfitable will be discharged  as for leaden bullets that have not been drawn out at the first dressing their remaining in the parts can do no great hurt because they are friendly to nature and in process of time by their own weight slip down between the muscles and often appear under the skin from whence they may be taken out without either trouble or danger the most part of surgeons are convinced of the truth of what i say only this i must acknowledge that we ought to endeavor to draw forth such bullets as are either lodged in a joint or in hazard of falling into some cavity of the body as that of the scull of the thorax or of the lower belly where they might be irrecoverably lost  chap v of the fourth end of tents as for the fourth pretended use of tents i grant that they are always soaked with the moisture of the wound but as they retain that humidity not suffering it to pass out so they are thereby swelled up and enabled to intercept the passage of all the other matter that is generated now i would willingly hear a reason for keeping in a wound excrements which nature is so sollicitous to throw out for being corrupted by their abode they alter and destroy the constitution of the parts that contain em seeing then the longer the matter is detained the more it is depraved i am persuaded it is much better to give it a free passage not interrupting its course than to shut it up with tents and force it to take other ways  having therefore demonstrated that the ends that have been designed by the use of tents in so far as they are for the advantage of the wounded may not only be attained without em but are really hindered thereby i will endeavor in the following chapter to take the part of oppressed nature and to assert her liberty by reasons founded on the circulation of the blood and supported by the authority of many authors  chap vi consequences deduced from the preceding chapters nature has been diversely defined by authors who have treated therein julius alexandrinus calls it the author the principle and efficient cause of natural beings in this sense it is regarded in physic as the cause of health and the physician of distempers and is by van helmont considered in three different states to wit either in its full strength and vigor or as impaired and weakened or as altogether oppressed and prostrate  these things might be applied to our present purpose however that i may give a more clear and intelligible idea of nature which may better suit with outward diseases i shall look upon her as the chief worker of whatsoever concerns our health and i am persuaded seeing she has framed every thing according to the law of its being she will also maintain them in their necessary union unite them when divided and in a word restore them to their first estate when any way fallen from it  this union is so necessary for maintaining health and preserving life that all or at least the most part of diseases proceed from a defect therein for things of a foreign quality are one way or other mixed with the humors of the body which disordering and interrupting the union of their parts change and deprave the good temperament and qualities of the natural balsam called radical moisture and from hence come diseases and death  in outward maladies also and in divisions of the harder or softer parts of the body manifest to the external senses it is plain that nature suffers and consequently must strive with all her might to reunite the divided parts the surgeon as her faithful minister in curing wounds ought to employ his utmost care to assist her while she labors to effect that so necessary union to this end he should not only leave her at liberty putting no hindrance in her way but also free her from whatever may thwart her design finally he must assist and imitate her mind her inclinations observe her proceedings and follow her as it were step by step that he may be ever ready to lend her his required help  the art of physic turns upon this principle that nature has the chief hand in curing diseases it is with her the physician ought to consult and without her consent as it were he ought never to do or undertake any thing and in a word he only is the ablest physician who has most earnestly applied himself to the study of nature  i acknowledge there are many cases wherein nature alone is not sufficient and in these she must be helped out by the hand of art as in the drawing out of extraneous bodies from wounds cutting off mortified parts opening abscesses restoring broken or disjoynted bones and other like operations belonging to the province of surgery but let a surgeon be never so superficially acquainted with nature he may easily perceive that by tents and dilaters she is oppressed deprived of liberty of acting and directly opposed in her design which is to reunite the divided parts  fabricius ab aquapendente whom i mentioned before asserts that nature never cures a wound so long as any thing is in it which she cannot retain for in this he is agreed with the most judicious that it is nature that works the cure and at the same time shows that a tent is such an enemy to her as neither ought nor can be kept within but to her hurt and destruction galen also in his third book of method says that it is not the remedies but nature that closes up wounds  wherefore experience having convinced me of this truth i set my self to consider natures designs her inclinations and the way she takes to effect the cure of wounds and have observed that tents do ever oppose and prove a hindrance to her it is every day to be seen that nature can suffer nothing foreign to abide with her she endeavors with all her might to free her self from tents and dossels with which wounds are ordinarily crammed up for though they did not occasion pain as we may well assured they do yet being extraneous bodies nature cannot endure them without trouble and let them be never so small or soft they must necessarily press always upon some vessels of which the body is nothing else but a contexture  according to their bigness and hardness tents do more or less disturb the course and order of the circulation of the blood so far as the wound reaches they squeeze out the most subtle part of that or other liquors contained in the vessels they press upon which by the matter already in the wound is converted into its own nature and becomes a ferment that being retained grows hot and corrupt and so alters the containing and neighboring parts and oftentimes imparts its vicious qualities to the mass of blood by vapors sent into the veins yea the matter it self is sucked up by the veins their orifices being dilated by its fermentation moisture and stay and this circulating with the blood entirely corrupts it and causes fevers that end in death unless nature by some critical and healthful motion throw out the corruption  ambrosius pareus in his ninth book treating of wounds chap   forbids the use of tents in few words being therein supported by the authority of galen who in the fourth chapter of his method affirms it to be necessary in all wounds whither simple or compound that nothing be between their lips that may hinder reunion the same pareus in his ninth book chap   recommends the use of long and thick tents in the beginning and afterward advises to make em more thin and short but does not here forbid their use in the same book chap    he takes the part of tents in opposition to a certain physician that had written against his method  these differing and contradictory opinions in one and the same author must of necessity throw the young surgeon into perplexing doubts so that often he cannot know what is best or what way is most secure it is certain however that the mischief of tents was known to galen because he forbids their use and also to that physician who found fault with the practice of pareus his name i know not but by the acknowledgment of the same author he altogether lays aside the use of tents and orders to dress a wound but once in four days this method therefore is not so new as at first i thought with my self for i had formed my design ere ever i was aware of what i have here quoted and it was experience only that opened my eyes  galen justifies further my opinion in his third book of method and ninth chapter when he says that in every wound there are two sorts of excrements a gross and a subtle which as he affirms hinder the generation of flesh now if this be so it is very preposterous to keep them in the wound with tents if it be said that the tents may be made so little as not altogether to fill up the orifice nor hinder the passage of the matter i answer that though they be made never so small yet will they fill up the mouth of the wound because they ever swell up to the bigness of the space they are in but supposing the most subtle matter to escape yet the more gross and clammy is by them retained and is enough to occasion grievous accidents now if small tents prove such a hindrance to the curing of wounds what may be expected from these that are long and hard and pass to the very bottom however these also are used by many surgeons who for want of applying themselves to the consideration of nature and her intentions in curing of wounds continue to follow a method that is both cruel and destructive  tents dilaters and setons always occasion disorders in the places where they are applied if they touch the nerves they cause extremity of pain that is often the original of many evils and followed by many grievous accidents such as convulsions loss of sense etc if they bear upon a tendon its action is hurt and motion ceases if they press the vessels as they almost ever do the circulation of the blood is disturbed  but suppose a tent should only press together the mamellons fibrenx fibrous papillae that compose the skin which are of a quick sense being the instrument of touching this alone were enough to disturb the order and distribution of the spirits which now moving in a tumultuary way among these fibrous papillae of the skin contract them by the irritation and pricking which they cause now the fibers being shortened and the skin contracted the vessels must of necessity be doubled or squeezed together and consequently the circulation diminished or entirely suppressed in these cases there is not so much blood carried back by the veins as was brought by the arteries now if the circulation is altogether stopped a mortification ensues if considerably diminisht an abscess but if the humors ouze into the wound from the capellary vessels large and tedious suppurations are occasioned  the hardness and swelling are caused by the matter that is stopped and diffused about the place and therefore all the accidents are more or less grievous and alter according to the force of the compression and quantity of the diffused matter the good or bad disposition of the blood of the humors or of the part affected and the different degrees of the natural heat which hastens or keeps back the fermentation and putrefaction  from what has been said it appears that the blood and humors are not carried or drawn as some authors love to speak to the afflicted part more abundantly than at other times although the spirits run thither in much greater plenty but as for the blood it is evident enough that it circulates less in the wounded than in the sound parts because it moves with greatest ease in these latter and it is a law of nature that a body in motion always moves toward these places where it finds least opposition  the truth of this is clearly demonstrated by the accidents which some time ago followed on certain malignant fevers in places not far distant from hence they caused an obstruction and swelling in the lower belly so considerable that the circulation was stopped and a gangreen ensued but on the contrary the blood was violently and in too great quantity carried upwards it could not be contained within the vessels broke through all obstacles and caused sharp pains abscesses deliriums and death  i have considered the accidents that most commonly attend wounds and do believe that for the most part they proceed from the disorder of the circulation of the blood occasioned by broken pieces of bones bullets or some other foreign thing remaining in the wound these things are not of such a figure as to cause an irritation nor can they of themselves produce any putrefaction and yet they commonly bring on abscesses we ought not then to ascribe these accidents to pain for sometimes they come without it and this often is present where those dont happen but i am of opinion that these extraneous bodies press the vessels that are dispersed through the place where they are and stop the blood which slipping into the pores and spaces of the flesh by its stay and fermentation is there corrupted and changed unto the matter of an abscess  it is true leaden bullets or other things of a like nature have been long in the body and yet no abscess has followed but this may be attributed to the largeness of the place wherein they happened to be lodged so as not to occasion any disorder or because sliding between the muscles it did not hinder the course of the humors the other accidents that ordinarily attend gunshot wounds are also occasioned by the defect of the circulation as i shall observe in the sequel of this discourse where it shall be made to appear that tents and dilaters used in this sort of wounds hinder the fall of the escar the dissolution of what is bruised and the passing out of whatever ought to be brought away  this will without difficulty be granted by those who well understand the course of the blood and humors and the union and order of the parts that compose the body all the parts are so united one to another that the least separation cannot be made without pain effusion of some humor or some other disorder experience shows that it is not only the air that rots the bones but also the nourishment of the nervous parts when it is altered by a malignant acid and generally any matter that has acidity enough to cause a fermentation and corruption in the place of its abode when kept in by tents or other such obstacle  though doleus in his surgery is not altogether against the using of tents yet he shows that we ought to do it with great caution from whence it appears he judged them dangerous  etmullerus is of the same mind in his physical surgery where he joins such accidents with the use of tents as ought to fright those who employ em he advises the using of pledgets and quite to lay aside tents in wounds of the nerves and tendons and in these of the joints hence it appears that this auther was no great favourer of tents for which reason he orders the use of the vulnerary balsam in the cure of wounds which promotes the generation of flesh and causes a speedy union to both which the use of tents is directly contray  all the famous physicians who have treated of surgery and the curing of wounds are well nigh of the same opinion i could reckon up a great number if i thought that these i have adducd were not enough it appears as i have said in the preface that septalius and magatus both renowned physicians that practiced surgery in italy followed this method for the space of forty years with very good success  m caufape doctor of physic in his observations on the frequent use of bleeding altogether discards the use of tents without any reserve he supports his opinion with reasons which i had conceived before his book came to my hands but we may be sure that author did not write on this subject before he was fully convinced by his own experience of what he advanced it would be an unpardonable rashness for one to write and maintain that of which he doubted the truth and to establish a method on false principles  i very well know that great numbers will oppose themselves to what i advance on this subject which is the common fate of all opinions that appear new but of this matter experience only is the most competent judge whose testimony shall be deduced at large and with all faithfulness in the second part of this work  in this first part i make account sufficiently to explain the reasons that obliged me to lay aside the use of tents and dilaters i cannot approve their proceeding who use them because others have done so or because the ancients have ordered it the glory or blame of the good or ill success say they accrues not to us we have custom and antiquity for our warrant but the arts and sciences ought never to be shut up within such narrow and unequal bounds knowledge reason and experience would be injured to the highest degree if we should impose upon them such severe restrictions and take from them that liberty which should last equally with the world  chap vii reasons to demonstrate the mischief of tents many of the ancients and some of the modern writers have spoken of tents as things indifferent such authors i mean as having written of surgery and the cure of wounds seem to have brought these things to some perfection they leave it to the discretion of the surgeon either to use them or not according as they judged convenient they did not think this matter of such moment as to require their attention they looked on these means with unconcerned eyes referring themselves therein to the honesty of those who first wrote of them it is apparent they had not observed as i have often done the mischief occasioned by tents the use of which destroys indifferently the vulgar with persons of merit whose loss in a state is always to be regretted  we need not be surprised at what we see happen every day in the cure of all sorts of wounds it is not at this time only that one thing has been taken for another our knowledge is not so great as to reach to all necessary truths nor do we perfectly understand the causes of all the accidents and disorders that follow upon wounds all those who have treated of this subject have endeavored to explain them according to their opinions as i have done my best to accommodate them to mine but occasions are now frequent enough and therefore it will be easy for any one to inform himself of the truth and to distinguish who are in the right and who not  m de la chariere in his book of operations discoursing of wounds advises carefully to wipe away all the matter of a wound and to fill up every the very least corner with dilaters or dossels to hinder its staying lest it should be sucked up by the veins and carried by the circulation to the heart the same author adds that the air is a most powerful enemy to wounds nevertheless it is impossible to dry up the matter with all that exactness he requires what diligence soever be used without taking up some time during which the air will do incomparably more harm than the matter that therein might have remained which often is not endud with all these ill qualities one is apt to imagine as shall be made to appear in the fourth chapter of the last part of this treatise  this author acknowledges that in contusions a little extravasated blood squeezes together the vessels interrupts the course of the blood and humors and causes fluxions and inflammations what then may be expected from a like quantity of dossels heaped one upon another they increase the division made in the body and oppose the design that one ought chiefly to have regard to in curing of wounds which is reunion to this may be added that they are more hard painful and contrary to nature than a little blood of which he speaks  as for what is alleged by him that the matter might otherwise be taken up by the veins it is not to be apprehended unless it were of so great a quantity as to ferment or made so long a stay in the part as to open and dilate the orifices of the vessels this may indeed fall out in wounds of the breast as will appear in the second part of this book and in these of the thorax where the capacity and heat of the part are sufficient to produce that effect this also may happen in great abscesses whereof we will give some examples at the end of this work finally this may arrive when the mouth of a wound is stopped up with tents or dilaters which too often keep the matter shut up from one dressing to another hence it increases ferments and ordinarily acquires a vicious and malignant quality which may be communicated to the heart by means of the circulation of the blood  of all those mischiefs tents and dossels may be accounted the chief occasion now to avoid all these accidents and the staying of the matter in the wound we need only leave open the orifice and put nothing into the cavity which may increase the separation of the parts to the end they may come together when there is nothing to hinder their reunion nor any empty space where the matter may make any considerable stay these i think are good reasons and strong enough to overthrow an opinion that is contrary to my ten or twelve years experience  the same m de la charriere a little further says that the orifice of a wound must be dilated when it is so little that it will not suffer dossels to enter that so it may be filled therewith and i on the contrary widen it that i may avoid the using of them for reasons mentioned before moreover it is to be feared that a dilater may be lost and fixed in a deep wound of this we have had sufficient proof in the person of one of our generals and many others wounded in the battle of marseils  wherefore if tents may be laid aside as has been done in this hospital even in deep wounds of the most fleshly parts of the body much more ought they to be forborne in others  the same author before mentioned rejects the use of tents excepting in wounds of the breast and lower belly that penetrate notwithstanding it may be seen in the second part of this treatise where we discourse of wounds in the breast in what manner we have cured many such of different natures without the assistance of tents  as for those in the lower belly i know it may be said to me that if i have not used tents to them it is long of the difficulty of their application and stay in this part where by reason of the continual motion they cannot be kept in unless with a very strait bandage but the matter is otherwise for indeed i see not for what reason tents are required to this part any more than to others let us suppose now that the expected suppuration of the contained parts that are wounded is already begun it is impossible the matter can come away while the orifice is stopped up with a tent but it must fall down by its own weight into the lower part of that cavity also what matter or blood may there be collected cannot be discharged by reason of the tent which is as a dam to keep it in especially if we wait till the suppuration of the teguments which is never great be excited by irritation or by tents otherwise the motion in breathing and the lifting up of the peritonaeum in inspiration will drive out the matter as it breeds if a free passage be allowed it  there is one case wherein dilaters and sometimes tents become in a manner necessary and that is when a wound is accompanied with a considerable bleeding then they may be used to carry astringents to the opening of the vessels and to support and keep them on chiefly in deep wounds for if at first we should join the lips of the wound and apply astringents upon them the outward bleeding might be represt before that of the vessels were restrained and so the blood running between the muscles would there be corrupted and would spoil the parts wherein it is contained and these that border upon them and might also occasion suffocation and a gangrene this is what i saw at turin to befall the baron de la serra a gentleman of savoy who being wounded with a sword near the right armpit had a branch of the vena subclavia opened he was dressed by a very expert surgeon who whether by chance or otherwise neglected to apply astringents to the opening of the vessel though the bleeding was very great the wound was joined and the part loaded with astringents which were made fast with compresses and bandage in the mean time the blood continued to run from the vein and to diffuse it self between the muscles of the breast two or three days past before the first dressings were taken off and then the thorax was found to be gangrened the wounded person died in a little time after  the cause of this gangrene cannot reasonably be ascribed to any thing else but the retaining of the blood and matter which finding no outlet pressed together by reason of their bulk the vessels and the nerves and hindered the circulation of the blood and course of the spirits and other liquors so that the blood became quickly corrupted and caused all these disorders these same accidents may be occasioned by matter shut up in the cavity of wounds by tents stopping their orifice especially if that matter is considerable for its quantity and very much crowded  when in my younger days i frequented hospitals and practiced with very able surgeons i have seen at time of dressing the tents for the most part expelled from the wounds in spite of the bolsters and bandage nature then clearly signifying her intention nevertheless they continued still to use them forcibly thrusting them again into the wounds though not without much pain what a strange method is this how is it possible for a wound to close up so long as a foreign body is entertained within it if a pea or a litttle ball be kept in an issue though for ten years it will still remain open but if you take it out but for one half day you shall find it entirely filled up  a tent does the same to a wound that the ball does to an issue and fistulas that trouble so many people all their life are the effect of tents that have been inconsideratly used in the cure of their wounds the humors take their course through these places which they find open this becomes first habitual and then natural and necessary and thereby the flesh is hardened and becomes callous these impurities which nature sometimes evacuates by ways surprising to us being detained in one place became a bag of mattet and that same nature unwilling that any thing superfluous and unprofitable should remain with her by a peculiar sagacity makes a virtue of necessity and uses these passages she finds open to free herself from the excrements and humors that disturb her but at the same time a part of the baume radical radical balsam which is the life and support of the parts passes out also by the same ways  i know not to what i can better compare these openings in the body through which humors take their course than to these of trees whether made by nature herself or the assisting hand of man by which the sap that nourishes both its trunk and the other parts passes out the difference only lies here that these help to increase and preserve the trees but those to destroy and weaken the body  for certain it is that fistulas considerably impair the parts never leave those that have them in an entire state of health and shorten their days whatever any may allege to the contrary but that which surprises me most is to find the afflicted persons support the inconveniences they suffer with a kind of satisfaction fancying that if in time they should permit their sores to close up then death would undoubtedly soon after follow  wherefore when there is nothing to hinder the filling up of a wound art has nothing else to do but to observe natures proceedings which sometimes exceeds in the breeding of flesh in soft parts and sometimes in generating the callus in hard parts but it is observable that in curing wounds she proves oftener superfluous than deficient thus it appears that tents ought not to be used in wounds seeing nature very frequently throws em out because she cannot bear the presence of what is foreign dont we see that so soon as she is oppressed with any thing hurtful all her endeavors are used to get rid of it she has a thousand means unknown to us and often takes such secret and singular ways as are hidden from the most curious anatomists that young man under the care of fernelius who had swallowed an ear of grass that came out some time after by a little abscess between two of his ribs is a sufficient demonstration of this truth ambrosius pareus also relates that he took from the groin of a woman a needle that had entered at the hip of the same side in fine the consideration of the surprising ways whereby these extraneous things were cast out of the body obliges us to conclude that nature is very wise and cannot endure the least thing that is hurtful or disquieting a little dust in the eye disturbs all her economy and no rest is to be expected till it is out a small crum of bread that goes not the right way but is by some motion or the agitation of a little air thrown into the windpipe does it not endanger suffocation what endeavors are made to cast it out the air breaks forth with violence from the lungs the whole body is shaken all its parts are in motion the face is inflamed the eyes run with tears convulsions follow and this admirable masterpiece of nature is all in trouble and disorder and all this for a thing in appearance most inconsiderable a stone or a little sand in the reins ureters bladder or vrethra will scarce permit a moments rest for the violent pain and indeed our life may be called an image of death so long as a stone is lodged in any of these parts so true is it that nature abhors what disturbs her  now it is to be observed that according to our method the dilaters and tents with which the wound was filled hitherto must be taken out so soon as the bleeding is stopped and that the surest way is for the surgeon altogether hence forth to leave off such dangerous means because their use may irritate and at the same time by touching the vessels may open them and renew the bleeding which by protracting the cure occasions new troubles to the wounded as i have often seen  fabricius ab aquapendente part i book   chap   speaking of transverse wounds of the forehead advises to apply long and slender compresses wet with the white of an egg one on each side of the wound and to press them together so that the lips may touch without stitching especially if we would avoid the deformity of a scar now i know no reason why the same method may not be put in practice in wounds of other parts of the body made by cutting instruments nor do i understand why such should be dilated seeing they require only reunion for my own part i have practiced this way in many places and on different parts of the body with the desired success  these who are unprejudicated or will reflect but a little on the common method will be convinced that i dont without cause reject it it is easy enough to apprehend the cause of the perpetual pains suffered by those miserable persons whose wounds are filled with tents and dossils for having thrust into the sore lint twisted hard and uneven and applied thereon plasters and bolsters all is made fast with a bandage that passes several times about the part now though this may seem not to be very strait yet it is ever tight enough to press upon the tent and cause it to touch every where upon lively and sensible parts for the inward parts of our body are indeed very sensible and unaccustomed to the touch of any extraneous thing so that the wounded cannot move in the least without great pain his wounded members are utterly disabled and by a kind of necessity he is confined to his bed as a lame and impotent paralitick and always in one posture which is no less if not more pernicious than the wound it self especially in hospitals where the beds not being such as are requisite for the ease and comfort of the sick cause almost universal excoriations and oftentimes mortifications and gangrenes this is what i have many times seen and frequently through the fault of those who follow the ordinary method of dressing  not that other parts of our body are distitute of sense any more than these i just now spoke of those that are so charitable as to visit hospitals will attest this nothing is there to be heard at the hours of dressing but cries and howlings but we cannot enough recommend to surgeons on this occasion to use their patients in the most gentle manner possible for it must be owned that there are some among them that would think they had not acquitted themselves as they ought unless they made those under their hands to roar out for some considerable time which makes many to think that surgery and cruelty are unseparable  chap viii the reasons of the authors practice with the motives that induced him thereto from what i have already said i know i shall be accused as if i only writ to find fault with the methods now in use nevertheless i am not afraid to avow that i am inspired with a much nobler design i take no pleasure to trample upon the monuments of the dead or to carp at the living it is conscience alone that obliges me to maintain what i have advanced for the good of the public but as it will be an hard task to persuade some people of what is contrary to these maxims they have sucked in as it were with their milk it will be convenient to propose examples of what ought to be followed and to point forth what is to be shunned for in fine it is here as in religions every one thinks his own method the best  among the great number of those who at this day practice surgery there are very few whose methods agree some without departing an hairs breadth from the opinion of the ancients blindly follow their dictates and it is enough that any thing has been advanced by such or such an author to make it pass into an unviolable law others more active and ingenious not regarding the received custom bestow liberal jeers upon whatever is not the product of their own brain and treading antiquity under foot are every day making new systems of surgery i know not with which party i shall be ranged but i have done my best to accommodat what the ancients have delivered to the opinion of the moderns and circulation of the blood imitating in this the bees that gather from every flower what is fit for making honey and if experience may have any sway my practice ought to obtain as being confirmd by it  these who extol the cures they have done have also reason to support their practice which because of the progress it has made passes even at this day for the best and most secure in many places this error has taken so deep root and gained so many followers that notwithstanding all my experiences i doubt not but many will stand out against my method reject my feeble reasoning and treat me as a violater of custom and received maxims and a rash and inconsiderate innovator for with them it is a general rule that a deep wound ought to be kept long open in order to a perfect cure yea the sick themselves being prepossessed in favor of this false opinion believe that the accidents which happen some months yea some years after they have been cured proceed from the too speedy closing up of the wound alleging the wolf was shut up in the sheepfold as for my self i am persuaded and am able to maintain it that almost all such accidents are caused by keeping the wound too long open whereby the parts being much weakened are hard to be restored to their first state so that the lest motion or excess renews the sore and brings back the symptoms  as for wounds of the head where the scull is laid bare exfoliation infallibly insues if they are long kept open if the cranium is broken the alteration and the accidents are yet more considerable and cause often a weakness a depravation of sense giddiness headache and other like distempers and sometimes a corruption of the membranes and of the brain  it is most certain that a wound cannot be kept long open but a great suppuration shall follow and then in spite of all precaution the matter that is every where diffused will glide along and rest upon the bone and the most subtle parts as galen says passing into the capacity of the scull by the fracture will fall upon the membranes from whence it cannot be got out but by the operation of the trepan and if neglected will bring on mortal symptoms  wounds of the thorax or breast may be closed up without danger as will be more largely made out by experience in some places of the second part of this work for those which continue to suppurate for a long time do infallibly bring on the tissick asthmas the cough shortness of breath and incurable fistulas  tents cannot be kept in wounds of the lower belly because of the perpetual motion of the guts and consequently such are secure from the pains and infirmities that follow upon their use  wounds of the reins of the emulgent veins and of the vreters if not speedily united leave behind them incurable fistulas with a running of urine at the wound the same falls out in those of the bladder  in these of the joints if tents be used the cure is very tedious difficult and dangerous for commonly there follows upon them an alteration of the tendons of the nerves and of all the part sometimes a shortening or lengthening of the member with loss of the nutricious juice and a weakness that endures for life  wounds of the extremities cause an entire dissolution of the nerves and often the loss of the members those of the bones rottenness those of the flesh moreover besides a great deal of time spent in vain occasion much pain vexation and charges  i have seen wounds of all these sorts some of them i have had dressed with tents where powerful digestives were used to procure great suppurations i have met with others that were followed by all such accidents but this i have ever observed that these which were handled according to my method were preserved from all these troublesome symptoms  it is known to every one that in wounds made by cutting instruments union is immediately to be endeavored in order to this design therefore we ought not to fill such wounds with lint as we have formerly said seeing this directly thwarts it it is also very hurtful to use digestives because disordering the contexture of its parts they corrupt the blood  the fall of the escar in gunshot wounds cannot be prevented whatever diligence be used wherefore suppuratives are here of no use seeing nature can do that work without their assistance which only weaken and destroy the temperament of the parts to which they are applied large suppurations therefore are not necessary in the curing of wounds  for in fine i cannot discover any reason why it should be judged requisite that a wound should suppurat a long time in order to be brought to a complete cure and surely before we abandon our selves to such a dangerous practice it is necessary first to understand what pus or matter is whence it comes and what is the necessity of it  we may observe then that matter is nothing else but the blood of ulcerated parts discharged into the wound from the orifices of arteries that are cut or torn and this is mixed with the nutricious juice brought to the parts for their sustenance whereby they are rendered lame as it were and useless if by the compression of tents or dilaters the blood be squeezed out of the vessels it may fill the capacity of the wound whereas otherwise it would have held on its ordinary course we are not then to be surpised if the blood and the nutricious juice are suddenly turned into matter seeing they are out of their natural place for even as a small rivulet may make a great lake if its waters are kept in with a dam just so the little pipes that are laid open in a  though but small in comparison with the  of its cavity being pressed as has been said by a tent which divides em more and hinders their reunion continually pour forth such liquors as they contain and the tent serving for a bank a lake is formed in the cavity of the wound we ought not therefore to wonder if plentiful suppurations continue so long as this method is followed and it is an undoubted error to account such evacuations profitable etmullerus in his medicinal surgery is of opinion that a wound would close up of it self if it was not hindered he says we ought to endeavor to prevent the marring and putrefying of the natural balsam of the wounded part and to use balsamicks according to the principles of helmont to hinder it from degenerating into a hurtful acid and to preserve it from corrupting  in fine he finds fault with the surgeons for using first suppuratives then digestives and after mundificatives sarcoticks and glutinatives as they term them that way adds he is too tedious delays the cure causes inflammation of the part alters the nutricious juice and often turns the wound into a sordid ulcer  it is apparent by this authority that one remedy skilfully managed is sufficient to answer all the intentions proposed in the cure of wounds that great suppurations are hurtful and that it is for the great advantage of the wounded to reject the bulky rubbish of improfitable druggs  as for such divisions in the body where many small vessess are quite cut asunder if the lips of the wound are brought together they will unite of themselves and this according to the opinion of many authors vouched also by experience providing nothing extraneous go between  now touching gunshot wounds that are so common in the hospitals of the army i am bold to affirm that my practice has given me more insight into their nature than all the authors that ever wrote on the subject but not to enter upon a debate concerning bullets it is evident that the effect they produce in the body do something resemble cauterizing yet though sometimes i use this word i can scarcely believe that they really cauterize but being round solid and compact bodies they cause contusion they tear and bruise whatever is in their way and occasion a heaviness in the wounded part  it is certain that the bullet very often stops the bleeding of the wound whether by the disorder it causes in the parts through which it passes or by cauterizing with its touch the arteries and veins but be it how it will the course of the blood is stopped and the passage between the arteries and veins is intercepted so far as the wound and contusion reach the heart according to the law of circulation squeezes the blood it has received into the aorta from whence passing into all the other arteries its course is stopped at the wound where it cannot as formerly be received by the veins and finding no free passage it extends the containing vessels and forcing its way diffuses it self according to its own quantity and the space it finds hence proceeds the hardness swelling and inflammation so ordinary in gunshot wounds if the blood be there corrupted or spoilt by some malignant acid the symptoms become yet more troublesome and obstinate and after the fall of the escar abscesses or large and grievous suppurations ensue  a simple convulsion only for like reasons is capable  produce the same accidents which being nothing but a disordering of the fibers and little pipes that changes the regularity and situation of the pores the circulation is rendered uneasy and the part choked up from hence comes the dullness and absence of the spirits which if not speedily recalled cannot but be attended with grievous consequences  i shall speak a word or two of the cure of a contusion in the last part of this book here i shall only show that tents are very destructive to gunshot wounds in regard they hinder the fall of the escar and coming away of whatever is bruised which ordinarily is consumed by suppuration a tent actually hinders the passing out of that matter and retains it in the wound where it causes all these mischiefs of which we have spoken it may also after the escar is removed renew the bleeding bruising by its rubs and bringing to suppuration the young flesh bred upon the orifices of the wounded vessels while the escar was a separating  the multitude of those that are to be seen maimed and with wooden legs and fistulas can witness to their sorrow the pernicious effects of tents yea how many are there who by the loss of their lives show their fatal consequences could they have spoken from the grave they would have said more than i can on this mournful subject and the destructive custom had soon been suppressed nevertheless the pains suffered by these unfortunate persons their complaints and cries have not yet been able to cause a method established and authorized by antiquity to be laid aside neither has the ill success of so many cures in vain attempted been hitherto capable to undeceive those who have practiced surgery  however i thought my self obliged to communicate to the public what i knew upon this subject that i might if possible procure for afflicted patients a gentle speedy and easy method for the comfort and encouragement of such as so generously expose their life for the glory of their prince and the good of their country  all my practice is levelled at these ends as may be seen by the sequel i abstain from using tents and dilaters as much as i can and as the case will bear i occasion little or no pain save at the first dressing and then i always widen the wound especially if it is a gunshot one and do my best to draw out the extraneous bodies now on this occasion i have three things further to recommend which are to dress gently speedily and seldom  there is a way of dressing wounds made with iron instruments usual among the soldiers called the secret dressing wherein they carefully suck the orifice of the wound in order to draw out the blood therein contained then they take samaritan balsam or oil and wine mixed without boiling and sometimes either of them alone which they squirt into the wound from their mouth and without any otheir dressings cover and bind it up muttering some words between their teeth to make the method appear mysterous which causes many people to think it magical  but these words are ineffectual and their virtue imaginary serving only to palliate and authorize the ignorance of such people who know not what they do and to deceive the imagination of the wounded these cures though accounted miraculous have nothing in them supernatural and may be performed without invoking the assistance of demons it is known to every one that blood when it is out of the vessels coagulates and corrupts in the wound if it make any stay there and that by sucking out the extravasated blood suppuration is prevented and also that is removed which might hinder the reunion  chap ix that it is necessary to dress wounds gently gentleness is one of these things that are indispensibly required in curing of wounds this circumstance is so necessary that without it other things have seldom the desired success yea so much am i possessed in favor of this opinion that when i see some that are rigorously handled i often admire how they ever come to be cured and indeed they never are without a great many accidents that fall out in the progress of the cure  it is ordinary for a wounded person to be seized with a fever which being symptomatick must be a consequence of the pain the inflammation that brings along with it such a numerous train of troublesome accidents is often occasioned by an irritation of the sensible parts want of sleep proceeds ordinarily from nothing else but the pain that is either over all the body or in one part only now if by dressing gently these three accidents are avoided we may quickly hope to see a perfect cure  tents dilaters and setons as has been already sufficiently observed are the principal cause of the pain that the poor wounded endure and the occasion of so many hurtful accidents their remaining in wounds being infallibly attended with most destructive consequences if then we lay them aside we may prevent the pain and what follows upon it and so having the command of whatever may give us trouble in dressing we may manage the cure as we please  finally we ought to endeavor with all care to remove so soon as possible what might cause pain and by evacuations and diversions wisely to withdraw what would foment it but if it has already assaulted we must apply what is most proper to ease and overcome it for in a word pain is a very formidable enemy in the progress of any disease whatever  chap x that it is necessary to dress wounds speedily in order to prevent the access of the air in this chapter i endeavor to show that the dressing of wounds ought to be performed speedily because experience has taught me that the air is a mighty hindrance of their cure and this is one of the chief reasons that obliged me to follow this method for though some pain in dressing is inevitable yet by this means it lasts for so short a time that the wounded scarce perceive it the air has not time enough to exert its influence upon the flesh destitute of its coverings and the nitrous parts with which it is thought to abound cannot pass to the bottom of the wound for i am of opinion it is the nitrous clammy and as some think arsenical qualities or particles of the air that destroy the due temperament of the parts when deprived of their natural cover and that consumes or at least alters the natural balsam or nutricious juice which is as the cement that unites the divided parts  all the ancients and the moderns also are in this agreed that the air is an enemy to wounds and experience attests that even the most pure and subtle is ever attended with a certain sharp and clammy acidity that sticks to iron and steel and makes them rust  it is the same air that also occasions so many disorders that alters and corrupts the bones hurts the nerves and destroys the tendons corrodes the flesh and utterly marrs the temper of the parts wasting the spirits that preserve the radical moisture which with a little help and often times almost without any unites broken bones by a callus fills up wounds with flesh cleanses ulcers and brings them to a scar  hippocrates sect   aphor  0 says that the cold is offensive to ulcerated parts that it hardens the skin causes pain and hardness occasions lividity shiverings fevers and convulsions  by the cold here is to be understood the air by means of which disorders are excited in us it is corrosive and therefore exasperates the sensible parts it hardens the skin thereby hindering the transpiration of the vapors which being retained cause pain hardness and fluxion and these produce shiverings and fevers and oftentimes are followed by lividity convulsion and a gangreen  the access of the cold air is indeed one of the causes of the pain which is so common in wounds remaining too long uncovered because it coagulates the humors and causes the blood in the small vessels to become more sharp and so to ferment and corrupt  a little experience is sufficient to make one agree to these reasons we ought to second the designs of nature that are ever aimed at the preservation of what is most precious such as the spirits now we may be assured that when a wound is left uncovered or often opened there is occasioned a considerable loss of these same spirits whereby the part is so weakened that being unable to make the right use of the nourishment sent for its maintenance it is all changed unto matter and excrements  that cold is hurtful to wounds no body doubts all are likewise agreed that the air is at all times colder than the inward parts of our body now if the touching of the air only rots the bones if it act with such force and violence on bodies so solid as they are it will undoubtedly be yet more destructive to the nerves and nervous parts that are so tender as also to the tendons to the flesh and to all parts in general to which it has access  the air moreover produces many other accidents in wounds for as has been said the spirits are dissipated by the long and frequent attacks of the air whereby its acid parts being at liberty and not entangled easily stick to the flesh and other uncovered parts which they corrode and tear with their points hence proceed pricking pains whose cause often many are at a loss to conjecture  that same acidity of the air coagulates the blood in the mouths of the arteries that open unto the wound hinders its course and makes it to swell up the vessels and very often also to discharge it self on the part hence are tumors fluxions hardness and if it ferment large abscesses for fermentation here is only the changing of blood unto matter now the blood having neither the same situation nor motion as formerly and its parts being disjoined easily corrupts and ferments in a little time unless we believe that the air cannot congeal the blood in the vessels which yet is beyond controversy  that the air is very piercing appears from chilblains and kibes in the heels where it has the force to congeal the blood in the veins and capillary arteries of the part afflicted if then it has such influence on parts clothed with the common teguments what will it have on such as want em in fine if it is able to coagulate the blood in the vessels where it may freely circulate much more may be feared from its acidity in wounds where the course of the blood being in a manner interrupted the wounded part receives but little aid from the natural heat and the spirits and the blood it self that precious balsam of nature being unmoved and not receiving fresh and vigorous supplies from the heart is corrupted as was said formerly and turned unto matter and indeed if we press the places about the wound we shall perceive a certain clammy matter to come out as from so many little pipes which often also is corrupt and stinking  now if nature which is every way admirable and always industrious in preserving dont in such a case exert her utmost efficacy the part must be mortified in spite of all the efforts of the inconsiderat surgeon and then if it is a member that may be cut off the next thing is to deliberate whether this ought or may be done without danger sometimes it is doubted whether the wounded person can bear up under the rigor of so painful an operation considering his ill temperament and disposition of body which only are accused as the cause of all these accidents for the wound of it self was inconsiderable and might have been soon cured in a person of a stronger and better constitution or otherwise the blame is laid upon some venereal venom vice of the parent disorder etc in fine the patient and his temperament are always found guilty and fall as victims to ignorance  i have been in many places my self where such things have happened and where neither the persons wounded nor the surgeons understood the true cause of the supervening accidents it is however very requisite in this to employ all our care chiefly in hospitals of the army where seldom are to be found all these conveniences that were to be wished for correcting the cold and the ill quality of the air which frequently is infected and corrupted it is in such places where we ought to hinder it with all our power to pass unto the inward parts of our body or to get access to those that are destitute of their coverings lest at the same time it impart to them its destructive impressions  it may possibly be objected to me that if that acid and nitrous quality of the air can produce such disorders in wounds we ought much more to be incommoded by the frequent and necessary use thereof in respiration but it is answered that the windpipe and lungs purify the air which is in a manner filtrated and prepared by them and so becomes friendly to nature that only uses the purest parts driving out by expiration together with the hot vapors or exhalations of the breast that which is useless and hurtful but it is not so in wounds that have no spring it is only the lungs that are fitted and appointed for receiving the air they alone perform the office of bellows to prepare purify or to expel it according to the necessity of our machine  besides it may be said that when the air enters unto places that are covered and furnished with membranes its acid parts slide upon them and take no hold but if there chance to be ulcers in the lungs the air will then cause considerable disorders and the cough which afflicts such kind of patients proceeds undoubtedly from nothing else but the irritation occasioned by the air in parts deprived of their covering  moreover it must not be denied that the air abounds with very subtle and piercing parts because it will pass through the skarfeskin the skin and other teguments there are many examples which show that persons have subsisted by means of the air passing through the pores of the skin when respiration was altother suppressed whether by suffocation or other such like accidents some have also been taken down from the gallows who were thought to have been a pretty while dead and yet with a little help have recovered whence it is easy to infer that nature had found the means to furnish the heart and lungs with a sufficient quantity of air to refresh them during that interval by the pores seeing it could not pass by the way of the windpipe a like consequence may be drawn from those that ly in a lethargy  we may therefore reasonably infer that if the air is so subtle as to pierce and pass through membranes so close and compact it ought much more to penetrate considerably beyond the extent and cavity of a wound where there is nothing to purify or subtilise it as there is when passing through the pores of the skin it supplies the place of respiration for since here the skarfskin keeps back the more gross earthy and clammy parts of the air we have reason to think that it ought not to produce any ill effects in the places to which it comes it were to be wished that wounds were covered with something at the times of dressing which might perform the office of the skarfskin and exclude the acid and viscous particles of the air together with other noxious effluvia with which it is filled for if these exhalations floating in the air are the original of so many diseases as some modern philosophers affirm why may not they occasion very dangerous symptoms when they take hold of and cleave to live and sensible parts now seeing these foreign particles are capable of alterations no less than the air it self we may be assured that the ill qualities which this has contracted in hospitals by the breath and transpiration of the sick are also communicated to those seeing such atoms have a substance and a certain form  these carbuncles that are so frequent in hospitals of the army are a sufficient proof of what i say they are occasioned as some think by the arsenical particles in the air which being taken in by respiration are thrown out by the strength of the natural heat upon some emunctory now seeing this falls out much oftener in hospitals than elsewhere we may infer that the air also is here much more replenished with these subtle and impure particles by reason of which the wounds here treated without very great care become sometimes cancerous always putrid and often fistulous and incurable  i have learned by my long frequenting of hospitals that these places where the sick have remained for some time retain long after they are gone the ill smell communicated by them this i believe is owing to the impure particles that stick to the walls whence these who design afterward to live in the place are obliged to plaster and whiten the walls that they may not be hurt by the pernicious effluvia proceeding from them  clothes and other goods brought from places where the plague is must be cleansd and purified from the pestilential particles that cleave to em without which precaution they might excite a general pestilence in the places to which they are brought it is this which inclines me to think that the nitrous and viscous quality of the air resides in those particles or atoms which if they are capable to stick to a body so smooth and polished as a wall and that for a long time without losing either their bad smell or ill qualities much more will they do so to a wound uncovered which is always moist and where they may get easier hold and act more readily because of the tenderness and weakness of the parts  the dead flesh of any creature if it is often handled and exposed to the air suddenly putrifies and a fatus a member etc if it be kept in a close vessel covered with spirit of wine may be preserved for ever whereas on the contrary a little air will dissolve it and reduce it to nothing  that the air is a mighty enemy to wounds is a truth owned by the modern practisers of surgery no less than by the ancients but there are few take sufficient care to hinder its access to the wounded parts knowledge is in vain when not put in practice nevertheless this is a thing so absolutely necessary in the cure of any wound whatsoever that without it nothing that a surgeons art can perform is to any purpose but all is hurtful and destructive  from what has been said consequences may be deduced very useful in practice all the regard i have for antiquity was not prevalent enough to keep me from the declaiming against an abuse though established by custom seeing truth depends on the things themselves and not on the opinion the ancients had of them i know many have already expressed themselves on this subject much after the same manner as i have done celsus who ought not to be reckoned among the moderns has written something that looks this way in his book of wounds of the skull chap   he says that flesh breeds easily enough in any part of the head except a little above the space between the eyebrows where often there remains an incurable ulcer because in that place there is a cavity of the bone full of air bordering upon the os cribrosum which air hinders the filling up of the ulcer  by all this then it evidently appears that the air is a powerful impediment to the cure of wounds and that the speedy method of dressing ought to be preferred to that which is yet in use in many places and to conclude it is certain that the pain caused by the use of a tent its remaining in the wound the length of the time taken up in dressing and the frequency thereof of which last i shall speak in the following chapter are the genuin sources of all the accidents that follow on wounds wherefore we must dress speedily and according to our method if we would prevent many dangerous inconveniences  chap xi that wounds ought to be dressed seldom galen in his fourth book of the composition of medicines chap   orders to dress ulcers but once in three days this method he acknowledges to have come from asclepiades and i cannot but wonder that such a practice has found so few followers being so necessary and advantageous for the patient  if ulcers require not to be dressed every day as this author thinks fresh wounds do yet much less call for it nevertheless it is the custom in almost all hospitals to dress regularly twice a day and i believe there is scarce one to be found that does otherwise excepting that of brianson where they dress the wounded some only once a day and others but once in two three or four days if i had found this method hurtful i would not have been so wicked as to continue to use it much less to desire that others also might do the same  pareus book    chap    treating of ulcers seems to be much inclined to the opinion of galen when he disapproves often dressing and yet in his eleventh book chap   speaking of gunshot wounds he orders to dress them twice a day and often once in every eight hours  it is surprising that so famous an author as pareus who believed the air extremely prejudicial to wounds adducing also many passages from the ancients to support that opinion should have left behind him rules altogether repugnant to it but it is probable he was so busied in compiling so great a work that he had not time enough to make the necessary reflections upon this subject which requires a very diligent application and this may be the reason why in many places he contradicts himself  fabricius ab aquapendente page   book   chap   discoursing of the way to preserve the substance of the parts in simple wounds affirms again and again that it is enough to take off the dressings once in three or four days which he confirms by the authority of galen where he treats of the cure of putrid ulcers  it is certain that the seldomer a wound is dressed the less it matters providing it be not stuffed with lint or some such thing the remedy also has the more time to communicate its virtue to the part which seems in some sort to be nourished thereby and the nutricious juice has more liberty and time to restore the lost substance and reunite the divided parts on the other hand if it is often dressed the strength of the remedy being destroyed and its virtue diminished it becomes so weak that it has no effect and its moisture running away like the sap of a tree when it is pierced is mixed with and turned into matter  what nature does in uniting broken bones may instruct us what we ought to do in curing of wounds we see that a callus is bred without the assistance of any thing by the wise contrivance of nature only if so be that she is not by frequent dressing or indiscreet motions of the part diverted from her work  when the little fibrous threads begin to be formed in a wound in order to unite the parts that are divided and the nutricious juice is communicated to the part to restore it to its natural state if then the part is often disturbed with frequent dressing if the wound is searched with the fingers or with a probe or a dry tent etc what nature has done will be bruised and separated and her work destroyed as soon as begun so that if this method is continued the nutricious juice becomes thick and hard and cleaves to the sides of the wound where it forms a callosity and often a fistula  generation then which is the principal work of nature cannot be accomplished without rest so true it is that repose is necessary to her in all her operations hence it is that i cannot apprehend by what reasons they are influenced who by frequent and painful dressing without any necessity exasperate the wounds and i protest i could never my self endure so cruel a method sometimes they search them with their fingers sometimes with an instrument and not contented with this if they fancy they have found any thing desire their friends present and their boys to do the same and in this miserable condition is the wretched patient detained sometimes an hour and that most frequently twice a day i dare not adventure to name the places in france italy and germany where i have seen the wounded used on this fashion and that by such as held very considerable posts where a good method was extremely necessary  finally after much time has been spent in taking into the wound they think they are bound in credit for the satisfaction of the wounded and the bystanders to draw out something and show it publicly lest they seem to have labored in vain now if it should chance that at length any little piece of a corrupted membrane is found which would not be strange in a wound dressed in this manner where corruption often causes great disorder it is drawn out with abundance of ceremony and the operater fails not to declare with great confidence that this is it which occasioned the restlessness and pain of the preceding night and now you must think the wounded person is half cured  heavens what abuse is it possible that any man can be so much imposed upon i would gladly understand what it is that did separate this shred of a membrane or these fibers etc it will be answered without doubt that it is nature which endeavoring a reunion rejects that which opposes it i demand again how it was brought to this place by the same nature will one say and why then will not she go on to drive that extraneous thing quite out of the body seeing she has done so much she is able to drive out bullets though fastened in a bone as i shall show in the second part to expel splinters yea to bring them to the orifice of the wound and that a considerable time after it has been closed up why should we then apprehend that she will leave such things within from which she may so easily free her self either by the orifice of the wound or by some other more convenient way for it is certain that nature left to her liberty takes ever the easiest way besides all the parts of the body have an elasticity or spring whereby any foreign thing is naturally driven from the center to the circumference  antony benevent a physician of florence relates that a certain woman swallowed a very large needle which two years after came away by her navel and tarentus a physician also reports that a maid who had swallowed a needle nigh about four inches in length voided it ten months after by the vrinary passage  from hence it appears that the industry and sagacity of nature surpasses that of all the esculapian family she knows what she does and wants not to be instructed in the ways she ought to take in order to drive out of the body whatever oppresses or is foreign and noxious unto her the surgeon ought only to employ his utmost care to understand and follow her he must study her designs and take all heed not to divert her from her enterprises seeing she does nothing in vain  after what i have said concerning nature i would not have any to think that i am one of those who regard her as a divinity and ascribe unto her a reason whereby she diposes all her wonderful works reason i look upon as a peculiar privilege of the human soul neither am i of the opinion of empedocles that whatever she does is mysterious it is him that aristotle in his third book of metaphysics ridicules for giving no other reason for many things that were asked him but this that it was natures pleasure all i will say is that if her operations are mavelous they are owing to her powerful author who has entrusted her with whatever we have that is most precious  but to return to my subject it is fit i should advertise my reader that i would not have any to follow my method of seldom dressing unless first he has entirely laid aside the use of tents and dilaters which by retaining the matter would cause a fermentation whereby these same tents and dossels would also be corrupted this is what fell out not long ago in a cure to which i was called the dilaters that had been used were carried along with the matter that was discharged between the muscles and there putrefying the corruption was quickly communicated to the neighboring parts whence it appears that this method has in it singularities and insparable circumstances that must not be omitted  m verdue in his pathology tom   fol     advises not to do as some surgeons who every minite are opening the wounds of those who are under their care for says he by too often taking off the dressings we hinder their reuniting and give occasion to the air to insinuate it self into the wound and to coagulate the nutricious juice this indeed is a most just and reasonable thought i remember when i was at rome in the year      i chanced to see a little book written in italian by the chief surgeon of the hospital of the h ghost whose name i have forgotten he therein discoursed of wounds of the head only and proved by very good reasons that they ought to be dressed only once in three or four days and sometimes not so often moreover in dressing he did not altogether lay open the wound but kept always upon it some thin cover as is done at this day in many places in dressing of burnings  in fine he took such great care to hinder the air from passing into and offending the wounds which he dressed that we may be assured he judged it a grand impediment to their cure which was also his opinion of frequent dressing in the same book he adducd many examples among which were several accounts of very considerable cures accomplished by this method  it were much to be desired that every one without regarding the public censure they might incur had the same charity to reveal the knowledge they have attained by their care and experience for it is very probable that by the universality of mankind almost an universality of knowledge is possessed one has a genius for one thing and the other has a genius for another and each their different endowments and in civil life and particularly in an art so necessary for the preservation of mankind every one ought to communicate without reservation  after all there is no rule without some exception and i freely own that their are certain cases wherein tents ought sometimes to be used as in some wounds of the breast and in an empyema when we would hinder the total evacuation of the blood or matter to preserve the strength of the patient and finally on some other occasions where they may be judged absolutely necessary  there are other wounds to which dilaters are necessarily required as when the bones being rotten or altered we wait for their exfoliation or when they must be kept open in order to some further operation to be performed upon them  there are also other wounds to which of necessity we must occasion some pain whither by drawing forth extraneous bodies or by setting broken bones or by dilating their orifice  others there are that will take up some time in dressing as in these of the head where we often suspect there may be a fracture of the scull also when the scull is broken when some operation is to be performed upon the bones in complicated fractures and when extraneous bodies are to be drawn out in such cases we cannot dress so quickly as were to be wished  to conclude there are some that must be often looked to when notwithstanding our care the suppuration is great as in abscesses that are cavernous and deep in very hot seasons and in patients of an ill disposition of body who abound in excrementitious moisture or when phlegmons erysipelas lividity and gangrenes or any other unexpected accident follow upon a wound for it is the part of a prudent and skilful surgeon to accommodate himself to emergent occasions and to correct the symptoms as they fall out  chap xii a discourse upon discovered bones with the way to prevent exfoliation it is almost an universal custom at least i have seen it put in practice wherever i have been so soon as a bone is uncovered to widen the wound by tents and dilaters and wait for its exfoliation this is so superstitiously observed in many of the kings hospitals that it would be judged a very heinous offense to do otherwise yea or to neglect what has been delivered by the ancients as if we were eternally obliged blindly to follow their dictates  experience has taught me on many occasions that nothing more is required to prevent the spoiling of a bone when only uncovered but to defend it from the access of the air for this intent we ought to endeavor to close up the wound with all possible speed by means of proper bandage and balsamic remedies without dilating it by tents and dossels thus the bone will soon be covered and the exfoliation thereof is avoided which would infallibly follow if time had been given to the air to exert its pernicious efficacy upon it  many authors have enjoined stiching in such a case hippocrates and several others after him have approved thereof in wounds of the head which notwithstanding may be united without it unless they are large and tranverse and of the lower parts where stiching oftentimes becomes necessary by reason of the figure of the scull  if any considerable portion of the bone is bared with loss of the covering substance the wound being large will take up a long time before it is closed up in this case all our care will not be able to hinder the alteration and rotting of the bone either by the air admitted in the numerous dressings or by the matter running along or staying upon the bone to prevent therefore this inconvenience we must in the first dressing pierce the bone as nimbly as possible in many places with the pyramid or pike of the trepan by this means a way is opened to a marrowy juice which thickning upon it covers over the bone in a little time without suffering it to lose any of its substance  it is well known to surgeons that any considerable portion of the scull laid bare by a wound can never again be covered with flesh without the assistance of art because of the smoothness and glibness of its surface upon this consideration it was that many of the ancients thought fit to rasp it that it might become rough and unequal and also to make way for the orifices of the little vessels with which its inward substance abounds to supply it with blood necessary to breed a new flesh wherewith it may be covered  but the operation which i have made upon it on many occasions and which i here propose appears to me to be more speedy safe and profitable than rasping wherein the instrument passing to and fro many times on the whole surface of the discovered bone heats it and alters it much more than the pin of the trepan which only slightly touches it at certain distancces and yet pierces so far as to approach the middle pith from which we must fetch the required assistance moreover the rasp lessens much the thickness of the bone whereby those that have undergone that operation are subject to pains in the head add to this that it also leaves after it an unseemly scar  this operation may be used when the first yea or both tables of the scull are broken providing no inequality be left on the inward surface thereof that may occasion accidents which will appear in a small time for if we delay to procure a covering to the bone the most subtle part of the matter may slide into the fracture and there cause some alteration or inflammation for according to galen and celsus the bone is liable to this inconvenience and also yet more troublesome accidents now seeing the first operation of this nature which i performed was on the scull i shall begin to justify this practice by showing how it is nourisht  the scull according to the opinion of many has its nourishment from three different sources first by vessels proceeding from those of the dura matter and passing into the cranium through its internal surface or that which is nearest the brain secondly from the diploe or middle pith a medullary juice is imparted to both tables whereby they are nourisht and sustained and thirdly by its external part it receives nourishment from the pericranium wherewith it is every where covered and defended  when therefore by some external violence the bone is deprived of that membrane and remains uncovered it is certain that the air by its acid and nitrous points takes hold on its outward surface and in a little time alters and rots it and then it must needs exfoliate because it is bereft both of its nourishment and defense  it becomes necessary then to make an amends and to draw nourishment from the neighboring parts instead of that which is lost that at the same time by covering it anew may shelter it from external injuries now this we can have from no nearer place than the diploe but in order to that we must give it an easy passage and open to it a way to fulfill at once the intention of nature and that of the surgeon this is accomplished by piercing the bone as we have said whereby the diploe sends forth at these little holes the most subtle part of the marrowy juice which congealing upon the bone in three four or five days sometimes sooner sometimes later entirely covers it  other bones that have marrow are nourished from within by the vessels of the membrane which cover that substance and from without by the penostrum or membrane wherewith they are invested for this reason we may perform this operation when there is occasion on the bones of the shoulder thigh and leg and these who doubt of this may be convinced by a trial  that which ought to recommend this method and procure it an easy reception is that thereby the cure is accomplished in twelve or fifteen days or so whereas otherwise it will take up near sixty for about forty days are required to the exfoliation of the bone and twenty more to fill up and cicatrize the ulcer our way is so exceedingly advantageous to the wounded that it ought not to be rejected nor can it without offending against that charity we owe our afflicted neighbor who by the delay in such cases is extremely endangered especially in an hospital where the corrupt and infected air ruins in time the strongest constitutions i have often seen and it is but too ordinary that the wounded persons being cured and just ready to depart from the hospital have been suddenly seized by malignant fevers looseness bloody flux etc occasioned by their tedious stay in such dismal place and death often has been the first thing that delivered them from all their miseries therefore we ought to endeavor a speedy cure and to spare no pains to prevent that tedious exfoliation but if the wounded are sent to us with the bone altered or if we cannot avoid this accident with all our care we must endeavor to help on the separation with all speed for as a gangreen in fleshy parts wants the assistance of art to put a stop to it so also does rottenness which is a gangreen of the bone wherefore exfoliation must be hastened by external remedies that it may go no further for sometimes it extends from one end of the bone to the other  it is the surgeons province to pick out such remedies as are proper for this intention the ancients and moderns have left us good store of this kind but above all we must avoid the use of acid spirits which increase the rottenness and have the same effrct on a bone as aqua fortis on iron the actual cautery is a great help on these occasions as also euphorbium infused in spirit of wine  the rules i have proposed to prevent exfoliation are inconsistent with the opinion of many italian surgeons who maintain that the bone so far as has been touched by the air will infallibly exfoliate i have heretofore had great debates on this subject with some people who through a stiffness of opinion without any ground would neither yield to reason nor experience not being able to bear what was contrary to their own principles and practice  chap xiii how to dress with a new instrument after trepanning or accidents of that nature wounds of the head accompanied with a fracture of the skull are such as require an expert surgeon i am convinced and i suppose none will deny it that the air is hurtful to them in this both ancients and moderns are agreed  it is certain notwithstanding that a great part of the accidents that follow upon them proceeds only from the little care that is taken to hinder the access of the air into the wounds whether the scull be only bared or broken or also trepanned i have discoursed of discovered bones in the foregoing chapter i have only two or three words more to speak of such wounds where the scull has lost some of its substance  when the dura matter is uncovered i prepare a plate of lead very thin and very smooth pierced with holes in several places without any inequality cut and fitted to the bigness of the opening and to make it more exact i sketch it out with the crown of the trepan that i have used or am to use in this operation or its measure may be taken from the piece of the scull cut out by the trepan on each side of this plate is left a little ear somewhat longer than the thickness of the scull these little ears i bend both one way so as they may be perpendicular to the plate and so much of them as exceeds the thickness of the scull i bend outward again that thereby they may rest upon the scull and by which as by two little handles i may lift them up with pincers if need be at each dressing these two little handles may be cut something broader than the two pieces that join them to the plate which must be of an equal breadth when i use it i dip it in some proper medicine pretty warm and apply upon it a very soft pledget of fine lint  i have found very much good by this method and have observed a fivefold advantage in the use of this plate first the matter or blood contained within the scull passes out at the holes of the plate and is imbibed by the soft lint that i put over it and if it has acquired any mischievous quality by staying there which often falls out the lint by which it is soaked up detains it from touching the dura matter and imparting the contagion thereto and consequently there is less hazard of its alteration  in the second place this plate by lightly pressing upon the dura matter facilitates the coming out of the matter or blood extravasated under the scull  thirdly it hinders the breeding of a fungus and the bunching out of the dura matter beyond the scull which otherwise often comes to pass obliging us either to cut off or to consume with cathecreticks that which so stands out whereupon very grievous accidents sometimes ensue  a fourth advantage is that it hinders by its slight pressure the dura matter in its continual motion to strike against the inequalities and pointed parts of the scull that remain after a piece has been raised by the operation of the trepan or entirely separated by some external violence  and finally it protects the brain and its membranes from the assaults of the air performing in some sort the part of that piece of the scull that was taken away  when we are assured that there is or are in doubt that there may be some coagulated blood under the scull we may for some time omit the use of the plate that we may leave it a free passage and afterward we may use it until the danger of the accidents is over and then we must use it no longer otherwise it may prove an hinderance to the reunion and the generation of the callus  when the operation of the trepan is performed on the basis of the scull as is usual now to be done without scruple the bunching out of the dura matter is more to be feared and of consequence this plate is absolutely necessary to support it and keep it in but for the operation on this place as well as for that on others we must endeavor as far as the case will bear to choose the highest part that the plate may have the less weight to sustain we may safely use it for fourteen or fifteen days if we judge it needful and it may be made of gold silver etc according to the desire and ability of the patient but for my self i always use a leaden one for every body knows that this metal is freindly to nature and is vulnerary and drying  though there were no other advantage to be reaped from the use of this plate but only that it defends the brain and its membranes from the insults of the air this were enough to recommend it to our esteem it is certain that the air acts not with that force when its acid parts find a hindrance in their way or when they must pass through such little holes as these of this instrument and sometimes i dont lift it up but in two or three days when it matters freely and the accidents abate  m verdue affirms that the fungus that breeds on the dura matter is caused by the attacks of the air in a word all the ancients and moderns are of one mind in this that the air is exceeding destructive to the membranes and to the brain  it is not then without cause that nature as a good and provident mother has taken care to encompass the brain with two membranes the scull the pericranium the teguments and the hairs on every side to cover it from the impresions of the air which of all the elements is most hurtful to it and the most part of those that have been trepaned or by a fracture of the scull have lost some part of its substance without having the brain or its membranes hurt are subject to a number of very troublesome acccidents  the reason of this may be easily conceived for the air at certain seasons and in certain constitutions thereof being endowed with more piercing and subtle parts or the skin being more relaxed finds nothing sufficient to stop its course and passes notwithstanding the callus which is never so solid as a bone to the membranes which are extremely sensible of cold and there occasions these pains that such kind of people are subject to  that the description of the plate may be the better understood we have here subjoyned its figure  the figure of a plate with nine holes to be used when the crown of the trepan is large   a little plate with five holes   the figure of a plate ready for use with the little ears bent   the hospitalsurgeon or a new gentle and easy way to cure speedily all sorts of wounds part ii further evincing the excellency of this way by a faithful and particular account of wounds of all kinds and in all parts of the body thereby brought to a quick and happy cure together with useful and practical reflections  chap i the reasons of writing this second part with a general proposal of what it contains though sound reason supported by authority may appear to be a proof of the goodness of any thing convincing enough and capable to sustain the weight of what consequences might thence be deduced yet does there oftentimes still remain an uneasiness and hesitation in the mind no otherwise to be removed but by ocular demonstration as it were and experience for nothing so infallibly shows the possibility of things as their having already come to pass nor can any thing so well assure us what will follow upon them as a multitude of trials it is this consideration that induced me in this second part to give a history of some wounds handled according to my method that justify my manner of practice  had i thought it requisite i could have filled a great volume with cures that i have done these ten or twelve years which were all brought to a happy conclusion and completed in a very small time but to avoid tediousness i resolved to set down as few as possible yet in spite of my design to relate only one of each sort and each part i found my self necessitated to exhibit many of which though some at first may appear altogether alike yet if they be more narrowly scanned they will be found to differ in some very material circumstances  as for the order observed in these relations i have followed that of the dignity of the parts beginning at the head and ending with the extremities not minding the series of time wherein they happened i have described all things just as they were without either adding or diminishing having no other design but to make the easyness and expedition of this method appear by the examples i here relate  chap ii of the head observation i after the war broke out in savoy there was brought to the kings hospital at luserne where i was then surgeon major in july    0 a soldier called la grandeur of the regiment of poudenx which is now that of gatinois he had received a wound on the right side of his head with a pretty large bullet which grazing upon the most unequal part of the bone of the sinciput had only carried away the common teguments not hurting the scull but the membrane that immediately invests it was so bruised that it appeared livid i know if time had been given it would have come to suppuration whereupon the alteration and exfoliation of the bone must needs have ensued to prevent which i teard off with my nails the pericranium so far as it was bruised being something more than the bigness of a silver shilling and forthwith i struck the uncovered bone in several places as nimbly as i could with the pyramid of the trepan and then covered it with some lint wet with spirit of wine the rest of the dressing was charged with a simple digestive upon which i put emplastrum de botemea and above all the cap  after two days i took off the dressings and found the bone covered with a lively red from whence i conjectured that it would soon be clothed with flesh two days after this it was dressed in like manner as before and then the bone was half covered over for which cause i let it alone for three days more so that in seven days time the bone was altogether hid with new flesh which was instead of a membrane to it and now nothing more was required but by dressing it every other day to attend the fall of the escar finally in the space of eighteen days the wound was filled up and completely cured  reflection if this wound had been managed after the ordinary method i leave it to consideration whither the cure would have been so speedily accomplished from that time forward i ever kept to this method which i have used in many occasions and never found that the wounds opened again yea or that exfoliation or any other evil accident ensued  this and the following example i judged sufficient to establish our way of dressing and indeed seeing it has been attended with success in such cases we ought to remain assured that it will prove no less effectual in incised wounds and others also where the bone is laid bare whither by that which inflicts them or by the suppuration of the pericranium but we must observe if the pericranium is bruised or discolored as in the preceding case and suppuration appear unavoidable that the securest way is to tear it off and speedily to uncover the bone that the foresaid operation may take place whereby the corruption of the bone will be prevented which might be occasioned by the lodging of the corrupt matter thereupon and then the operation would be too late  chap iii of the head observation ii a certain soldier named chasteaumontague of alignys company in villars his regiment together with a companion of his in the same company was during the campaign in the year      brought to the hospital established for the kings army at brianson  the first had received a cut on the middle of the os sincipitis of the left side whereby the bone was uncovered to the bigness of a silver crown piece at the second dressing i made eight or ten little holes with the piercer upon the discovered bone not reaching so deep as the middle pith or diploe that i might make trial if i could accomplish my design without piercing through the first table i applied upon the bone so far as it was laid bare lint dipped in spirit of wine dressing the rest of the wourd with the simple digestive emplastrum de betonica and the kerchief  i waited two days before i dressed it again and then found that my operation had not been without effect the bone was become reddish and the holes made by the piercer to which this effect was owing began as it were to sprout forth which made me conclude that nature would accomplish the work she had already begun for the first eight days he was dressed but four times after which the bone was wholly covered and in eight or ten days more wherein he was dressed but every third day the wound was filled up and a good and firm cicatrix formed he came into the hospital on the   th of may and upon the   th of june he went out perfectly cured all that were therein being witnesses of the operation and the speediness of the cure  his companion had several cuts over all his head which he had received in the same occasion but especially a deep one upon the upper and middle part of the foreheadbone finding that in none of them the scull was fracturd i judged it sufficient to join together their lips only in the last during the first days i left two small threads of lint dipped in spirit of wine with the ends hanging a little out of the wound four days after i caused to be removed whatever might hinder the reuniting thereof dressing only once in three days because no accident appeared  the suppuration in this last wound was but very inconsiderable and no bones came away neither was there any exfoliation so this man also was cured and returned unto the regiment with his companion  reflection had i only recounted one cure of this nature done in a place at a great distance from paris the truth thereof might readily enough have been called in question but these with many others of the like kind having been publicly performed in an hospital to which every one had free aceess and as it were in view of the world ought not only to remove all scruple as to the truth of the matter of fact but also to establish the reputation of a method attended with expedition and security the excellency and usefulness of the little operation performed upon the uncovered scull off the first man may be easily made apparent to every one being founded on reason and experience m jouve a very expert physician belonging to this hospital was an eyewitness of the happy success of these last cures he having been present from the beginning to the end  i should but weary my reader and my self also if i should go about to reckon up the number of those who in three years time with a surprising quicknss have in this hospital been cured of wounds of the head as well such wherein the scull was cut more or less as those wherein it had lost of its substance  i am not the only person who has conquered scruples commonly enough entertained about wounds of the head ambrosius paraeus reports that he cured in a small time a certain person that with an edged instrument had a large piece of the foreheadbone entirely separated and hanging over upon the face by the skin only which yet was easily enough reunited  in the scull as in other bones of the body when a piece is separated whether by a cut or fracture so as yet to adhere to the encompassing membrane it is sufficient artfully to restore it to its natural place in such a manner that it may have the same situation and disposition as formerly that so the pores may answer and the nutricious juice necessary to form the reuniting callus may be freely admitted which could not be done without extreme difficulty if it were placed either to high too low or aside in which cases the natural order and situation of the part being altered it is impossible it can sit so close to the bone from whence it was divided but that many little distances must interveen that are liable to be filled with lympha blood or matter or all three together which alter the wounded part corrupt its aliment and bring that membrane to suppuration by which only the divided part was tied so that nature must now of necessity throw it off as an extraneous body  from hence we may readily conclude that it is not at all necessary to permit wounds of this kind to come to suppuration or to keep them open in expectation of the coming away of bones which without danger may be avoided  this our method is also confirmed by the authority of rhasis and serapion authors celebrated by antiquity who treating of wounds of the head accompanied with a fracture of the scull tell us that it was their custom to stitch them even when the fracture passed through both tables m verdue also in his first volume chap    of wounds in the head makes mention of a fracture of one of the ossa sincipitis that reached from the sagittal to the lambdoidal suture which was cured without the assistance of operation  the diploe or middle pith plentifully supplies the scull with nutricious juice from whence it is that when broken it is more easily united than any of the other bones though yet its callus is less firm and providing the brain with its membranes are safe we need not fear any danger from the fractures of the surrounding bone but though this may sometimes fall out yet is it scarce to be expected but that the violence that occasions a fracture in the scull should by the sudden jolt or concussion produce some disorder in such a soft glandulous body as is the brain great carefulness therefore and attention is here required for a rupture of the vessels or a dilatation of their mouths that are frequent enough in such cases and cause effusion of blood dont appear at first as i have oftentimes observed but so soon as the accidents begin to show themselves operation must not be neglected  it will possibly be objected to what i have said concerning carefully placing the broken piece of bone in the same situation it had formerly that the bones of other parts of the body may be reunited by means of a callus even when so ill placed that there is a necessity of breaking them anew in order to restore them to their natural figure but the answer is easy for there is a difference between the former case wherein a piece or splinter of bone is separated from the whole and this where the nutricious juice that comes from the one as well as the other part meets diffuses it self and coagulates about the fracture and so forms that which we term a callus but in the other case the alimentary liquor proceeds and is communicated from one of the parts only and if it find no pores rightly disposed to receive it there being nothing to which it can join it self it is altered and corrupted and the loosened piece shares with it in the same fate  as for the operation of trepanning which i have often performed seeing nothing extraordinary has therein occurred i will pass it over in silence  chap iv of the head observation iii about the conclusion of the year      a little time before the war of savoy the vaudois cut off almost all the inhabitants of pramol which depends on the valley of st martin i was at that time surgeon major to the hospital of the army of his royal highness the duke of savoy thither were brought a great number of men women maids and children in a most deplorable condition and among others a young girl about nine or ten years of age who besides others in the body and arms had received eighteen or nineteen blows on the head with a cutlass each whereof had pierced the scull some even to the dura matter some pieces of the first table were carried away and some of both tables entirely separated  i caused in the first place such parts to be shaved as would bear it and afterward i gently rubbed the whole head with a liniment made of vnguentum de betonica the yelk of an egg and spirit of wine mixed together in this mixture also i dipped large pledgets with which i covered all the head without either tents or dilaters above these i put emplastrum de betonica and over all the ordinary cap  what her age and strength would allow was done for diverting the humors and the first dressings were left untouched for two days which method was continued for fifteen days when we took off the plaster almost at every dressing we found pieces of bone sticking to the pledgets what was altogether separated came away with eease and in fine such bones as yet adhered to the pericranium were reunited and what was wanting in the cranium was speedily supplied when i perceived the suppuration to diminish i dressed but once in three days this course i found so successful that in the space of about five weeks the cure was perfectly accomplished this poor wounded girl was known to almost all pignerol being very remarkable by the loss of one of her ears which she had sustained in this afflicting occasion  reflection this cure is altogether to be ascribed to nature as being entirely her work and had not great circumspection been used in prohibiting the access of the air in this case where the very membranes of the brain in several places were discovered it could not have had so speedy easy and successful an upshot especially had it been managed in the ordinary way for besides that the cure would have been unsufferably tedious a thousand dangerous accidents might have arrived chiefly in an hospital where longwinded cures are seldom attended with success in fine notwithstanding the novelty that may be charged upon this method it is supported by the authority of hippocrates who b   aph    affirms that the air is an enemy to the brain the bones the nerves and to our nature in general galen in his book de usu partium chapter   says that the air is prejudicial to ulcers by which word he understands all sores and adds that in trepanning we ought to take special care not to cool the brain as well during the operation as when it is over  the access of the air is not only hurtful to the wounds of the scull and brain but also to those of the other parts of the body in which the accidents are neither so sudden nor so violent yet ought they to be regarded with all necessary care for if you ever so little neglect the conservation of the natural heat and spirits the wounded member must needs fail and frequently the owner also shares in the same destiny  chap v of the face observation iv in the year      i being in the same post and at the place before mentioned when the vaudois were driven from the valleys of luserne a certain officer whose name civility obliges me to conceal was wounded with a broken sword in the left cheek toward the corner of the nether jaw about an inch below the ear and the ductus salivales were torn  he was at first dressed by a surgeon who according to his usual manner dilated the wound by thrusting into it as much lint as it could contain a considerable time passed without any appearance of a cure and by little and little it became fistulous i was called by the wounded person to give him my advice and assistance and forthwith i consumed the callosity by touching it nimbly with tents dipped in dissolved causticks i caused him to be fed with jellybroth to be taken with a quill that there might be no occasion to move the lower jaw ordering him also to keep himself very quiet without either speaking or moving and when all the callosity was taken off i applied to the wound the balsam of peru and pressing together the lips with long slender boisters i covered it with the styptick plaster of crollius thus he was cured not without difficulty though at first it might have been done with great ease  chap vi of the face observation v being in pignerol in the year      the chevalier vauban a captain in the regiment of beaujolois sent for me to see his brother who was run with a sword into the cheek the wound had been dressed by a surgeon who at first thrust into it a tent both thick and long which passed into his mouth and continuing the same method for six or seven days the patient was thereby thrown into a violent fever and his head and face were exceedingly swelled by reason of the great flux of humors  after we had laid aside the tent we found it necessary to have recourse to such means as might divert the humors but the accidents which so great an irritation of the parts had occasioned could not be easily removed nevertheless they were at length conquered though not without difficulty and by means of sarcoticks we completed the cure but an ugly scar remained behind occasioned by the inconsiderate use of the tent  reflection the face being the image of god and as it were an abridgment of all the beauties of nature which as a little world representing in miniature what is more voluminously displayed in the great bulk of the vastlyextended universe ought doubtless to enjoy some privilege over the other parts of the body hence it is that all the authors both ancient and modern though for the most part they have allowed the use of tents in all other wounds yet have they unanimously condemned it in those of this part which nevertheless have been cured with wonderful facility and by the use of the very weakest of sarcoticks  fabritius ab aquapendente in wounds of the face recommends the use of the dry stitch to avoid the deformity of a scar and indeed seeing we are to preserve the beauty of the countenance as much as possible they are to be accounted very unskilful surgeons and but ill instructed in what belongs to their business who employ tents in such occasions the saliva seems to be that balsam which is peculiar to the face assigned thereto by nature that has also granted to all the other parts one proper to them  chap vii of the tongue observation vi in the year      a lieutenant of the militia of mondevis having his mouth open as he gave orders to his soldiers in an encounter received a bullet that broke and tore all his tongue into five or six pieces which were not altogether separated but stuck together on the upper part he was carried to the hospital of luserne and forthwith there dressed by m de la ramee master surgeon at turin and skilled in his employ but finding that with all his care he was not able to stop the flux of blood which was considerable he desired my advice in this affair  having searched his mouth in order to discover from whence the blood came i found the bullet lodged under one of the corners of the lower jaw bone having only fretted the skin of that part and finding no other place from whence the blood could come but these veins under the tongue called ranulares i proposed to heat red hot three of these small cauterising irons which are used for the teeth and to apply them to the ranulares which being accordingly done the bleeding was stopped and the wounded person speedily cured  reflection the ancients have ordered to stitch the wounds of the tongue unless the pieces be altogether separated in which case the operation is to no purpose and the reunion impossible fabricius ab aquapendente is of the same opinion but as for my self i can see no manner of necessity for such stitching seeing nature alone when left in repose to her self does excellently accomplish the uniting of the divided parts without it every body knows that the tongue is situated in the mouth under the arched palate and made up of innumerable little nipplelike bodies encompassed on all sides by the teeth and supported in such a manner that its parts are kept together and cannot fall asunder the spittle is its balsam and oftentimes the only remedy necessary to cure its wounds this is what i have observed in the preceding cure for this gentlemans tongue was after some small time altogether so well that scarce any signs of the division of its substance could be discerned but whereas it had been torn by the bullet and scorcht with the cautery it must of necessity have lost of its substance nevertheless nature found the way to make up what was wanting and to effect a complete union of the divided parts from whence i have reason to conclude that what the ancients have left us in writing is not always true  i have dressed a great many with fractures of the lower jaw bone but chiefly two soldiers who were wounded in that part at the battle of marseils one of whom had more than half of the bone broken to pieces who nevertheless were perfectly cured as others had been they are at this time amongst the invalids being disabled and much deformed of these i will not speak more particularly having observed nothing extraordinary in their case  chap viii of the neck observation vii it would be both tedious and unprofitable here to relate examples of wounds in the neck of which i have cured a great number in very little time and with simple remedies only i have also several times taken out bullets which have been lodged there for some time yea many years i shall content my self therefore to give my thoughts of what i judge necessary to the speedy cure of wounds of this part in the following chapter  reflection all the ancients agree in this that wounds of the neck though passing quite through are easily enough cured provided the great vessels and spinal marrow be not hurt but they give no sufficient reason for their opinion i know not if i have hit the matter aright but in my opinion it proceeds from this that the use of tents has been laid aside which in the wounds of this part cannot be employed because of the necessary uses of the windpipe and gullet that would be hindered by so hard a bandage as is required to keep in a tent  it is therefore according to my opinion nature her self who being freed from impediments speedily heals up the wounds of the neck and this greatly confirms the reasonableness of my method for those who fear lest the omission of tents should bring on abscesses bags and sinuses have more reason to apprehend such accidents in the wounds of this than in these of any other part  it is well known that this part is obnoxious not only to the bronchocele afflux of cold humors and quinsie but also to phlegmons st anthonies fire and all other indispositions in general that afflict the whole body for this part by reason of the glands that here are very numerous is always charged with abundance of humors which render it subject to all such disorders as proceed from these thrown out upon the parts  it must also be owned that there is not any part in all the body which in proportion to its bigness contains any thing nigh so great a number of blood vessels as are here to be found  and in fine if it were true that the use of tents would prevent fluxions collections of matter bags and sinuses i know no other place of the body that when wounded would be in more need of them than the neck which is extremely subject to such accidents  wherefore since wounds of the neck that of all the parts is most liable to dangerous symptoms may not only without tents be cured but even much more safely and speedily than with em we may conclude that these of other parts ought to be treated also with the same gentleness and set at liberty from the tyranny of tents  chap ix of the breast observation viii being at pignerol in the month of april      m de fontaniere commander of the kings battalion received a thrust with a sword about two inches above the right nipple and in the side thereof toward the armpit which entered the body between the third and fourth rib  he was dressed by one of the surgeons in pignerol before which he had lost according to conjecture about between seven and eight pounds of blood and notwithstanding of the dressings the flux of blood did still continue for which reason i was sent for by the wounded person and his friends i searched the wound in presence of him that had formerly dressed it and drew from it between eight and nine ounces of blood and lest at first i should appear ridiculous i permitted it to be dressed with a tent and immediately after caused him to be let blood and advised his friends to dispose him to set his affairs in order all the signs were dangerous his pulse was weak and convulsive he had frequent swoonings and pains over all his body a clyster was given him and some weak cordials in good broth a little after the bleeding he was seized with a fever and all these accidents concurring made us question whether he could outlive that night which yet he did in great pains over all the breast and perpetual restlesness  in the morning which was the end of the first day of his wound we took off the dressings and found that it had bled all night between six and seven ounces of blood half corrupted issuing from the wound which was dressed as the day before the clyster was repeated we gave him aperitives and vulneraries in syrup of violets and in his broths a diaphoretick made up of some grains of vitriol calcined and the powder of a human scull which gave no small relief being a specific in such sort of wounds  after the dressing the blood yet run from the wound into the bed and as we were preparing to bleed him again news were brought him that he behooved to change his lodgings and for his greater security to some place at a considerable distance from that where he was in this occasion his removal threatened no less than death for this was but the beginning of the second day of the wound i was willing to see it before his departure though it had been dressed but a little time before but having perceived at the last dressing that some blood run from one of these arteries that pass along the lower part of each rib and having only out of complaisance continued the tent i designed to use one of another sort than had been yet done seeing there was now no time to loose  i prepared therefore a soft tent indifferently thick and blunt at the end that it might rest upon the rib without touching the pleura or passing into the cavity of the breast this being dipped in a simple digestive and rould in vitriol finely pulverized i applied with a broad head as is usual together with the rest of the dressings and the plaster of andreas a cruce after having taken some broth he was put into a chair and carried to his new lodgings where he might remain more conveniently by the way he only lost a little blood though many had been of opinion he could never come alive to the end thereof  he rested a little that night and in the morning which was the end of the second day the fever was still pretty violent the wound was without moisture or blood the pleura was reunited he felt a heaviness and breathed with some difficulty the wound we dressed now with a small dilater only to which for more security a long thread was tied applying the other things as before i bled him in the arm and increasing the dose of the diuretics with the syrup of maidenhair ordered an emulsion to be taken at night with two grains of laudanum  all these things succeeded so well that the next day which was the end of the third since he was wounded i found the fever diminished he breathed more freely felt little or no heaviness and in the night time had voided such abundance of urine that we may reasonably enough suppose this to have been a critical evacuation he had also spit store of bloody matter the wound being now in a very good condition from this time forward i dressed it with a plaster only  at night i observed a moisture upon him which made me believe that nature might accomplish the rest of her work by sweat wherefore that i might not let slip so favorable an occasion and to assist nature i caused prepare for him a potion with the distilled waters of carduus benedictus and of scabious four grains of diaphoretick antimony half a dram of the confection of hyacinth and of alkermes a little of the powder of vipers and two or three drops of the spirit of salarmoniac this remedy being given so seasonably procured a thorough sweat and in the morning which was the end of the fourth day of the wound the fever was gone the weight upon the diaphragm removed and he breathed without difficulty and finally all these symptoms being evanishd the wound was only dressed with a sarcotick plaster as if it had been a simple excoriation  the day after which was the fifth of his wound he mounted his horse without help and went to diblon for a more pure and temperate air where he no longer kept his bed though he found not thereby the least inconveniency there i purged him twice which was done not out of any absolute necessity thereof but as an expedient precaution i advised him also for a time to live somewhat moderatly thus that wound which appeared to us at first mortal and was attended with a numerous train of dangerous symptoms was in five days time completely cured to the amazement of all pignerol  reflection this method of practice will appear at first to be ridiculous and rash to those who have not considered so much as i have done the surprising works of nature nor these secret passages she finds out to discharge her self of what is troublesome to her in like cases nor how in particular she oftentimes effects a crisis by the way of urine  but seeing experience has frequently taught us that an empyema in the breast has been carried off by means of diuretics the matter as the ancients thought passing to the urinary vessels through the vena azygos but much more probably through ways to us yet unknown why may not a little extravasated blood contained in the cavity of the breast or lying upon the diaphragm be discharged by the same ways or by those of sweat especially if nature be therein assisted by the use of diaphoreticks  by these ways then now mentioned the breast may be sufficiently freed from humors that oppress it chiefly in a young and vigorous body neither is there now place for any to doubt of this of which so many people in our days have been eyewitnesses who can yet testify the same  wherefore there is no reason to be so obstinately bent for using tents in wounds of the breast unless it be to carry astringents to some place whether otherwise they could not reach or to support and keep them on but in all other cases they ought entirely to be laid aside for by exasperating such parts as they touch they are apt to renew the flux of blood they hinder the closing up of the wound and by widening the division of the pleura occasion an inflammation thereof  it also frequently falls out when a tent is something long that it touches the lungs and bruises em by reason of their continutl motion and beating against its point yea oftentimes it enters into and divides their substance making its way through the investing membrane now brought to suppuration in wounds also where the lungs are not spoiled there being only a simple division of their substance with a sharp instrument a tent may increase the separation and by iritating the parts cause a discharge of humors thereupon and great suppurations which end ordinarily in incurable fistulas  moreover a tent presses upon the muscules of respiration and permits not the patient either to cough spit or breath freely it hinders the circulation of the blood by bearing on the vessels so that the wounded is in danger of suffocation by the collection of blood matter or phlegm and oftentimes of all three together unless they are by some means discharged but if there is not a sufficient quantity of one or all of these to produce such an effect and if the lungs are yet at liberty to perform their wonted motions yet these humors will there ferment and corrupt and occasion putrefaction in the parts that contain em  but after all this accident may sometimes have an happy event and a bad cause may by chance produce a good effect for our body as we are informed by anatomy being nothing else but a contexture of vessels it may happen in wounds of the breast that the blood or matter collected in the substance of the lungs or upon the midriff may there undergo a fermentation and thereby together with the heat and moisture of the part open and dilate the pores of the veins whereby these humors being taken into and mixed with the blood rarify subtilise and dispose it to throw off the offending matter either by sweat urine or other crises of alike nature according to the disposition of the body  and surely we need make no great difficulty to believe that such a thing might happen in a wound of the breast if we will consider what befell m de la place a captain in the regiment of barrois who voided by stool the matter of a great abscess in his arm occasioned by a wound he had received in that part of which we will give you a particular account in the last chapter of this book as also of another wounded in the last campaign from whom the matter that was contained within the breast was drawn away by opening the vena mediana with a design only to let blood  in fine we may say though the ways by which these crises were effected are not altogether known to us yet it is very certain that there are such and seeing nature is not ignorant of them we ought to leave to her conduct the success of a work whereof she ought to have all the honor and which she alone brings to pass our part being only to wait upon her and assist her in her design  galen in his   book de locis has observed that matter contained in the breast is oftentimes carried off by urine the same thing also he affirms in his  th book de partium morbis  andreas a cruce a famous physician of venice in the first section of his fourth book of surgery in express terms forbids the use of tents and pipes in the wounds of the breast he advises only to use a plaster the advantage of which i have thoroughly experienced  fabricius ab aquapendente part i book   chap    says that he has often seen the matter contained in the breast in a pleurisy or peripneumonia discharged by urine he relates an authentic history of a wound piercing into the cavity of the breast which having been dressed as a simple one of the common teguments the patient was on a sudden surpised with such symptoms as plainly discovered the nature of the wound that he might be relieved with as much ease as possible and not put to the torment of a counteropening it was thought expedient to dilate the wound but it was so well closed up that the operation of the empyema was resolved on next day but during the night sage nature had accomplished the work a glass full of blood being voided by the urinary passages whereby the spitting of blood difficulty of breathing and all the other accidents were completely removed  the same author recommends on such occasions the use of strong diuretics unless a fever hinder and in the above cited chapter he says that there are some who will not allow wounds of the breast to be kept open but suffer them to close lest otherwise the natural heat might be dispersed and the cold air should enter in and spoil the neighboring parts he adds that the use of tents occasions fistulas  ambrosius pareus book  0 chap    approves the practice of those who make use of tents in wounds of the breast and elsewhere commends such as employ them not so that as to this point he seems to have been undetermined and inconsistent with himself  in the same chapter also he speaks of a cure done by himself without tents and afterward he affirms that fistulas which follow upon wounds of the breast are oftentimes occasioned only by the use of them the same author in the   th chapter of the   th book of his treatise of matter and blood that may be carried off by the veins demonstrates by many reasons that such an evacuation may be and shows that galen was of the same mind  hollerius in his commentaries is of the same opinion and m verdue tom   chap    affirms that wounds of the breast the more they are exposed to the air are so much the more dangerous  it would be a very tedious task to recount all the authors that have approved of this method although it is but little put in practice and it would be a very easy matter to bring many examples of cures wrought by nature through secret and occult passages conveying humors and matter into other parts than what were first affected  chap x of the breast observation ix about the end of the year      there was brought to the hospital of the king at brainson a granadeer of the regiment of touraine together with a servant of m de lesseraine formerly commissary at pignerol  the first was run into the sidepart of the breast between the third and fourth ribs with a sword which past into the capacity of the thorax and pierced the lungs the usual symptoms appeared at first and diversions were made the first and second day some blood came from the wound which was only dressed with the plaster of andreas a cruce without either tent or dilater diuretics also and diaphoreticks were used and upon the fourth day he voided great abundance of urine by which critical evacuation he was freed from the fever difficulty of breathing weight upon the midriff and spitting of blood and on the fourteenth day he was completely cured  the other had received just such another wound piercing in like manner only higher by one rib the symptoms were so violent that though it was immediately dressed yet was there no hope of cure he was treated after the same manner as the former but he was much more speedily cured by means of an universal sweat whereby that very day all the accidents were removed in eight days time he went out from the hospital entirely cured  were i to give a particular account of the numerous cures of alike nature that have been done according to this method there would be enough to fill a great volume all which were neither attended with any evil accidents during the time of the cure nor followed by any after it nor did they ever leave fistulas behind em i shall speak of gunshotwounds in the following chapter  chap xi of the breast observation x in the year      there was brought to the foresaid hospital of brianson a prisoner of the army of savoy who was wounded with a bullet that entered near the right pap toward the armpit and passed out of the body four fingers breadth from the sixth vertebre of the back having in its way broken asunder the fourth rib  i enlarged both the orifices but a little more that of the back which was somewhat lower than the other we dressed him only once a day at first without either tents or dilaters and from the hinder orifice came forth a certain thin watery humor which evacuation continued till the falling of the escar after which time he was dressed only once in two days i kept the last mentioned orifice open from time to time by means of a piece of prepared sponge conjecturing that there were some splinters of bone to be discharged which accordingly came to pass without any pain about the eighteenth day of the wound from that time forth i endeavored to heal it up applying between the orifices compresses dipped in warm wine during this cure i could observe no sensible crises nor did any accident happen it was finished in thirty days  reflection in this wound the lungs were untouched for any thing that appeared a rib only being broken and the pleura hurt which indeed had been sufficient to produce fatal accidents had any other method been followed for if in this case tents had been used or had the wound been crammed full of dossils as has been often done on such occasions the matter proceeding from the dissolution of the escar and the contusion being pent up between the two orifices and still increasing and finding no vent would infallibly have broken into the cavity of the breast from whence it could not have been drawn forth but by the operation of the empyema  an ancident like unto this happened this year to a famous officer of our army in savoy who having received a wound which was thought to peneteate and really did so was dressed with tents but the matter finding the way by which it should have been discharged from the body altogether intercepted and passing among the broken pieces of a fracturd rib diffused it self into the capacity of the thorax and in this condition he dyed having his breast full of matter  chap xii of the breast observation xi upon the twelfth day of june      the marquess de larray lieutenant general took by storm a post in the valley of barcelonetta and in this occasion had five and twenty or thirty men wounded who were brought to our hospital of brianson and among others there was one called simon contaut of the regiment of vendosme and company of berole this man had received a bullet which went in hard by the sixth vertebra of the back breaking in its passage the transverse process on the right side and came out on the fore part of the thorax between the second and third rib toward the left side  this wound was attended with all the most dangerous symptoms that use to appear when the lungs are wounded being one of the most considerable that had been under cure in this hospital  there was not here any need of dilating the orifices the largeness of the size of the bullet having done it to some purpose the wounds were dressed without any tent but only with large pledgets and a good agglutinative plaster the compresses and bandage being such as is usual diversions were made without delay and a course of diet appointed he was dressed but once a day and that with all possible speed  the hinder orifice of the wound did blow with such force that all the bystanders were surpised thereat and such a prodigious quantity of water did issue from it that oftentimes it was necessary to change the linnens twice a day diuretic and vulnerary potions were given  this large evacuation continued for about twelve or fourteen days after which the wounded person was dressed but once in two days the twentieth and first or twentieth and second day the opening of the pleura on the back was perfectly closed up that before having preceeded it some days there was nothing came away that we could observe either from the broken process or the ribs that had been touched in the passage of the bullet and in thirty five days or thereabout the orifices were both entirely filled up  reflection this wounded man was sent to the hospital as one of whom all hopes had been laid aside for the surgeon major of the regiment who at first dressed him with great care told his captain that his death was inevitable  this same captain about a month after coming to brianzon with the lieutenant colonel of his regiment who had been wounded with a sword was much surpised when he was visited at his lodgings by this soldier who was at that time as vigorous as before he had received his wounds at which he now had only a plaster the surgeon also testified to me his amazement and enquired after what manner i had proceeded to accomplish that cure in so small a time  this cure is of it self sufficent to evince that in wounds of the breast there is no need of tents and moreover does demonstrate that the operation of the empyema is attended with much better success when performed on the hinder than on the lateral parts of the thorax for this operation is done with design to give a passage to the extravasated blood and to evacuat the matter contained in the cavity of the breast for which purposes this place is much more convenient than the others the humors being thereby by discharged so soon as bred unless they be retained by tents the wounded are not troubled with violent agitations but enjoy a profound quiet the parts have liberty to perform the necessary motions and nature acts without constraint finding always the ways open by which she may deliver her self from what is contrary and hurtful unto her so that nothing is now to hinder her from closing up the wound when ever she shall find her self disposed so to do  if then gunshotwounds of this nature notwithstanding the havoc that the bullet makes in the places through which it passes are so easily and speedily cured by this method we have all the reason in the world to believe that the wounds made by sharp instruments where there is ordinarily only a simple solution of continuity may be cured with much greater facility  but we must observe that in this way of dressing great care is to be had of covering such wounds with good substantial pledgets of such bigness that there may be no danger of their being pushed into the cavity of the breast by the weight of the incumbent air and upon the pledgets we must apply a strong and agglutinative plaster such as that of andreas a cruce which also must be sustained with a compress of four doubles and all kept on with the napkin and scapulary all which precaution is necessary to withstand the entry of the air which otherwise the use of tents being laid aside might pass into the thorax and there produce fatal accidents  m verdue tom   chap    advises not to use tents in wounds of the breast for too long a time lest thereby incurable fistulas be occasioned  chap xiii of the breast observation xii when i was at liserne there was brought to the hospital in the year      a soldier of the regiment of saluce who was wounded with a  which is a weapon made in form of a poniard on the side of the cartilago ensiformis the wound as was evidently to be seen when it was dilated passing upwards by the short ribs and piercing the midriff in its fleshly part  he was dressed with a pledget only covered with an incarnative that was pretty liquid the necessary diversions were performed and such a diet was ordered as suited best with the greatness of the wound and the strength and constitution of the patient he was dressed only once in two days the suppuration was but very small and in the space of eight or nine days he was completely cured  reflection if this wound had been dressed with tents after the ordinary manner i leave it to be judged by every one if such a desirable success could have been expected seeing the tent would unquestionably have caused fearful irritations of the diaphragma which without it is with great difficulty brought to reunite because of its perpetual and necessary motion in fine this wound how inconsiderable soever it might appear had certainly proved mortal if it had been stuffed with an extraneous body which by increasing the division of the midriff would have proved an impediment to its action for every body knows that wounds in its nervous part are deadly and that these in the fleshly part may become so when exasperated by ill treatment or neglected  chap xiv a remark on one that was wounded in the breast obserrvation xiii in the last mentioned year and in the same hospital one of the wounded died on the fifth or sixth day of his wound and because it had not at all appeared to be mortal the bullet having but glanced upon him whereby the fifth rib was only broken and the pleura slightly hurt i opened him that i might discover the cause of his death at first i was of opinion that an asthma with which he was afflicted when alive and which had almost quite disabled him for service had conduced much to the shortning of his days but i was convinced of my mistake when i perceived all the parts in the breast in a very good condition only the heart had its ventricles filled with polypuses of the thickness of a large writing quill and about the length of the little finger there being four in the right and two in the left ventricle  if we may give credit to dr lower of oxford in his treatise on the motion of the heart we may easily enough account for the death of this man he says that in order to continue the circulation of the blood and to send a convenient quantity thereof through the vessels the two ventricles of the heart must be of an equal capacity and moreover that they must have alike strength to undergo this labor now this equality not being to be found in the heart of him of whom we speak its motion must needs have been depraved by the disproportion of the weight of the polypuses and by the inequality of the capacity of the ventricles or because the heart being overcharged could not contract it self without much difficulty so that remittting much of its motion it became weak and languishing and the midriff also to which it is always tied did loose its necessary vigor especially after his receiving the wound by reason of which the breast could not be dilated without trouble and pain because of the broken rib and of the solution of continuity of the pleura intercostal muscles and muscles of respiration wherefore the heart and lungs being deprived of their necessary relief suffocation and death were unavoidable  though this is a subject foreign to our present design yet we judged it would not be amiss here to take notice of it for caution and advice to others in a like occasion  chap xv of the lower belly and loins observation xiv in the same year      a soldier of the regiment of montferrat called sans soucy was wounded by a bullet which entering before at the region of the navel came out behind at that of the reins piercing the right vreter as it passed along he was at first dressed by one of the mastersurgeons of turin who used to assist us which he performed after his own way  the orifice which was in the belly notwithstanding the tents which he used was closed up after the falling off of the escar of the teguments but it fared otherwise with that in the back for that surgeon being careful to keep it open with a thick and long tent hindered also the reuniting of the vreter which occasioned the urine to come forth at the wound i having seen him one day advised the surgeon speedily to take away the tent if he would avoid an incurable fistula but my words were to no purpose for had he complied with em he would have thought he had offended against the rules of art and ancient received maxims with which my advice was inconsistent  some days after seeing this wound in a very bad condition being covered with a whitish flesh almost without sense and ready to become a callus i was willing to prevent the fatal consequences of that indiscreet dressing wherefore with a dissolved caustic i consumed all that appeared callous about the lips of the wound causing also some of it to pass into the cavity thereof and leaving out the tent i expected the discharge of what the caustic had mortified when the flesh had regained its usual color without loss of time i syringd into the wound some balsamic water i also used the balsam of peru alone for some days and after that the styptick plaster of crollius with little longish compresses that were placed on the two sides of the wound to press together the brims thus the wound begun to be filled up and the urine did by little and little resume it is former course and in about    or  0 days the wounded person was perfectly cured  reflection in the progress of this cure may evidently be perceived the difference between the method used by many surgeons fondly conceited of their own opinions and that which i practice for if in this case the first had been continued but for eight days time the wound had become either extremely difficult or impossible to be cured this is confirmed by the wound in the belly the speedy cure whereof is to be attributed to the motion of the intestines which contrary to the design and desire of the surgeon expelled the tent so soon as applied in such sort that it was completely cured a little after the falling of the escar  wherefore we can never too much blame those who are so obstinately wedded to the use of tents in wounds of the lower belly they ought altogether to be laid aside in spite of all the objections that may be made on their behalf for which undoubtedly there is no real ground experience gained by practice has so undeceived me touching the use of tents that i have left off the use of them not only in the lower belly but even in all other places of the body unless upon a very pressing necessity but in wounds of the emulgent vessels of the reins of the vreters and of the bladder as also in those of the joints they occasion accidents which oftentimes prove mortal or otherwise leave behind them infirmities that ever after render life miserable  chap xvi of the ventricle observation xv one of the principal deputies of the hospital of brianzon in the spring of the year      received a wound in the upper and middle part of the right hypochondrium piercing in appearance to the ventricle or to the pylorus i could not find out the depth of the wound with the probe notwithstanding of all the postures i could put the patient in but an accident that immediately fell out discovered the truth of the matter for though he had supped very slightly he vomited up again all he had taken mixed with pure blood i immediately dilated moderately the wound that a free passage might be left to the blood that possibly was extravasated in the lower belly or to the matter that might afterward breed there i dressed him with a pledget only upon which i applied a suitable plaster and bandage i bled him a little after and ordered a very exact course of diet the blood was thin muddy and corrupted whereby i perceived the ill habit and sickly disposition of his body he spent the night in restlesness because of pains over all the lower belly and a violent fever which kept him from sleep in the morning i repeated the bleeding he had several motions to vomit but could not and nothing at all came from the wound which was dressed as before  there being two enemies to be grappled with i proposed to continue the diversions without interruption which was also approved of by our physicians we used potions juleps and ptisanes such as were most proper for purifying the mass of blood and blunting the points of the acids to which i added some vulneraries suppositories were used to procure stools but to no purpose which obliged us to give him from time to time half a pound of decoction in a clyster but with small success this method we continued for seven days without being able to observe any considerable change either as to the fever or the pain in which time he was let blood six or seven times in fine toward the seventh or eighth day of the wound his bellly was opened and at first he had a kind of a bloody flix but afterward he voided pure blood though in no great quantity i caused boil some vulnerary plants with his broth and made him take for some days fasting a little spoonful of our samaritan balsam called that of the scripture the fever and pains abated a little which gave me some hopes of recovery the voiding of blood by stool continued till the fourteenth day and then all the dangerous symptoms disappeared and the wound was completely cured without having afforded any considerable store of matter  reflection it was only the situation of the wound together with the accidents which followed that made me conclude that either the ventricle or the pylorus was wounded having therefore no certain sign to direct my judgment in this affair i tried if the sword that had given the wound could make any discovery and found it was marked with blood the length of ten inches or thereabouts there needed no more to assure me of the nature of the wound but that which altogether convinced me was the blood voided by stool the seventh day of the wound this having been collected in such a quantity as was sufficient to press and push forward the excrements contained in the guts at length made way for it self and if we had delayed to bleed him or done it more seldom he would certainly have had a great and very dangerous flux of blood besides a number of other accidents that infalliby had followed  it appears then that the true knowledge of wounds which pierce into any cavity o the body and hurt the inward parts depends upon the accidents and it is of high concern to a young surgeon not to confide too much in his probe or thereby to give his opinion he ought also to make all requisite diversions and to endeavor with all necessary care to avoid and prevent accidents which too often when arrived to a certain height become proof against all our endeavors  a great many wounded persons have been sent to me dressed at first as if their wounds had been but slight which nevertheless i have found to be deep and very considerable it is sometimes not possible to put the patint in the same posture he was in when he received the wound so that it is an easy matter to be deceived if we trust to such uncertain trials as those made with the probe the parts may have changed their situation or they may be swelled or clotted blood gathered together in the wound may oppose the probes passage or when it cannot trace the way of the instrument that made the wound it may slide along between the interstices of the muscles oftentimes the wounded either know not in what posture they were or are mistaken therein or they are not in a condition to give an account finally it is much better to exceed in exactness which cannot prejudice the patient than to take up with an uncertainty which may cost the wounded his life and the surgeon his reputation  moreover it appears by the success of this cure that the orifices of penetrating wounds afford but very small assistance to the cure of the inward wounded parts for it is next to impossible to convey through them remedies to those parts that want em and for which they are designed this i am bold to affirm contrary to the sentiments of the ancients and of fabricius ab aquapendente and some moderns it is also scarcely to be expected that the blood which flows from these parts should come forth by the external orifice as we have observed unless the lower belly be quite filled up with blood and in fine the keeping open of the wounds is more pernicious than profitable serving only to inintroduce the air into places where it almost never fails to occasion irritations disquieting pains coagulations obstructions or corruptions and oftentimes all these evils together  galen affirms that wounds in the bottom of the ventricle if not great are curable but celsus is of opinion that they are mortal now how to reconcile such opposite sentiments i know not however that they are not absolutely mortal this cure is a sufficient proof but it is nevertheless true that they are very dangerous and their cure uncertain being atttended with many accidents the least of which may prove fatal such as vomiting a disorder peculiar to this part or a flux of blood from the branches of the arteria caeliaca the vena gastrica and gaffrepiploica whether scarce any astringents can reach and where they cannot be kept on also convulsions may be occasioned by the wounding of the nerves that proceed from the recurrents add to these that by wounds of this part the chyle may be evacuated so soon as made  caap xvii of the perinaeum observation xvi during the campaign of the forementioned year      a soldier in the regiment of the duke of savoy and company of st george called la couleur was sent to me having an abscess which covered all the perinaeum and part of the scrotum  after i had opened it on the left side at that place where ordinarily the operation for extracting the stone is performed there came forth a great deal of corrupt matter with much urine whereby i understood that by the long stay of the matter the membranes of the bladder were vitiated and corroded  i used neither tent nor dilater to the sore but judged it sufficient to drop into it a medicine for cleansing the ulcer the suppuration lasted for the space of fifteen days which yet hindered me not from the very first to use little long and slender bolsters for bringing together the divided parts which i kept fast with a strong bandage fitted to the figure of the part  after this perceiving the matter came away in a moderate quantity and of a laudable consistence though mixed with some urine i used more powerful incarnatives balsamic water and the balsam of peru and upon these crolliuss plaster i straightened the bandage obliging the patient to keep his thighs close together thus by degrees the urine resumed its former course and in five or six weeks time the cure was finished  reflection this cure is inconsistent with the opinion of galen who aphor    says that divisions of the blader cannot be united because it is a part without blood  i have had many under my hands that were wounded in the bladder which were all happily cured by the same method and indeed if loss of substance occasioned by the corrupting matter of an abscess has been readily enough made up it is easy to believe that simple divisions thereof by external causes may with much more ease and expedition be united this is sufficiently demonstrated by the great number of those which have recovered after cutting for the stone and if sometimes fistulas were left after this operation they have been occasioned by keeping tents in the wound without any necessity i know m verdue imputes this to the sharpness of the urine but that i cannot be persuaded of having observed in many places of my travels that the country people have used nothing else but their urine to cure their wounds  but if we reflect a little on the effects produced by tents which many people use in the divisions of this part we may soon be convinced that they are the cause of this accident by keeping open a way for the passage of the urine which though it cannot run in a full stream so long as it is hindered by the tent yet this being penetrated by the urine dulls the sense of the place and turns the flesh callous  when a wound abounds in moisture be the humor what it will it is of difficult cure this is sufficiently confirmed by the fistulas which happen in the breast or joints tho the urine have no hand in the matter moreover to convince us that the humors wherewith wounds and ulcers are watered are an hindrance to their joining and filling up we need only to consider these openings in the thighs and legs of hydropick persons that are made by nature or that we are necessitated to make by art every body knows that the cure of these is extremely difficult to be effected because of the humidity wherewith they are continually soaked which is sufficient to support what we have advanced on this subject and to persuade such as are of a contrary opinion  moreover the breaking or fretting of the lymphatick vessels which occasions the perpetual running of watery humors in sores hinders their reunion in regard that this serosity dilutes and carries away the nutricious juice and brings them to a fistula great suppurations also have the same mischievous effects but these being not so obstinate are more easily conquered than a running of the lympha  finally if we would effect a speedy cure in wounds of the bladder we must carefully shun whatsoever may widen them or hinder their reunion we must apply some powerful incarnative such as the balsam of peru a substantial agglutinative plaster as that of crollius with small longish compresses and a sufficient bandage as has been said but above all we must take care that the patient be altogether at rest without any disturbance these are the means which i have found most effectual and most successful in bringing such kind of ulcers to a perfect cure  chap xviii of the fundament observation xvii monsiue de monrodon captain of a battalion of the kings regement commanded by m desbordes having been four years ago cured of an abscess in the anus there remained still some fistulous sinuses from which there was always discharged a great deal of matter this inconvenience obliged him in the year      to demand my advice having observed several callosities about the anus with deep and winding cavities i proposed to him to lay open the fistula in order to consume these hardnesses and cleanse the bottom thereof without which there was no hope of a perfect cure but he calling to mind the torments he had endured in the first cure put it off for some time till falling into an indispotion occasioned by his ill habit of body the fistula opened of it self about a month after i had seen him with an extraordinary running and great abundance of matter accompanied with a quick and insupportable pain  i was at that time in a place at some distance from our hospital wherefore he caused himself to be dressed by a mate of the regiment who having nothing but the common remedies and understanding only the ordinary method filled up that large cavity with a great quantity of lint armed with suppurative and putrefying medicines which made a terrible corruption and great havoc in the part increasing the suppuration and the pain he then sent me an account of the deplorable condition to which he was reduced praying me to come and see him when i came i advised him to cause himself to be removed unto a place where i might take care of him my self which also was done that same day the matter that was retained and the continual exasperation of the parts had made a hole big enough to admit ones fist which passed with a winding course even to the os sacrum there was also another sinus that reached to the neck of the bladder so that the sick person could no ways go to stool or enjoy one minute of repose  having taken him under my care i dressed him only with the red balsam melted with an equal quantity of the samaritan balsam which i poured warm into the sinuses and after having filled them therewith i covered the orifice with a large pledget dipped in the same over which i put a plaster and upon this a compress making all fast with a convenient bandage i caused him use some absorbing medicines to dull the points of the acids and ptisanes to putrify the blood and also some gentle purgatives this method succeeded so well that the matter which was thin putrid and corrosive became laudable the flesh which was loose and wasted by degrees recovered its firmness the patient went to stool every day without any pain at night also he enjoyed the repose which was so necessary for him and finally in one months time he was completely cured the sores being brought to a firm and laudable scar to the amazement not only of the patient himself but of all those also who knew to what a deplorable condition he was formerly reduced being without all hope of being cured  reflection these kinds of distempers are extremely roublesome that affect parts on which by reason of their necessary use it is very difficult to keep the dressings such a part is the anus that is often afflicted with great suppurations and dismal putrefactions which delay and protract a cure to a formidable length the person we have been just now speaking of is a clear demonstration of this in the first cure six months time were spent he endured much pain and trouble and after all it was not brought to perfection from whence i infer that it is evident that the gentleness and easiness of our method was the genuine cause of the perfect and speedy cure that ensued for that organ which serves for the commonshore of the body being left at liberty and not straightened by an extraneous body the excrements were neither pressed nor retained but were discharged with ease and without pain whereas on the contrary when wounds in this part are crammed up with lint it is impossible that evacuations can be made by the anus but the excrements must press and squeeze the crowded lint against the sides of the sore which must needs occasion insufferable pains and oftentimes also a flux of blood and indeed monsieur de monrodon affirmed to me that he never went to stool all the time of his first cure but he was still troubled with these two symptoms  finally we may see that when putrefying and suppurating medicines are laid aside the parts are by the means of unctuous balsamicks gradually restored to their former temperature and that when the points of the acids are broken and the mass of blood purifyed by proper remedies the natural balsam of the parts does cleanse fill up with flesh and cicatrize when ever the occasion requires  chap xix of the upper part of the shoulder observation xviii in the year      as i traveled from turin toward rome and venice there was brought to me the son of an inhabitant of a certain place called la rose having an abscess that covered all the acromion and the upper part of the shoulder bone of the right side with a great defluxion of humor upon the joint i showed his father the urgent necessity there was of opening it and the accidents that otherwise might ensue but the fond love he had for his son made him withstand the proposal some time after this it opened of its self and the thinnest part of the matter made its way through several holes into which so many tents were put by a surgeon of the place who dressed him at his fathers desire this method was followed for two or three months without any prospect of a cure  at my return he was committed to my care in a very bad condition he was altogether deprived of the motion of his arm several cavities were formed about the joint there was a perpetual flux of matter and the ligament were relaxed which made me fear the falling out of the head of the humerus i was persuaded that the distemper was past cure considering the weakness of the patient and of the part affected and the ill disposition of his body which yet was but a symptom of the disease occasioned by the great irritations and continual discharge of humors as i knew by the sequel i made however a pretty large opening in that which i judged the most depending part and straightway took away the tents though at that time i was not altogether convinced of their pernicious effects  from that time forth the flux of matter begun to diminish which made me endeavor with all possible speed thoroughly to cleanse the bottom of the ulcer and the sinuses with a lotion of birthwort myrrh sugar candy and vitriol in white wind which had very good success i did my best also to strengthen the joint finally the cavities were filled up by degrees the higher orifices were first closed up and the others afterward he was cured in two months time but his arm was something more than other two before it recovered its strength  reflection this sudden good success falling out so unexpectedly and at a time when i had casually though very seasonably laid aside the use of tents began to open my eyes and to make me entertain an ill opinion of them for i could blame nothing on this occasion save the tents which had been so long kept in the sore for having caused all these accidents by the irritation and compression of the parts and moreover by hindering the discharge of the matter from one dressing to another whereby it had time to gather and to ferment to increase the cavities and waste of the substance to moisten the tendons slacken the ligaments and to weaken and entirely ruin the part finally the most part of the symptoms ceasing with the leaving out of the tents does sufficiently evince that they proceeded from them and had the first method been continued in for a month or two a complete dislocation of the head of the shoulder bone the corruption of the ligaments and incurable fistulas had certainly ensued and the patient would have thereby been made lame during his life  chap xx of the shoulder observation xix in the year      a soldier of the regiment of sourche whose name i have forgotten was brought to the hospital at brianzon he was wounded with a bullet which entered at the foremost and middle part of the acromion and came out on the upper part of the shoulder blade breaking the acromion with a part of the scapula as it went along  the orifices were straitway dilated and dressed only with pledgets and the digestive diversions were speedily made and his diet ordered in the first dressings several pieces of bone that could not be reunited having been almost wholly separated came away several others that were yet tied by a small piece of the periosteum though in appearance shaking and ready to fall off were yet joined again  finally all the adhering splinters being again united the wound began to fill up and in two months time or thereabout was brought to a firm and laudable cicatrix to the great surprise of all who had been present at the dressings no accident having happened all the time of the cure  reflection it will certainly be thought strange that i permitted the orifices to be closed up without expecting the discharge of the bones and it will possibly be said that i dressed not according to art  but to me it appears much more reasonable and advantageous to have preserved them than occasioned their loss seeing a callus has never the becoming convenience of a natural part and the excellency of art consists in curing speedily if possible and without pain and in preserving the figure substance and disposition of the wounded parts it is certain that health being the end of the surgeons art the principal design is attained when the cure is performed  if that intention which ought to be the scope of the artist can by this method be gently easily and speedily accomplished there is no controversy but that it ought to be preferred to all others that are contrary to it  chap xxi of the arm observation xx the following year a granadeer of the regiment of navarre called belle humeur was brought to the same hospital wounded with a shot on the upper part of the left shoulder bone about an inch or two fingers breadth below the joint the bullet entered on the fore part and went out behind making a terrible havoc three or four days passed wherein he was not dressed but only slightly at first and without making any diversion the whole arm was distended like a football the orifices were choked up inflamed and disposed to gangrene  i made incisions in the orifices to give breath unto the wound and scarifications over all the arm and having dressed with a digestive only without tents or dilaters i let a good quantity of blood run from the part by the incisions to empty it somewhat and afterward fomented it with spirit of wine and a little salarmoniack i applied over all the arm diapalma dissolved in oil of roses and vinegar which in a little time abated the inflammation of the part and lessened the swelling  diversions were not omitted but in spite of all could be done three abscesses were formed one at the bending of the elbow inwardly another on the outward and middle part of the arm and the third on the hinder and almost lowest part of the humerus they were all three opened and by their plentiful suppuration the whole afflicted member was eased after three or four splinters of the bone that stuck by their upper part only to the periostium were again joined i bent all my endeavors to bring together and unite the lips of the wound and when the escar was entirely fallen and the symptoms vanished i used only a simple incarnative dressing but once in two days the suppuration was but small and the orifices begun apparently to fill up and in thirty days were quite skinned over so that from thenceforth i used the rolling bandage and plasters in order to fortify the callus and now his diet is increased and he is able to rise from his bed finally he departed to return to his regiment forty four days after he had received the wound  reflection the delaying of the diversions as evidently appears was one of the chief causes of the accidents that followed upon this wound and it is plain that if tents dilaters or other exasperating things had been used in dressing they had infallibly proved an impediment to the discharging of the part and ripening of the abscesses for reasons adducd in the first part when we discoursed of their fatal effects  nature is in such cases sufficiently perplexed without the additional oppression of the most grievous of all her enemies she is as it were fettered and cannot act and when by a healthful and critical motion she endeavors to deliver her self as in the abscesses of the former cure she is unable to produce any desirable effect so long as the wound is crammed full of lint and the most frequent consequence of this is a stifling of the natural heat after which follows a gangrene  there have but few accidents followed upon wounds treated after our method and i am bold to affirm that scarce any have miscarried under our care though more dangerously wounded than this soldier of whom we have been speaking all which is owing to the gentleness of this way and the use of diversions  chap xxii of another wound in the arm observation xxi in the year    0 a little time after the war was declared in savoy a soldier of the regiment of pondenx named la montague was sent to the hospital at brianson who had got a violent blow with the handle of an halberd on the middle and outward part of the left humerus whereby the bone was broken to pieces with a wound and gteat contusion  several portions of the bone stuck out at the wound which did still adhere to the periosteum i placed them one by another as gently and nimbly as possibly i could endeavoring to give them their natural position i rubbed the part with a powerfully dissolving balsam very warm which i had caused to be prepared for contusions i joined the lips of the wound and applied an incarnative i gently rolled the part with a band about three fingers breadth above the wound and with another as much below it applying a plaster made of diapalma dissolved in oil of roses and vinegar between the bands the middle part whereof being opposite to the wound the ends met upon it and covered it upon this i put a compress of the same figure and bigness folded into three or four doubles and dipped in warm wine and then a piece of pastboard which resting with its ends upon the two roulers and embracing and keeping fast all the woundapparel came together and was tied on the hinder part of the arm  in this pastboard there was a hole cut out where it covered the wound to which a piece of the same was fitted to be taken off at each dressing and afterward put on this was made fast with a little band which i rolled about all the pastboard after i had applied my dressings in such fashion that without disturbing either the arm or the pastboard i had nothing to do but when there was occasion to unty the band take off the piece and lift up the two ends of the compress and of the plaster and so to embrocate the wound and then to dress it with a pledget only and do it up again  in this manner it was dressed once a day for five or six days after which i gently took off all the dressings save the rollers and changing the plaster and compress i dressed but once in two days no accident happened for the contusion was quickly dissolved no bones were discharged and the suppuration was but little diversions having been made from the very first the wound was filled up and completely skinned about the twenty second day of the wound wherefore i thenceforth dressed it only with rollers the plaster pro fracturis and the necessary splents since that time i have not seen him because then we parted from luserne but it is certain he was past all danger  reflection if this way of dressing be compared with that of many surgeons who not only fill up the sores with lint but also at each dressing move to and fro the broken pieces of bone in order to promote their separation it may be seen how different the success will prove had i treated this wound in a rigorous manner such accidents had undoubtedly happened as would have baffled my care the suppuration would have been great and thus the pieces of the bone thereby quite separated and carried into some cavity had caused many abscesses and sinuses which disorders oftentimes cause a necessity of amputation and when the strength is decayed they bring on death after this i made use of a piece of white iron formed in the same fashion as the pastboard with a window opening upon the wound which being lift up i dressed it without moving the body of the machine but seeing in those places where hospitals are we have not every thing requisite at hand the surgeon must supply that defect by his own ingenuity  chap xxiii of the forearm or cubit observation xxii in the same place a soldier in the foresaid regiment received a shot in the forearm on the middle and hinder part which broke the radius and carried away a part of the cubitus  he was dressed after our method but the cavity of the wound was filled with a pledget of very fine lint dipped in a mixture of our balsam and a little linimentum arcaei which eases pain promotes the fall of the escar and resists fluxion of humors diversions were made and his diet ordered  we dressed him after two days and found two or three pices of bone sticking to the lint in the second dressing i set the radius keeping it firm with little compresses stiffned with pastboard one of these i put on the forepart of the arm upon the broken bone another on the inward and a third on the outward part making them all fast with two rollers one above and the other below the fracture this apparatus kept the arm straight and served instead of a defensive over all we applied the pastboard and supported the arm with a sling the suppuration was very moderate and another piece of bone came afterward away we dressed but once in two days and on the twelfth or fifteenth of the wound the flesh begun to cover the bone for which cause we dressed him only once in three days and that very gently and speedily toward the twentieth day the wound began to be filled up the defect of the cubitus was made up with a callus and the radius recovered without exfoliation and all in four weeks time after which i only used a roller on the fracturd place about this time we parted from luserne and i have not seen him since  reflection the good success the expedition and the gentleness of these cures ought in my opinion to give some reputation to this way of dressing i have not seen since first i entered upon practice any method followed that has been either so short so easy for the patient or so certain in the consequence hereby these pains are prevented which ordinarily bring fevers that are attended with many other accidents abscesses fluxions and inflammations are avoided the matter is but little and that laudable the wounded can take solid nourishment and necessary rest whereby all the faculties become more vigorous and nature more active flesh is more easily generated and a callus more speedily formed and in fine every thing with more facility reestablished and reduced to its former state  chap xxiv of another wound in the forearm observation xxiii about the end of the year      i being in the same post in the hospital of the abbey of oulx wherein i was in that of brion there was brought to us one called beau belonging to the kings battalion commanded by m desbordes and of the company of m du mont he was run with a sword into the middle and inward part of the left arm whereby the artery between the radius and cubitus was opened  he had remained eight or nine days in his quarters being dressed by one of the mates who without making any diversion only shut up the wound with a strong stopple which restrained the great flux of blood between dressings but at the time of dressing he bled excessively the blood which was extravasated in the member did there corrupt and caused abscesses in several places but at last his surgeon seeing that his strength was daily diminished and fearing some fatal accident caused him to be sent to oulx  his weakness was advantageous to him for whereas amputation was chiefly indicated his loss of strength was a contrary indication that prevailed over the former i dilated the wound that i might discover the artery and empty the part of that matter and clotted blood wherewith it was filled but being then unfurnished with such things as were necessary for my design i applied a button of vitriol to the opening of the artery and having filled the wound with lint and applied the other dressings necessary on such occasions i let him blood twice but in small quantities and gave him certain emulsions wherein were mixed some anodyne medicines to retard the motion of the blood i let two days pass without dressing but on the third i found all i had done was to no purpose at the place where the artery was opened there was a considerable and painful swelling the lint that filled the wound was heaved up with the pulsation and a bloody water came out which presaged the sudden return of the bleeding i caused prepare my troches of rose water gumdragant and vitriol with some good styptick water and two days after i took out all that which filled the wound i also took away the escar made by the vitriol and the fungus that was grown in the wound which i further dilated to give vent to the blood that had diffused it self through the flesh beyond the extent of the wound all this time i repressed the bleeding by the turnkey which i caused to be slackned to discover again the opening of the artery to which i applied two little troches supported by a small compress dipped in the styptick water i filled the cavity of the wound with dossels pretty hard and moistened in the same liquor then i took a large compress of three fingers breadth thick and a foot in length covered only with bole dissolved in vinegar this i applied along the artery even to the armpit and lastly an astringent plaster which i made fast with compresses and strong bandage i caused the arm to be laid on a pillow with the hand higher than the elbow two days after i untied the rollers and took off the compresses and the plaster and seeing things in a good condition i applied new astringents without touching the wound this method i continued two or three days afterward i begun to remove the dossels that were outmost sustaining always the others with new ones hindering also those which were next to the artery to fall off until the suppuration were begun that time might be given to the flesh to cover the artery the bleeding being very well stopped in effect about ten or eleven days after the application of these dressings all came off of its own accord not one drop of blood following for the artery was pretty well covered all this was done in presence of m davejan one of the physicians of the hospital a man of integrity merit and great skill finally the wound was in a little time completely cured  reflection these kinds of wounds where arteries are opened are of all others the most ticklish they give a great deal of trouble and but little reputation is gained by their cure every one knows that there was no place for the operation of the aneurisma where this artery was opened and that it was necessary either to cut off the member or to let the wounded person perish or to stop the bleeding by such means as i used by this we may see that it is not good to be too hasty in cutting off a member where arteries are opened that admit not the aneurisma that we ought not to dispond though our first attempts to stop the flux of blood prove unsuccessful and that the troches which i use are upon many accounts better than vitriol this is not the only time that i have experienced the success of this method in a like occasion i made some trials of the same at luserne in the year      and in particular upon a certain soldier who had the artery that is between the tibia and fibula opened after much trouble before i would condescend to the cutting off of the member i was willing to try this method which had also a very happy success that we may preserve a member we are to leave nothing undone neither ought we to consent to its amputation until first all other means have been in vain assayed  chap xxv of the hands observation xxiv since the beginning of the war i have had under cure very many whose hands were pierced torn or half carried away by such firearms as burst asunder which is a thing very ordinary in armies many others also have i dressed that had their hands shot through with bullets and cut with sharp instruments of which i shall not speak in particular  but i may say that all those i have dressed in these latter times though by the wounds the part has been very much shattered and torn have been always cured without losing what remained of the member and with little or no discharge of splinters of the bones or loss of fingers or their joints  in this kind of wounds as well as in others i have avoided frequent dressing and the use of putrefying medicines and i own that i have ever found the spirit of wine a very successful remedy in wounds of the extremities and in those of nervous parts i have used  it chiefly in hospitals where it brought always a speedy relief  many of the ancients have ordered to keep open for some considerable time the wounds of the nerves and tendons to give vent to such matter as by its stay might corrupt the substance of the parts  but experience has taught me that it is much more benificial to the wounded in such cases to hinder than to promote the suppuration by doing betimes what is necessary to prevent fluxions upon the part sometimes applying good defensives to the superior parts to repress the activity of the blood and some times using resolving anodines to the place afflicted if there is need to prevent or take off the pain from which most commonly the accidents proceed that attend such wounds and to stave off at the same time the attempts of the air which is the greatest enemy of the nervous parts  i can aver that by using this method i have cured such wounds much more suddenly than i could any other way i believe also seeing all are agreed that the air is pernicious to wounds in general that none will question but these of the nerves receive thereby a more notable prejudice than those of any other parts of the body considering their tenderness the nature of their substance and their temperament i leave it then to consideration whether wounds of this kind could be defended from the injuries of the air if they were kept open according to the opinion of the ancients  but it will be said that it is extremely difficult after all possible precaution to avoid the use of putrefying and irritating medicines and of dilaters in cures that are tedious for if such things as breed flesh and are balsamic be used when the wound at the same time must be keept open there will be a necessity of consuming incessantly the flesh with cathereticks which are very apt by the pain they cause to produce accidents especially in parts so sensible as these  now to this i say that if suppurating and putrefying medicines are used there almost ever infallibly follows a great suppuration and sometimes a total dissolution of the nervous and tendinous parts especially if tents or dilaters be also employed which if but for a small time they touch such parts do oftentimes draw on incurable and sometimes mortal symptoms  wherefore i have ever judged it best to close up the wound so soon as possible on such occasions chiefly when there is no extraneous body which of necessity must be drawn forth or if all requisite diligence has been already at first dressing used to that intent in fine though i have ever not only avoided with all possible care the using of putrefying things but also have endeavored to dress as seldom as might be i dare affirm that in this way of practice there never happened even the least accident to all that great number of wounded persons dressed according to it in our hospital at brianson  pareus book  0 chapter   shows that by this method he successfully cured the pricking of a tendon which king charles the ninth had received in bloodletting though in another place he exceedingly finds fault with those who use the stitch to wounded tendons he would undoubtedly have been of another mind had he lived and seen as i and many others have done how often the deceased m bienaise an expert surgeon has performed the same with success in his house at paris but after all we may maintain that he is not the first who has practiced the stitching of a tendon for in former times it was ordinary and many of the ancients have done it  chap xxvi of the thigh observation xxv in the year      when the vaudois were driven from the valleys of luserne one le grand a frenchman by birth sergeant in the regiment of guards and at present an officer in a regiment of fusileers belonging to his royal highness being wounded by a bullet in the upper and outward part of the right thigh and the ball not to be found was brought to the hospital at luserne  he had lain a day and a night helpless upon the ground which occasioned a considerable fluxion and an inflammation of the part i made large incisions and spared no pains to find the bullet but all in vain  he was forthwith let blood and had a clyster given him an exact course of diet being ordered the bleedings were repeated with the other remedies for withdrawing the humors from the part the swelling and inflammation were lessened and i began to think that things were in a pretty good condition i kept in the wound only a little tent about the length of two fingers breadth very soft and of pretty fine lint  thus the first accidents were vanquished but others more troublesome and more obstinate yet remained for the suppuration and flux of humors was so prodigiously great that i verily believed his whole body would thereby have been dissolved at every time we opened the wound to dress it which was twice a day more than a pint of matter came away besides what was discharged between dressings which might be judged as much in the mean time the strength of the wounded person was more and more impaired and his body insensibly wasted away  i could ascribe all these accidents to nothing else but the bullet which remained in the member and this i the rather inclined to think in regard that almost all the bullets that were drawn from wounds during this campaign were full of sublimat or glass and many others of other metals and tin  i advised with m conte then at luserne surgeon in ordinary to his royal highness who being acquainted with the order of cure and the symptoms was of opinion that by purging the moisture might be dried up this was accordingly put in practice  i was so eagerly desirous to effect this cure as if all my reputation had depended upon the success and indeed it appeared as if providence had thereby designed to open my eyes and to make use of me for the relief of many others being qualified for that end by the experience i therein attained  the wounded part was greatly disordered by the purging yea in such sort that i feared a gangreen the fever was increased and the patient had quitted all his hopes notwithstanding the assurance he had conceived of being cured under my hands  as for my self i began to despair although it is my humor never to give over my wounded patient so long as life continues for his thigh was all over livid and the spaces between the muscles yea all the member was filled and soaked with matter which every day increased the wound being as it were an inexhaustible fountain i considered with my self a thousand times if there was any thing more i could do or any thing further to be used i had performed all that art prescribes to dry up that matter wherewith the part was ever filled having used not only hard bandge with expulsive compresses to hinder its gathering together and abode in the part but also sudorifick decoctions though all in vain i was also thinking to make a counteropening under the thigh to give a more free course to the matter and to hinder its stay but on second thoughts i believed it would be to no purpose  m conte and generally all who saw the man despaired of his being cured and told me that i vexed my self in vain as if all my reputation had depended upon the cure  although i had hitherto assayed all sorts of means in vain yet i was obstinatly bent to find out some other way by my own consideration seeing the wounded person himself was also desperate  as i have formerly said i had hitherto kept in the wound a little tent about two fingers breadth long and very soft this i resolved altogether to lay aside and to dress the wound with a pledget and plaster only and such a bandage as might be sufficient to keep em on  this affrighted the poor dying man and it was with great difficulty that now i could obtain his consent to have that power over him which of right belonged to me and what formerly he had so freely granted  in the evening to my great surprise i found him in a much better condition the matter came not away in so great a quantity that night he slept much better than ever yet he had done since he received his wound and in the morning i found him yet better this evening the matter began to be of a good consistence and to be discharged in moderate quantity henceforth i dressed but once a day  his fever which had continued from the beginning left him altogether the second day after the leaving out of the tent and from the fourth he was dressed only once every other day he also began to eat and to recocover his strength from the eighth day nothing further came from the wound and on the twelfth after the disuse of the tent he was entirely cured to the truth of which i call god to witness  reflection this is the cure as i sincerely protest to which i have been most obliged it was this which made me embrace that method which now i expose to public view and which from this time forth succeeded so happily with me and it is certain that i had infallibly cured my patient at once of all his distempers if i had continued but only for seven or eight days to use a tent though never so small and soft  from this time forward i resolved to abandon the use of tents and to give my advice in this affair to the public when once an opportinuty should present it self i communicated my design to m thouvenot physician in ordinary and chief surgeon to their royal highnesses a man of great learning and experience to be esteemed as well for his profound knowledge as his eminent virtue and having related to him a description of the cure he confirmed me in my opinion  it was here therefore in the kings hospital settled at brianson that i drew out several observations which i had made and some accounts i had kept of many cures done in different times and places in order to make up a collection of them together with some others done in this hospital  but to return to the preceding cure it is convenient to observe that though the bullet was lodged in the member yet no disadvantage did thereupon ensue to the patient which made me think for a time that the bullet hitting upon the belly of some large muscle might have rebounded the same way by which it entered but i found my self out in my calculation for being at turin about a year and half after this cure i was sent for from the citadel where i stayed and when i came i found this same person whom i had cured of his wound who showed me a a little abscess that was formed upon the old scar i opened it without difficulty and perceiving something white and hard with my instrument i drew out the bullet which was flat with a piece of the thigh bone sticking to it the ulcer was quickly cured without any inconvenience and never more returned  had i at first dressing found out the bullet to the misfortune of the wounded person i should have been obliged by custom and the rules of our art to draw it forth though it had been as indeed it was sticking in such a part of the bone as was encompassed with greatest depth of flesh but for certain it could not have been got out with such ease or without pain and griveous irritations besides i question if the patient who was of a bilious constitution could have born up under so tedious and painful an operation seeing an infinite number of accidents had been occasioned only by the touches of a little and very soft tent wherefore i am persuaded and am bold to affirm that it is not always necessary to draw forth the bullet when it is lodged in a bone that lies deep under the flesh nature that is much wiser than we has more gentle and easy ways and best knows the time to free her self of what is hurtful to her  hippocrates in the fifth of his epidemicks relates that he drew forth the head of an arrow from the groin of a man after it remained six years in his body without any accident happening during all that time  alexander benedictus reports that a certain man was wounded in the back with an arrow the head whereof could not be got out being bearded and two fingers breadth in length which yet two months after the wound was cured the patient voided by stool  hildanus in his  th observation tells us that he took out the point of a knife which had remained two years among the acute processes of the verterbrae of the loins without producing any accident there  let us now therefore acknowledge that nature is wonderful in her operations these examples together with my own experience and reason have made me very cautious in drawing forth of bullets when they are not lodged in places where they may mar or quite destroy the action of any part nor in danger of falling into some cavity  this cure is of it self enough to convince any one of the advantage and to establish the credit of my practice it having been publicly performed yea authorized and approved by many learned physicians and skillful surgeons of the court of savoy  since that time i have in several places and in diverse hospitals cured many who have had their thighs pierced quite through without either tents or dilaters save only in the first dressing for supporting and containing the astringents necessary to stop the bleeding this is contrary to pareus his method who in the thirty seventh chapter of his tenth book of wounds affirms that wounds of the thighs and legs ought to be kept long open that the corrupted membranes may have time to suppurate and come away as if indeed nature that has brought solid bodies such as iron bullets bones etc to the orifice of wounds even after they have been a considerable time cicatrizd as has been formerly observed were not of sufficient power and sagacity to expel some shreds of corrupted membranes  but to avoid corrupting of the part the wounds must be speedily closed up tents and dilaters laid aside the air must be carefully excluded from the wounded parts great suppuratives must be cashiered and we must dress as quickly and as seldom as possible  chap xxvii of the knees observation xxvi in the year      when i was at pignerol a captain of a battalion of the kings regiment commanded by m de launay was wounded in the right knee with a bullet which went in at the outward and middle and came out at the inward and upper part thereof he was dressed for four whole months by a surgeon of the army very well skilled in his employment but who followed the common method he had also advised with the surgeon major of pignerol who had given over hopes of the cure the surgeon that had him under cure not thinking to make any long stay in this city proposed to me after so long a time to undertake the care of dressing him which i also did  i found five or six holes in his knee all of them filled with tents that were hard and long enough to reach to the bottom his leg and foot were swelled his body very thin and he had a slight fever which had never left him from the first time he received his wound with perpetual watchings and a loathing of all kind of food  i began to leave out all the tents and with a small incision at the lowest part hereof i dilated the wound i laid aside the aromatic wine that had been so long used o no purpose and left off the use of a certain njection which being applied twice a day y the intolerable pains it occasioned had angled all the joint and caused a communiation amongst all the holes which were exctly stopped with the fingers every time that medicine was employed that it might make some stay in the part  i dressed him indeed with the remedies that had been formerly used but i took care to apply them more conveniently and to accommodate em better to the nature of the part and of the wound  when i came to see him the day following so soon as he saw me he embraced me and swore in the presence of many officers that he was inexpressibly obliged to me and which was no less surprising than true he told me that he had slept all night though he had not done so since the first day of his wound that he felt no more pain in his knee and believed his fever was gone  he was so encouraged with this good success that from that time forth he thought himself cured for five or six days he was dressed after the same manner once a day and after that once every other day neither did i change the ointments and plasters which had been so long used before without any advantage the cure was completed in less than a month after which i advised him to go into his own country there to use the waters in order to strengthen the part that was weakened by the frequent dressing and if possible to enable him freely to extend it  reflection it appears by this cure that a good method is the most effectual remedy and the principal instrument in healing wounds if any man will but be at the pains to ponder this case i doubt not but he will be convinced that the tents the injection and the other humid things wherewith the part was perpetually moistened were the cause of the deplorable condition of the wound now if such a thing as it often falls out had happened to a common soldier under necessity of being sent to an hospital and treated in the common way he must have endured twenty deaths by the tedious and painful dressings yea it is certain that he could never have held up under them being at the same time deprived of all necessary conveniences breathing in an unhealthful and corrupted air and having food neither so nourishing nor given him at such seasonable times as a captain might who was willing to spare nothing that might conduce to the preservation of his life  the account i have given of this cure has nothing in it which is not exactly conformable to the truth the gentleman who was wounded himself made the same relation to m goiffons a very learned and experienced physician of lion and chief physician of the kings armies in italy  it is true the wounds of the joints require very great care there being few that are obnoxious to more troublesome accidents and when the part is much shattered they are judged mortal however i am very certain that great abuse is committed in the manner of dressing them and this i judged my self obliged not to conceal  the joints moreover are nervous or tendinous parts and are known to be of a cold and moist temperament wherefore they must be guarded from the attacks of the air they must not be exasperated by the touches of tents and dilaters putrefying medicines must be suppressed because they weaken the parts to which they are applied and ruin these that are nervous and tendinous  all these liquid things which are commonly used are also hurtful to the joints such as aromatic wine fomentations and injections etc such things as are heating and drying are profitable we must endeavor to hinder the waste of the spirits and seasonably to perform the necessary diversions observing a drying and slender diet and using to the wound sarcotick medicines such as balsams or spirit off wine avoiding also long and frequent dressings if this method is followed all these accidents which ordinarily accompany wounds of this nature will be prevented  fabricius ab aquapendnte in his first part book i chap    treating of wounds in the joints says that they are not only extremely hard to be cured but also dangerous and mortal and he adds that the cure is dangerous and difficult both in regard of their own essence and also of that of the joints for nature being the cause that produces flesh and fills up wounds is less vigorous in the joints which are cold in temper and destitute of blood and flesh than elsewhere especially when weakened yet further by a wound  afterward in the same chapter being supported by the authority of galen in his third book of fractures he affirms that whatever lies under the skin is advantaged by being covered therewith and considering that the joints are cold without blood and without flesh he says that their natural heat is soon extinguished especially when exposed to the cold of the air these were the thoughts of this author who was accustomed to use the stitch on such occasions to protect this kind of wounds from the injuries of the air  he further adds in the same chapter that wounds in the joints ought not to be left open or exposed to the cold air because thereby we run the hazard of quenching the natural heat and of a gangrene or if this should not fall out yet is there seldom seen any digestion in the wound when so treated  these parts then as has been said are naturally very weak destitute of heat and plentifully watered with moisture which by reason of the abounding salts is apt to contract an acrimony and malignity especially when it is retained in the part with tents now this same moisture insinuating it self into the pores of the nervous fibers fails not to harden them and render them callous from whence it comes that these wounds often end in fistulas it is observable also that if there happen any change or disorder in the blood this humor becomes so corrosive that it rots the bones and destroys the parts where it comes long and frequent dressing moreover occasion the like accidents because of the admission of the air that increases the force of the acids and easily destroys that small portion of spirits and heat with which these parts are furnished  all these things are of the greatest importance and well deserve our serious consideration and if reason in any thing ought to prevail over custom it is chiefly here where the life of mankind is concerned which is a thing so precious that it very well merits our most particular care  after all i am of the mind that the authority of so famous a person as fabricius ab aquapendente ought to give some reputation to my opinion but before i conclude this chapter i will moreover affirm that if wounds in the joints are hard to be cured and often degenerate into fistulas this is not so much owing to the weakness of these parts as to to the manner used by most part of surgeons in dressing them  chap xxviii of the leg observation xxvii one la grandeur who was of the guards of the marshall de catinat general of the kings forces in italy being at the siege of luxemburg in the year      had received a wound with the shiver of a granade in the left leg which left behind it an ulcer near the inward ankle that had baffled the care of the surgeons  this man being at pignerol about the beginning of the year      took a resolution to have his ulcer cured though it had been of a pretty long standing and was to him instead of an issue here he finds a surgeon pliant enough who without foreseeing what accidents might follow or considering the evil disposition of body and the bad constitution of the patient takes bim in hand dresses him and heals up this ulcer  but in a little time after he had ample occasion to repent the rashness of his undertaking for the impure humors of that unwholsom body which had taken their course that way not finding any outgate were by degrees gathered together in the member and by their stay arrived at a pitch of malignity sufficient to cause a gangrene  on the middle and inward part of the leg there arose a tumor or swelling which was forthwith taken by his surgeon who had very little understanding in such cases for a phlegmon whereupon without further deliberation he begins with bleeding which he repeated five or six times  the humor retained in the part not being able to come to a perfect concoction because of the defect of heat and spirits made its malignity appear and corrupted a great part of the leg the gangrene appeared and the surgeon made an opening in the highest part of the tumor from whence came forth a little foetial lympha but the disease increasing every moment both the patient and the surgeon were alarmed and sought out for some body to advise with about cutting off the member  i was ordered by the marquess of chamlay who was then at pignerol to go see him and to employ my utmost care to retrieve him if possible from that miserable condition i made incisions in his leg from the knee to the ancle on the inside and touched it with a very piercing spirit so far as the gangrene reached i ordered for the patient the strongest cordials not forgetting oriental bezoar and generous wine which i caused to be given him from time to time  three days passed over in spite of all i could do before a stop was put to the progress of the gangrene the unseasonable bleedings his diet his fever and the other evils with which he was oppressed had so impaired his strength that nothing could be hoped therefrom nevertheless i judged no way would be more compendious and effectual than that of sweat to withstand the evil n its principle and to ease nature overwhelmed with a world of impurities wherefore  did my endeavor to procure it and for that purpose made him take one evening a entle sudorifick  this remedy had all the success i could exect the patient sweated a little that night which forthwith put a stop to the course of  gangrene the escar came away but very slowly because of the weakness of the patient but when this was entirely separated another accident supervend which threw us into a new perplexity for a large tendon that had been altered by the gangrene and was wasted by the suppuration being joined to its original by a small portion only drew after it the matter and notwithstanding all our care formed a very considerable abscess under the joint of the knee which by increasing by little and little overspread all the hinder part of the thigh  i dilated the wound making a fresh incision wherein i put a very small dilater to hinder its closing up i used the dilater for seven or eight days in which time the matter increased the sinus was enlarged and the thigh swelled and became painful  i resolved then to find the most depending part that i might there make a counteropening whereby to give a passage to the humors and to hinder their abode in the part so i made a mark without upon the place i destined for that operation  nevertheless i was willing first to try all other means i could think on i begun to leave out the dilater which i had only kept between the lips of the wound not suffering it to pass into the cavity of the ulcer so i dressed the wound only with a pledget and a plaster and such a bandage as might keep them on  the next day very little matter came away and the day after that yet less the swelling and pain of the thigh were diminisht the large and deep sinus was filled up in four or five days thus the operation i designed was prevented and the patient cured in ten or twelve days after  reflection it is no wonder that very many able surgeons have been deceived without perceiving it in the too frequent use of tents and dilaters these fatal instruments seeing i who had bid them open difiance could not keep my self from a surprise and indeed he must be a capital enemy to em and have experienced their pernicious consequences who can imagine that a thing so small as this tent was could occasion such considerable accidents  i was much amazed at this event and confirmed thereby in my aversion for tents and dilaters resolving now to use more caution than ever if i should at any time be necessitated to use them  i willingly own that the collection of matter under the thigh was not occasioned by tents they are not always the cause of impostumations nor of the accidents that follow notwithstanding their use contributes much to delay the cure and to render the symptoms were obstinate as may be seen by the preceding cure for after the widening of the sore a free passage being given the matter would have been discharged insensibly and without intermission if it had not been hindered by the dilater which how little soever was yet sufficient to obstruct its passage  i hope then i shall not be thought without good reason to have done my endeavor to put down the use of tents seeing it is attended with such pernicious consequences it is easy to judge that if a little dilater about the bigness of a middlesizd bean was able to occasion such troublesome symptoms a long and thick one must have caused much more irritation and disorder if i had continued to use that extraneous body yet eight days longer it would have brought on a new mortification which at that time might have laid the patient in his grave considering the deplorable estate he was reduced to by his former distempers  chap xxix of another hurt in the leg observation xxviii in that same year when i was in the hospital of brianson there was brought thither a soldier of the colonels company in catinats regiment of foot who had both the bones of his left leg broken together with a wound two fingers breadth below the garter this accident befell him upon the works of the foresaid city  the lower part of the tibia came out at the wound and passed over its upper part two fingers breadth wherefore we were necessitated to make a vigorous extension before we could put all things in their right place we joined the lips of the wound and dressed with pledgets only having made an embrocation to dissolve a very considerable bruise to which we applied our diapalma dissolved two or three fingers breadth above the fracture we encompassed the member with a little roller using another in like manner below it the space between we filled up with double compresses dipped in wine or brandy under the leg we used a pastboard to hinder its bending at the fracture and over this the bandage with eighteen tails finally having made all fast with the juncks and their furniture diversions were made in due time and a course of diet ordered  by reason of the contusion we were forced to dress once a day which we did without undoing the rollers or giving any trouble to the member and when i saw the bruise begin to be dissipated from which i had feared some accidents he was dressed but once in two days on the twelfth day we took off the rollers that we might straiten them a little which we did in such a manner that the bones remained straight and unmoved the wound then had begun to fill up and there was not the least exfoliation nor separation of any bone  the wound was completely cured in nineteen or twenty days after which we used the rollers with splents and the juncks upon the place of the fracture  this patient was pretty fortunate in this that during the cure he had not felt the least disturbance or inconvenience notwithstanding of the unwholsomness of the beds in the hospitals of the army after forty days the juncks were laid aside and he began to walk with crutches and in a month after he returned to the regiment  reflection by this cure which was publicly performed it appears that it is not absolutely necessary to widen the wound in complicated fractures as some are of opinion for so soon as it is dilated the cavity is filled with matter that slides in between the broken bones and being once there it is impossible to bring it away or hinder its stay and thus it alters and rots the bone which it touches it dilutes and depraves the nutricious juice thereof mixing with it and rendering it unfit for breeding a callus finally it causes exfoliations and separations of bones from the extremities of the fracture and oftentimes sliding along the bone upon the periosteum produces abscesses and sinusses very hard to be cured  the patient all this time is in very great danger chiefly in an hospital where he is every day tormented once and often twice with long and painful dressing the part is weakened and the whole body wasted away besides it is observable that but few fractures that are accompanied with a wound are ever cured in hospitals especially when dressed according to the ordinary method and above all these of the thighs and legs where the wounded is confined to his bed are most seldom cured  among all the ancients that i have read i find none that more favors my method of treating complicated fractures than fabricius ab aquapendente for in his first part book   chap   and in many other places of his works he is not for dilating such kind of wounds but leaves the separation of bones to natures conduct and though he expect that some splinters of bones are to come away yet he fails not to stitch up the wound for says he nature will never cure a wound in that place where a bone is to be excluded wherefore we ought to endeavor to heal up such wounds which we shall not be able to effect unless nature judge it convenient and find that their remaining open would be unprofitable  chap xxx of a third wound in the leg observation xxix on the fifteenth of june school a mason called la pierre was sent from mont dauphin to the hospital at brainson who laboring on the fortifications of that place had the inner bone of his right leg broken about the middle with a wound six fingers breadth long and two in width this was one of the most considerable fractures that had come under our care in this hospital and yet one of these that were soonest cured  after we had reduced the fracture we joined the wound and dressed it with a good incarnative we fomented where it was necessary and put on the dressings in the manner above described we performed the usual diversions and left all untouched for three days we dressed it a second time after the same manner letting it alone again other three days in fine at the fourth dressing that is upon the twelfth day from the first dressing the wound was quite filled up and more than half skinned over wherefore straightway as gently as was possible we took off the bandage with eighteeen tails using instead thereof rollers with light and easy splents upon the fracture no accident happened during all the time in forty days space he was able to walk with sticks which also he laid aside soon after  reflection this wounded man was showed as a prodigy to all who came to the hospital though this cure had been the only one i had ever performed this way yet the success i had therein had been sufficient to convince me of the excellency of this method and to engage me to follow it during my life but seeing it is moreover supported and approved by authors and confirmed by many other cures of a like nature all the pretended reasons that may be brought against it will prove too weak to overthrow it and will be slighted by all men of good sense and lovers of the truth and whatsoever may be said in order to censure it will be so far from lessening its merit that it will rather heighten the esteem taereof  in the last part of this work where i treat of fractures that are attended with a wound i give some reasons further to justify this way of practice  chap xxxi another case whereby this way of dressing complicated fractures of the legs is confirmed observation xxx a soldier called la violette of the regiment of nivernois and company of bonal was brought to the kings hospital settled at the abbey of oulx on the first of may      he had two wounds upon the os sincipitis of the ight side with the bone uncovered all his face was bruised three of the true ribs on the same side were forced inwards he had many bruises on his body his right arm was out of joint and the hand all torn both his legs were broken and shattered the right one without a wound and the left with one all which havoc was caused by a fall from a very high rock near the barrier of the fort d exille  all his wounds were dressed but these of his head which were not observed till the next day his arm was reduced his right leg which was broken about three fingers breadth above the ancle was dressed with the circular bandage the left with that of eighteen tails the tibia was broken to pieces in the middle many of the splinters were out of their places being unloosd from the bone at one end and so could not he brought together and altogether set right in the first dressings the orifice of the wound was not large and we did not dilate it it bled indifferent much for the three or four first days i let the bleeding stay of it self without using astringents i let him blood many times both in regard of the contusions and fractures and also because of the forcing in of the ribs which occasioned a great difficulty of breathing i caused a hole to be made in the strawbed and clothes which was sowed round to afford him the convenience of going to stool without being removed it being impossible to touch him without putting him to grievous torments the wounds in the head were soon filled up without any apparent exfoliation the bruises in his face were removed his ribs were restored by means of sticking plasters and the difficulty of breathing continued but for six or seven days the dislocation of his arm and the wounds of his hand gave us no trouble the simple fracture though the bone was shattered was not followed with any accident the wound of the compound one was completely healed in eight or nine days after which we put little bolsters upon the protuberant pieces of the shattered bone tying them on with rollers which had so good success that at the next dressing no inequality was to be seen about the fortieth day after the receiving his fall he was able to stand up with crutches and his left leg that had the complicated fracture was stronger and more clever than the right that had the simple one only which was much admired by many  reflection this cure may be of excellent use to establish the credit of the others if there is any need thereof that which makes it remarkable is the two fractures of a different kind in the same person one of them being complicated which yet was soonest cured and the patient was able to use the leg wherein it was before the other m davejan and m michellet the kings physicians in this hospital knowing men and beyond all exception were witnesses of what i have here related and know that i have added nothing to the truth it is thought also that this is the first time that a complicated fracture was dressed after this manner in this hospital though it be of a pretty long standing these same gentlemen have oftentimes seen wounds no less considerable then these brought by the same method to a speedy and happy cure  i believe indeed that the strong constitution of the patient conduced much to the good success of the cure but it is no less true that the requisite diversions were not delayed whereby whatever might have occasioned troublesome accidents was removed moreover he was gently treated in dressing and the sores were not exasperated so that in the first days he felt but a very slight pain he rested well and was able to take with much ease such food as was proper for him  you will very seldom see a wounded person in so deplorable a condition as this man was all the parts of his body were either wounded or bruised had but any accident followed death had been unavoidable and our care in vain and if the dissolvents and diaphoreticks had not unloaded the parts promoting the circulation of the blood and course of the humors by a gentle and insensible transpiration i doubt the event had neither been so sudden nor so desirable  it is well known that in practice there is a great difference made between fractures not accompanied with a wound and those that are in many places the latter are accounted very hard to be cured and often are judged incurable especially those of the lower extremities that indispensibly oblige the patient to keep his bed  i dont question but very many especially the admirers of antiquity will find fault with this method and reject my rules but let them with all my heart charitably oblige the public with more easy and more sure ways and confirm them with unquestionable experience and i promise them to be among the first that shall embrace their party  chap xxxii of the feet observation xxxi upon the   th of june of the same year      an irish gentleman called john donoughal nephew to lieutenant colonel athlone was brought to the hospital of brianson having been wounded at an action in the valley of barcelonetta he was shot into the right foot and the bullet entering on the upper and foremost part of the metatarsus toward the side was lodged between two bones of the same part  a surgeon upon the spot did whatever he could to draw out the bullet by the same way it entered but his endeavors proved fruitless  the first day that i dressed it after i had considered the wound and observed the way of the bullet i found it could not be got out unless a counteropening were made which accordingly was done at the middle and hinder part of the metatarsus and the bullet was drawn out with very little pain  the wounds were dressed according to our method with embrocations over all the part diversions were not omitted and he was dressed but once a day with our simple remedies and the plaster of dissolved diapalma  the escar being separated no great suppuration ensued no bones came away at least that we could observe henceforth he was dressed but every other day and was cured in thirty days or thereabouts after which time he returned on foot to his regiment  reflection it is almost universally known that wounds of the extremities accompanied with a fracture are tedious and troublesome to be cured the tendons and nerves that here abound make these parts of a quick sense and render the wounds therein obnoxious to grievous accidents therefore it is that they require to be dressed with much gentleness and remedies particularly suited to em i have elsewhere remarked that tents and putrefying medicines are extremely hurtful to nervous and tendinous parts wherefore i shall speak no more of them i shall only here take notice that some prepossest persons have had the confidence to say that this way of dressing so gentle and so easy has something of rashness in it that it is very dangerous to omit the circumstances observed by the ancients that their rules were not laid down without good reason and that their method in fine ought to be put in practice among the soldiers though reason and experience are both on my side yet i am ready further to maintain that this method has nothing of temerity in it seeing it follows the footsteps of nature which ought ever to be our guide in the curing of wounds we can never go astray if we follow her conduct and if we swerve from her paths we cannot but fall headlong into dangers  mereover it is no less necessary to be an able surgeon and expert in practice in order to manage a cure according to this method that appears so easy than according to the common way of practice which is full of so many circumstances that are ever unprofitable and oftentimes pernicious and we may reasonably presume if our method has been so successful when practiced on soldiers dieted and dressed in an hospital where the air is oftentimes infected that it will yet be much more so when used toward patients who have all the conveniences of life and who breath in a pure air  caap xxxiii of the feet observation xxxii when i was at luserne in the year      a soldier of the trainedbands was brought to the hospital there who had received a shot in his right foot that was pretty remarkable for the way of the bullet which was of a very small size it entered at the inward and middle part of the great toe and came out at the end of the little one no excoriation appearing either above or below  the first and second bones of the great toe were broken the second of the three next were entirely crushed to pieces and the last of the little toe in like manner  when we parted the toes one from another a great many little pieces of bones were to be seen which seemed only to hang by a thread i first set to rights every bone by it self and afterward set them in order one with another between every toe and its fellow i gently slipped in a little piece of linen dipped in spirit of wine and i made small compresses pretty hard and longish which i put above and under the toes in form of splents being wet also with spirit of wine i wrapped all up in linen without ointments or plasters and supported the foot with a sole sustaining all with an easy bandage  i took off the dressings after two days and without removing the little pieces of linen between the toes i fomented all the part with spirit of wine and dressed it as before the suppuration was but very small and indeed it was with design to prevent it that i used nothing but the spirit of wine which was the only remedy i employed to complete the cure this was effected in about three weeks time without the coming away of the least bit of the bones though they had been entirely shattered to pieces  reflection all experience assures us that it is nature and a good method that effect the cure and not at all either the great labor or vast charges bestowed upon it if i had used in this case the ordinary ointments and putrefying medicines they would have occasioned a plentiful suppuration whereby the splinters of the bones had been loosened and brought away the cure had been delayed and possibly the toes lost which had been enough to render the patient lame for all his life  though this cure is not of great consequence yet the conduct therein used may suffice to show that the bones do easily enough reunite when they enjoy the necessary repose when the air has no time to alter them or to exert its efficacy in the wound and when the use of suppurative remedies is laid aside which are ever hurtful as has been above observed and i will here add as to the last mentioned medicines i know no kind of wound in what part of the body soever that does absolutely stand in need of them  but lest i should weary my reader with unprofitable repetitions i shall content my self with having described the two preceding cures of wounds in the feet though in this hospital we have had a great number of this nature through our hands that have had a most happy and comfortable event  chap xxxiv the conclusion of the second part if my weak reasonings and the authorities i have adducd together with the experiences which i have faithfully related shall not prove sufficient to convince some persons of the excellency of my method i have only one request to make to such as shall withold their approbation which is that they would make a trial thereof themselves  i could have recited a very great number of cures like unto these contained in this second part i could have described the cures i have performed on wounded persons in my travels or in the army where occasions of this nature daily present themselves because of the actions that ordinarily fall out such are those of the valley of barcelonetta and the battle of marseills fought oct        but this would have been for the most part to say the same things over and over again all these cures being managed well nigh after the same way  i suppose it will be easily enough believed that i could have enlarged the bulk of this volume with many other observations seeing it is a truth that in four years time wherein i have been in this place more than three thousand persons have gone from it completely cured  some there are who not being able to discover the genuin cause of the desirable success that has attended the cures done in this hospital and willing to blast the reputation of a method to which only they were owing have attributed all to chance and have given out that we have been accompanied with an extraordinary good fortune as if forsooth the curing of wounds were like a game at cards or throwing of dice or as if blind chance had any thing to do where experience and good conduct are so indispensibly necessary  i have hitherto only treated of such wounds as were very considerable and were almost all somewhat complicated from whence i hope it will be believed that simple wounds wherewith i was unwilling to fill up this part were cured after this method with much more speed and ease than those here related  it may possible be thought strange that in certain cures of single sentinels described in this second part i have declared that i used on different occasions the balsam of peru which is scarcely probable considering the place and the condition of the persons this i own and do nevertheless aver that i have said nothing but the truth but when it is considered that his royal highness the duke of savoy sent his apothecary to luserne with orders to supply himself from thence with whatever was most precious and to furnish a most complete shop of medicines for the hospital of that place what i have said will easily be believed seeing not only that remedy but also pearls bezoar and the most costly cordials were bought up and used freely and without distinction  the hospitalsurgeon or a new gentle and easy way to cure speedily all sorts of wounds part iii exhibiting a general view of the authors new way of practice not only with respect to wounds but in other cases belonging to surgery and a description of the simple remedies he uses with some observations  chap i the design of this part and what it contains although in the preceding parts of this book where i declare the advantages and excellency of this way confirming the same by reason authority and manifold experiences i have sufficiently made known my practice with relation to wounds yet because it is there delivered without any method and with frequent interruptions being interwoven with my reasonings and observations i shall for the ease and advantage of my reader but especially of the young surgeon in this third part give a general prospect as it were at once of all the parts of my practice and that not only in what concerns wounds to which i principally confined my self in the two former parts but also in other cases that fall under the surgeons care  i will likewise here ingenuously and without reserve give a description of the simple and easy remedies which i have used as well in the cure of wounds as in that of other distempers that come within the jurisdiction of surgery the happy and comfortable effects that i have so frequently seen produced by them is enough in my opinion to recommend them to the esteem and use of the wise and unprejudicated artist and who heartily designs the good of such of his fellow creatures as fly to him for a refuge in their distress  finally i will as i go along deliver some observations very instructive and useful to illustrat and confirm the subjects for the sake of which they are adducd to which when necessary reflections shall be subjoined i shall begin with tumors and abscesses  chap ii of tumors and abscesses monsieur bertrand a physician of marseils in his new reflections upon acid and alkali gives in few words a very clear and exact notion of the nature of tumors but seeing i am confined by my proposed design only to declare my practice with respect to them those who desire to search into their causes and examine their differences must consult such authors as have written upon them  the moderns are not well agreed with the ancients in this matter for since the circulation of the blood has been found out the true causes of many accidents that fall out in the cure of tumors have been discovered which the ancients explained in a manner altogether different  wherefore seeing a disease after its nature is understood is easy to be cured if one brings but a little application of mind the young surgeon will do well to search into the causes of tumors in the works of the moderns where also he will find suitable remedies etmullerus in his medicinal surgery describes a great number of very proper medicines as also m verdue in his book called pathalogie de chirurgie  this only i will say by the by that the tumors that are accompanied with inflammation such as a phlegmon and an erysipelas have more need of dissolving than repercussive medicines i was confirmed by experience in his opinion and the truth thereof at this day is not doubted though yet it is contrary to the rules of the ancients for a phlegmon proceeding from an internal cause according to the moderns is nothing else but an obstruction of the vessels and that from an external cause may be accounted of the same nature this accident does very commonly happen in gunshotwounds under which head we will speak a word or two thereof  according to these principles resolvents are absolutely necessary in order to fulfill the first intention which is to dissolve or to cause transpire the accumulated humor  an erysipelas according to these same moderns is caused by a subtle and volatile acid diffused over the skin or the muscles dissolving medicines are also proper in this disease spirit of wine prepared with camphire the sugar of lead or eldervinegar may be used  the accidents that follow upon a great erysipelas are frightful and violent i remember that when i was at luserne a certain person who had a fever was seized with a like distemper it reached from the middle of the thigh to the heel he was not so wise as to give us notice of it in time but kept the whole part out of the bed for a whole night in a pretty cold season which caused such a repercussion that on the morrow all the part was gangrened and all our care and diligence could not prevent its entire mortification for in a very little time the gangrene turned to a sphacelus before he died the one half of his body was entirely corrupted and putrified i never saw so dreadful a sight or smelt so intolerable a smell for not only the hospital but even the whole city was in danger of being infected thereby when he was yet alive  when an erysipelas will not yield to dissolving remedies we ought without delay to have recourse to scarification of the whole part to give a passage to the blood and moreover we should foment the whole part with spirit of wine prepared with camphire or some other spirituous and piercing liquor vinegar wherein sal ammoniac is dissolved or common salt when that is wanting may also be used notwithstanding it is not to be thought that repelling medicines are altogether to be laid aside only it is fit we know how to use them in suitable occasions  in the year      m dechamp then commander of the third battallion of sault but now lieutenant colonel of the same regiment having an erysipelas in his leg had been treatted with the dissolving remedies prescribed by the moderns for three weeks time without perceiving any advantage thereby whereupon he caused himself to be brought to this town that he might be under my care and being informed by him of what remedies had been used i thought fit to apply repercussives and in eight days after he departed being entirely cured in order to a prudent use of remedies the age and the constitution of the patient the season of the year and the nature of the part affected are duly to be considered but i shall not further insist upon a subject from which i hasten  now as for abscesses of all sorts which have come under our hands in this hospital and have been cured with an expedition that may appear incredible i will only say this that judging it sufficient to make a large opening in them i left the rest to the sage conduct of nature not forgetting however general remedies and the ordering of diet but as for the dressing of the ulcer i only used a simple pledget covered with the most common medicines and sometimes in case of a cavity small compresses for expelling the humor also a plaster with a bandage sufficient to keep it on  the great number of those who have been treated in this hospital according to this method and cured in a very small time is almost wholly beyond belief  when the orifice is not stopped up with an extraneous body it is evident that the matter can make no stay in the parts but will come away without intermission and the parts that were thereby kept at some distance from one another come together and at the same time do altogether expel what may there be contained and leave no empty space for the collection or abode of what is useless and inconvenient hence the parts are united nature acts at her freedom whose balsam generates flesh better than all the remedies in pharmacy  i hope i may presume that none will think i would have continued in the use of this method for so long time had i not experienced its desirable effects in a thousand occasions and i could safely take my oath that never any the least accident happened to any of those who were dressed after this manner every one may believe as he thinks good of what i say but i dare aver that i am much more careful that what i say should be true than that it should be persuasive  as for scrophulous tumors or a bronchocele i have not found any remedy so successful as mercury and i believe in the opinion i have of it i am not singular the many experiences i have had thereof make me much to value it he that well understands the cause and nature of these evils and withal the virtues and uses of the remedy whereof i speak will agree with me that this only can effect a complete cure but all consists in the discreet using thereof the best of remedies and the most exquisite instruments are ever dangerous when managed by surgeons that are void of knowledge and experience i may possibly one day make known to the public the way which i have successfully used to bring to a perfect cure a great number of such maladies as i now speak of and these the most obstinate and inveterate of their kind  chap iii of a gangrene a gangrene is an accident that occasions very much trouble in the hospitals of the army i shall say nothing of its causes m thevenin has fully treated of this matter and m causape in his book of fevers has given a brief discourse thereon upon different principles young surgeons may betake themselves to the reading of them for their instruction herein  wherefore omitting this i say that here we have no time to lose but must immediately apply our selves to stop its progress and to avoid the fatal consequences when the great vessels are thereby entirely intercepted in a member that may be cut off the best way is to come speedily to operation without attending a sphacelus for the gangrene goes on so swiftly in a small time that the sound parts care assaulted before ever we can well know what we are a doing  a gangrene often happens in gunshot wounds if it is not prevented as also in bruises in wounds made by cutting or bruising instruments and also after a great phlegmon or an erysipelas and sometimes by an extremity of cold this last kind is very frequent about the end of campains the remedy we used was spirit of niter or aqua fortis wherein crude mercury to half the quantity is dissolved with this we have easily enough stopped mortifications in the feet or hands applying over all the extent of the gaegrene a little piece of linen wet in this liquor and when this cannot be had other spirits may be used that are near of the same quality  this remedy i have found to be so gentle and so quick in its operation that i never use any other in any sort of gangrene it admirably well separates what is dead from what is alive without scarifying or cutting unless when the mischief lies very deep where these violent remedies are absolutely necessary  cordials and wine ought never to be omitmitted in such cases to fortify and defend the natural heat from an enemy that oftentimes assaults it in its very principle when the body is plethorick bleeding and clysters are no small help in the beginning of a gangrene to topical remedies diversions may be added without forgetting to order the course of diet which also demands our particular care so soon as i have discovered a disposition to mortification i have sometimes used cataplasms and emplasticks when the inflammation would allow to recall the spirits and to give nature time and strength to resist and to overcome by the force of the heat concentrated the matter already endowed with a malignant quality or just ready to become such and i have often seen such kind of maladies to end happily in an abscess with a laudable concoction  when a phlegmon that follows on a wound is violent and obstinate and will not yield to diversions and dissolving medicines we must without delay scarifie the part so far as the tumor reaches to give an outlet to the blood that is extravasated and often also corrupted and to discharge and relieve the part that otherwise might be suffocated by the fullness and obstruction bathing is afterward with spirit of wine and sal ammoniac for if we be remiss in our care the enemy that is concealed within is privately at work and when the outward signs of the gangrene appear all that is under the teguments is often found already corrupted and in irremedible disorder  an erysipelas is yet more formidable for it is more sudden and more nimble in its operation it is the part of a prudent surgeon to take heed to it in time a fomentation with spirit of wine vnguentum egyptiacum and sal ammoniac may be used  many authors have described a great number of remedies very proper in the cure of gangrenes but in the hospitals of the army there is not always the convenience of making a choice wherefore it is good to know how to use such as are simple and easy to be found it is not always the most pompous compositions that are of greatest efficacy  in this sort of distempers it is very necessary to make use of inward remedies as well as topical ones such as strong cordials venice treacle confection of hyacinth and alkermes and alexpharmicks to which a little camphire may be added wine ought to be numbered amongst the cordials it is one of these which i very frequently use in hospitals germander taken inwardly and applied outwardly upon the grangrene is a remedy not to be dispisd  a great many remedies very proper for a grangrene may be seen in etmullerus he has also given an account of the way used by the germans to separate the mortified from the sound parts which is done with the butter of antimony this is the remedy they use in the amputation of members to avoid the use of the dismembring knife and of astringents that burn and cauterize  this remedy might be used with the same success as the spirit of nitre which i have spoken of before there is no difference providing we have regard to their nature in using em but whither the one or tother be used to stop a gangrene a simple digestive will afterward be sufficient to hasten the falling of the escar and finish the cure  chap iv of ruptures rvptures are very frequent amongst the soldiers the toil they undergo and their manner of life do alike conduce to bring them to that miserable condition by reason of which there is often a necessity to send them to hospitals  my design in this place is only to give an account of the way i use to help this sort of distemper for i am convinced and no body doubts of it that a truss is the most sure and most infallible remedy to hinder the falling down of the guts but as there is no convenience for making of them in hospitals so accidents must be quickly provided for that come oftentimes all of a sudden such as the descent of the intestins into the scrotum for the pains are then extremely violent and so grievous that they resemble those of the passio iliaca  wherefore in such an occasion i apply a cataplasm of oxdung or else when i may have it so i use it fried in oil of hemp seed or in that of violets this remedy eases the pain by dispelling the wind and so gives liberty to restore the gut unto its place providing the intestine is without excrementitious matter in it astringents of the first rank may also be used as common bole etc mixed with the glair of an egg or vinegar some use emollients but their operation is to slow in a case requiring such have  i have often found much advantage from a fomentation made up of pomgranate flowers nutgalls cypress nuts pomegranaterind allom camomil and melilot flowers with common salt all bruised and beaten and boiled in forgewater or in rough wine i use it very warm all together without straining the liquor with this remedy i have restored prtients who seemed to be upon the very blink of death moreover the emplastrum pro hernia ought to be applied upon the dilatation of the peritonaeum which without a truss the best of all remedies will do no great feats  chap v of wounds i have sufficiently explained my method as to what concerns wounds in the account of cures contained in my second part my design is here for reasons mentioned at the beginning of this part to entertain my reader with a general and comprehensive idea of my way of practice that may quadrat to all the different sorts of wounds that occur  perhaps this method may seem to swerve a little from that of the ancients or may not agree so much with that in use amongst the most part of the moderns as some could desire but i would entreat those who shall read this treatise not to condemn it before they have thoroughly examined the truth of the matters of fact and the reasonableness of the rules therein laid down for our usual rashness in judging of what we dont altogether understand is often the cause of our error however i am in good hopes that ere it be long this way shall be acknowledged to be the product of experience and its evidence to be an infallible mark of its truth  moreover i dare confidently affirm that this method howsoever new it may appear to many ought not to be numbered among these things that are more curious than profitable reason speaks for it nature vouches it experience confirms it putting it beyond all doubt and about three thousand wounded persons happily cured by it may warrant any one in the use thereof in the first and second part of this work i explain at length the reasons that justify my practice and support them with several authorities both of the ancients and moderns  if i condemn tents as instruments unprofitable and destructive twas experience that convinced me of their mischief and i hope henceforward very many surgeons shall range themselves on my side  if i recommend in a special manner a gentle and speedy way of dressing i must herein be justified by all men of a sound understanding and indeed i dont question but every reasonable person after he has been rightly informed will sufficiently approve what i have advanced in this matter  finally in asserting that the air is hurtful to wounds i have said nothing but what hippocrates galen and many others were sufficiently convinced of it is known to all that the cold piercing air is very pernicious to our nature on this i have enlarged a little in the seventh chapter of the first part suitable to that little measure of understanding wherewith i am endowed  i suppress frequent dressing that nature may be allowed time to act and to restore the wounded parts unto their first condition which she cannot do when she is so often interrupted in her work  i have ever observed this as a general rule to dilate by making incisions gunshot wounds at the first dressing as also all other penetrating wounds and such as have a narrow orifice this is the true way to keep off and to avoid the most part of accidents that happen in practice and to prevent being reproached when any troublesome symptom falls out i sometimes use dilaters in the first dressing to hinder the union of new incisions to keep their brims asunder and to leave an open passage for matter or any thing else to come away when nature shall be disposed to expel em otherwise i use them not lest i should hinder the closing up of the wound  when the bleeding is obstinate i use calcined vitriol astringent pouders powder of the vine styptick waters etc it is only in desperate cases that i have recourse to roman vitriol aqua fortis and the actual cautery  i have ever in the first dressings found much advantage from defensives which i applied above and sometimes below the wound to allay the heat of the blood to moderate its activity and resist fluxions observing always to make them somewhat emplastick  i am always careful to empty the lower belly by clysters having found that the retaining of the excrements is ever a mighty hindrance to the good disposition of the body  when the bleeding has been great i dont take off the first dressings till the second or third day after they are applied that the wounded vessels may have time to unite and providing the season and the pain or other accidents dont hinder i every day take off the roulers during that time and leaving only that which supports and keeps on the astringents i make embrocations when needful and renew the defensives by this means i often avoid the suffocation that may happen if the astringent and emplastick medicines are too long kept on the parts which by stopping up the pores of the skin and retaining the vapors that ought perpetually to pass out thereby are the occasion of many very grievous accidents that happen to wounds too great a quantity of bands and compresses has often the same effect  i use only pledgets after the first and sometimes after the second dressing and continue the embrocations till the contusion is dissolved which may be in five or six days more or less according to the bigness and condition thereof or to the nature of the affected part  when a phlegmon or an erysipelas etc happens to a wound i avoid the use of unctuous things which are hurtful here employing only such cataplasms as are proper for easing pain and sometimes also dissolving medicines which together with diversions and a proper course of diet resist and overcome these accidents  i find it very profitable when i dress the wound to cover it with a linen cloth wet with warm wine or brandy immediately after i have taken off the dressings this defends strengthens quickens and unites the spirits and hinders the particles of the air and the effluvia therein to stick to the wounds or pass to their bottom  after the first dressing is over i never search the wound either with my finger or probe unless there is an absolute necessity thereof i also disallow the use of dry tents so commonly employed for drying up the matter from the very bottom of wounds and and generally every thing that may irritate or occasion pain or may oppose the design of nature which is the healing up of the wound  i dont as some do take up a deal of time in striving exactly to empty the wound of all the matter that is in it but as quickly as can be i apply the dressings to hinder as has been said the action of the acid parts of the air and the dissipation of the spirits that the strength of the afflicted parts may be preserved as much as possible which is very requisite in order to enable them to bear up against them any evils wherewith they are assaulted on all hands  when i say in the fifth chapter of the first part that the matter ought not to be retained in wounds and that nature would not be at such pains to drive it out if she could have any advantage by its stay this is to be understood of such matter as is kept in by means of tents which becomes hot and ferments and by its abode acquires an evil quality and might be sucked up by the veins for that which is laudable is hurtful only by accident being of its own nature balsamic because it is ever mixed with good store of the natural balsam or nutriious juice which without intermission flows into the wounded parts what i say is confirmed by that which is done in some places of holland where of the laudable matter that runs from wounds they make a balsam that is of great use in their cure  it is not at all improbable that the sound matter that comes from wounds may promote their cure when by the hand and diligence of a skilful artist it is purified and separated from its excrementitions parts for what remains is only the balsam of the blood this will be more easily conceived by those that consider that there are some learned and ingenious italians who cure the bludyflux with a salt drawn from the excrements of the patient and also such as have a dropsy with the salt of the waters that are drawn from their belly etmullerus also very much commends the excrement of the ears for curing wounds  all these things contain less balsamic juice than the matter that runs from wounds when it is not altered by the heat of an essential or symptomatick fever when it has not remained long in the wound being detained there by tents etc or in fine when it is not depraved by the use of putrefying medicines or others of a like sort that destroy its natural temperament  m verdue tom   page   0 speaks very patly to this purpose when he says that matter is the chilous part of the blood wherefore it is against all manner of reason that some moderns require that the wound be accuratly wiped dry seeing thereby it is deprived of that which only can effect the cure  when i know or am in doubt that there is some extraneous body in a wound which nature would exclude by the orifice or that any splinter is separated from a bone without having to do with tents i sufficiently dilate the wound with prepared sponge or the pith of elder or gentian root fitted for that purpose that a free passage may be given to any thing that must come away this way is understood by every surgeon and there is no difficulty therein providing one be careful to use it seasonably  i cannot restrain my self from highly blaming those who very patiently marshal up in order a great number of dossels or dilaters of which they make three or four lays in wounds that are any thing large observing a certain symmetry and proportion which exposes to the view of assistants a method no less pernicious than contrary to common sense and reason as for the decency and seemliness which adorn and set off that way it will be no less conspicuous in making large pledgets of long and pretty fine lint that may at once reach over all the extent of the wound  i my self have experienced what a fond opinion is commonly entertained of that cruel method for the greatest part of wounded persons believe themselves neglected if an hour is not spent in searching their wounds and as much in applying the dressings but charity obliges us to free them from their error  when a wound is deep with much loss of substance i fill it only with pledgets of fine lint left leaving an empty space it should be filled up with air i apply them very slightly covered or moistened with some medicine agreeable to the nature and quality of the wound these are not so hard as dossels and consequently occasion less pain and dont so much hinder the closing up of the wound being not so compact as to hinder the breeding of flesh neither are they so apt as tents to be lost in the wound or fixed in some corner of its cavity  i am no less careful to suppress injections than tents having observed their effects to be no less pernicious for they liquefy and dissolve the blood enlarge the wound cause pain and make proud flesh to grow  i disallow the use of aromatic wines in dressing as also of fomentations that are frequently used by some which conduce very much to the protracting of the cure  it is very sure that these parts drink up the moisture which softens relaxes and puffs up the skin and passing through it fills them like spunges the natural heat of the afflicted parts is thereby suffocated and extinguished no perfect concoction can be performed but all is turned to matter and corruption and if this method is long continued as it too often falls out the ligaments are relaxed and the patient is in danger of being lame for all the rest of his life  this way of practice is in a particular manner pernicious in hospitals of the army where that which is necessary to give remedies all the required qualities is not always to be had for instance how can they be kept warm without a sufficient number of clothes to preserve the patient from the cold hence it is that in a moment after application all the dressings become cold and frozen which occasions oedemas very hard to be cured and oftentimes also symptoms that are yet more troublesome  a right course of diet is so neeessary in curing of wounds that without it an infinite number of accidents cannot be prevented but it is necessary to have respect to the age and constitution of the patient to his habit of body to the season of the year and the nature of the wound  it is to be observed that a very exact diet is a mighty hindrance to the cure of wounds in soldiers who ordinarily feel more the inconveniences of a too scanty than those of a too plentiful table wherefore i dont altogether deprive em of the use of substantial food unless when necessity requires otherwise and this keeps up their strength for broths though good are not so nourishing in hospitals as to be sufficient of themselves for food and yet this is no prejudice to the necessary diversions wine also ought not to be kept from them being allayed a little unless in some very important cases it resists the ill quality and malignity of the air which is always impure in hospitals and in a word wine is their cordial and counterpoison  it is very necessary also especially in hospitals of the army to have regard to the situation of the wounded part which ought to be such as to give liberty to the circulation of the blood and a descent to the matter and ease to the patient i have known the neglect of this point occasion very troublesome symptoms  if a surgeon is not so charitable as to give instructions to those that attend the wounded how to make their beds suitable to the quality and nature of their wounds the miserable patients are ever in pain by the inconvenient position which is enough of it self to deprive them of the rest that is so necessary for em and to render their sufferings and our cares to no purpose  the head ought to be placed indifferently high and laid upon something that is soft without feathers if it may be had with a descent to promote the discharge of the matter when the neck is wounded it must be in a manner slightly supported by the pillow or by linen folded into several doubles we must fill up the empty space between the head and shoulders  wounds of the breast require an easy and unstraind posture rather high than low but in this we must have most regard to the convenience of the wounded person  these of the lower belly and loins demand almost the same situation to these of the bladder and genital parts an undisturbed repose a convenient bandage which is a suspensory and a position somewhat raised are very needful  every body knows that the arm when wounded must be supported by a sling that passes over the neck and that in wounds and fractures of the shoulder bone a pillow is necessary to keep it almost as high as the breast in which posture it is most at ease in wounds or fractures of the wrist metacarpus and fingers we must keep the hand extended with a piece of board  wounds of the thighs require that the member be placed straight neither too high nor too low these of the legs and feet do necessarily demand that the part be something high that so the courser blood may freely circulate for otherwise the blood by its weight might be stopped in the veins and corrupted there and thus the circulation being suppressed many grievous accidents would ensue this hanging or low position of the legs not being minded by many surgeons exceedingly conduces to render wounds of these and the feet very uneasy to be cured and makes em degenerate into ulcers  it is also very necessary to stretch out the legs and keep them straight during the cure otherwise it will be difficult to restore them to their natural figure after it is over chiefly if it has been of some continuance as supposing the leg had been kept bent when under cure of a complicated or simple fracture this is what i have often observed and to which young surgeons would do well to take heed fractures of the tibia and fibula and simple wounds in the legs if any thing considerable stand in need of a sole to sustain the foot as well as these of the tarsus metatarsus and toes  too strait bandage especially in gunshotwounds occasions troublesome accidents it hinders the circulation and causes frequently mortifications wherefore i use only such as may keep on the dressings chiefly in the first days many have been brought wounded to this hospital with the parts half gangrened by too tight tying for in gunshot wounds the wounded members ever swell some more some less whereby the bandage though but moderatly strait becomes intolerable before the next dressing rest also is of no less consequence to the patient now where all these things meet together and are rightly ordered they are commonly of very great advanto the wounded  i use purgatives with great caution and after the time of the most dangerous symptoms is over beginning ever with the slightest that only loosen such as cassia and manna etc during which time clysters together with the use of prunes give no small relief oats and cleansed barley being easily digested and yiedling a moderate nourishment qualify the preternatural heat of the blood and keep open the belly  as for the topical remedies which i commonly employ in dressing of wounds they have nothing singular in them which is not pretty well known to the most part of surgeons  i avoid as much as possible the use of putrefying medicines and of powerful suppuratives because they destroy the temperament of the parts disunite the particles of the blood corrupt and deprave the nutricious juice which ought carefully to be preserved in a good condition it is this which moved the ancients so often to recommend to us to maintain the wounded parts in their natural temper  hippocrates affirms that all contused wounds ought to be brought to suppuration in order to a speedy cure whereby he seems to patronize and allow the use of putrefying medicines which commonly are employed to bring a wound to suppuration but me thinks this ought not to take place in the hospitals of the army where the air is ordinarily infected by the breath and abode of the sick and which are almost ever encompassed with the graves of the dead whose number is but too great  it is very certain that this nearness of the place of burying chiefly in hot seasons imparts to the air by the steams that rise from thence a complication of corruption and ill qualities that occasions rottenness in wounds alteration and great suppuration and often causes great mortality in the hospitals and places adjacent now according to this maxim of that author gunshot wounds must be dressed with these same medicines seeing they are of the number of contused ones  i dont absolutely deny but there may be some occasions wherein such may be used however i may be allowed to say with all the respect i owe so celebrated an author that in hospitals we ought to shun as much as possible putrefying and suppurative remedies and others of a like nature even where the escar may require a considerable time before its falling for by the seasonable ordering of diversions and the course of diet all these accidents are often prevented which the delay of the suppuration might cause and one may without scruple use as i have done such remedies as have a virtue to resist corruption as the spirit of wine which etmullerus prescribes even in gunshot wounds and which i used at the first dressing on the day of the battle of marseils without having observed any evil consequence of my so doing for besides a good method which may be called the strength and chief instrument of a workman it is of high concern to understand and to know how to choose remedies that agree with the temper of the parts to which they are applied and to maintain them in that state wherein god has created them but it proves often a very difficulty task to satisfy this intention  as there is an admirable variety of constitutions so it would seem that it were necessary to use different remedies to wounds of the same nature and of the same parts in different subjects the sex age and season must also be considered i have likewise observed in my travels by people of different nations that have been under my hands that diverse climates require particular applications in certain circumstances necessary to the cure of wounds for the constitutions of men depend chiefly on the countries they inhabit on their situation high or low dry or moist the winds that rule the food and water that they take so that they differ among themselves according as the heavens look upon them with different aspects  but not to search any further into these things which cannot be contained within the limits prescribed to this little work and dont properly belong to my subject i will only say that it is easy enough to distinguish a proper remedy from one that is not so that which corrupts and depraves the natural balsam is known by looking into the wound from which if there proceeds a strong and stinking vapor it is a sign that the matter is not concocted seeing it is thin blackish too plentiful watery and of an offensive smell  the flesh likewise has its peculiar signs it is dull of feeling and sometimes is covered with another proud flesh oftentimes there is to be seen over all the wound a certain black or white filth which some as i have often known scrape or cut off at every dressing whereby the wound is enlarged and the cure delayed others imputing it to the vicious temperament and ill disposition of the patients body have recourse to purgatives which occasion still more new accidents such as fevers etc  but be this as it will it is certain that we ought not always to delay till the last before we change the remedy our smell and our sight only are sufficient to direct us in this occasion hippocrates orders a medicine to be changed when it does not what it ought or was designed for  but we must not on the other hand fall into the contrary extremity of changing the ointments sometimes once and often twice every day not giving time to a remedy to act and exert its virtue on the part to which it is applied it is necessary that the wounded part draw as it were nourishment from the medecin and therefore it must have a requisite time allowed it for that purpose it must if i may be allowed so to speak amalgamate with the nutricious juice of the part or at least if it dont increase its quantity it ought to preserve it in the natural state and when fallen therefrom restore it again to be capable of these effects it must be endowed with a volatile and oily spirit viscous also and temperate as balsams and vulneraries are which i have used with very good success  i have often experienced on many occasions in several hospitals and chiefly in this and in very considerable cases that after i had in vain used many remedies authorized by custom the balsam described in the sacred writings has had surprising effects and that members at the point of being cut off have been thereby cured with much ease this hospital of brianson might afford many instances of the truth hereof but i shall content my self with the two following  chap vi an observation of a very considerable case a surgeon of this hospital being one of those who was most employed in dressing the wounded by accident had a thorn run into the middle finger of his right hand which pierced the tendon of the muscle that bends it his whole hand and arm were attacked with very troublesome symptoms accompanied with a continual fever extremely violent and an unsufferable pain  five or six days past over before i had notice of this accident and all the symptoms were at the very worst i found all things in a deplorable condition the arm swelled as big as the leg the hand of a monstrous size and the finger as great as ones arm many cavities were in the inward part thereof and some in the outward from which issued a serous matter there was another large sinus under the musculas palmaris with an orifice near the roots of the fingers  i straitway laid open the finger on the inward part from one end to the other and found the tendon swelled and corrupted i did not enlarge the orifices on the outward part nor that of the palm hoping that all these would he well if i could but overcome the accidents  he was let blood and had a clyster given him though somewhat too late he observed an exact course of diet and was dressed with the balsam of arcaeus on the morrow when i took off the dressings i was surpised as i had been the day preceding with a vapor of an intolerable smell the lips of the wound were turned outward which made me despair of a cure and judge it would be necessary to cut off the hand the matter remained undigested the fever the pain and the swelling continued as before he was dressed in the same manner as the day before with addition only of a little spirit of wine the bleeding was repeated and also the clyster  the day following the wound was in the same condition save that the corruption appeared to increase we were of opinion that nothing but amputation could save his life but for as much as art and reason dictate that the preservation of the members ought to be endeavored so much as possible and as we are obliged in conscience to try all remedies before we come to that extremity i resolved forthwith to change the medicines judging rightly that what had been used might have occasioned this depravation of the salts whence it was to be feared a total corruption of the nutricious juice might follow  wherefore now i used the balsam of the scriptures mixed with a third part of that of arcaeus in this i wetted the pledgets which i applied very warm over all the wound and upon the sinusses i poured some of it also into the sinus of the musculus palmaris and upon it i put a plaster of dipalma dissolved in oil of roses and good vinegar  on the next day after this we found all things much changed to the better the fever and pain were lessened and there was nothing so ill a smell as before  i question not but the fever is a symptom troublesome enough and able to cause all these effects and that by the motion it excites in the blood it seperates saline and sulphurous juices that by irritating the fibers may occasion that turning out of the lips of the wound their swelling and that insupportable smell but it cannot on the other side be denied that outward remedies conduce much to procure that fermentation and corruption in the wounded part when they are such as putrify because they dissolve the blood and other liquors causing irritations corruptions and great suppurations and destroy the temperament of the parts to which they are applied whereas when balsamic and spirituous medicines are used they produce quite contrary effects for by allaying the sharpness of the humors and making the blood fluid they resist corruption dry up the moisture and in the place where they are applied abate the commotion of the humors caused by the fever  in fine whither it was by this or any other way it is certain that the change of the medicine here produced a notable alteration on our patient for though the fever appeared but very little abated by all that i had formerly done the very next day after this the lips begun to come nearer together the pain and defluxion ceased and which is most of all the ill smell was quite evanisht so that in five or six days he was past all danger and the cure was completed in a little time after  m le clerk physician to the king in his complete surgery commends much the samaritan balsam to which we have given the title of the balsam of the holy scriptures and the approbation of such a man is sufficient to justify its use i thought it not unfit likewise here to subjoyn the description of another compound samaritan balsam of an admirable virtue it is made up of equal parts of spanish wine and oil of roses to each pound of which mixture two ounces of sugar candy and as much honey of violets must be added and all boiled on a gentle fire and skimd till the wine is consumed this may be called the balsam of balsams or the compound samaritan balsam  chap vii an observation of another case m vert the younger an ensign of the company of m de beauvet lieutenant of the king at brianson and commander of the second battalion of sault had no less reason to applaud my method and the good effects of my remedy than him we discoursed of in the preceding chapter  he was wounded with a sword at pragelas in the outward part of the left arm near the bending of the elbow the wound was at first neglected being not well dressed for without dilating it in any manner a tent was thrust into it as long as it could possibly receive which occasioned such frightful accidents that the patient thought of nothing but losing both his arm and his life in the inward part of the arm opposite to the wound matter was collected and abscesses formed which obliged him to consult the principal surgeons of the regiments who thought it convenient to make an opening in that part which accordingly was done by the large and deep incisions that were made the artery was opened so that they were obliged to use the actual cautery to stop the bleeding by this means the wound was enlarged and the pain and the accidents increased  the first wound was still dressed as before with tents but the wounded person having kept his bed for fifty days and his wounds being still in a very wretched condition he was advised by the abovementioned gentleman m de beauvet to cause himself be transported to brianson to try if there he might find any help he was committed to my care and i found the inward or lower wound the length of a large span and four or five fingers breadth wide the artery and tendons were uncovered the ancient or outward wound whose orifice was very strait had in it a pretty long tent which shut up the passage of three or four sinusses that took up all the joint  the arm and hand were oedematous being much swelled and painful i began by making an incision in the wound on the outward part whereby i discovered the orifices of the sinusses into which i dropped a little of our balsam mixed as i formerly said with some of that of arcaeus  the large and lower wound was dressed with the same remedy we used expulsive cmpresses to press together the sides of the cavities which we kept on with a proper bandage moreover we laid aside the aromatic wines that had been before used upon all the part to its great detriment  three days after it had been dressed in this fashion the most part of the accidents disappeared he begun to rise up from his bed to take his victuals and to gather strength all the deep cavities were filled up the artery the nerve and the tendons were covered over the pain the fluxion and the oedemaetous swelling were quite gone and by this powerful incarnative the cure was completed in a fortnight with the assistance of a little vnguentum apostolorum wherewith we sometimes use to consume the flesh after this he mounted his horse and went for the air into his own country  this i may confidently affirm as a certain truth that when the balsam we speak of is genuin and unsophisticated it may serve at the same time both for food and medicine being made up only of sweet oil and wine and that it may be used not only for curing wounds of the mouth of the tongue of the gullet and windpipe and generally of all the breast but likewise in obstinate dysenteries in relaxations of the fibers of the ventricle in ulcers thereof and in these of the guts and of all the lower belly for if we consider its nature we shall find it of a friendly quality and extremely agreeable to our constitution being compounded of such things as serve us daily for food sweet oil softens loosens sweetens and penetrates and when it is boiled with wine which it devours as it were and consumes retaining with its self all the virtue thereof it is enabled to perform all these operations with much more ease it cuts dissolves strengthens restores the spirits breeds flesh and is astringent all which our balsam performs being endowed with the most useful virtues of these remedies and containing a volatile oily and temperate salt that is astringent and sarcotick and if a little sugar is boiled with it it becomes yet more excellent is more vulnerary and balsamic has no acrimony and is without either smell or taste  had this remedy how simple soever it may appear produced such effects in the hands of any other but my self they would without question have made a great secret of its composition and though this had been known to many yet they would never have published its virtues  it were greatly to be wished that there were only one remedy which might be able to answer all intentions so we should not be always obliged to have in the patients chamber a whole apothecarys shop which is often no less prjudicial to the purse than offensive to the smell  being about six years ago at turin i cured a gentleman of an inveterate ulcer that encompassed all the bottom of the uvula many surgeons had to no purpose used a great many remedies and i in like manner after the use of some more with no better success bethought my self at length of my anodin balsam in this i dipped a linen rag tied to the end of a probe and therewith touched the ulcer twice a day by this means as i solemnly protest in twelve or fifteen days the ulcer was completely cured  this remedy how ancient soever it is will appear new to many however it is certain that hippocrates in complicated fractures used little linen rags dipped in oil and wine mixed together to allay the pain and prevent convulsions which is a precedent sufficient to invite our imitation  it has been the policy of almost all who ever wrote of medicine still to reserve something undiscovered to themselves i could name a great number of authors who have published the virtues of certain remedies whereof they have never given the composition or if they have it has been in such ambiguous and aenigmatical terms that it is hard to understand any thing of it and indeed i must acknowledge that a remedy when it becomes common how good soever it may be loses much of its esteem  i have formerly said that the variety of constitutions and diversity of wounded parts require sometimes a difference of remedies to this we must have all due regard for it often falls out that even the most excellent medicines are not capable to answer all our expectations especially when the patient is of an ill constitution and the distemper obstinate and troublesome  however it is not good to put too much confidence in this single composition as if it were an universal remedy if at any time the success prove not answerable to our desires i own that i have been obliged my self in such cases to boil in our balsam the greater consound bugle sanicle some lavender clary st johns wort and the lesser moonwort which is a powerful vulnerary and very common in these parts and afterward to give it some consistence with about a third part of the balsam of arcaeus this composition has done surprising things it has consumed and removed fungusses from feet that had been entirely frozen and also from amputations which had withstood all other remedies it procures a good and moderate suppuration eases the pain of wounds in the nerves allays and resolves powerfully fills up with flesh in a small time in fine an embrocation therewith cures speedily bruises of all sorts  although i have these remedies in great esteem and am confirmed in my opinion of their excellency by a multitude of experiences that i have had yet i dont pretend to lay aside the ointments cerats and plasters of pharmacy which may be of very great use and are every day employed with success by very skillful persons in curing wounds  this only i will affirm by the way that the most part of ointments have a strong smell that is not only disagreeable to the wounded but is also no less hurtful to the wounds than offensive to the smell and very much conduces to render them putrid sanious and virulent  there are also several places where they very unadvisedly use corrosive sublimat arsenick and other things of a like nature in the cure of wounds not foreseeing their fatal effects nevertheless we cannot here be too cautious all the parts of our body are made up of veins arteries nerves lymphatick vessels and glands that are easily affected by whatever touches them and that by means of the circulation convey to the large vessels and the original of the nerves the good or ill qualities that have been imparted to em the contagion that is communicated to the sheets of a bed wherein one that has the pox or itch has lain for a night only will imprint its characters on a sound person that after lies in em though the impure matter touch only the scarfskin and is to appearance much less active than arsenic or sublimat  the unfaithfulness used in making up certain compositions which i have experienced on some occasions has obliged me to resolve to make up my self some that are more simple and much more effectual  etmullerus in his medicinal surgery and many others before him have complained of the prodigious number of medicines used in practice and of the great many plasters ointments cerats and a thousand other useless things good for nothing but to perplex the mind of young surgeons that great magazine of pharmacy might be reduced to much narrower bounds experience has convinced me of the truth of this and there are at this time many persons very expert in chirurgical practice that are herein of my opinion some of whom think that one remedy only may answer all it were well if such a method might be established for the good of the wounded and the convenience of surgery  but i am inclined to think that no man has yet gained that point which is extremely hard to be attained because of the diversity of the parts of which we are composed and the variety of constitutions in different persons it is this considetation that hinders me to give credit to that universal remedy which a certain modern otherwise a very able surgeon and at some distance from these parts has endeavored to establish but if i am not altogether of this last opinion i am yet much further from that of the ancients who have left us such a numerous list of remedies as cannot be either committed to the memory or retained therein a great deal of study and diligent application is necessarily required in order to know their virtues and properties for to make the right use of a medicine we must know its nature and effects not abandoning the success to uncertain chance and the fidelity of another as is often done  moreover it is very hard to believe that all these mighty compositions are answerable in their effects to the expectations had of em the numerous and differing ingredients do oppose alter and destroy one another the most simple things are most agreeable and sympathize most with our nature  i could never yet learn that solomon who had an universal knowledge of all things left behind him for the cure of wounds compositions so perplexing and stuffed with such a number of ingredients as these which some use at this day in his time two or three simples sufficed to make a balsam which was nothing inferior to many others that are now cried up as infallible remedies  balsams are recommended in the curing of wounds by the most part of the ancients and almost all the moderns contrary to the opinion of some that practice surgery enemies to antiquity who therein act as the quacks do contrary to all manner of reason but an undiscreet passion ought never to prevail over that which is justified and supported by experience  though i dont approve of medicines made up of numerous ingredients yet i have often used the styptick plaster of crollius which though it may be accounted of this number ought not at all to be laid aside for when it is faithfully made up it has virtues too effectual to be neglected and not sought after when i have a mind to give it a softer consistence and reduce it to the form of an ointment that i may make use of it in dressing of wounds i melt it with the balsam which i have described and sometimes with the oil of st johns wort prepared with gumelemy  it will answer all the expectations may be had of it in curing wounds and ulcers it allays pain cleanses and breeds flesh those who will give themselves the trouble to exaamine its composition and ingredients will agree with me that it is not impossible but it may have all these virtues  i have sometimes used and also in this hospital a red balsam made with an ounce of red saunders and white wax two ounces of venice turpentine oil of roses and rose water and a dram of sal ammoniac all mixed together and hastily boiled and kept for use it resists putrefaction and lessens suppuration  the simple digestive is a remedy that i commonly use to bring away the escar in gunshot wounds mixing always therewith a little of the yolk of an egg and some spirit of wine i renew it every day because it soon corrupts by reason of the yolk of the egg  turpentine is a simple balsam which is excellent for curing of wounds the country people about brianson who gather a great quantity thereof from the wood of the larchtree use nothing else but this single remedy without any mixture for the cure of their wounds certain it is that they who are accustomed to mix with it a great number of ingredients and catagmatick powders spoil its virtue and can expect nothing from it but bad succes  arceus his balsam used in so many places is not to be despised when rightly composed but it is convenient to remark that it agrees not to all distempers nor all parts of the body as was observed in the first remark of this third part which i have also experienced since in many other occasions  basilicon is one of the most common ointments and most used i sometimes employ it to receive the pouders that i think necessary either to irritate or procure suppuration when i judge it convenient otherwise i dont much deal with it  it sometimes falls out by the use of sarcotick balsams that the flesh grows so fast as to oblige us to consume it and also the orifices of the lymphatick vessels oftentimes raise up certain protuberances that together with the superfluous flesh forms as it were a resemblance of mushrooms which some endeavor to remove with cathereticks but to no purpose  i have observed that to touch the excrescence all over with a dissolution of the caustic stone is much better than any other means that can be used for this intention providing the application be renewed so often as is needful i have in eight or ten days consumed mushrooms as big as my fist which the ordinary powders could not have done in two months it may be seen in several places of the second part of this book that i have used it with a quick and happy success when there was occasion to take off the callosity happening to wounds in order to procure a reunion and when these kind of protuberances have but a dull sense i dont scruple to sprinkle upon them the foresaid caustic pulverized or to apply pledgets dipped in a dissolution thereof till i have procured such smoothness as is requisite in order to a laudable cicatrix and have restored the feeling of the part  when i only intended to bring to an equality the luxuriant flesh and procure a firm and handsome scar i have used with good success vnguentum apostolorum mixed with a little vnguentum egyptiacum this destroys proud flesh and is an excellent medicine for ulcers to be applied before the use of powerful sarcoticks for it quickens the flesh consumes superfluous moisture and resists putrefaction  i have always mightily approved the use of the spirit of wine and have often caused dress wounds of the extremities with this remedy only it is true it delays suppuration and protracts the coming away of the slough in gunshot wounds but it powerfully resists putrefaction corroborates and quickens hinders excessive suppuration and the dissolution of the nerves to which putrefying medicines are very hurtful  the emplastrum tripharmacum juberti made of litharge oil and vinegar to which i add a little scraped lint is admirably good to digest a wound and bring it to suppuration without occasioning great putrefaction it mightily dissolves contusions and its use is of great benefit  it is certainly very convenient that a surgeon have some peculiar remedy the virtues whereof he is well acquainted with to which he may have recourse in obstinate and troublesome accidents that sometimes follow upon wounds and will not yield to the common remedies it is often also expedient to change the medicines as i have formerly said and not always to be confined to one thing for the fondness one may have for a balsam or an ointment that possibly may have done very good service on many occasions ought not to prevail so as to make us employ it in all times and places the best and most approved remedies have not always the same effects or the same success for certain it is that not meeting with the same constitution in all persons it is impossible they can have the same operations  reflection i have often observed and it daily falls out that quacks who have neither skill nor experience have succeeded in the curing several distempers after they were given over by professed surgeons who had bestowed much time and used many romedies to no purpose but i dont at all think it strange for those leave nature to her self in such occasions and it is she only that works these miracles that are unjustly attributed to them and give such repute to their remedies  not but that acting without any rule they commit very gross blunders being unable with all their balsams to correct overcome yea or foresee the accidents that often follow upon wounds for all their skill extends no further than to the making up of their remedies and that which cannot be cured by these passes with them for incurable it is not so with regular surgeons they know the causes of accidents and apply thereto the necessary remedies without abandoning the wretched patient to his ill fate  it is indeed a notable shame that a wounded person should go from under their hands to be cured by a quack a clown or a simple woman i have known in several places such who by the sale of their remedies have acquired great reputation whether by the confidence that wounded people had of the virtue of their balsams or for a reason that appeared very convincing to wit that though they neither used tents nor dilaters yea in very express terms discharged them yet they often succeeded in their cures to the disgrace of surgery however it must needs be that the inventers of these balsams did discover some inconveniences in the use of tents seeing they have altogether forbidden to employ em now i suppose it will easily be believed that these men or women who are employed in selling them are not the first authors and that these who first used em were not altogether destitute of knowledge  diapalma is one of the plasters most commonly used in hospitals of the army when it is rightly made up and dissolved as was said before it is not to be despised and i add to it when the case requires a little of emplastrum de betonica  emplastrum divinum manus dei gratia dei etc are plasters of a singular virtue but very seldom to be found made up with all the requsiite fidelity  i have nothing in particular to say concerning cataplasms according to the ordinary method it belongs to the prudent surgeon to give them what form and qualities he thinks fittest for the present occasion  i have often faund much more advantage from the use of emplastrum tripharmacum spoken of before and diapalma dissolved which dont so much clog the parts to which they are appplyd nor at all hinder transpiration anodine cataplasms such as that of the crum of bread and others of that nature are very useful in great inflammations of wounds after the necessary diversions have been performed they allay the heat of the blood extinguish the acrimony of salts and relax the skin vnguentum santalinum may also be used to good purpose and when the pain is partly removed i use dissolving medicines which at first would have increased the inflammation and fermentation  before i put an end to this discourse i will remark that it is very requisite for a surgeon of a fieldhospital or of an army who may sometimes be shut up in a besieged place ill furnished with medicines for the use of the wounded to understand how to make up simple and easy remedies with few things such as those before mentioned for wounds and these of which i shall afterward speak for ulcers which in time of need may serve for all brandy which is the ordinary refuge in want of other remedies may also be lacking it is the part of a prudent surgeon wisely to provide for this necessity and to accommodate himself to the time by dressing the wounded seldom and according to our method thus fewer medicines shall be used a little shall go a great way and every one shall have reason to be satisfied  a great number of abscesses wounds ulcers and fractures of all sorts that have been under our hands in this hospital have been cured according to this method wherein there is nothing but what is gentle and easy all the amputations that we have performed were dressed only once in two or three days during the whole time of the cure with our simple remedies and that with very good success those who have been so happy as to avoid the malignant influence of the contagious steams that have so long prevailed in the air have experienced the comfortableness of this method by the suddenness of their cure completed without any exfoliation of the extremities of the bones which infallibly had followed on frequent dressings  i commonly use a button of vitriol to cauterize the vessels and stop the bleeding which i ever found successful neither did the flux of blood ever return the two stitches with a needle made crosswise upon the vein or artery are very sure this is a common way which i have sometimes and yet do follow but the falling of that suture is sometimes so tedious that it exhausts the patience both of the wounded person and the surgeon notwithstanding its use is very safe for the bleeding is less to be feared this way which is quick and gentle than any other the actual cautery is now out of use unless it be in amputations performed on the dead  though in the cures of the penetrating wounds of the thorax spoken of in my second part i was not obliged to perform the operation of the empyema yet i have had occasion to use it on many other wounded persons since i embraced this method for take what way or what care you will it is oftentimes absolutely necessary when the cavity of the breast is full of blood and the orifice of the wound high it is not then safe to attempt to empty it by the way of urine which might be too slow and is too uncertain but we must without delay fall about the operation  i will not here describe the manner of performing this or other operations m verduc and m chariere have lately afforded sufficient means of instruction in this affair this i will only say on the subject in hand that this operation ought always to be performed on that side where the effusion of the blood is and if it is found to have been on both sides and one opening does not give the ease that is expected though the extravasated blood is discharged we must make an opening also on the other side after the first is carefully closed up and the patient has had some time allowed to recover his strength sometimes i am obliged to use tents for the first day left the division of the pleura that was but newly made should unite again and so there would be a necessity of a new operation the next day to let out that blood which being coagulated could not at first be brought away and can hardly be evacuated by any other means as for these openings made in the body by bullets in gunshot wounds there is no need of tents to keep them open for they cannot be closed up till the escar is separated  i have already said that in openings which i make to evacuate the collections of matter or abscesses in the thorax ocasiond by a pleuresy or peripneumonia i use tents without a point in the first days to keep the matter from coming out all at once otherwise the place that was possessed by the matter would soon be filled with air which being ever colder than the inward parts of the body might occasion coagulations suffocations and swoonings moreover when a great deal of blood is extravasated it must also be let out by degrees now in such occasions tents are necessary but these being once over i lay them aside for good and all that a free passage may be given to the matter that the generation of a callosity about the sides of the opening may be prevented and that nothing may be left to hinder the reunion  by this method the wretched patient is delivered from a great deal of trouble pain and vexation being enabled thereby to enjoy a repose which otherwise he could never have expected and by seeing him thus from pain what inumerable accidents are avoided  had not charity and patience prevailed in this place and restrained us from cutting off without further delay members that were only gangrened by an extremity of cold as other surgeons of hospitals have done this of brianson would have been full of invalids for about the end of the campain in the years      and      a great number of sick persons were brought thither from pignerol and olx who in passing the mountain genevre were in such manner seized and penetrated with the cold in the extremities of the body that a total loss of sense and also a gangrene did ensue the most part of whom notwithstanding were cured without amputation those only excepted that had been before worn out with long sickness  chap viii of gunshot wounds seeing wounds are the principal subject of this little treatise it was not fitting that those inflicted by firearms should here be forgotten wherefore i shall say something of them in this chapter  gunshot wounds are acknowledged by all to be very troublesome because of the tearing and of the disordering the flesh occasioned by the bullet the stop put to the circulation so far as they reach the havoc that attends them and the obstructions they occasion all which are but too too able to produce very grievous accidents fluxions mortifications and gangrenes are here very much to be feared to prevent which i at first give breathing to the wound with pretty large and deep incisions according as the nature of the part and bigness of the wound do require i do my utmost to draw out the extraneous bodies if there are any putting the wounded person in the same posture wherein he received the wound afterward i dress it according to my method and seasonably perform the requisite diversions a flux of blood is almost never to be feared till the escar be fallen unless some great vessel be wounded  nevertheless i can truly affirm that there never happened any flux of blood in gunshot wounds since i laid aside the use of tents for according as the escar is dissolved and comes away a new flesh is bred without any hindrance and covers the wounded vesels which cannot be when it is pressed by tents this is a truth so evident that i hope no man will call it in question  diet ought always to be rightly ordered and if notwithstanding all our care and precaution dangerous symptoms do follow we must endeavor to ease and relieve the part by making many scarifications thereon in order to give a vent to the extravasated blood and to hinder its stay and fermentation but seeing the most part of the accidents that happen are more or less troublesome according to the different bigness of the contusion i do what i can to dissolve it as soon as possible and to restore the humors to their usual motion for according to the definition we have laid down in our first part a contusion is a disorder of the fibers and little vessels that changes the regularity and situation of the pores but this is often accompanied with an effusion or extravasating of blood which pressing upon the vessels hinders the course and motion of the humors and spirits the accidents that follow in this last case are much more troublesome wherefore without expecting the effects of dissolving medicines i forthwith have recourse to scarification for mortifications often times surprise of a sudden however seeing things come not always to this pass i sometimes use dissolving medicines  we have known a very warm embrocation with oil of roses to which was added a little of that of turpentine and some spirit of wine produce exceeding good effects it begins the dissolution relaxes the skin and disposes the part to receive afterward the impression of the plasters such as the tripharmacum juberti diapalma dissolved as we have ordered fresh cow dung fried with volatile salts as also that of other animals the roots of briony infused in spirit of wine are in this case very proper  dissolving cataplasms are sometimes very seasonable providing they be not too emplastick and if in spite of all our care a gangrene should follow we must use these remedies which were described under that head but this accident never yet fell out in any of these wounds whereof we had the first dressing and i can aver that though simple gunshot wounds are dressed in this hospital as excoriations only yet are they always cured with a surprising quickness nevertheless we perform all the necessary diversions the remedies we used may be seen in the relation of the cures  chap ix of burns the accidents occasioned by gunpowder might afford us subject of much discourse upon burn but i design only to speak a word or two thereof that i may thence have occasion to point forth the remedies i use in their cure  the tallow of which they make candles melted with the oil of walnuts to the consistence of an ointment will answer to all the intentions proposed in this matter i have not found any thing either so effectual or so easy it will terminate the empyeme and cures generally all sorts of burns whatever in very short time in fine this is the remedy which we ordinarily use benjamin vnguentum populeum and the yolks of eggs may be used when this cannot be had there are but very few surgeons who have not always some particular remedy for burnings some more some less effectual etmullerus and other authors have given a great number of very good ones and m verduc in his pathology explains their nature and their differences in a very clear and unintelligible way  a little time after the declaration of war an accident happened in the valleys of luserne which afforded us many frightful spectacles the guardhouse of the fort of tour called st marys fell down upon about thirty soldiers as they were warming themselves about a great fire of whom twenty or thereabouts were buried with the ruins in the chimney by the fire a good deal of time was spent before they could clear away the stones and the rubbish and get out these poor wretched creatures some were found dead and roasted others were brought into the hospital of luserne a plaster as big as a bedsheet was scarcely sufficient to dress them two or three died and five or six were cured by the assistance of cordials diaphoreticks and absorbing medicines taken inwardly to facilitate the opening of obstructions while outwardly the most proper ointments were used to allay the pain and dissipate the corrupt matter to which i caused add a little camphire and some yolks of eggs mixed together to conclude after very frightful suppurations the cure was completed but they were for the most part like so many serpents all obliged to change their skin  chap x of ulcers etmullerus is of opinion that the cause of ulcers proceeds from an acid whereby the immediate nourishment distributed to the part is corrupted and losing its oily and balsamic nature becomes sour and altogether unfriendly to the part that it ought to nourish and so considerably increases the acid ferment and augments its activity  according to this definition a topical remedy well accommodated to the kind of the disease and that destroys acids and repairs the balsamic nature of the nutricious juice if sufficient to bring this sort of distemper to a perfect cure i have often in this manner cured many poor afflicted creatures without the use of general remedies but not to make any change in the manner of dressing i say in the first place that ulcers are but too common in the hospitals of the army tbe ill diet of the soldiers their irregularities their fatigues and their unavoidable nastiness are more than enough to occasion such as are very obstinate and difficult to be cured secondly we have in this hospital followed a method whereby in a little time a great number of ulcers were cured for after general remedies and some slight diversions i used a decoction of walnut leaves with a little sugar in this i dipped pledgets which i applied moderately hot letting often three days pass over without taking off that dressing  many persons in france i know have kept this composition as a great secret but i thought it would have been inconsistent with charity not to publish its virtues and the manner of making it  i have experienced on a thousand occasions that it mightily cleanses and breeds flesh mortifies and devours it acidities resists putrefaction removes plentiful suppurations and consumes the moisture that hinders reunion in fine it has virtues that surpass belief and its effect is more quick than that of all the ointments and cerats with which apothecaries shops are stored and which are commonly used in curing of ulcers but often to no purpose in the mean time i dare affirm and that truly that in the places where i have used it all these ulcers that were formerly thought incurable were thereby ended in a very short time  though i do but very seldom make any use of injections nevertheless i have been sometimes obliged to have recourse to this remedy from which i have reaped more advantage then from all those used in practice and especially in hollow and deep ulcers as also in large abscesses of fleshy parts where there is great putrefaction and sometimes a considerable cavity  the scriptural balsam spoken of before which is only an equal quantity of oil and wine boiled to the consumption of the latter is also an excellent medicine for ulcers with this remedy only i have cured great numbers  many authors there are who have left us an account of a vast number of remedies which are used in hospitals for which reason i will say nothing of them here where my design is only to make known those i use in my own practice  by what i have said of the seldom dressing of wounds it may be easily guessed that i am not for frequent dressing of ulcers for if they proceed from an acid as etmullerus thinks we ought to endeavor not to promote the coagulation by admitting the acid of the air which by insinuating its pointed articles into ulcers corroborates the cause renders them putrid sanious and sometimes incurable  it is not without ground that galen as has been declared already in the first part in his fourth book of the composition of medicines chap   has ordered to dress ulcers but once in three days and i believe that it would yet be better to do it more seldom unless some urgent cause require it such as the season of the year the badness of the humors or some other evil disposition of body  we may observe that suppurative medicines used in dressing ulcers are extremely pernicious for the matter is but too plentiful and requires to be lessened and dried up if we desire a perfect cure the application of topical remedies when well chosen oftentimes performs in this case what neither diversions nor internal medicines could do and of such there are good store but it depends only on the prudence and skill of him that prescribes em to use them seasonably for we can expect no desirable effects either from one kind or another but according as they are properly applied  vnguentum apostolorum mixed with vnguentum egyptiacum is not to be despised it consumes all the corrupted and the superfluous flesh i have often applied this before i made use of our lotion  the aqua phagaedenica or limewater mixed with salt of lead or sal ammoniac and aqua coelestis have also served us on such occasions for if one remedy fails as often falls out we must have recourse to another  chap xi of simple fractures in the cure of simple fractures commonly four things are proposed to be done first to set the bone or bring it to its natural figure secondly to keep it so with fit dressings thirdly to take care of the neighboring parts and fourthly to give the afflicted member a convenient posture  first then extension is almost ever necessary to reduce the bone to its natural state which is to be more or less vigorous according to the quality of the fracture the nature of the broken part or the age and sex of the patient but we must observe not to make extension when inflammation or other accidents appear till they are either removed or considerably abated  as to the second thing which is the necessary dressings i have always observed the direction of hippocrates in using three bands as he did in simple fractures celsus employed six but these in my opinion were too many for the part wherefore i chusd rather to follow the practice of hippocrates approved of by galen in the fifth chapter of his book of method  the most part of those who practice surgery differ in the use of topical remedies some apply all dry as for my self who am not confined to the way of the ancients in this matter i have found that the glair and yolk of an egg beat up together with a little oil of roses will answer all expectations it is astringent anodine and dissolving the rest of the dressings i use dry unless an inflammation or some such thing oblige me to the contrary for as it is my way to dress my patient as seldom as possible i apply the bandage dry that it may be the faster and less apt to slacken  plasters and emplastick medicines employed in fractures stop up the pores of the skin keep in the vapors that occasion itching and so oblige to take off the dressings oftener than is expedient wherefore i endeavor to avoid whatever may cause that accident  hippocrates used to take off the dressings three days after application many stay till the seventh and for my self i delay it as long as ever i can experience has taught me that it is most advantageous for the patient not to be dressed till the callus is entirely formed unless the bands are loosened or some unexpected accident has fallen out such as itching and disordering of the reduced bones i could recount a great number of soldiers that have departed from this hospital cured of simple fractures of all sorts according to my method but i shall content my self with the relation of the following cure  a soldier called la tulippe of the regiment of conde was brought to this place having his right thigh bone broken about the middle and shattered this unlucky accident befell him as he was sleeping upon mount genevre under a tree which at the same time was cut down and fell upon his thigh so soon as he was committed to my care i reduced the bone by a vigerous extension and applied a linen cloth dipped in an entire egg beat up with a little oil of roses and a small quantity of good vinegar upon which i put some compresses then three or four pretty long rollers with some splents of pastboard encompassing all with a piece of the same and last of all the juncks with what belongs to em diversions were performed and a moderat diet ordered i let the dressings stay on for twenty days at the end of which time i found the part in its right and natural disposition at this dressing i used emplastrum pro fracturis and applied the bandage as before with splints of wood and the other things necessary in twenty days after i took off the dressings a second time and found all things to my satisfaction and twenty days more passed before i looked to it again so that in sixty days i dressed him only three times not reckoning the first he began now to rise and to walk on crutches and we continued still the dressings upon his thigh omitting the junks in fine after he had remained sometime in the hospital to recover his strength he returned to his regiment  it is convenient to observe that in simple fractures of the thigh we ought always to use on the hinder part a splent of the breadth of two or three fingers to sustain the bone which without this precaution would be in danger to bend in hospitals of the army where the loose straw on which the soldiers lie is apt to slip from under them and so to make holes or furrows capable to disorder the joining of the broken parts unless they be supported by some thing that is sufficiently stiff  i have no credit to give to the inward remedies which some use for breeding a callus such as the juice of cowslip of agrimony or its root taken in drink and many others to be seen in ancient authors nature is the architect and principal framer of the callus when she is allowed that repose which is necessary to her acting however i dont disapprove the use of incrassating nourishment on such occasions  in the third place as to the care of the neghbouring parts when the fracture is much shattered and very painful it is exceeding advantageous to apply defensives to the superior parts and the emunctories the liniment made of an egg beat up with oil of roses and sometimes with a little of that of turpentine and some vinegar when the contusion is great answers also to this intention together with embrocations with dissolving oils above all diversions are of great efficacy to prevent and remove accidents  as for the fourth thing it is of great importance to the fracturd member to be placed in a convenient situation upon which very often depends the good or ill success of the cure in hospitals of the army all the necessary conveniences are not to be found but the ingenuity of the surgeon ought to make up that defect the greatest part of the wounded are only laid upon straw which has not stability enough to keep a member long in the same situation it is this consideration that obliges me after applying the three bands spoken of above to use splents in the first dressing unless the pain engage me to defer em and afterward i make all sure with a fourth band i add also the juncks and the sole with what belongs to em if the fracture is in the thighs or legs if in the arm i use the sling as also if in the forearm the case of pastboard all being well tied on secures the part in such sort that there is no hazard of its being disordered this is the method i use in simple fractures  chap xii of compound fractures complicated fractures are very hard to be cured in the second part of this treatise may be seen the manner how a good number of such were brought to a perfect cure but we must not always flatter our selves with expectations of the like good success chiefly when part of the substance of the bone is lost the youth and good constitution of the patient are great helps in such occasions the method of dressing gently speedily and seldom saves a great deal of time and prevents very many accidents nature when at liberty and acting without restraint does things very surprising and such as we would have judged to be impossible  the generation of a callus in a simple fracture is undoubtedly more speedy than in a complicated one in the first the heat is kept in and united and acts with more strength and quickness the bone being covered by the teguments is sheltered from the injuries of the air for according to fabricius ab aquapendente part   bo   chap   the external air alters the bones and destroys their natural temperament more over nature is not diverted nor disturbed in her action by dissipations or suppurations all consists in the reducing of the fracture or rightly setting the bone as we have taught in the former chapter  from these reasons a consequence may be drawn to justify my method in respect of complicated fractures for by suppressing frequent dressing and giving all diligence to hinder the access of the air to such wounds i prevent all the accidents it might occasion as great suppurations alterations rottenness fluxions pains and generally whatever prolongs the cure and often makes the wounds incurable  in complicated fractures when there is great suppuration the matter must undoubtedly be mixed with the nutricious juice of the bones which from the first moment of the fracture begins to cover the ends of the bone and form a callus tents and dilaters with which commonly these sorts of wounds are filled by their touch hinder this work which ought not to by interrupted long and frequent dressings give time for the air to penetrate into the wounds whereby the nourishment of the bone loses what was spirituous in it coagulates breeds obstructions or is turned into matter moreover this method not only occasions always irritations and pains but also deprives the sick of that rest which is absolutely necessary to em  fabricius ab aquapendente in the eighth chapter of the same book treating of complicated fractures where the bone is not uncovered orders the lips of the wound to be joined together and that it be dressed but once in three days and in the tenth chapter of the same book speaking of complicated fractures where the bone is laid bare directs to join the lips of the wound by stitching or otherwise and afterward to go on with the cure as in a simple wound  i am not therefore the only person that has dressed complicated fractures after this manner it may be observed also that rhasis and serapion used this method in the cure of wounds of the head with a fracture of the scull for they say that wounds of the head must be stitched up even where the scull is broken quite through  if this may be done on such occasions much more in complicated fractures of other parts of the body now the stitching used by these authors in fractures of the scull was for no other end but to exclude the air which might have proved hurtful to the brain the membranes and the scull  galen and avicen advise stitching in such a case but hippocrates forbids it in his book of wounds of the head for my self i very rarely use it in any part of the body though i dont disapprove it but in gunshot wounds it cannot be practiced for many reasons known to every body  fractures with a wound are in general very troublesome but these caused by firearms more than others and they are also more or less hard to cure according to the part wherein they are for the complicated fractures of the thigh which we have had under our care in this hospital were not so soon cured as those of the leg nor these as the fractures of the arm and so of others though in all the same method was always followed  as to the difficulty of curing those of the thighs it is often occasioned by the inconveniences to be met with in the hospitals of the army for there is difficulty in giving clysters there where we cannot afford the accommodations necessary for voiding the excrements because wanting ordinarily servants handy and charitable enough to assist the patients in such occasions they ly in their nastiness and are indiscreetly and violently moved by which means the cures become tedious and difficult for we may be sure that nature acts with no less diligence and wisdom upon these than upon other parts  i make no question but many persons will condemn this way of dressing complicated fractures which possibly will appear to be very new for i own i never hitherto saw it used by any but we ought not to be too forward to affirm that what we have not seen is not there are without doubt many secrets both in nature and in arts which would be of notable advantage were they known to us  those who will give themselves the trouble exactly to follow this method may extricate themselves from the errors with which their minds were prepossessed against it  chap xiii of dislocations it is in the cure of dislocations that art has the advantage over nature because that alone accomplishes the cure without the assistance of this the operation of the hand machines and bands are the means that surgery imploys to reduce them  though this subject would afford an ample field to theory yet i shall remit the young surgeons to such authors as have designedly treated thereon i will only say that it is necessary to be thoroughly instructed in the knowledge of the bones and bandages and that if possible we must not lose one minute of time to restore the parts that are dislocated before the accidents supervene that oftentimes hinders the operation for the head of the bone that is out of its place commonly presses on nervous and sensible parts and sometimes squeeses together the vessels that carry the blood for the nourishment of the parts which occasions a kind of palsy and atrophy and sometimes a fluxion moreover the cavity of the receiving bone may be filled with the synovia or humor that moistens the joints which if it be coagulated there by some acid will hinder the head of the bone to go into that place from whence it came out in which case we may reckon the restoring of the bone to be impossible wherefore we ought at first to employ all our care to procure its reduction  the instruments necessary to reduce old luxations or such new ones as require great force are not all to be found always in hospitals of the army but the hand of servants and the ingenuity of the operator ought to make up that want as much as possible  guy de chaulie fabricius ab aquapendente pareus and many others have sufficiently explained the manner of reducing dislocations a young surgeon ought to omit nothing that may conduce to his accomplishment herein for it is by these simple operations that the vulgar knows to discern the skilful from the ignorant because these sorts of performances are altogether chirurgical and require only the dexterity of the artist to accomplish em  i have found by experience that an egg beaten up with oil of turpentine and a little vinegar is very profitable to the luxated parts to which it is applied yea that it is a remedy sufficient to answer all intentions aromatic wine may be used when this cannot be had if your design is only to strengthen the plaster pro fracturis will do the business  bleeding clysters and a convenient course of diet ought not to be neglected in great luxations attended with contusion these sorts of remedies oftentimes prevent being surpised with accidents and remove them when present  chap xiv of the relaxation of the joints soldiers who commonly ly on the ground during the campain in very severe seasons are liable to have their bodies stuffed with superfluous humors wherewith all the parts in general are soaked but in a special manner they very often fall upon the joints where softning and relaxing the ligaments that kept them fast they do thereby occasion luxations of the parts  this kind of distemper is very hard to be cured and will scarcely yield to remedies we have had of them under our hands in this hospital which have occasioned us a great deal of trouble and but little credit hippocrates in such cases advises the use of the actual cautery and galen after him is also for the same operation in order to drain and consume the slimy and watery humors to strengthen the skin and to fasten and fortify the joint  hippocrates for this purpose uses a rope of raw flax which being set on fire yields a coal like that of the match used in armies and aetius according to archigens did it with the root of fullersweed and of birthwort probably to render the operation more gentle it is performed upon the place where the head of the bone bunches out  this remedy is rude and we have never used it in this hospital because it frightens the patient nevertheless these distempers are sometimes so painful and withal so obstinate that those who are under em willingly submit to the most cruel operations that they may be released therefrom  fabricius ab aquapendente relates that after he had in such a case to no purpose used very many things the patient was cured with a plaster of a certain herb which he believed was heartsease that was applied to him by a quack  as for my self though i dont disapprove the way used by the ancients in this case yet i am of opinion that it ought not to take place till more gentle methods are first tried and this is the course we use to take at first trying whatevet may heat cut dry and strengthen the oil of lavender the fat of the mountainrat and spirit of wine or the queen of hungaries water made up in form of a liniment and applied very warm give great assistance in such cases to which may be added a little of the oil of turpentine which cuts and opens the passages so making way for dissolving and drying medicines  but when i find these remedies ineffectual i use such things as irritate vesicatories and caustic herbs such as spurge celandine and the like which by the exasperation of the pain may cause a fluxion upon the part affected that so the matter being after digested and ripened by a fermentation all may be happily ended by an abscess as sometimes fails out  when we have brought things to this pass we must not fail without delay to restore the bones into their cavity and to fortify the joint with good aromatic wines quickened with spirit of wine or else with mans grease and a little of the queen of hungaries water mixed and applied hot and generally we may for this purpose use any thing that may strenghthen the member and wast the moisture in the mean time the part must always be supported with a good bandage and surrounded with compresses and bolsters to command the bone and keep it fast in its place moreover the patient must be very careful to keep himself quiet and must observe a drying and attenuating course of diet  chap xv the conclusion of the third part with some very useful remarks my principal design in this little treatise being to introduce for the relief of wounded persons a gentle speedy and easy way of curing their distempers i have endeavored to confirm the same as much as lay in my power by reasons and experienees i am not ignorant that this part of surgery which concerns wounds does not exhaust its bounds and that i have only slightly touched on other things that are of no less importance  my intention was not to transcribe from other authors and therefore i thought it enough superficially only to declare my thoughts of the other parts of surgery wherein also i have confined my self to that which is most common and most necessary and was withal most particulurly known to me not being willing to speak of many things about which i had nothing new to advance i think i have done what i designed and am ambitious of nothing else but that my intention which i have sincerely declared may have all the success i could wish it  the course i take to prevent the scaling of bones explained in the first part of this book i learnt from experience i hope also it will be found very useful and necessary in dressing wounds where the bone is uncovered  i drew also from the same fountain the manner of dressing after the operation of the trepan and yet i doubt not but it will have the fate to be condemned as new however i will not spend time in anticipating the objections of others by answering them before hand for whatever might be said in commendation of the plate which was never used by any before me would only prove an inducement to excite the critics to decry it  experience and reading have informed me that the air is a mighty hinderance to the cure of wounds and i have endeavored to find out an easy way to hinder its access especially in wounds where the scull is cut for it is evident that the most part of the accidents that attend such wounds are occasioned only through the little care taken to keep off the assaults of the air which are promoted by the custom of long and frequent dressings  i have seen surgeons spend whole hours in dressing wounds of the head accompanied with a fracture of the scull to loosen break or cut off the splinters or some piece of the bone which ought never to be done unless we are very well assured that they prick the dura matter  there are many who think they have spect well if at each dressing they can but extract some little bit of broken bone which they carefully preserve to show to all that come thinking thereby to gain credit and to raise their reputaeiou by that which ought to be condemned and often costs the wounded person his life  a very famous officer not long ago experienced the fatal effects of this cruel method for having had his scull broken by a bullet whereby he was in a manner trepanned without hurting the brain or its membraues or occasioning any dangerous symptom some time was unadvisedly spent twice a day in loosening and pulling away forcibly little portions of the bone which nature would easily have separated supposing that afterward which yet was impossible they might chance to prick the dura matter by this method the dura matter and the brain were altered and visibly mortified so that he died on the eleventh day of his wound i was indeed called to give my advice after his condition was desperate but all i could do in this case was to give him notice of his approaching death  many surgeons in a vain ostentation spend all their life and exhaust their diligence in unravelling all the secrets of the new discoveries in physic and in qualifying themselves to discourse accurately thereon contemning all the opinions of the ancients while in the mean time they remain in an entire ignorance of the practice notwithstanding all their science if these men were as desirous to be knowing as ambitious to appear so they would take another course and not confining themselves only to reasonning and to show their wit in consultations neglect to improve a good method  it is not enough to understand the nature and difference of wounds and to know the cause of accidents that besall them nor yet quaintly to explain em by reasons purely speculative and chymerical we must join to the theory that is indeed very useful and necessary a method of curing and rooting out distempers which is to be looked on as the most necessary part of surgery but it is rare for those who addict themselves wholly to reasonning to have such regard for practice as to acquire it to perfection and to abandon their own maxims to follow others that are contrary to em wherefore i have addressed this little discourse to young surgeons who may possible reap some advantage from it not being incapable of the good impressions one desires to make upon em  i am not desirous that the newness of this method should either engage them to follow it or oblige em to reject it but only wish that they may put it to a trial in order to make a true judgment for every reasonable man ought wisely to inform himself of the truth of things and to examine their consequences before he positively give his judgment nothing is more easy for one than to pass a verdict and nothing more difficult than to judge aright  i am convinced by experience that it is dangerous to credit the testimony of others the wrong judgment made on a wound that one of our most famous generals received october        being the day of the fight of marseils and my easiness to rely on the fidelity of another and on the report made to me the day after the first dressing thereof had almost cost him his life the wound was deep and made by a large bullet and was dressed at first as if it had been only a simple one with a great quantity of lint whereof a part was lost and fixed in the depth of the wound however it happened very fortunately that it was driven out by the matter but it left behind it in the place where it was hid a considerable mortification which gave occasion to make great and deep incisions whereby a fracture was discovered prudence hinders me to declare at more length the circumstances that accompanied this cure to which m dalibour mastersurgeon sworn at paris and surgeon major of the horse of the household an able and experienced man was called to give his advice in a word after many accidents all was brought to a happy conclusion  it is therefore absolutely necessary for a surgeon who is careful of his reputation to search the wounds himself which were not dressed by him at first in order to discover their nature and know their extent this was not the only person who in the day of that fight experienced the inconveniency of being dressed at first in a hurry i have for good reasons not mentioned several other cases not much differing from the former that occurred in the same occasion wherein there were many dressed in that quarter that was assigned to the body of reserve belonging to our army  in this book and particularly in the second part thereof may be seen after what manner i have brought to a perfect cure a great number of wounds of all kinds and qualities with much ease small charge and with simple remedies which are no less useful to the rich than convenient for the poor  the great charges ordinarily laid out upon the cure of wounds sometimes involve the patient after that cure is perfected in evils no less troublesome than the former the wounds are filled and closed up but the pockets are opened and drained that person of whom i spoke in the twenty fifth chapter of the second part before he came under my care had a bill of three hundred and seventy six livers brought him by the apothecary for medicines furnished by him when yet after all that expense there was no appearance of a cure  the credit of a surgeon does not consist in emptying the shops to cure his patients on the contrary we ought rather christian like to be saving of the money of those who put their very person and life in our hands and if they chance to prove so ungrateful as to deny us what we have deserved after such a good deed we may expect our reward from heaven we ought not to be bribed by the consideration of a mean interest to abandon the fidelity wherewith we ought to endeavor the speedy cure of our patients if a patient is destroyed by unexpected accidents when the cure is delayed on a mercenary account the surgeon under whose care he was becomes guilty of his death  i have seen many persons of note whom i will not name who passing through brianson eight or nine months after the battle of marseils wherein they had been wounded were either fistulous or very far from being completely cured  nevertheless that i may not rashly blame those who had these persons under their care i am willing to believe that the tenderness of their constitution their ill temperament or the unwholsom air which very much conduces to continue the wounds occasioned that tediousness of these cures which in other persons and circumstances had been perfectly finished in two or three months at most but i cannot restrain my self from saying that the tents as well as the frequent and painful way of dressing so much in use are sufficient to cause all these accidents and to hinder the cure of wounds and this is what makes surgeons hated and surgery chargeable  in this little work i have done what i could to show not so much by reasoning as examples and authority that nature has the greatest hand in curing wounds or to speak more truly that she is the principal worker therein but i leave it to the performance of more delicate pens to celebrate her praises and publish her excellencies contenting my self to admire her wonders which are no less unaccountable than they are surprising  the year      afforded me an occasion wherein it appeared that nature ever acts for the preservation of the most noble and the most perfect of her works a soldier of the fort of mirabout which parts the valleys of luserne from queras having robbed his captain was pursued and finding no other way to escape he threw himself down from the top of the walls upon the rocks where falling on his feet they were not only put out of joint but each of them were fracturd with a wound he was taken and brought to the fort where there was no surgeon by reason of the smallness of the garrison  he lay four months on straw without any relief but bread and water during which time his feet were gangrened and soon afterward entirely mortified  but which is extremely surprising around the lower part of both the legs a little above the ancle nature her self formed a certain wreath or roll which stopped the progress of the mortification so that what was beyond this was abandoned to the fury of the sphacelus while whatever was above these rolls was free from blemish  he cut off the right foot himself by the joint with a little pocketknife without either pain or bleeding and because the putrefaction occasioned an intolerable smell over all the fort by reason of the excessive heat he was sent to our hospital at luserne  by the way he lost a good part of the other foot which came away of its own accord and notwithstanding the contagious smell which as a carrion he dispersed in all the places where he passed and also the extreme heat of the season the mortification did not pass over the bounds that nature had given it only these wreaths that we mentioned above were considerably increased in bulk by the way  after he had recovered his strength by the assistance of good cordials some wine and victuals i cut off all that appeared to be entirely mortified not sparing the highest places of the rolls which cast an insupportable smell i let him rest till to morrow and then cut off one leg and the other the day after for the ends of the tibia and fibula were altogether rotten and uncovered finally no other accident hppend during the rest of the cure which was completed not long after  this wonderful example is sufficient to evince that the want of art is oftentimes supplied by nature this may further appear also by what follows being a very strange thing that happened at pignerol m de la place captain in the regiment of barrois was wounded with a bullet at the battle of marseils that entered at the middle and hinder part of the forearm and came out at the lower and forepart of the same breaking the cubitus in its passage he was dressed by m malinas a surgeonmajor belonging to the army in italy and master surgeon of lion very skilful in his employment  this wound was attended with some troublesome accidents for together with a continual fever an abscess was formed by a collection of matter which was extended over all the arm and forearm but as they were preparing to make an opening the wounded person was seized with a great looseness which all of a sudden put an end to that tumor and restored the arm and forearm to their natural state this unexpected accident being followed by so surprising an effect obliged his surgeon to cause take a view of that which the patient had voided and it was found to be the very matter of the abscess without any thing else save some little excrement which remained altogethr unmixed therewith moreover according as new matter was gathered in the same places it was still voided again by stool in a little time after in fine the wounds being completely cured the looseness ceased because that was removed which occasioned it  perhaps the matter was taken up by the veins and by means of the circulation carried to the mesaraicks and thence emptied into the guts but this i only propose as an uncertain conjecture all other ways being to me unknown i willingly leave it to the learned to be explained according to their different apprehensions but that which inclines me to think that this way has some appearance of truth is that this same surgeon solemnly protested to me that at the beginning of the same campain he had under his care a captain who had a wound in the thorax that pierced into the substance of the lungs and was accompanied with all the accidents common to such kind of wounds all which nevertheless were removed by opening a vein in the arm which was done with an intention to let blood instead of which nothing came out by the orifice made in the vein but real matter that had been sent thither from the breast many persons worthy of credit who were eyewitnesses assured me of the truth of this prodigy  fabricius hildanus chapt   observe    relates that an inveterate ulcer in the leg with a fistula having been rashly and unseasonably cured was followed by a pleuresie in which the patient voided at the mouth a matter like to that which used to come from the ulcer of the leg  it were an easy matter to adduce an infinite number of examples almost alike wherein nature appears to have surpassed even her self either in preserving parts afflicted or in easing such as are overcharged with humors or finally in uniting such as are divided  in the year      one lansaveche quartermaster of the dragoons of verue in the war against the vaudois was wounded by a large bullet in the upper and sidepart of the hypogastrium and by all the accidents it appeared that the colon was opened and torn by the bullet there came out at the wound for more than the space of two months an excrementitious matter during which time he suffered grievous pains at length nature without any assistance closed up the wound of the gut though the bullet was lost and he left luserne at the breaking up of the hospital which was three months after his receiving the wound  hildanus has a like observation of a certain man who had one of the great guts opened in the operation of the bubonocele which closed up of its own accord in fine as we are oftentimes surprised by things that could not be hoped but from either the bounty or even the caprice of nature so also very extraordinary things fall out in wounds by an effect of chance as well by reason of the posture men are in when they receive their wounds as because of the figure of these things with which they are wounded  in the same year      one wounded with a shot was brought to the hospital at luserne the bullet entered on the lower and middle part of the os occipitis and grazing upon the templebone came out under the right ear carrying away a part thereof though it plainly enough appeared that the bullet had touched the scull yet the wound was dressed as a simple one because no accident appeared and it was left to the care of the servants thus three days past during which the patient was troubled with a restlesness complaining only that he could nor put himself in an easy posture which was not much minded nevertheless he died on the fourth day of his wound with all the symptoms that usually attend sleepy distempers  the unexpected death of this man obliged me to open his scull i found he had been wounded with a little wedge of lead which hitting against the middle ridge on the lower part of the os occipitis when at the same time his head was bowed down was cut in two by the sharp edge of the bone and one part thereof had slipped upon the templebone as was said and the other had entered the cavity of the scull of that same side and remained fixed between it and the membranes which were cut and pressed thereby his fellowsoldier in the same day and action had two wounds by one shot the first a little below the yokebone of the left side and the other in the middle part of the right hypochondre yet he was completely cured in twelve days with a moderate suppuration and no accidents  i have seen many wounds that were no less strange than these but in order to make a right judgment in such like cases the nature and figure of the wounded part the posture of the person when he received the wound together with the figure of that which made it must all be very carefully examined beforehand now the ready apprehending of all these circumstances with many others also very necessary to be known in order to successful practice cannot be attained by surgeons without great study continual exercise and unwearied diligence  the ascent whereby we mount unto the temple of esculapius is no less difficult and steep than that by which we rise unto mount pernassus it is almost impossible to get up without making some false steps however it is but reasonble to think that those who were employed in hospitals and armies during the late war by the inumerable different cases which it has afforded have discovered things very surprising and no less useful in practice and have often seen the strange ways that nature takes to throw off what offends by healthful evacuations and to accomplish her designs  such as impart to the public their observations and experiences which are the fruits of their diligence and of their care have deserved well of mankind many surgeons there are who have not the advantage of occasions to accomplish themselves in this sort and of those that have few are so charitable as to publish what they have seen and remarked that is extraordinary  when a man does not communicate his seize by writing to the public let his endowments and his knowledge be never so great they are for the most part if not altogether buried with himself in the ground the good that a man can do lasts but for a time but the excellent advices that he leaves in writing to posterity are useful for ever we had been still in ignorance had not the writings of the ancients come down to our hands  wherefore i thought my self bound in conscience though at the hazard of being condemned by the envious to impart to the world my experiences that if possible i might procure to poor wounded persons a more speedy assistance than can possibly be afforded by the common method if i shall have the happiness to succeed in my design i shall think my self sufficiently recompensed for all my toil and will praise the almighty father of lights who by small means oftentimes brings mighty things to pass  finis books printed for
