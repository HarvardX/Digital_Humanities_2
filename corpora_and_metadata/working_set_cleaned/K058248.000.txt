the court of alexander an opera in two acts  the court of alexander  an opera in two acts  as it is performed at the theater royal in covent garden  in times of old indeed when time was young homer the first of bards his history sung and every poet since the iliad chooses for want of voice tinvoke the singing muses from whence with leave this inference we draw in aristotles institutes it is law blank verse or rhyme to instruments well strung should be recitativd or else in ballad sung aristot fol     london printed for t waller in fleet street  price one shilling  the argument of this opera alexander the great tempted by the accounts which several prisoners had related of the immense wealth in india determined upon invading the dominions of king porus who was then its sovereign  upon alexanders crossing the river hydaspes porus was made captive and entertained in the macedonian camp with great hospitality where the indian monarch fell in love with parisatis who was betrothed to lysimachus  the son of philip was ambitious of being thought the best drinker as well as the greatest fighter of his time both accomplishments then as now were looked upon to be acts which equally constituted the hero  no wonder therefore if after the defeat of the indian king his conqueror in honor of the victory should order a drinkingmatch and immediately after the exercise of that engagement or carousal  the opera is supposed to begin  as to the complexion of porus historians are divided some supposing him white like the chinese others coppercolourd like mangolans some declare him to have been only tawny like the malays but we have followed the authenticated commentaries of meleager and gorgias two generals who were belonging to alexander one commanded the light horse the other the leftwing of the mirmydonian infantry at the time and they declare porus to have been a black  the editor is aware that some anachronismical objections relative to chronology may be raised against his keeping clytus alive until the year of the world  0   when the battle with porus was sought but it is according to the account of bagoas who is supposed to be the most impartial writer in those times and upon the credit of plutarch justinianus arrian and diodorus bagoas was preceptor to roxana and it was from him we are told that both the zogdian princess and thais attended alexander in all his expeditions  as to the descent of jupiter we have not only pantomimical but also classical authority to vindicate such a measure  it being common in old rome even to a proverb nunc pro machina and horace allows it in his ne deus intersit etc  the scene is laid in bucephalon a city alexander built in honor to his horse  the lines marked thus are omitted in the representation
