sophocles and a maenander when rome had prevailed it was degraded and prostituted to the savage combats of gladiators and in the time of trajan the athenians exceeded even the corinthians in their relish of that cruel pastime  in the rock above the theater is a large cavern the front ornamented with marble pilasters of the corinthian order supporting an entablature on which are three inscriptions over that in the middle is a female figure which had lost its head in the year      mounted on two or three steps sedent on one side is a marble sundial moved away from its proper position it is of a kind anciently very common as is evident from the great number still in use about athens particularly in the tract called the gardens where many are set on the mud walls often with very rude gnomons above the cavern are two columns standing on the steep slope between the foot of the castlewall and the sedent figure the greeks have converted the cave into a chapel which is called the virgin of the grotto the sides of the rock within are covered with holy portraits the door is rarely open but i was once present says chandler at the celebration of mass when it was lighted up with waxcandles and filled with smoke of incense with bearded priests and a devout crowd the spectacle suiting the place which is at once solemn and romantic  at some distance from the theater of bacchus begins an outwork of the fortress standing on ancient arches supposed to be the remains of a portico connected with the theater called the odeum this fabric was designed by pericles for the musical contests which he regulated and introduced at the panathancean solemnity it contained many rows of seats and marble columns the roof was constructed with the masts and yards of persian ships and formed to imitate the pavilion of xerxes here was the tribunal of the archives or chief magistrate and here the athenians listened to the rhapsodists rehearsing the poems of homer and to the songs in praise of the patriots harmodius and aristogiton and thrasybulus aristion and sylla set it on fire the former when he fled to the acropolis because the timber would have enabled the enemy to raise machines for an attack without loss of time it was restored by king ariozanes and in a stable is an inscription which has belonged to a statue of him erected by the persons whom he appointed the overseers this fabric was roofed with cedar and greece had not a rival to it in dimensions and magnificence the wall of the inner front of the proscenium is still standing very lofty with open arches and beyond it a portion of the exterior wall of the right wing is visible on the right hand within the gate is the way into the area which was sown with wheat as was also the circular sweep of the hill on which the seats once ranged the dervishes have a place of worship above with a room in which the bowstring when a turk is sentenced to be strangled is commonly administered  by the side of the mountain of the acropolis nearly opposite to the rock of the aeropagus is a large naked semicircular area or terrace supported by stones of a vast size the face cut into squares the descent into the area is by hewn steps and the rock within is smoothed down perpendicularly in front extending to the sides not in a strait line but with an obtuse angle at the steps this place says chandler has been mistaken for the areopagus and for the odeum but was the pnyx  pnyx was a place of public assembly not boasting the curious labor of a theater but formed with the simplicity of primitive times there the citizens met to transact their affairs and by law no person could be crowned elsewhere on a decree of the people the business was done afterward in the theater of bacchus but they continued to choose the magistrates and to vote the praetor in pnyx which was hallowed by command of an oracle the furniture on record is a stone or altar on which certain oaths were taken a pulpit for the orators and a sundial made on the wall the pulpit which before looked toward the sea was turned contrary by the thirty tyrants who considered naval dominion as the parent of democracy excepting the accession of soil with the removal of the altar the pulpit and the sundial pnyx may be deemed to have undergone no very material alteration it had formerly many houses about it and the region of the city was called by its name  we proceed now to another magnificent fabric in the vicinity of the acropolis the temple of theseus this temple is of the doric order and in the style of its architecture greatly resembles the parthenon or temple of minerva though a very ancient fabric it is entire except the roof which is modern and vaulted with an aperture or two for the admission of light the pavement has been removed and the walls are bare it is a greek church dedicated to st george a recess for the sacramental table has been erected as in the parthenon but in the pronaos and decorated with portraits of saints the entrance is in the side of the cell at a low door which is kept locked except on the festival when mass is celebrated it is plated with iron and much battered the turks firing at it with bullets to try the force of their powder the goodness of their pieces or their own dexterity at a mark in the corner within stands a circular marble which has served as a fount from the inscriptions which range in four columns it appears to have belonged to the pytraneum  the sculptures still extant about this temple though much impaired witness the hand of a master and furnish abundant proof that pericles was its owner the exploits of this hero and of hercules were carved on the metopes in sixteen compartments in alto relievo and the following subjects are intelligible viz theseus killing the sow of crommyon throwing sciron from a rock into the sea wrestling with cercyon destroying the minotaur driving the bull of marathon to athens hercules strangling the nemaean lion with jolaus destroying the hydra receiving the golden apples from a nymph one of the hesperides  at some distance from the acropolis in the plain is a marble gate which separated hadrianopolis or new athens it is related that theseus erected a column on the isthmus of corinth which remained above an hundred years to the time of codrus when it was demolished by the peloponnesians it had inscriptions in greek on one side here is peloponnesus not ionia and on the other here is not peloponnesus but ionia the gate serving as a boundary is inscribed in capitals in like manner over the arch on another side what you see is athens the old city of theseus and on the other front what you see is the city of hadrian not of theseus  this fabric which is of the corinthian order with the tower of the winds and other structures at athens is seen to disadvantage from the accession of soil round about it beyond it within the region of new athens is the majestic ruin of the temple of jupiter olympius  deucalion was said to have erected the first temple of jupiter on this spot and the place of his burial was shown near it to prove he had lived at athens pisistratus the second founder dying his son carried on the work but after they were slain so many difficulties occurred that it remained unfinished for ages a specimen of the only temple in the whole world designed with a grandeur worthy of the ruler of heaven and exciting astonishment in every beholder about four hundred years after antiochus promised to complete it and cossutius a roman architect was extolled for his noble ideas of magnitude in the cell and for disposing the columns and the entablature with an exact symmetry which testified his exquisite knowledge and skill the temple was a dipteros and hypaethros or with double rows of columns and open to the sky though not as was most common with ten but with eight columns in front rome afforded no example of this species it was one of the four marble edifices which had raised to the pinnacle of renown the architects who planned them men it is said admired in the assembly of the gods for their wisdom and excellence  sylla when he punished athens dared to plunder even jupiter olympius and removed columns and brazen households to adorn the capital of rome the structure still continuing imperfect the kings in alliance with augustus agreed to finish it by contribution and jointly dedicate it to the genius of the emperor it was reserved for hadrian to put the last hand to a work on which athens had expended seven thousand and eightyeight talents in our estimate of the gold which decked the statue of minerva in the parthenion we said fortyfour talents were equivalent to an hundred and twenty thousand pounds sterling let it be judged then what an immense sum this fabric the work of ages must have cost little short of eight millions sterling this atchivement of the emperor was celebrated in a hymn sung at the sacrifice when he dedicated the temple to jupiter more than seven hundred years after its foundation by pisistratus  the ruin of the temple of jupiter olympius consists of prodigious columns tall and beautiful of the corinthian order sluted some single some supporting their architraves with a few massive marbles beneath the remnant of a vast heap which only many ages could have consumed and reduced into so scanty a substance the columns are of very extraordinary dimensions being about six feet in diameter and near sixty in height the number without the cell was one hundred and sixteen or twenty seventeen were standing in      one was overturned a few years before we arrived says chandler with much difficulty and applied to the building of a new mosque in the bazar or marketplace it was an angular column and of consequence in determining the dimensions of the fabric  new athens was supplied with water by the munificence of hadrian from remote sources at a vast expense he founded a very extensive aqueduct of which many piers are yet standing the water was partly conveyed by a duct running along the side of the adjacent hill and distributed to the town from a reservoir or cistern cut in the rock and fronted with an arcade of marble of the ionic order one half of this remains it stands beneath the mountain of st george and is about a mile from the gate of hadrian the space between where once was new athens is now ploughed and sowed  on the left hand returning from the aqueduct is the bed of the ilissus and higher up the junction of that and the eridanus the water of this river was so bad that the cattle would scarcely drink of it the ilissus is now as it ever was an occasional torrent in summer it is quite dry during our residence at athens i several times visited the bed after snow had fallen on the mountains or heavy rain hoping to see it filled to the margin and rushing along with majestic violence but never found even the surface covered the water lodging in the rocky cavities and trickling from one to another  and here it may be remarked that the poets who celebrate the ilissus as a stream laving the fields cool lucid and the like have both conceived and conveyed a false idea of this renowned watercourse they may bestow a willow fringe on its naked margin amber waves on the muddy maenander and hanging woods on the bare rock of delphi but the foundation in nature will be wanting nor indeed is it easy for a descriptive writer when he exceeds the sphere of his own observation to avoid falling into local absurdities and untruths  we have now given a survey of the most striking ruins in athens two structures yet remain either omitted or mentioned inexplicitly by other writers which we shall just touch upon one is the tower of the winds or of andronicus cyrrhestes the other is a doric portal situated at the foot of the hill of the acropolis  the tower of andronicus cyrrhestes is a small edifice of marble an octagon decorated with sculpture representing the winds eight in number and has supported a triton which turned as a weathercock and pointed with a wand to the wind then blowing on the sides were sun dials to show the hour of the day it is mentioned by varro and vitruvius  the tower of the winds is now a place of worship belonging to a college of dervishes i was present with my companions says chandler at a religious function which concluded with their wonderful dance the company was seated on goat skins on the floor crosslegged forming a large circle  the chief dervish a comely man with a gray beard and of fine presence began the prayers in which the rest bore a part all prostrating themselves as usual and several times touching the ground with their foreheads on a sudden they leaped up threw off their outer garments and joining hands moved round slowly to music shouting alla the name of god the instruments sounding quicker they kept time calling out alla la illa ill alla god there is no other god but god other sentences were added to these as their motion increased and the chief dervish bursting from the ring into the middle as in a fit of enthusiasm and letting down his hair behind began turning about his body poised on one of his great toes as on a pivot without changing place he was followed by another who spun a different way and then by more four or five in number the rapidity with which they whirled round was gradually augmented and became amazing their long hair not touching their shoulders but flying off and the circle still surrounding them shouting and throwing their heads backwards and forwards the dome reechoing the wild and loud music and noise as it were of frantic bacchanals at length some quitting the ring and fainting at which time it is believed they are favored with extatic visions the spectacle ended we were soon after introduced into a room furnished with skins for sofas and entertained with pipes and coffee by a chief dervish whom we found with several of his performers as cool and placid as if he had been only a looker on  the doric portal may be seen with its inscriptions in the ruins of athens one of these informs us that the people erected the fabric with the donations made to minerva by the god julius caesar and his son the god augustus from the plan and proportions of the ruin it has been inferred that the fabric to which the portal belonged was not a temple an edict of the emperor hadrian inscribed on the jamb of a doorcase regulating the sale of oil and the duties to be levied on it has been urged in favor of the opinion that the portal was the entrance of the enclosure of the agora or marketplace mentioned by strabo to have been in a district of the city called etreria  the territory of athens was anciently well peopled the small towns were in number     scattered except some constituting the city about the country frequent traces of them are found and several still exist but mostly reduced to very inconsiderable villages many of the ancient wells also occur all over attica some are seen in the vineyards and gardens nearly in their pristine state a circular rim of marble about a yard high standing on a square pavement adorned not inelegantly with wreathed flutings on the outside or plain with mouldings at the top and bottom the inner surface deep worn by the friction of ropes the highest is a kettle a jar or the skin of a goat or kid distended and close by is commonly a trough or hollow stone into which they pour water for the cattle the city was supplied with corn from sicily and africa and the regard of the emperors and kings its patrons was displayed in largesses of wheat and barley to be distributed generally in the ordeum at present attica is thinly inhabited and probably produces grain sufficient for the natives but the edicts prohibiting exportation are continually eluded and public distress bordering on famine ensues almost yearly  the olive trees are now as anciently a principle source of the riches of athens the wood of these trees watered by the cephissus about three miles from the city has been computed at least six miles long the mills for grinding and pressing the olives are in the town the oil is deposited in large earthen jars sunk in the ground in the areas before the houses the crops had failed for five years successively says chandler when we arrived the cause assigned was a northerly wind which destroyed the flower the fruit is set in about a fortnight when the apprehension from this unpropitious quarter ceases by a law of solon no tree could be planted less than five feet nor an olive or fig tree less than nine feet from one of another proprietor  the honey as well as the oil of attica was anciently in high repute many encomiums are extant on that of hymetteus and it deserves them all flies are remarked to buzz about it without settling which has been attributed to the odor it derived from thyme the race of bees was said to have been originally produced in hymettus and to have swarmed from thence in numerous colonies to people other regions the mountain furnishes a succession of aromatic plants herbs and flowers peculiarly adapted to maintain them both in summer and winter the hives are set on the ground in rows enclosed within a low wall their form and management and the method of taking the comb without destroying the insect has been described by wheeler by a law of solon no person was allowed to place a stand within three hundred yards of one before established  the purple hills of hymettus were the scene of the famous story of cephalus and procris in ovid the fatal mistake of the husband was said to have happened among some thickets near a sacred spring or fountain this seems the spot called pera where was a temple of venus and a water which was believed to conduce to pregnancy and an easy delivery the same it is probable is now occupied by the monastery of cyriani in many instances the temple or its site with the consecrated portion have changed their owners and the deity been dispossessed by the saint the convent is an old irregular building on the side of the greater hymettus in view from athens encompassed by a wall with battlements and entered by a low iron door the greek women repair to it at particular seasons and near it is a fountain much extolled for its virtues the popes or priests affirmed that a dove is seen to fly down from heaven to drink of it yearly at the feast of pentecost from the top of this mountain is a fine prospect of the country and of the islands in the aegean seas  chap xxv ancient and present state of athens with the character manners customs and dress of the inhabitants athens has on the west side of the plain the mountains aegaleos and parnes on the north brilessus on the northeast about six miles distant pentele and next the aegaean sea hymettus the clouds attracted by some of these mountains anciently furnished a variety of prognostics for the weather while clouds above the mountains on the side of hymettus portended ruin if in the night a long cloud guided it beneath the top the rain generally continued for some days a long cloud resting on hymettus in winter presignified a violent storm at the setting of the seven stars called vergiliae lightning about parnes brilessus and hymettus if all were comprehended denoted a great storm if two a lesser but if parnes alone severe weather a storm ensued if clouds enveloped that portion of parnes which was toward zephyrus or the west  a day or two after the storm beforementioned says chandler the capuchin as we were conversing by the window of his apartment put his hand incautiously on the frame and suddenly withdrawing it complained of a painful puncture a turk who was with us on examining the wall found a scorpion of a pale green color and near three inches long which he crushed with his foot and bound on the part affected as an antidote to its own poison the smart became inconsiderable after the remedy was applied and as no inflammation followed soon ceased the sting if neglected produces acute pain attended with a fever and other symptoms for several hours until the paroxysm is over when the malignity of the virus as it were decaying the patient is left gradually free some preserve scorpions in oil in a vial to be used if that which commits the hostility should escape though it seldom happens but on turning up a log or stone another may be found to supply its place  athens was the parent of philosophy as well as of eloquence and had three celebrated gymnasia without the city the academy the lyceum and cynosarges from which as many sects dated their origin the platonic the peripatetic and the cynic followers of plato of aristotle and of antisthenes zeno instituted the stoic philosophy in the portico named poecile and epicurus had his garden in the city  the academy was in the suburb without dipylon distant from athens only three quarters of a mile it was once the possession of a private person named academus who gave it to the people hipparchus son of pisistratus surrounded it with a wall crinon drained the low grounds near it the spot parched and squalid was improved and rendered very pleasant the walks were shaded with tall plane trees and cooled by running water before the entrance was an altar of love plato commenced teaching at the academy then reputed unwholesome afterward he preferred a small garden by the colonus hippius his own property the lacedaemonians spared the academy when they ravaged attica but sylla wanting timber for machines cut down the grove there and at the lyceum the successors of plato in the academy enjoyed a considerable revenue which in the subsequent ages was greatly augmented by legacies from persons desirous of contributing to the leisure and tranquillity of the philosophic life the little garden of epicurus was near the academy the teacher of ease it is recorded was the first who introduced that species of gratification the enjoyment of the country in town  by the destruction of dipylon and the citywall we are deprived of the ancient boundaries of athens and the town besides being reduced in its extent furnishes a variety of avenues to the plain moreover the mansions of the illustrious dead like the the bodies which they covered are consumed and have disappeared time violence and the plough have levelled all without distinction equally inattentive to the meritorious statesman the patriot the orator and philosopher the soldier the artist and physician atticus is described by cicero as pleased with recollecting where the renowned athenians had lived or been accustomed to sit or dispute and as studiously contemplating even their sepulchers the traveller will regret that desolation interferes and by the uncertainty it has produced deprives him of the like satisfaction but in the style of the ancients to omit the research would merit the anger of the muses  it has been observed that without dipylon the road branched off toward the piraeus and eleusis as well as the academy the road to the haven and to eleusis divides now not far from the temple of theseus and is nearly in the same direction as formerly on the right hand of the eleusinian road is a way which leads to the site of the academy the turkish aga has lately erected a house in or near it with a large garden and a plentiful fountain by the road side supplied it is likely by the channels which conduced to the coolness and verdure of the old suburb  we proceed now to the gymnasia on the other side of athens the lyceum and cynosarges  the lyceum was sacred to apollo a proper patron as an ancient author has remarked the god of health bestowing the ability to excel in gymnastic exercises the image represented him as resting after fatigue with a bow in his left hand his rightarm bending over his head the gymnasium was erected by lycurgus son of lycophron the militia of athens paraded there and were instructed in the management of their horses shields and spears in forming the phalanx and in all the established modes of defense  cynosarges was but a little without the citygate there was a temple of hercules on a summit near was the tomb of isocrates philip who reduced the city to require aid from the romans encamped by cynosarges and set fire both to that place and the lyceum  the lyceum was beyond the ilissus the site is now marked by a well and a church and many large stones scattered about cynosarges was not far from the lyceum and perhaps on the same side of the ilissus with the city where is now a garden near this bed and by the road the artificial currents of water having ceased the environs of athens are become more bare and naked than they were even after the devastations of philip and sylla  athens maintained under the romans its reputation for philosophy and eloquence and continued though subdued the metropolis of learning the school of art and the center of taste and genius the gymnasia and the gardens of the philosophers were decorated with the capital works of eminent masters and still frequented the fierce warrior was captivated by greece and science and athens humanized and polished the conquerors of the world but sylla greatly injured the city by transporting to rome the public library which had been founded by pisistratus carefully augmented by the people removed by xerxes into persia and restored long after by seleucus nicanor the spirit of learning drooped on the loss and the roman youth under tiberius were sent to study at marseilles instead of athens even there the barbarous gauls joined in the pursuit of eloquence and philosophy the sophist as well as the physician was hired to settle among them and the nation was civilized by the greek city  the emperor hadrian embellished athens with a noble library and a new gymnasium and restored science to its ancient seat lollianus an ephesian was first raised to the high dignity of the sophistical throne which was afterward filled by atticus herodes and other eminent and illustrious persons the number of professors was increased by antoninus the philosopher who had studied under herodes his establishment consisted of thirteen two platonists as many peripatics stoics and epicureans with two rhetoricians and civilians and a president styled prefect of the youth the student proceeded from the philosopher to the rhetorician and then to the civilian a yearly salary of about four hundred and sixtyeight pounds was annexed to each of the philosophic chairs and one of a talent to those of the civilians  education now flourished in all its branches at athens the roman world resorted to its schools and reputation and riches awaited the able preceptor the tender mind was duly prepared for the manly studies of philosophy and eloquence age and proficiency were followed by promotion the youth was advanced into the higher classes enrolled with the philosophers and admitted to their habit the title of sophist was conferred on him when mature in years and erudition and this was an honor so much affected that the attainment of it almost furnished an apology for insolent pride and extravagant elation it was a custom for the masters to inscribe on marble the names of their scholars some specimens of these registers are preserved in the oxford collection and many fragments are yet extant in athens  at this period athens abounded in philosophers it swarmed according to lucian with clokes and staves and satchels you beheld every where a long beard a book in the left hand and the walks full of companies discoursing and reasoning the cloak or tribonium was the habit of all the orders the general color was dark but the cynic wore white and with the stoic had the folds doubled one shoulder was bare the hair hanging down the beard unshaven the cynic with the stoic and pythagorean was slovenly and negligent his cloak in tatters his nails long and his feet naked the cynic was armed with a staff as a defense from the dogs or the rabble the sophist was adorned with purple and commonly polished as well in dress and person as in manners and language it behoved the professor as lucian affirms to be handsomely clothed to be sleek and comely and above all to have a flowing beard inspiring those who approached him with veneration and suitable to the salary he received from the emperor  a learned father who was cotemporary with julian at athens has described the manner in which the novice was treated on his arrival there with the ceremony of initiation he was first surrounded with the pupils and partisans of the different sophists all eager to recommend their favorite master he was hospitably entertained and afterward the students were allowed to attack him with rude or ingenuous disputation as each was disposed he was next to be invested with the habit a procession in pairs at equal distances conducted him through the agora to a public bath an opposition was feigned on their approach to the door some calling out and forbidding his admission some urging on and knocking these prevailed he was introduced into a warm cell washed and then clothed with the tribonium he was saluted as an equal on his coming out and reconducted no one was suffered to appear in that dress at athens without the permission of the sophist and this ceremony which was attended with considerable expense  the philosophers were long as distinguished by their aversion to christianity as by their government it is recorded of justin martyr that he preached in the tribonium to which he had been admitted before his conversion the establishment of christianity deeply affected the prosperity of athens a gradual desertion of the place followed minerva could no longer protect her city its beauty was violated by the proconsul who stripped poecile of its precious paintings it was forsaken by good fortune and would have lingered in decay but the barbarians interposed and suddenly completed its downfall when the goths were in possession of it in the time of clodius they amassed all the books intending to burn them but desisted on a representation that the greeks were diverted by the amusements of study from military pursuits alaric under arcadius was not afraid of their becoming soldiers the city was pillaged and the libraries were consumed devastation then reigned within and solitude without its walls the sweet swain the vocal nightingales as the sophists are fondly styled were heard no more philosophy and eloquence were exiled and their ancient seat occupied by ignorant honeyfactors of mount hymettus  athens after it was abandoned by the goths continued it is likely for ages to preserve the race of its remaining inhabitants unchanged and uniform in language and manners history is silent of its sufferings from later incursions from wars and massacres plenty and prospect of advantage produces new settlers but where no trade exists employment will be wanting and attica was never celebrated for fertility the plague has not been as at smyrna a frequent visitant because the intercourse subsisting with the islands and other places has been small and the port is at a distance the plague described by thucidides began in the piraeus and the athenians at first believed that the enemy had poisoned the wells if from inadvertence the infection be now admitted into the town the turks as well as the greeks have the prudence to retire to their houses in the country or to the monasteries and it seldom prevails either so long or so terribly as in cities on the coast  a colony of new proprietors was introduced into the city by mahomet the second but the people secured some privileges by their capitulation and have since obtained more by address or money the turk has favored the spot and bestowed on it a milder tyranny the vaiwode purchases his government yearly but circumspection and moderation are requisite in exacting the revenue and the usual concomitants of his station are unceasing apprehension and danger the impatience of oppression when general begets public vengeance  the turks of athens are in general more polite social and affable than is common in that stately race living on more equal terms with their fellowcitizens and partaking in some degree of the greek character the same intermixture which has softened their austerity has corrupted their temperance and many have foregone the national abstinence from wine drinking freely except during their ramazan or lent some too after a long lapse have reassumed and rigidly adhere to it as suiting the gravity of a beard and the decorum of paternal authority several of the families date their settlement from the taking of the city they are reckoned at about three hundred their number though comparatively small is more than sufficient to keep the christians fully sensible of their mastery the turks possess from their childhood an habitual superiority and awe with a look the loftiest vassal their deportment is often stern and haughty many in private life are distinguished by strict honor by punctuality and uprightness in their dealings and almost all by external sanctity of manners if they are narrowminded in the extreme it is the result of a confined education and an avaritious temper is a natural consequence of their rapacious government  the greeks may be regarded as the representatives of the old athenians on our arrival in the piraeus an archon came to meet us the learned reader may perhaps be struck by that respectable title and annex to it some portion of its classical importance but the archons are now mere names except a tall fur cap and a fuller and better dress than is worn by the inferior classes some have shops in the bazar some are merchants or farmers of the public revenue the families styled archontic are eight or ten in number mostly on the decline the ordinary habit of the meaner citizens is a red skullcap a jacket and a sash round the middle loose breeches or trowsers which tie with a large knot before and a long vest which they hang on their shoulders lined with wool or fur for cold weather by following the lower occupations they procure not without difficulty a pittance of profit to subsist them to pay their tributemoney and to purchase garments for the festivals when they mutually vie in appearing wellclothed their pride even exceeding their poverty  the lordly turk and lively greek neglecting agriculture and even pasturage this department which in asia minor is occupied by the turcomans has been obtained in europe by the albanians or albanese these are a people remote from their original country which was by the caspian sea spreading over and cultivating alien lands and as of old addicted to universal husbandry and to migration it is chiefly their business to plough sow and reap dig fence plant and prune the vineyard attend the watering of the olive tree and gather in the harvest going forth before the dawn of day and returning joyous in the evening on the close of their labor if shepherds they live on the mountains in the vale or the plain as the varying seasons require under arbours or sheds covered with boughs tending their flocks abroad or milking the ewes and shegoats at the fold and making cheese and butter to supply the city inured early to fatigue and the sun they are hardy and robust of manly carriage very different from that of the fawning obsequious greek and of very desperate bravery under every disadvantage when compelled by necessity or oppression their habit is simple and succinct reaching to the knees they have a national language and are members of the greek communion  the christians in athens both greeks and albanians are more immediately superintended by the archbishop and by the two epitropi or curators who are chosen from among the principal men and venerable for their long beards these endeavor to quiet all disputes and prevent the parties from recurring to the severe tribunal of the cadi or turkish judge watching over the commonwealth and regulating its internal policy which still retains some faint and obscure traces of the ancient popular form though without dignity or importance a traditional story is related at athens and in the east to illustrate the native quickness of apprehension which as if transmissive and the property of the soil is inherited even by the lower classes of people a person made trial of a poor shepherd whom he met with his flock demanding in greek from whence he came where going who he was and the number of his flock thus from whence and where and who and how many he was answered without hesitation and with equal brevity in the same language from athens to livadia theodore and five hundred in the citizens this aptitude not being duly cultivated instead of producing genius degenerates into cunning they are justly reputed a most crafty subtle and acute race it has been jocosely affirmed that no jew can live among them because he will be continually outwitted they are conscious of their subjection to the turks and as supple as depressed from the memory of the blows on the feet and indignities which they have experienced or seen inflicted and from the terror of the penalty annexed to resistance which is the forfeiture of the hand uplifted but their disposition as anciently is unquiet their repose disturbed by factious intrigues and private animosities the body politic weakened by division and often impelled in a direction opposite to its true interest they have two schools one of which possesses a small collection of books and is entitled to an annual payment from venice the endowment of a charitable athenian but the money is not regularly remitted  the liberty of the fair sex at athens is almost equally abridged by the turks and greeks their houses are secured with high walls and the windows turned from the streets and latticed or boarded up so as to preclude all intercourse even of the eyes the haram or apartment of the turkish women is not only impenetrable but must not be regarded on the outside with any degree of attention to approach them when abroad will give offense and in the town if they cannot be avoided it is the custom to turn to the wall and stand still without looking toward them while they pass this mode of carriage is good breeding at athens  the turkish women in this city claim an exemption from their confinement on one day only in the week when they visit their relations and are seen going in companies to the baths or sitting in the burying grounds on the graves of their friends their children husbands or parents they are then enwrapped and beclothed in such a manner it is impossible to discern whether they are young or old handsome or ugly their heads as low as the eyebrows are covered with white linen and also their faces beneath the prominency of the nose and mouth giving them nearly the visages of mummies they draw down a veil of black gauze over their eyes the moment a man or boy comes in view they wear short loose boots of leather red or yellow with a large sheet over their common garments and appear as in constantinople very bulky  the dress of the greek matrons is a garment of red or blue cloth the waist very short the long petticoat falling in folds to the ground a thin flowing veil of muslin with a golden rim or border is thrown over the head and shoulders the attire of the virgins is a long red vest with a square cape of yellow satin hanging down behind they walk with their hands concealed in the pocketholes at the sides and their faces are muffled sometimes they assume the turkish garb neither prudence nor modesty suffers a maiden to be seen by the men before she is married her beauty might inflame the turk who can take her legally by force to his bed on a sentence of the cadi or judge and the greek if she revealed her face to him even unwillingly would reject her as criminal and with disdain  the albanian women in athens are inured early to hard living labor and the sun their features are injured by penury and their complexions by the air their dress is coarse and simple a shift reaching to the ancle a thick sash about the waist and a short loose woollen vest their hair is platted in two divisions and the ends fastened to a red silken string which with a tassel is pendant to their heels and frequently laden with pieces of silver coin of various sizes diminishing gradually to the bottom among these the antiquarian may often discover medals of value they are seen carrying water on their backs in earthen jars with handles washing by the fountains or assembled by the ilissus after rain with the female slaves of the mahometans and other servants treading their linen or beating it with a piece of heavy wood spreading it on the ground or bushes to dry and conveying it to and fro in panniers or wickerbaskets on an ass their legs and feet are generally bare and their heads hooded as it were with a long towel which encircles the neck one extremity hanging down before and the other behind the girls wear a red skullcap plated with peraus or turkish pennies of silver perforated and ranged like the scales of fish  the greek will sometimes admit a traveller into his gynecaeum or the apartment of his women these within doors are as it were uncased and each a contrast of the figure she made when abroad there the girl like thetis treading on a soft carpet has her white and delicate feet naked the nails tinged with red her trowsers which in winter are of red cloth and in summer of fine callico or thin gauze descend from the hip to the ancle hanging loosely about her limbs the lower portion embroidered with flowers and appearing beneath the shift which has the sleeves wide and open and the seams and edges curiously adorned with needle work her vest is of silk exactly fitted to the form of the bosom and the shape of the body which it rather covers than conceals and is shorter than the shift the sleeves button occasionally to the hand and are lined with red or yellow satin a rich zone encompasses her waist and is fastened before by clasps of silver gilded or of gold set with precious stones over the vest is a robe in summer lined with ermine and in cold weather with fur the headdress is a skullcap red or green with pearls a stay under the chin and a yellow foreheadcloth she has bracelets of gold on her wrists and like aurora is rosyfigured the tips being stained her necklace is a string of zechins a species of gold coin or of the pieces called byzantines at her cheeks is a lock of hair made to curl toward the face and down her back falls a profusion of tresses spreading over her shoulders much time is consumed in combing and braiding the hair after bathing and at the greater festivals in enriching and powdering it with small bits of silver gilded resembling a violin in shape and woven in at regular distances she is painted blue round the eyes and the insides of the sockets with the edges on which the lashes grow are tinged with black  for coloring the lashes and socket of the eye they throw incense or gum of labdanum on some coals of fire intercept the smoke which ascends with a plate and collect the foot this says chandler i saw applied a girl sitting crosslegged as usual on a soa and closing one of her eyes took the two lashes between the forefinger and thumb of her left hand pulled them forward and then thrusting in at the external corner a bodkin which had been immersed in the foot and extracting it again the particles before adhering to it remained within and were presently ranged round the organ serving as a foil to its luster beads contributing as they say to its health and increasing its apparent magnitude  the improvement of the mind and morals is not considered as a momentous part of female education at athens the girls are taught to dance to play on the turkish guittar and the tympanum or timbrel and to embroider an art in which they generally excel a woman skilled in reading and writing is spoken of as a prodigy of capacity and learning the mother of osman aga a turk says chandler who visited our house was of this rare number as he often told us so terrible for her knowledge that even achmet aga her kinsman had been seen to tremble when he received her annual visit in common life the woman waits on her husband and after dressing the provisions which he purchased eats perhaps with a female slave the stately lord feeding alone or in company with men  provisions of all kinds are good and cheap at athens the frequent and severe fasts imposed by the greek church have an influence on the market the christians are often by the tenets of their religion confined to vegetables or to things without blood such as snails which they gather from the streets the cutlefish or seapolypus the latter called by the greeks octopodes from the number of its feet is beaten to make it tender and when boiled is white like the tail of a lobster but has not much flavor hares game and fowl may be purchased for little more than the value of the powder and shot oranges lemons and citrons grow in the gardens the grapes and melons are excellent and the figs were celebrated of old the wines are wholesome but the pitch infused to preserve them communicates a taste to which strangers are not perfectly reconciled  when the figs ripen a very small bird called by the italians beceafigo by the greeks sycophas appears and is continually settling on the branches of the tree and pecking the fruit if frightened away they return almost immediately and a person sitting in the corn or concealed by a thicket may fire with little intermission  they are eaten roasted entire each in a vine leaf and are accounted a great delicacy when the olives blacken vast flights of doves pigeons thrushes and other birds repair to the groves for food wild turkies are not rare the redlegged partridge with his numerous brood basks in the sun or seeks shade among the mastic bushes they are fond of the berries in the season and have then a strong but not disagreeable taste in winter woodcocks abound descending after snow on the mountains into the plain especially on the side of the cephissus and as suddenly retiring if the weather continues severe and the ground be frozen they enter the gardens of the town in great distress rather than cross the sea and are sometimes taken with the hand snipes teal widgeon ducks and the like are also foundin plenty a horse or ass is commonly provided by sportsmen who go in a party to bring home what they kill  hares are exceedingly numerous calling is practiced in still weather from the latter end of may to about the middle of august three or four men in a company stand silent and concealed in a thicket with guns pointed in different directions when all ready the caller applies his fingers to his lips and sucking them at first slowly and then faster produces a squeaking sound when the hares within hearing rush to the spot in this manner many are slaughtered in a day one of my companions says chandler with two or three greeks who were adepts killed eleven among which was a female big with young these animals are said to assemble together to leap and play at the full of the moon and it is likely the shepherds who live much abroad observing and listening to them learned to imitate their voices to deceive and make them thus foolishly abet their own destruction  the wild beasts which find shelter in the mountains greatly annoy the shepherds and their folds are constantly guarded by several large fierce dogs the person who killed a wolf was entitled by a law of solon to a reward if a female to one dram about sevenpence halfpenny if a male to five drachms afterward a talent or one hundred and eighty pounds sterling was paid for a young wolf and double that sum for a full grown the peasant now produces the skin in the bazar or market and is recompensed by voluntary contributions parnes the mountain toward the cephissus is haunted besides wolves by deer and foxes as it formerly was by wild boars and bears the sportsmen lie in ambush by the springs which they frequent waiting their approach in the dusk of the evening pliny mentions the deer bred about parnes and brilessus as remarkable for four kidneys and the hares as having two livers the latter peculiarity in some which we purchased was much noticed by our swiss who once brought the two livers for my inspection the youth of athens were anciently trained to hunting as a useful and manly exercise  a place where the fair sex bears no part in society will be justly supposed dull and uniform indeed a turk is generally a solemn solitary being with few visible enjoyments except his pipe and coffee the former is his constant companion it is his solace on the sopha and when squatting on his hams as he is sometimes seen in the shade by the door of his house or in a group looking on while the horses which are staked down with a rope feed in the season on the green corn when he is walking or riding it is carried in his hand or by an attendant the tube is of wood perforated commonly long and pliant and sometimes hung with small silver crescents and chains with a mouthpiece of amber the bowl is earthen and a bit of alse wood put into it while he is smoking augments his pleasure yielding a grateful perfume a silken embroidered bag is usually tucked in at his sack by his side and contains tobacco his horse his arms and haram are the other chief objects of his attention he is grave sententious and steady but fond of narrations and not difficult to be overcome by a story  the turks in this city observing we did not use the sign of the cross and being informed that we disapproved of the worshipping of pictures or images conceived says chandler a favorable opinion of us their abhorrence of hogflesh is unfeigned and we derived some popularity from a report which we did not contradict that we held it in equal detestation several of them frequented our table the principal turks came all to our house at night while it was ramazan or lent when they fast in the daytime and were entertained by us with sweatmeat pipes coffee and sherbet much to their satisfaction though distressed by our chairs some trying to collect their legs under them on the seats and some squatting down by the sides when we visited them adds chandler we were received with cordiality and treated with distinction sweet gums were burned in the middle of the room to scent the air or scattered on coals before us while sitting on the sofa to perfume our mustaches and garments and at the door on our departure we were sprinkled with rose water the vaiwode at certain seasons sent his musicians to play in our court the greeks were not less civil and at easter we had the company of the archons in a body several of them also ate often with us and we had daily presents of flowers sometimes perfumed of pomegranates oranges and lemons fresh gathered pastry and other like articles  the turks have few public games or sports we were present at a foot race and a wrestling match provided by a rich turk for the entertainment of his son and other boys who were about to be circumcised a train headed by the vaiwode and prniple men on horses richly caparisoned attended by the boys who were all neatly dressed their white turbans glitering with tinsel ornaments to a place without the city where carpets were spread for them on the ground in the shade and a multitude of spectators waited silent and respectful the race was soon over and the prizes were distributed to the winner a sufficient quantity of cloth for an upper garment to the next a live sheep to the third a kid to the fourth a huge watermelon the company then removed to a level spot the ruin of the temple of jupiter olympius and formed a large circle the wrestlers were naked except a pair of close drawers and were anointed all over with oil  some arabian and black slaves who had obtained their freedom and were settled at athens had a feast on the performance of the rite of the circumcision the women danced in a ring with sticks in their hands and turning in pairs clashed them over their heads at intervals singing wildly to the music a couple then danced with castanets and the other swarthy ladies sitting crosslegged on a sofa began smoking  athens was anciently enlivened by the choruses singing and dancing in the open air in the front of the temples of the gods and round their altars at the festival of bacchus and on other holidays the greeks are frequently seen engaged in the same exercise generally in pairs especially on the anniversaries of their saints and often in the areas before their churches their common music is a large tabour and pipe or a lyre and tympanum or timbrel some of their dances are undoubtedly of remote antiquity one has been supposed that which was called the crane and was said to have been invented by theseus after her escape from the labyrinth of crete the peasants perform it yearly in the street of the french convent at the conclusion of the vintage joining hands and preceding their mules and asses which are laden with grapes in panniers in a very curved and intricate figure the leader waving a handkerchief which has been imagined to denote the clew given by ariadne a grand circular dance in which the albanian women join is exhibited on certain days near the temple of theseus the company holding hands and moving round the musicians the leader footing and capering until he is tired when another takes his place they have also choral dances  marriages are commonly announced by loud music at the house of the bridegroom a turk or greek neither sees nor speaks to the maiden beforehand but for an account of her person and disposition relies on his female relations who have opportunities of seeing her in their visits and at the bath the turk when terms are adjusted with her family ratifies the contract before the cadi or judge and her presents if he be rich a band of musicians precede a train of peasants who carry each a sheep lamb or kid with the horns gilded on their shoulders and these are followed by servants with covered baskets on their heads containing female ornaments money and the like for her use and by slaves to attend her years often intervene before he requires her to be brought to his home the streets through which she is to pass are then left free and she is conducted to his house under a large canopy surrounded by a multitude of women all wrapped in white with their faces muffled if a turk finds a pair of papouches or slippers at the door of his haram it is a sign that a stranger is within and he modestly retires that apartment is even a sanctuary for females flying from the officers of justice  the papas or priest reads a service at the greek weddings the two persons standing and holding each a wax taper lighted a ring and gilded wreath or crown is used and at the end of the ceremony a little boy or girl as previously agreed on is led to the bride and kisses her hand she is then as it were enthroned in a chair and the husband remains at a respectful distance with his hands crossed silen and looking at her until the women enter and take her away when the men carouse in a separate apartment her face and hands are grossly daubed over with paint and sometimes the corehead and cheeks are bedecked with leafgold  the albanians convey the bride to the house of her husband in procession on horseback with a chid astride behind her a loose veil or canopy concealing her head and face her fingers laden with silver rings and her hands painted red and blue in streaks their dress is a red jacket handsomely embroidered with a colored turban the entertainments on these occasions consist of a great variety of dishes chiefly pastry ranged in summer under a long low arbor made with boughs the company sitting on the ground when the bride is to be removed to a place at a distance some women dance before her to the end of the town  the wife of a turk who lived near us dying we were alarmed says chandler on a sudden with a terrible shriek of women and with the loud expostulations of the husband she was carried to the grave at daybreak the greeks bury in their churches on a bier the bones when room is wanting are washed with wine in the presence of the nearest male relation and then removed i was present at a funeral entertainment provided by one of the archons whose daughter had been recently interred the procession set out from his house before sunrise headed by a papas or priest and some deacons with lighted candles the women who were left behind screaming and howling one man bore a large waxtaper painted with flowers and with the portrait of the deceased in her usual attire and hung round with a handerchief of her embroidering in gathers two followed carrying each on their heads a great dish of parboiled wheat the surface blanched almonds disposed in the figure of a dove with gilding and a border of raisins and pomegranate kernels these on our arrival at the church were deposited over the body the matins ended with a service appropriated to this ceremony and read by the priest near the spot the dishes were then brought round and each person in his place took a portion and was afterward helped in turn to a small glass of white brandy called raki or of wine the waxtaper with the handkerchief was suspended from the cieling as a memorial of the girl represented on it and some peraus or silver pennies were distributed to the poor who attended  the turks are a people never yet illuminated by science they are more ignorant than can easily be conceived the leisure of the greeks is chiefly employed in reading legendary stories of their saints translated into the vulgar tongue this and their nation they style the romano it has a close affinity with the ancient language which they call the hellenic but the grammar and syntax are much corrupted they speak rapidly and curtail many of their words which are farther depraved by incorrect spelling their pronuciation differs widely from the english they have no knowledge of the old quantity of syllables but adhere to the accents and compose verses in rhyme with great facility i enquired for manuscripts and was told of some belonging to the monastery of s cyriani on mount hymettus these were shown me with several books printed by aldus negligently scattered on the floor in a loft at athens where the hegumenos or abbot resided  credulity and superstition prevail at athens and all over the east the traveller may still hear of medeas women possessed of magic power and expert in various modes of incantation amulets or charms are commonly worn to repel any malignant influence children are seen with crosses or thin flat bits of gold called phylacteries hanging about their necks or on their foreheads the turks inscribe words from the koran the greeks confide in holy water which is sprinkled yearly on their houses by a priest to purify them and to drive away any demon who may have obtained entrance the insides of several of their churches are covered with representations of the exploits of their saints painted on the walls extravagant ridiculous and absurd beyond imagination the old athenian had a multitude of deities but relied chiefly on minerva the modern has a similar troop headed by his favorite panagea he listens with devout humility to fanciful tales of nightly visions and of miracles vouchsafed on the most trivial occasions the report is propagated and if on examination the forgery be detected on the spot the remoter devotee continues in his conviction and exults in the contemplation of the solid basis on which he conceives his faith to be founded in the first year of our residence in the levant says chandler a rumor was current that a cross of shining light had been seen at constantinople pendant in the air over the grand mosque once a church dedicated to st sophia and that the turks were in consternation at the prodigy and had endeavored in vain to dissipate the vapor the sign was interpreted to portend the exaltation of the christians above the mahometans and this many surmised was speedily to be effected disgust and jealousy then subsisting between the russians and the port and the georgians contending with success against the turkish armies by such arts as these are the wretched greeks preserved from despondency rouzed to expectation and consoled beneath the yoke of bondage  before we quit livadia it may not be amiss to mention delphos the modern castri which was much resorted to by the ancients on account of the temple of apollo and the dark cave from whence the pythian priestess used to deliver her oracles sitting upon a tripos  delphos or delphi says chandler was the chief and most illustrious city in phocis its sanctity was deduced through a long succession of ages from a period involved in fable and obscurity the influence of its god has controlled the councils of states directed the course of armies and decided the fate of kingdoms the ancient history of greece is full of his energy and an early register of his authority  the oracular power was supposed to reside in a deep cavern with a small and narrow mouth said to have been discovered by goatherds who were inspired by the vapor which arose out of it and prophesied as from apollo a lofty tripod decked with laurels was placed over the aperture the pythia or priestess after washing her body and especially her hair in the cold water of castalia mounted on it to receive the divine effluvia she wore a crown of laurel and shook a sacred tree which grew by sometimes she chewed the leaves the frenzy which followed may be attributed to this usage and the gentle or more violent symptoms to the quantity taken in one instance the paroxysm was so violent that the priests and suppliants ran away and left her alone to expire it was believed of the god her part was unpleasant but if she declined acting they dragged her by force to the tripod the habit of her order was that of virgins the rules enjoined temperance and chastity and prohibited luxury in apparel the season of enquiry was the spring after which apollo was supposed to visit the altars of the hyperboreans delphi was conveniently situated for the conflux of votaries lying in the center of greece and as was then imagined in the center of the universe the god prospered in his business his servants and priests feasted on the numerous victims and the riches of his temple were proverbial even before the wars of troy  the enclosure of the temple was of great extent and filled with treasures in which many cities had consecrated tenths of spoils taken in war and with the public donations of renowned states in various ages it was the grand repository of ancient greece in which the labors of the sculptor and statuary gods heroes and illustrious persons were seen collected and arranged the inequalities of the area or acclivity contributing to a full display of the noble assemblage  it was the opinion of wheeler that no mountain in greece was higher than parnassus on the side of which this city stood that it was not inferior to mount cenis among the alps and that if detached it would be seen at a greater distance than even mount athos the summits are perpetually increasing every new fall of snow adding to the perennial heap while the sun has power only to thaw the superficies  the water of castalia from which the pythia and the poets who versified her answers were believed to derive a large share of their inspiration descends through a cliff of parnassus the rocks on each side high and steep ending in two summits from one of which the delphians threw down the famous aesop by the stream within the cleft are small broken stairs leading to a cavity in which is water close by at the foot of the eastern precipice is a basin with steps on the margin once it is likely the bath used by the pythia the water is limpid and exceedingly cold returning from the village says chandler in the evening i began to wash my hands in it but was instantly chilled and seized with a tremor which rendered me unable to stand or walk without support on reaching the monastery i was wrapped in a garment lined with warm fur and drinking freely of wine fell into a most profuse perspiration this incident when apollo was dreaded might have been embellished with a superstitious interpretation perhaps the pythia who bathed in this icy fluid mistook her shivering for the god  adjoining to parnassus is helicon one of the most fertile and woody mountains in greece on it the fruit of the arbutus or strawberrytree was uncommonly sweet and the inhabitants affirm that the plants and roots were all friendly to man and that even the serpents had their poison weakened by the innoxious qualities of their food  the muses were the proprietors of helicon there was their shady grove and their images with statues of apollo and bacchus and linus and orpheus and the illustrious poets who had recited their verses to the harp the valleys of helicon are described by wheeler as green and flowery in the spring and enlivened by pleasing cascades and streams and by fountains and wells of clear water the grove of the muses was plundered under the auspices of constantine the great the heliconian goddesses were afterward consumed in a fire at constantinople to which city they had been removed their ancient sent on the mountain is not ascertained narcissus too is forgotten the limpid basin in which he gazed was shown in the thespian territory and the flower into which he was changed continues to love and adorn its native soil it abounded in that region and was very fragrant in the month of april  thiva the ancient thebes was the capital of that subdivision of greece called boeotia the town is not more than three miles in circumference at present and is inhabited chiefly by greek christians of its ancient grandeur no vestiges remain it produced several great men particularly pindar epaminondas pelopidas and some say hercules and bacchus according to the poetic fiction it was in this city that amphion charmed the stones by the music of his harp to march and place themselves in the walls  of plataea likewise situated between thebes and athens where pausanias who commanded the lacedemonian army obtained that signal victory over the persians which ruined the ambitious designs of xerxes against greece scarce any remains whatever are to be discerned  chap xxvi a description of the morea called peloponnesus by the ancients the morea is almost an island but joins to the continent or country of proper greece by a narrow neck of land called the isthmus of corinth so famed for the isthmian games celebrated there in honor of neptune it anciently consisted of the following small kingdoms sicyon argos and mycene corinth proper achaia arcadia and laconia its present name of the morea is said to be derived from morus a mulberrytree either from its resembling the leaf of that tree in shape or from the great number of mulberrytrees it produces  the chief rivers in it are   the carbon anciently the alpheus this river the poets feigned to pass under the ionian sea and rose again in sicily it rises from the mountain stymphalus taking its course through arcadia and being joined by the rivers celadon and amyrinth falls into the ionian sea   eurotas which rising in arcadia passes through laconia or lacedaemon and discharges itself in the bay of colochina   styx one of the rivers of hell according to poetic fiction whose waters are so excessive cold that the drinking of them endangers a mans life it is to the extraordinary qualities it possesses of corroding iron and copper that the old poets have called it the river of hell the morea has not only several mountains but also many fertile and delightful plains at the treaty of carlowitz the turks ceded all the morea to the venetians but in the year      again dispossessed them of it it is divided into four districts  saccania or romania minor contains the ancient cities of corinth sicyon and argos  corinth by the turks called gereme is a celebrated town at the foot of acrocorinth on which stands a castle having a most beautiful prospect on every side the original name of this city was ephyra with the addition of heliopolis or city of the sun and bimaris which signifies a place lying between two seats it was anciently one of the finest cities in all greece and abounded in stately buildings such as temples palaces amphitheatres porticos monuments baths and other works all ornamented with pillars cornices and pedestals whose singular decorations gave rise to the appellation of the corinthian order with numbers of statues by the greatest masters but its edifices being demolished at present and the spot on which it stood filled up with little gardens and fields it looks much more like a village than a city and what is still worse is frequently exposed to the descent of the corsairs it is however the seat of a greek archbishop the christians here from some passages in st pauls epistles appear to have been very numerous  the fertility of the country round corinth was alluded to by the witty oracle which answered a person who enquired what he should do to become rich that he needed only to get all the land between corinth and sicyon  the city of corinth says chandler stands on the isthmus on the side of the peloponnesus a situation once peculiarly happy from which all its ancient prosperity was derived its ports were commodiously disposed by nature to receive the ships of europe and of asia and to render it the center of their commerce the circumnavigation of the peloponnesus was tedious and uncertain to a proverb whilst at the isthmus not only their cargoes but if requisite smaller vessels could be transported from sea to sea the isthmus in the narrowest part was only five miles over corinth held the keys of the peninsula and taxed both the ingress and egress resembling in some measure in this particular the citadel at the entrance of the crimea the isthmian games likewise by the concourse of people at their celebration contributed to its opulence which was immense the temple of venus possessed above a thousand female slaves consecrated as courtesans the prodigality of the merchants made the place so expensive that it was a saying not every man could go to corinth the citadel was called one of the horns on which philip was advised to lay hold in order to secure the heiser or the peloponnesus it has also been styled one of the fetters of greece  various attempts have been made to open a communication between the ionian and the aegean sea by a navigable cut through the isthmus the project was adopted by demetrius poliorceles but his surveyors found the waters in the corinthian gulf much higher than on the opposite shore and were of opinion that aegina and the neighboring islands would be flooded and the canal be unserviceable it was revived by julius caesar and caligula nero commenced a fosse from lechaeum and advanced about half a mile atticus herodes was ambitious of engaging in it but as nero had failed was afraid of offending the emperor by asking his permission all those says pausanias who have endeavored to render the peloponnesus an island have been prevented while laboring to divide the isthmus it is manifest where they began digging and the rock is untouched as it was made originally it remains and is now a continent  so difficult is it for man to force nature the vestiges of these fruitless efforts which pausanias saw in the second century says chandler are still extant  in the district of zachonia or braccio di mania which formerly comprehended laconia and arcadia stands lacedaemon or sparta now named misitra it is supposed to have been founded a thousand years before the building of rome the form of the city was circular and its circumference about six miles few cities ever attained such a height of military glory the spartans received their laws from lycurgus the two chief magistrates had the title of kings but were in reality subject to the senate they were afterward governed by five magistrates called the ephori who were deposed by cleomenes but he being subdued by the macedonians laconia became a province to that city  the modern town of misitra is an episcopal see and consists of four divisions the town the castle and two large suburbs the town lies at the foot of the castle and consists of two spacious streets with several others crossing them at right angles the old marketplace is beautified with a noble fountain and a church built out of the ruins of minervas temple here are also the ruins of the gallery or portico built in memory of the victory obtained over the persians at the battle of plateae with some remains of the temples of helen hercules and venus armata all built of white marble without the walls are still to be seen the grove of planetrees where the spartans held their annual games and exercises  of olympia situated on the borders of the river alpheus scarce any vestiges are to be seen this place was rendered excessively illustrious in the times of ancient greece by the power and reputation of its princes by the oracle and temple of the olympian jupiter and by the renown of the agon or games in which to be victorious was deemed the very summit of human felicity  the jupiter of olympia was accounted sufficient to immortalize its maker phidias it was of ivory and gold the head crowned with olive in the right hand was a statue of victory and in the left a flowered scepter composed of various metals on which was an eagle the sandals were of gold as was also the vestment which was curiously embossed with lilies and animals the throne was gold inlaid with ebony and ivory and studded with jewels intermixed with paintings and exquisite figures in relievo the image impressed on the spectators an opinion that it was higher and wider than it really measured its magnitude was such that though the temple was very large the artist seemed to have erred in the proportions the god sitting nearly touched the ceiling with his head and suggested an idea that if he were to rise up he would destroy the roof a part of the pavement before it was of black marble enclosed in a rim of parian or white where they poured oil to preserve the ivory  pasaunias declares that a person may see many things wonderful to tell of among the greeks but that the olympic agon or games with the eleusinian mysteries partook in a special manner of the deity the former grand exhibition was conducted with prodigious solemnity  from the silence of homer it has been argued that the four great spectacles of games in greece either did not exist when he wrote or were in no repute that of olympia however deduced its origin from remote antiquity and continued to a late period undergoing several alterations  the computation of time by olympiads which began about four hundred years after the destruction of map of the islands in the archipelago map of the greek isles troy was used until the reign of theodosius the great when a new mode of reckoning by indictions or from the victory of augustus caesar at actium was introduced the olympic games with general assembly were abolished and the image made by phidias was removed to constantinople jupiter and pelops were banished from the seat which they had possessed for ages olympia has since been forgotten in its vicinity but the name will be ever respected as venerable for its precious era by the chronologer and historian  chap xxvii the islands in greece forming part of or adjoining to the cyclades the grecian islands may be divided according to the seas in which they lie namely in the archipelago the mediterranean and the parts about candia and the ionian sea as it was anciently called  we shall first treat of the islands in the archipelago formerly called the aegean sea but receiving its present name from the greek arkos chief and pelagos a sea it being the longest and principal sea in those parts this sea separates europe from asia to the north and west washing romania macedonia and greece and to the east natolia and asia minor it is interspersed with many large and small islands comprised by ancient geographers under two general names those which form a kind of circle round delos are called cyclades i e the circle islands but those which lie farther off from delos and are scattered all over the archipelago they call sporades i e the scattered islands  delos the center of the cyclades is situated in twentyfive degrees east longitude and thirtyseven degrees north latitude of an oblong figure near twice as long as it is broad and about six miles in circumference it has the south part of mycone on the west the channel between it and tinos on the north and the island of rhenia on the east it is called little delos or zdeli in the plural number including the island of rhenia the reason of its being so celebrated by the ancients was that this island was held to be the birthplace of apollo and diana the islands therefore about it sent thither priests sacrifices and choirs of virgins instituting great and public festivals to their two deities the number of their superstitious cyclades was at first but twelve but afterward comprehended most of the islands in the aegean sea upon the destruction of corinth the wealth and trade of that city seemed to be transferred hither it being much frequented from the safety of its harbors and the convenience of its situation being in the center between europe and asia but more especially on account of its immunities and freedom from customs and impositions there are still great heaps of ruins on this island some of which belonged to the temple of apollo as appears by the trunk of his statue still remaining this god has been handled so rudely that they have left him neither hands feet nor head but his locks hanging round his shoulders are still to be seen having marks in each curl where apparently jewels had been set his girdle also appeared to have been richly adorned and on his left shoulder was a light mantle the statue was four times larger than life the shoulders being six feet broad and the rest of the trunk proportionable on the declivities of the hills are some very beautiful fragments of porticos and other ancient buildings  the greater delos is separated from the lesser by a channel about five hundred paces in breadth and is about eighteen miles in circumference the mountains are not very high and afford excellent pasturage the valleys would produce corn and wine if they were cultivated but this island like the other delos is entirely deserted except that the inhabitants of mycone send over shepherds with large herds of cattle which they are frequently obliged to transport back to their own island to preserve them from the pirates that infest these seas tournfort relates that he saw near one hundred and fifty altars among the ruins which then made a very stately appearance they were mostly three feet and a half in height and about three feet in diameter the harbor of this island is called port mastick from the great number of mastick trees growing near it  mycone lies about three miles to the east of the lesser delos and is nearly thirty miles round there is scarce a well in the country and very little wood the soil produces corn wine and figs and some few olives they make five and twenty or thirty thousand hogsheads of wine every year the number of inhabitants in this island are computed at three thousand most of the men follow a seafaring life and have the character of being pirates the plunder at least is brought to this island by other pirates who keep their wives and mistresses here the wives of the seamen are for the most part temporary ones the women in general here being more in repute for their beauty than their chastity a traveller relates that the captain of a vessel he sailed with purchased a young girl from her parents who people of the isle of mycone with a greekboat with seeming reluctance suffered herself to be carried on board and was followed by a great number of young girls from eleven to fifteen years of age nearly a hundred to the seaside not to prevent the rape but to give indications by the wantonness of their gestures how much they wished to have been carried off in like manner the day following the captain gave an entertainment to his officers as if it had been his wedding having dressed the girl in a rich white venetian habit the dress of the women of mycone is very singular and scarce reaches below their knees the men wear large trowsers gathered below the knee  most of the inhabitants are christians of the greek church and have magistrates of their own but an officer of the turks comes annually to collect the tribute they are obliged to pay to the port a cadi also frequently visits them and holds a court in the island that those who may have any disputes may bring their causes before him to decide and the greeks it seems are frequently so ridiculous as to come before this tribunal in preference to submitting their causes to be decided by their own magistrates there are no less than fifty greek churches in this island with several monasteries and a nunnery the convents of this island however are mostly deserted the people here not appearing very fond of a monastic life  the island of naxia or naxos lies fifty miles to the south of mycone and eight miles east of paros it is of an oval form and nearly an hundred miles in circumference there is but one town which lies on the south side of the island and about forty villages inhabited by greek and latin christians of whom the former are most numerous the prejudices which the greeks and latin christians are scarce to be conceived the turks however make no distinction between them on the arrival of the smallest turkish galliot the christians dare not appear without a red cloth upon their head like the meanest galley slave but as soon as the turks are gone the naxian nobility resume their former pride and consequence covered with their velvet caps and discoursing of nothing but their families and pedigrees the ladies are no less vain than the men and are to be seen returning from the country after the vintage with a train of thirty or forty females some mounted on asses and others on foot one carrying a pair of stockings another a towel a third a dish and there the ladies wardrobe and furniture is exposed to public view she herself makes her entrance into the city at the head of this cavalcade whilst the husband brings up the rear the naxian nobility remain for the most part at their country houses inviting one another but seldom and occupying themselves in hunting and other rural diversions the villages are not very populous there not being above eight thousand inhabitants in the island they have however two archbishops one of the romish and the other of the greek church the capuchins have a convent in naxia and apply themselves with great zeal to make proselytes from among the greeks for as to convicting the mahometans there is no instance of their attempting to convert any mussulman to christianity so severe is the punishment inflicted by the turks on those who endeavor to make proselytes among them the greek archbishop has a handsome revenue and the islands of paros and antiparos are within his jurisdiction  the people here elect their own governors as in most of the other islands but are sometimes visited by a cadi to whom they may appeal as the last resource they are also annually visited by an officer to collect the taxes which amount to ten thousand crowns a year and upwards the meanest turkish officer who comes on the island but occasionally is in a manner governor whilst he remains there and will order whom he pleases to undergo the bastinado at these times all the controversies of the islanders about their quality and precedence seem to vanish every one officiously makes his court to the haughty turk and endeavors to insinuate himself into his favor the common people seem to lead as merry and as thoughtless lives here as in other islands they derive themselves from bacchus and have plenty of good wine and if they are slaves they are the merriest in europe  among their antiquities is still standing a beautiful marble gate in the midst of a heap of magnificent ruins upon a rock in the sea at a small distance from the castle this is said to have been the palace of bacchus but tournfort is of opinion they are the remains of a temple dedicated to that god dia the highest mountain in the island which signifies the mountain of jupiter formerly gave name to the island toward the base on a rough block of marble is an inscription signifying that this was the mountain of jupiter the preserver of flocks and a grotto is shown to strangers where it is pretended the bacchants celebrated their orgies  about six or seven miles to the west of naxia is the island of paros which is about forty miles in circumference it is famous for its extraordinary white marble and had also most excellent artists for working it those celebrated antiques called the chronicles of paros are marble having greek inscriptions performed on this island and bought in the year      by thomas howard earl of arundel who in      made a present of them to the university of oxford and they are now called the arundelian or oxonian marbles the inscription is the most authentic piece of ancient chronology being made two hundred and sixtyfour years before the christian era and contains a space of above three hundred years  they contain the most remarkable greek epochs from the reign of cecrops who was the founder of the athenian monarchy to diogenes the archon and it is from this monument we became acquainted with the foundation of the most famous cities in greece and are informed when their greatest men flourished  the town of parichia seems to stand on the ruins of the ancient paros the walks and houses being decorated with several fine marble remains of that city besides the monuments in the adjacent country the panagia or madonia without the city is both the largest and most splendid church in the archipelago in this island besides a great number of churches and chapels are several considerable villages a large fleet may lie conveniently and securely in the harbor of st maria but the common anchoring place for the turkish navy is drio on the west side of the island  antiparos about a mile from paros is a flat rock about sixteen miles in circumference covered in some places with a stratum of vegetable earth which producs corn enough for about sixty or eighty families who inhabit a small village about a mile from the sea there is very little in this island deserving notice except a very remarkable grotto about forty fathoms in height and fifty in breadth the roof forms an arch embellished with fretwork and in some places there are bunches of grapes festoons etc of a surprising length or something resembling on the right and left are formed several little closets or cabinets and among other things there is a large pavilion formed by productions so exactly representing the roots branches and heads of cauliflowers as if nature intended to show how she operates in the vegetation of stone all these figures are of white marble transparent and crystalized and many of them covered with a white back which if struck against sounds like copper there are also several columns of marble planted like trunks of trees on the tuft of a little rock these stones of marble certainly vegetate for not a single drop of water ever falls into the place and if it did it is not conceivable how a few drops falling from a height of twentyfive or thirty fathoms should form cylindrical pieces terminating like round caps  adjoining to paros is santorini or st erini it is eight miles in length and as much in breadth and almost covered with pumicestone whence the soil in general must be dry and barren it is however greatly improved by the industry of the inhabitants who have turned it into a garden it affords a great deal of barley plenty of cotton and large quantities of wine in which and their cotton manufactures their trade consists fruit is scarce except figs and they have neither oil nor wood they kill their beeves but once a year and then they put the flesh in pickle which in time makes it very hard the inhabitants are all greeks and about ten thousand in number pyrgos is the capital town they have but one spring in the island which obliges them to preserve the rainwater in cisterns  acroteri adjoining to the above is an island much talked of in natural history it appears to be only a pumicestone incrusted with a fertile earth and according to the accounts of the ancients rose in a violent earthquake out of the sea as a volcano the same origin had four other islands near santorini and the sea here is of such a depth as not to be fathomed by any soundingline the first of these islands rose out of the sea after a violent earthquake in the year  0  before the birth of christ and in the beginning of the eighth century a new island suddenly appeared with a terrible explosion which shook all the neighboring islands and adhered to the former island which thereby became considerably enlarged at the same time showers of pumicestones were cast up to a vast distance on all sides the second island which lies a little without the harbor of santorini sprung from the sea in the first century after the christian era in the year      a sudden fire burst out of the sea and soon produced a new island to which was given the name of the small burnt island in the years   0  and   0  a fourth island rose like a volcano attended with an eruption of fire concussions a crash like the loudest thunder and a noisome smoke and has been gradually increased by additional rocks  cytheria a small rocky island between candia and the morea is remarkable for nothing but having been attributed by the poets to be the birthplace of venus and of helen whose enlevement by paris occasioned the siege of troy  melos situated likewise in the archipelago between candia and the morea but more to the north is of considerable extent and said to contain about twenty thousand inhabitants this island is one hollow spungy rock which the salt water enters by a great number of subterraneous passages and mixing with the sulphur which abounds here occasions almost continual fires the hollow rock of melos is a kind of natural stone gently warming the superfices of the earth in most places and thereby causing it to produce the choicest fruits particularly grapes figs and melons the best in the archipelago so fertile is the soil that it never lies fallow one year it produces wheat another barley a third pease and beans melons etc their fields are like so many gardens separated from each other by stone walls for eatables besides butchers meat they have fowl fish and game in great plenty though they live in a sickly unwholesome air and upon the surface of a burning lake as it were which they may expect every day should break out and destroy them and their country they are as merry as greeks used formerly to be and indulge in the good things they thus abundantly possess neither the sickness the turkish tyranny nor burning caverns in the bowels of the island can digest the spirits of the merry meliotes the inhabitants of melos are generally seafaring men and serve as pilots to ships which sail in the archipelago the chastity of their women is equal to that of the ladies of some other seaports tournfort says they are arrant coquets and use the powder of a seaplant to give a ruddiness to their complexion but it soon destroys their skin and spoils their beauty they wear drawers like the rests of the females in the levant which seem a very necessary part of their dress their petticoats scarce reaching to their knees  there are two turkish magistrates in the island the cadi and the waivode the one a civil and the other a military officer but their principal employ seems to be to take care that the sultan is not defrauded of his duties and to extort as much as they can from the poor greeks to fill their own pockets the greeks have here as in the other islands the privilege of electing their own magistrates who decide all controversies among them though sometimes they are so indiscreet as to appeal to the cadi and make an infidel their judge  the modern name of this island says savary is milo or mile anciently it had a town of the same name built by the phenicians that maritime people attracted by the beauty of the port undoubtedly made it an emporium of their commerce in early antiquity this island enjoyed perfect freedom the athenians unable to bring the people of melos to declare in their favor in the peloponnesian war made a descent upon their coasts and laid all waste before them with fire and sword twice did they fail in their enterprise but returning with more numerous forces they laid siege to melos and having reduced the besieged to surrender at discretion according to strabo put to the sword every man capable of bearing arms they spared only the women and children whom they carried into captivity this atrocious action makes us blush for humanity and dishonours the athenian name but war was then carried on with a barbarity of which we have now no example republics know not how to pardon and always carry their vengeance to excess lysander the lacedaemonian general having in his turn subdued the athenians obliged them to recall the colony they had sent to melos and restored to the island the wretched remains of its inhabitants  the island lost its liberty when the romans aspiring to the empire of the world conquered the whole archipelago in the partition of that monarchy it fell to the eastern emperors was afterward governed by its own dukes and finally was conquered by solomon ii since that period it has groaned beneath ottoman despotism and is completely deprived of its importance  tournfort says savary who visited this island in   00 gives a delightful description of it the earth constantly heated by subterraneous fires produces almost without intermission wheat barley cotton exquisite wines and delicious melons s elic the most beautiful monastery in the island and situated on the highest ground is surrounded by cedars and orange lemon and fig trees the gardens are watered by copious streams olive trees which are rare in other parts are very numerous round this monastery and the adjoining vineyards furnish excellent wine in a word all the productions of the island are of incomparable excellence its partridges quails kids and lambs are in high estimation yet extremely cheap  could tournfort adds savary return to milo he would no longer find the beauteous isle he has described he would still see the feathered alum with silver threads suspended from the roofs of caverns fragments of pure sulphur filling the crevices of the rocks numerous mineral springs hot baths and the same fires which in his time heated the bosom of the earth and rendered it so fertile but instead of the many thousand greeks paying the capitation he would now find on a surface of eighteen leagues in circumference only about seven hundred inhabitants he would sigh to behold the finest parts of the country without cultivation and fertile valleys changed into morasses milo has assumed a very different appearance within the course of the last fifty years the plague every where propagated by the turks has cut off the greatest part of its inhabitants and the detestable government of the port and the oppressions of the captain pacha have completed its destruction at present the want of laborers prevents their giving a free course to the water which stagnating in the valleys turns fetid and infects the air with putrid exhalations the salt marshes which have multiplied for want of care have produced the same effect if to their inconveniences the sulphurous vapors which arise on every side are added it will not be surprising that the inhabitants of mile are tormented with violent fevers during three quarters of the year nay possibly they will be under the necessity of totally abandoning their country their complexions are universally of a yellow pale and deadly hue nor is the look of health to be found in any one of them the prudent traveller should take care to make but a short stay in this unhealthy country if he would not expose himself to a fever only to sleep a single night in the island nay even to pass a day there is sometimes sufficient to contract that disease  an enlightened government says the above author might remove these calamities which have so depopulated melos its first care ought to be to establish a lazaretto and prevent the approach of infected vessels canals should then be cut to drain the marshes from which arise pestiferous exhalations the island would repeople for the sulphurous vapors are not what most render it desolate it produced them equally in the time of the ancients yet it was extremely populous to the description therefore of the turkish government and its detestable politics must we attribute the destruction of the island of melos let me not be accused says savary of painting the turks in colors blacker than they deserve i have traveled through their empire i have seen the injuries of every kind which they have done to the sciences the arts and the human race i see them carrying the plague from island to island from country to country without suffering their eyes to be opened by the example of every other nation and shall i not raise my voice against the abominable indifference of this barbarous people shall i not inveigh against their destructive fatalism and endeavor to find words sufficiently forcible to paint the crimes and horrors of their government the enemy of the human species which has destroyed more men by its odious tyranny than ever fell by the sword of the most cruel conqueror at the sight of these melancholy spectacles my heart groans and is filled with indignation my blood boils in my veins and i could wish to excite all europe to combine against these turks who descending from the mountains of armenia have crushed the nations in their passage and waded through rivers of blood to the throne of constantinople nor have the beautiful countries they inhabit been able to soften the ferocity of their character power is their law and justice their sabre  adjoining to melos is the little island of argentiera formerly famous for its silver mines the soil is extremely dry and destitute of springs nor is there any water but what is collected in cisterns or brought from melos the hills vales and the whole country stripped of trees do not offer a single shade from the sun the venetians during their war with the turks cut down all the olive trees and did irreparable damage to the island nor do the present inhabitants dare to make fresh plantations lest they should draw on themselves heavier impositions  argentiera presents nothing but rocky hills destitute of verdure and valleys producing worthless shrubs and thorny thickets the vales are generally covered with a white and fat clay called by the ancients terra cimolia fullers earth and which the inhabitants employ instead of soap to wash their linen this barren soil seems but ill adapted to agriculture yet the industrious islanders make it produce them a subsistence they sow barley and wheat in the beginning of autumn which is the rainy season and reap in march their vineyards on the hillsides furnish them with fruit only for the table they procure their wines from santorini milo and other islands of the archipelago they rear poultry and flocks of goats and sheep the flesh of which is excellent the country affords them quails hares and partridges in abundance the women knit cotton stockings and the men employ themselves in fishing and navigation excellent fish are taken round the island especially the roujet which is very delicate eating  the little tribe which inhabits argentiera is composed of about five hundred persons their enjoyments are not many but thanks to their industry they want none of the necessaries of life this little island does not groan under the immediate oppressions of the officers of the port here are no agas nor cadis the turks would not venture to reside here as there is no fort to prevent the maltese from making them prisoners whose privateers come hither from time to time to spend in feasts entertainments and pleasures of every kind the money they have taken from the mahometans this is a tribute they pay to the pretty women of argentiera in a word the greeks who inhabit this rock would be happy were the captain pacha but to forget them in the annual contributions he levies frequently with barbarity on the islands of the archipelago  the dress of the greek women of argentiera is in some particulars a little whimsical in france and england a neat leg and small foot are in high estimation but the belles of argentiera are of a different opinion they swell out their legs by wearing several pair of stockings and appear as if they were booted which strange kind of ornament they consider as an essential part of dress and lest it should be lost to the eye their garments do not descend above two inches below the knee these too are so contrived as absolutely to spoil their shape and render it impossible to form any idea of the beautiful proportions with which they were formed by nature in other respects they are cheerful lively and handsome if it be represented to them that they disguise by such preposterous ornaments some of the loveliest of their charms their answer is our grandmother did so before us and we do but follow their custom  thermia lies to the northeast of melos it receives its name from the hotbaths which are in the island this island is not so mountainous as many others and the soil being well cultivated yields plenty of barley wine and figs but wheat and oil are very scarce it is computed there are about six thousand inhabitants in the island they have a greek bishop residing in the city of thermia the capital in which there are fifteen or sixteen churches and several convents there are a number of hot springs in this island the ancient baths were situated in the center of a valley the fragments of which are still remaining on the island are still visible the ruins of two cities one of which on the south coast must have been of extraordinary splendour  a few miles to the west of thermia lies zia or ceos in this island are many remains of antiquity it is about fifty miles round carthea is now the only city remaining it is situated on the side of a hill and the flat roofed houses rising gradually form a kind of theater the roofs of the houses are the only streets there are to walk in the valley near the town contains innumerable pieces of broken columns or pedestals the first will admit the largest vessels the ruins of the city of ioulis occupy an entire mountain an ancient temple is still to be seen the columns of which have their shafts half plain and half fluted from this temple there is a descent from the seashore by a noble marble staircase at the foot is the statue of a woman without arms or head but the drapery exquisitely fine it is supposed to be the goddess of nemesis in this island likewise are the remains of a road paved with flat stones extending three miles in length and supposed to have been made when greece was in its flourishing state it is said that this country having formerly been very populous a law was enacted if any person lived above sixty years that it should be lawful to poison him or put him to death by any other means and it is said the natives had such an indifference for life that they very cheerfully resigned it  syra is another small island to the east of zia the principal city is built round the sides of a little steep hill in the form of a pyramid at the distance of a mile from the port where stood the ancient syros in this island the romish clergy boast of a great superiority in numbers over those of the greek communion the people of this island are also said to be of a character very different from that of their neighbors being persons of strict piety and honesty as well as diligence and improving their manufactures to the utmost  andros lies fifty miles northeast of zia and is in circumference about an hundred miles its length however is much greater than the breadth the principal town is situated near the sea and called the port of the lower castle its ancient monuments show it was built on the ruins of some magnificent city though nothing can be more despicable than the present buildings considering the materials of which they are constructed the dress of the women of this island like that of the other islands is not very becoming their petticoats scarce reaching to their knees and their shifts coming down still lower they generally wrap themselves up in five or six gowns and wear large rolls of cloth about their waists like farthingales the sleeves of their gowns are so very ample that they reach almost to the ground on their legs they wear white cloth stockings with slippers instead of shoes for their feet a piece of linen is wrapped round their heads which likewise covers their breasts the usual garb of the men is a vest and a red cap and instead of shoes they wear pumps or slippers a custom very prevalent in the east  this is one of the most fertile islands in the archipelago yielding great plenty of wine oil and barley with some wheat but their principal riches consist in silk their mountains are covered with the arbututrees from which they distill a spirit as they do from their mulberries  on the ruins of the ancient paleopolis situated on the brow of a hill near the sea are seen the fragments of a solid wall with columns chapitres bases and inscriptions mentioning the senate and people of andros and the priests of bacchus the trunks of several statues likewise bespeak the hand of some masterly engraver but the different members have been mutilated by the turks who have an utter aversion to images near the temple of bacchus was a fountain which according to tradition on certain days every year flowed with wine instead of water  tine or tinos lies about a mile to the southeast of andros this island is about sixty miles in circumference it is well watered and produces great quantities of corn wine and fruit and particularly silk of which the inhabitants make stockings and gloves they dress here in a more decent style than that of the other islands following the venetian fashions this island having been longer under the dominion of the venetians than any other in the archipelago from the castle is a noble prospect of the adjacent isles  chap xxviii other islands of the archipelago having now taken a cursory view of those islands which either make part or are adjoining to the cyclades we propose to treat of the other islands in the archipelago most of which either lie near or are considered by many geographers as belonging to the asiatic coast negropont and one or two others excepted  stalimene anciently lemnos is an island in the north part of the archipelago of a quadrangular figure each side being from five and twenty to thirty miles in length and is equally distant from the coasts of romania natolia and macedonia the principal source of wealth in this island is a mineral earth called terra lemnia which is said to be an excellent medicine for healing wounds expelling poisons stopping dysenteries etc and a great preservative against infection it is made up in little bags and sealed by the turkish officers after which it is permitted to be vended and exported  the greeks begin to collect it on the  th of august with much superstitious ceremony there is only one hill which produces it the surface of the ground being dug up they easily find the vein resembling earth cast up by worms after as much being taken up as the priests approve and put into bags the ground is covered over as before and some bags of this earth are sent as presents to the grand signior and the rest sold to the foreign merchants by the sanjiac or his deputies the inhabitants keeping this earth in their houses without his permission are punished with death  when the venetians possessed this island there were between forty and fifty towns and villages upon it and the island was well inhabited but at present it is very thinly peopled it was upon this island that the poets feign vulcan to have fallen when kicked out of paradise by juno for his deformity and that being lamed in his fall he was called lemnius and worshipped by the people of the island as a decrepid deity  the island tenedos which lies between lemnos and the continent of asia is chiefly rock but fertile it was anciently reckoned about ten miles in circumference its position near the mouth of the hellepont has given it importance in all ages vessels bound toward constantinople finding shelter in its port or safe anchorage in the road during the etesian winds and in foul weather the emperor justinian erected a magazine to receive the cargoes of the cornships from alexandria when detained there this building was two hundred and eighty feet long ninety broad and very lofty the voyage from egypt was rendered less precarious and the grain preserved until it could be transported to the capital afterward during the troubles of the greek empire tenedos experienced a variety of fortunes the pirates which infested these seas made it for many years their place of rendezvous and othman seized it in   0  procured vessels and from thence subdued the other islands of the archipelago  the port of tenedos has been enclosed in a mole of which no part appears above water but loose stones are piled on the foundations to break the waves the basin is encompassed by a ridge of the mountain on the south side is a row of windmills and a small fort and on the opposite a castle by the shore the houses which are numerous stand at the foot or on the slope of an acclivity with a flat between them and the sea formed partly by soil washed down from above they reckon six hundred turkish and three hundred greek families the church belonging to the latter is decent  we found here but few remains of antiquity says chandler worthy notice we perceived on our landing a large and entire sarcophagus or stone coffin serving as a fountain the top stone or lid being perforated to admit a current of water which supplies the vent below and on one side is an inscription near this was part of a fluted column converted into a mortar for bruising corn and in a shop was a remnant of tessellated pavement then recently discovered in the streets the walls and burying grounds were pieces of marble and fragments of pillars with a few inscriptions  in the evening this being sunday and a festival we were much amused with seeing the greeks who were singing and dancing in several companies to music near the town while their women were sitting in groups on the roofs of the houses which are flat as spectators at the same time enjoying the soft air and serene sky  we were lodged much to our satisfaction in a large room with a raised floor matted in which we slept in our clothes in company with two jews and several greeks a cool breeze entering all night at the latticed windows and sweetening our repose  in these countries on account of the heat it is usual to rise with the dawn about daybreak we received from the french consul a greek with a respectable beard a present of grapes the clusters large and rich with other fruits all fresh gathered we had besides bread and coffee for breakfast and good wines particularly one sort of an exquisite flavor called muscadell the island is deservedly famous for the species of wine which produces this delicious liquor  mitylene anciently lesbos situated a few leagues from elca in lesser asia is of considerable extent and though some part is mountainous and barren it has many fruitful plains which produce plenty of corn the chief town is castro anciently mitylene having a strong garrison to protect the island against the pirates which infest very much these seas in this island are said to be upwards of a hundred villages it has given birth to and been the residence of some of the greatest men of antiquity theophrastus and phanios disciples of aristotle were natives of this island the famous arion also was born here whose skill in music charmed the dolphins so that they carried him safe to the shore epicurus read lectures at mitylene and aristotle resided there for many years though few islands indeed have produced men of greater genius yet all their grave lectures it seems could not reform their morals it being a proverb in greece when speaking of a profligate fellow to say he lived like a lesbian  in this island there still subsists two very singular institutions the first is that all estates both real and personal descend to the eldest daughters whereby all the males and the younger children of the female line are disinherited this custom is of very ancient date and is said to have been consented to by the males out of love to their sisters and to procure better establishments for them the mytylenians says guys informed me that the men would have no difficulty in getting their right of inheritance restored if they chose to claim the benefit of the turkish law which admits the children of both sexes to an equal share in the parents fortune but the man who should attempt to promote his interest by an appeal to a foreign power would for ever appear infamous in the eyes of his countrymen  the other is that in a small town about three days journey from the capital every stranger upon his arrival is compelled to marry one of the women even though his stay should be for a night only they generally present a maiden to him whom he must absolutely espouse or if he should prove to be a man of great property or importance several females are presented and he has the selection of one of them travelers of inferior rank have no choice but must accept the lady offered to them who in that case is generally the oldest and plainest in the district a priest then appears who performs the marriage ceremonies with great solemnity a nuptial feast is prepared and the new married couple pass the night together the husband may if he pleases depart the next morning if he has any money or valuable effects and chooses to make his ephemeral wife a present it is received and indeed expected but if he should not he may still proproceed upon his journey without molestation the lady thinks herself sufficiently obliged to him for having delivered her from the reproach of virginity which it is ignominious either to retain or even to surrender to a mitylenian the preservation of the ladys honor depends upon her being first married to a stranger it is of no consequence whether he remains with her or ever returns at the expiration of a year she may contract a new marriage with any man that presents himself and should the former husband appear he would have no legal claim whatever upon account of his previous marriage the first is that a woman cannot marry to advantage until she has had intercourse with a stranger this custom is said to be of most ancient date and the only alteration the teachers of the christian religion have been able to effect is that the cohabitation shall be preceded by a marriage according to the forms of the church now established there by this compromise the priest the bride and all parties quiet the scruples of their conscience  the island chios now scio is by strabo reckoned one hundred and twelve miles and an half in circuit and about fifty miles from the island mitylene the principal mountain called anciently pelinaeus presents to view a long lofty range of bare rocks reflecting the sun but the recesses at its feet are diligently cultivated and reward the husbandman by their rich produce the slopes are clothed with rich vines the groves of lemon orange and citron trees regularly planted at once perfume the air with the odor of their blossoms and delight the eye with their golden fruit myrtles and jessamines are interspersed with olive and palm trees and cypresses amid these the tall minarets rise and white houses glitter dazzling the beholder  scio shared in the calamities which attended the destruction of the greek empire in the year  0   when robbers and pirates were in possession of several considerable places trachas a turkish malecontent took the city in   0  this was one of the islands which suffered from the exactions of the grand duke roger general of the roman armies the city was then seized by the turks who came before it with thirty ships and put the inhabitants to the sword in      the genoese took the city and kept in possession of scio about   0 years they were deprived of it by the turks in      but the chiotes in general were still indulged with numerous and extraordinary privileges they consisted of two parties differing in their religious tenets one of the greek persuasion which acknowledges the patriarch of constantinople as their head the other of the latin or papists which enjoyed a free toleration under the turks their priests celebrating mass as in christendom bearing the sacrament to the sick going in solemn procession habited beneath canopies with censors in their hands to the year      the venetians then attacked and took the castle but afterward abandoned it on a defeat of their fleets the latins who had assisted them dreading the punishment which their ingratitude deserved fled with their families and the bishop and settled in the morea the turks seized the churches abolished the genoese dress and imposed on their vassals badges of their subjection obliging them among other articles to alight from their horses at the city gates and at the approach of any even the meanest mussulman  the town of scio and its vicinity resembles from the sea genoa and its territory as it were in miniature the ancient city had a good port and stations for eighty ships the present which occupies its site beneath pelinaeus is large well built and populous a naked hill rises above it with a house or two on the summit where was the acropolis of the greeks and afterward the citadel of the genoese the port has an ordinary or ruinous mole like that of tenedos almost level with the water the town grecian islanders says chandler appeared to us a collection of petty palaces after the hovels of mud we had seen on the continent of asia  the beautiful greek girls are the most striking ornaments of scio many of these were sitting at the doors and windows twisting cotton or silk or employed in spinning or needle work and accosted us with familiarity bidding us welcome as we passed the streets on sundays and holidays are filled with them in groups they wear short petticoats reaching only to their knees with white silk or cotton hose their headdress which is peculiar to the island is a kind of turban the linen so white and thin it seemed to be snow their slippers are chiefly yellow with a knot of red fringe at the heel some wore them fastened with a thong their garments were of various colors and their whole appearance so fantastic and lively as to afford us much entertainment see the plate which exhibits the dress of the females of scio naxos and mitylene the turks inhabit a separate quarter and their women are concealed  we returned to the ship at night says chandler the dragoman and chiote lighting us with long paper lanthorns to the boat which waited at the beach a great number of ghaunt dogs were collected by the shambles which are at the outskirts of the town they barked furiously at us but were chid and repelled by our guides whose language they understood the public we are told maintains them and they assemble when all is quiet it is observable that these animals were of old a like nuisance being the lemures of the ancients who used to pacify them with food the arcadians in particular were accustomed to carry bread from their table on account of the nightly terrors or the dogs which they expected to assail them in the streets  prosperity is less friendly to antiquity than desertion and depopulation we saw here no stadium theater or odeum but so illustrious a city with a marble quarry near it could not be destitute of those necessary structures and perhaps some traces might be discovered about the hills of the acropolis a few basreliefs and marble are fixed in the walls and over the gateways of the houses we found by the seaside near the town three stones with inscriptions which had been brought for ballast from the continent of asia the chiote our attendant was vociferous in his enquiries to little purpose we were more than once desired to look at a genoese coat of arms for a piece of ancient sculpture and a date in modern greek for an old inscription  the most curious remain is that which without reason has been named the school of homer it is on the coast at some distance from the city northward and appears to have been an open temple of cybele formed on the top of a rock the shape is oval and in the center is the image of the goddess the head and an arm wanting she is represented as usual sitting the chair has a lion carved on each side and on the back the area is bounded by a low ruin or seat and about five yards over the whole is hewn out of the mountain is rude and indistinct and probably of the most remote antiquity  the wines of scio have been celebrated as aiding digestion as nutritious and pleasant they were much esteemed by the romans hortensius hoarded them and caesar who was as generous as magnificent dispensed them freely to the people at his triumphs and sacrifices it is related that the culture of the vine was introduced by a son of bacchus called oenopion or the winedrinker whose sepulcher remained here in the second century and that red wine with the making of these liquors was invented by the chians a rugged tract named arvisia was particularly famous for its produce which has been extolled as ambrosial and styled a new nectar we were treated with a variety of choice specimens and it may be questioned if either the flavor or qualities once so commended be at all impaired  to the peculiar possession of the arvisian wine no longer talked of has succeeded the profitable culture of the lentiscus or mastic tree this employs as we were told twentyone villages which are required to provide as many thousand oaks of gum annually for the use of the seraglio at constantinople they procure it by boring the trunk with a small sharp iron in the summermonths in october their harvest is conveyed with music into the city and lodged in the castle the cadi and officers who attend while it is weighed have each a certain portion for their perquisite the remainder is delivered to the farmer or planter to be disposed of for his own advantage the greeks of these villages have a separate governor and enjoy many privileges in particular they are allowed to wear a turban of white linen and their churches have each a bell to call them to prayers an indulgence of which they speak with much glee the asiatic ladies are excessively fond of this gum which they chew greedily believing it good for the breath and attributing to it various other excellent qualities  negropont the ancient eubaea on the opposite coast is the largest island in the archipelago it is ninety miles long and about twenty broad on the southwest side of the island the strait is so narrow that it is joined to the continent of attica by a bridge the walls of the town are two miles in circumference and the suburbs where the christians inhabit are extensive the captain bashaw or admiral of the turkish fleet is the viceroy of this island and the adjacent parts of greece where he has a deputy and a fleet of galleys generally lie in the port what is very singular in this island is the irregularity of the tides in the euripus the strait which separates this island from the continent of attica  the tides are regular from the last three days of the old moon to the eighth of the new the ninth day they become irregular and continue so to the thirteenth the fourteenth they are regular again and continue thus to the twentyfirst when they become irregular again until the twentyseventh when they are irregular they flow twelve thirteen or fourteen times and ebb as often in the four and twenty hours when the tides are regular they observe the same rule according to the moon as the tides in the ocean but there is this difference at all times between the tides of the euripus and those of the ocean that the tides of the euripus never rise above a foot whereas those of the ocean in some places rise twentyfour feet in others not more than one foot between the ebbing and flowing of the euripus is a small space where the water seems to stand still which it is not observed to do in the ocean  chap xxix rhodes this famous island is situated between the thirtysixth and thirtyseventh degrees of northern latitude about sixty miles northeast of the island of candia two hundred and fifty to the west of cyprus and about twenty miles southwest of the continent of asia minor  on our approach to this island by the narrow strait that separates it from the continent of asia minor a new scene says savary presented itself to our view an innumerable multitude of swans and cranes sailing on the waters and ranged in files like soldiers in order of battle each of these files were upwards of a quarter of a league in length and we counted thirty of them all swimming in a similar direction the head of this army terminated in a point and resembled the prow of a ship they all kept their posts notwithstanding the motion of the waves with which they alternately rose and fell their plumage of a dazzling white formed an admirable contrast with the transparent greenness of the waters farther on we discerned another troop disposed in the same manner all having their heads turned toward africa to which they steered in concert  these birds at the approach of winter fly the snows and ice in the north to seek a milder climate they first arrive at the black sea where they remain for a time and when the cold begins to increase too much there again take their departure with a northerly wind traverse asia minor and rest a while on the shores of the mediterranean they afterward pass this sea partly by swimming and partly by flying in this manner they reach the coasts of africa and especially egypt where the great lakes menzala and buelos furnish them abundant food there they remain all winter but the storks which appear to be fond of a still warmer climate quit these lakes in november proceed toward the said and end their journey at the lake maeris and the canal of joseph they free the country from innumerable frogs insects and reptiles which abound in the marshes such is the regular progress of these birds on a signal given from their leaders these winged navigators rise in the air and fly all together directing their course toward the south to cleave this element with more facility they range themselves in the form of a triangle the vertex of which is a very acute angle what wisdom is displayed in the actions of creatures which to us seem destitute of reason fortunate perhaps in not possessing that faculty so frequently abused by man they do not counteract the views of nature and enjoy without alloy that portion of happiness assigned them by the creator  rhodes is about fifty miles in length from north to south and nearly half as much in breadth ancient historians assert that it was called by the greeks rhodes from the great quantity of roses produced in it rhodes signifying in that language a rose the poets feign it to have received its name from rhoda one of the daughters of apollo by venus  several authors assert that this island was formerly covered by the sea and that it raised its humid head above the waters and became an island but they do not fix the time of this event which is lost in the obscurity of ages tradition however has preserved the memory of the fact and the gravest writers of antiquity have admitted it as certain delos and rhodes says pliny those celebrated islands arose out of the sea ancient annals assert says pindar likewise in one of his odes that at the time when jupiter and the immortals divided the earth rhodes had not yet appeared in the midst of the sea but was still concealed in the profound abysses of the ocean philo attributes this event to the diminution of the waters of the sea and were this opinion wellfounded most of the islands of the archipelago being lower than rhodes must have had the same origin  it is much more reasonable to imagine says savary that volcanic fires such as in the fourth year of the one hundred and thirtyfifth olympiad threw up from the abysses of the ocean theracia and thera the modern santorin and which in our time have raised above the waters seven little islands near them gave birth in the remote ages of antiquity to rhodes  in its center is a high mountain which commands the whole island it is called artemira and i imagine it to be the mount atabyris says savory of strabo on it formerly was a temple of jupiter now no longer in existence but its place is supplied by a small chapel to which the greeks make pilgrimages mount artemira is very steep so that it is impossible to ascend it on horseback and on foot it takes four hours to reach the top when there we enjoy a most magnificent prospect on the edge of the horizon toward the northeast we discover the summits of mount cragus to the north the high coast of caramania to the northwest the small islands of the archipelago which appear like luminous points to the southwest the summit of mount ida capped with clouds and to the south and southeast the vast expanse of waters which bathe the coasts of africa this extensive prospect varies every instant as it is more or less illumined by the rays of the sun and exhibits a moving scenery which astonishes and delights the beholder after contemplating this grand picture the eye looks down with pleasure on the island which rounds itself beneath our feet and here and there we perceive on the tops of the most lofty hills ancient pines planted by nature that in ages past formed thick forests which the rhodians carefully preserved for their navy at present these trees are not very numerous as the turks make use of them to build the grand signiors caravelles and cut down without ever planting their solitary shades are at present the retreats of wild asses which are remarkable for their surprising swiftness  beyond these first heights we meet with various amphitheatres of eminences which become gradually lower till we reach the sea the hills in general are covered with thorns or brambles but on some of them we find vineyards which still produce the perfumed wine in such request among the ancients this wine is very pleasant to the taste and leaves an exquisite flavor in the mouth the rhodians added the luxury of drinking it out of voluptuous cups it would be easy to multiply these vines and cover with them hills of a great extent which are now lying without cultivation  on the shady summit of mount artemira a great number of springs arise which fertilize the plains and valleys around the villages we find a few cultivated spots and orchards where the fig pomegranate and orangetree though planted without regularity or taste afford pleasing shades the peachtrees which in the time of pliny produced no fruit at rhodes are at present very fruitful but the peaches they bear have neither the flavor nor the delicious juice of ours as in this country they knew nothing of the art of grafting the palm flourishes here as in the days of theophrastus but produces no fruit there seems to be a certain line drawn by nature for each species of tree beyond which some will not grow at all and others become barren  in passing over the island we traverse with regret beautiful valleys without finding so much as a village a cottage or even the smallest traces of cultivation the bottoms of the rocks are covered with wild roses myrtles in flower perfume the air with their delicious emanations and tufts of the laurelrose adorn the banks of rivulets with their beautiful flowers the inhabitants suffer the earth to nourish an infinity of useless plants without endeavoring to direct or profit by its fecundity  this island enjoys the happiest temperature imaginable and its air is pure and salubrious no epidemical disorders are known but what are imported from other countries the westerly winds which prevail for nine months in the year moderate the heats of summer and in the winter ice snow and even hoarfrost are unknown in the dullest day the sun disperses the clouds and shows himself at least for some hours through the whole year he enlightens the island with his beneficent rays fertilizes the earth and purifies the air which is naturally humid tiberius says suctonius made a stay for some time at rhodes so enchanted was he with the beauty and salubrious climate of the island  ancient rhodes seems to have surpassed all the cities of the world in beauty and magnificence strabo who had traveled through several countries and had seen rome alexandria memphis and the most celebrated cities of asia preferred rhodes to any of them the beauty says he of its harbors streets and walls and the magnificence of its monuments render it so much superior to all other cities as to admit of no comparison aristides likewise adds within the walls of rhodes we never saw a small house by the side of a large one all were of the same height and the same order of architecture so that the whole city seemed but one single edifice wide streets crossed it from side to side and these so well disposed that from whatever part it was viewed the prospect was truly magnificent the walls and towers of a wonderful extent height and beauty above all excited our wonder the lofty summits of the latter served as a pharos to mariners such indeed was the magnificence of rhodes that without having seen it the imagination cannot possibly form any conception of its grandeur all the parts of this immense town mutually connected with each other and most beautifully proportioned formed a perfect whole of which the walls were the defense and ornament rhodes was the only city of which it might be said it was fortified like a place of war and decorated like a palace  to this description we must add superb temples whose porticos were enriched with paintings of the first masters a multitude of colossuses and statues of astonishing workmanship a magnificent theater extensive arsenals and fleets arriving from every part of the world to pay the tribute due to the arts from wealth pliny after enumerating the most famous colossal statues of antiquity adds but none of these are to be compared to that which the rhodians dedicated to the sun this colossus was the work of chares a pupil of lysippus it was seventy cubits high about one hundred and five feet and was thrown down by an earthquake fiftysix years after it was first erected in this state its appearance is still astonishing few men are able to grasp the thumb and its fingers are larger than entire statues usually are where it has been broken we may discover withinside deep cavities filled with enormous stones which the artist had introduced to render it firm on its base it is said to have been the labor of twelve years and that it cost three hundred talents a sum which the rhodians had gained by the sale of the warlike machines left by demetrius before their walls when he raised the siege this city contains an hundred other colossal statues less indeed than this but each of them superb enough to render any city illustrious where they were erected to these are to be added five gigantic statues of the gods the invaluable works of bryaxis  some modern historians wishing to add something to the mavelous have pretended the feet rested on two rocks at the entrance of the harbor and that vessels passed with all their sails set between its legs this fable deserves no regard since it is contradicted by the silence of antiquity on the contrary historians who mention the fall of the colossus as well as those who saw it testify that it was lying on the ground strabo says the colossus of rhodes overthrown by a violent earthquake and at present lying on the ground has its knees broken the rhodians are forbidden by an oracle from raising it up this colossal statue the most beautiful ever consecrated to the gods by man is placed among the seven wonders of the world had it been situated at the entrance of the harbor it must have fallen into the sea says savary which circumstance they would not have omitted it was still in its fallen state in the days of pliny as it likewise was till the reign of the emperor constans when moawiah general of the caliph othman taking rhodes destroyed this statue which had well deserved to be enumerated among the seven wonders of the world he sold it to a jew who conveyed its fragments to emesa on nine hundred camels nine hundred and thirtytwo years after it was first erected constantine porphyrogenetus says it was sold to a jew at edessa and increases prodigiously the number of camels which carried off its fragments making them amount to thirty thousand  the arts seemed to vie with each other to contribute to the embellishment of rhodes painting likewise disputed the palm with sculpture the temples contained a multitude of admirable works among which says strabo two pictures of protogenes were particularly admired the one representing jalysas and the other a satyr standing upon a column with a partridge at his feet the latter picture being exposed to public view the bird attracted universal admiration so that the satyr in the finishing of which the artist had employed his utmost attention and abilities was almost entirely disregarded the wonder and applause of the spectators was still more increased when on bringing some partridges before the picture they began to call as soon as they perceived the painted bird to the great delight of the multitude protogenes was so mortified at the preference given to what be intended merely as an ornament that he requested permission from the prefect of the temple to efface the partridge and actually did efface it  pliny thus describes the picture of jalysus mentioned by strabo the most beautiful of the works of protogenes is the picture of jalysus which is still to be seen in the temple of peace at rome to secure it if possible against the injuries of time the painter placed four layers of colors one over the other hoping that if the upper ones should decay the lower would still remain in this picture we see a dog exquisitely painted chance having conspired with art to render it perfect the painter after finishing every part of the animal and having surmounted every difficulty was so far satisfied with his work but one thing still remained which he despaired of being able perfectly to express this was the froth which whitens the mouth of a dog when panting to represent this defied his utmost art and in every attempt he only seemed to depart further from nature the foam appeared always painted and never natural he was the more mortified as he was never satisfied with any thing less than what might be mistaken for nature itself often did he efface his colors and as often change his brushes without success irritated at the impotence of his art he peevishly threw his sponge against the picture which by accident struck the mouth of the dog and disposed the colors more happily than his utmost skill had been able to effect chance for once happily imitating nature  protogenes and apelles his cotemporary imitated nature so perfectly that their pictures seemed living and animated beings let it not be imagined however that the artist born with the happiest talents can ever attain this high degree of perfection without prodigious efforts genius must be seconded by the most persevering labor and a profound knowledge of every science allied to his art protogenes was seven years in finishing the picture of jalysus and if pliny may be credited during the whole time lived entirely on lupins lest by too much indulging his appetite he should obstruct the activity of his mind  do not imagine that rhodes contained only a small number of excellent paintings the porticos of its temples were decorated with pictures of infinite value the possession of one only of these immortal works says aristides would have sufficed to render any city illustrious  the sciences and literature ever go hand in hand with the fine arts for the cultivation of these also were the rhodians distinguished their schools attained so high a degree of celebrity that they were resorted to by some of the greatest men of rome among whom were cato marcus brutus cicero cassius caesar and pompey  to what must we attribute the flourishing state of the rhodian republic to the fertility of the soil the beauty of the climate or the excellent situation of the island these advantages no doubt contributed to but were not the efficient cause of the wealth of the rhodians which was owing to the goodness of their laws and the wisdom of their government the only solid foundations of the glory of empires we cannot too much admire says strabo the care with which the rhodians preserve their excellent code of laws and the wisdom conspicuous in the whole constitution of their republic and especially in the management of their navy this has long preserved to them the empire of the sea which they have freed from pirates and has secured to them the friendship of the romans  rhodes was the emporium of every trading nation the mariner who touched there says aristides beheld with astonishment several harbors formed by art of piers of stone which advanced far into the sea one of these received the vessels from ionia another those from caria here a mole offered shelter to the fleets from egypt cyprus and phoenicia as if expressly formed for each respective city near to the ports arsenals reared their lofty heads and astonished the beholder with their magnificence  the rhodians were worthy to inhabit this city their morals were mild and amiable and their manners polished without affectation when they appeared in public they were remarkable for the gravity of their deportment they were not seen loitering in the streets but seriously reproved foreigners whom they saw strolling about in inconsiderate idleness at their tables civility and urbanity presided and all excess was banished they conversed in a free and friendly manner with their guests and never mortified them by assuming airs of importance these are the virtues says aristides which render your city so renowned these raise you above every other nation and attract the love and admiration of every people your ancient and truly grecian manners render you far more illustrious than your ports your walls or your arsenals  such a people could not but be humane as for myself says savary i doubt whether men possess a right to put other men to death though guilty of enormous crimes the rhodians however spared their fellowcitizens the horror of these bloody tragedies which dishonor our cities far from preparing scaffolds in public places far from hiring despicable mercenaries to publish in the streets sentences which condemn unhappy wretches to the flames or to the wheel the law prohibited any executioner from entering rhodes even the sentence of death was pronounced without the walls of the city and they would have considered it as impiety to stain their streets with human blood  ancient writers nevertheless particularly athenaeus reproach the rhodians with vices inseparable from great wealth luxury and voluptuousness they build likewise says stratonicus as if they were immortal and serve their tables with as much profusion as if they had but a few days to live the vessels they made use of in their repasts were of an exquisite invention and greatly renowned for the pleasure they gave in drinking in their composition they employed myrrh the flower of an odoriferous reed saffron balm amoma and cinnamon baked together anacreon reciting the number of his mistresses says for rhodes write down two thousand and we find the ancients call it the city of gallantry  the government of rhodes was always republican at first the supreme power was lodged with the people the nobles afterward got possession of it and formed an aristocracy but they did not abuse their power humanity led them to succor their fellowcitizens they took care to prevent that wretchedness which is so destructive to population and created magistrates whose sole employment was to prevent or relieve the necessities of the poor to provide these with wholesome food and employ them in the public works this excellent regulation secured tranquillity to the state which never experienced those violent convulsions that at length overthrew athens and rome  it was against this city according to diodorus siculus that demetrius advanced his moving citadel of wood plated with iron to batter down its walls this edifice called the helepolis was of a prodigious size it had nine stories and might be moved every way catapultas were employed against the walls which threw prodigious stones and beams of an immense size headed with iron while battering rams two hundred feet in length and worked by a thousand men at once were shaking them with repeated strokes a multitude of archers placed on the top of the moving tower showered down their arrows on the besieged thirty thousand soldiers were employed to put the helepolis in motion the courage of a free people however triumphed over the fleets of demetrius the numerous army he had in pay and all the military talents this great captain displayed during a whole year in his various attacks  in fine ever observant of their laws and careful to maintain the commerce to which they owed their power they remained independent till the reign of vespasian who first reduced this island to a roman province the power and riches of the inhabitants then disappeared and since that time rhodes like candia has been only one of the fine islands of the archipelago  the modern town built on the ruins of the ancient city occupies only a quarter of its extent and possesses no remarkable antiquities not even the smallest remains of the theaters temples and porticos are to be discovered statues colossuses paintings all have been carried off to wide and skilfully disposed streets to those regularly ranged edifices where each front presented the same order of architecture have succeeded narrow and winding lanes and houses without taste regularity or decoration were a rhodian of the days of alexander to revisit his native city he would find himself absolutely a stranger he would not recollect the smallest monument but must imagine himself transported into a country inhabited by barbarians  the knights of rhodes have left various traces of their residence in the island their armorial ensigns and some busts of the grand masters sculptured in relief on marble decorate the front of several buildings the walls and towers they erected still subsist and bear the glorious mark of an obstinate defense the church of st john has been converted into a mosque the vast hospital in which christian charity received the faithful from all parts of the world and furnished them with succors at this day serves as a granary for the turks the barbarians suffer it to go to ruin as well as the governmenthouse in which we find antique marbles and columns  rhodes has only two harbors the smallest faces the east and is called darca rocks at a small distance from each other in the front block the entrance and only leave room for one vessel to pass moles raised on each side defend it from every wind the turks who since the conquest of the island have not removed from it a single grain of sand suffer it gradually to choke up there is only water enough for merchant ships and even these are obliged to unload a part of their cargo before they can enter it ships go thither to careen and caravelles are built there for the grand signior this handsome basin might be made fit for the reception of large vessels if the same means were employed to clear it as are used at marseilles and other ports  the other harbor is large it bears the name of rhodes and in this frigates of thirty guns may anchor vessels are here defended from westerly winds which prevail the greatest part of the year north and northeasterly winds blow full into the harbor and when violent ships are in danger of driving on the rocks or against the walls of the town though rhodes has retained none of its ancient splendour its advantageous situation on the point of a promontory its houses disposed in the form of an amphitheatre the solid structure of its walls and its towers advanced upon the shoals give it an air of strength and importance to mariners as they approach the city  the island of rhodes contains two cities the capital of the same name and the ancient lindus of the three cities founded according to the ancient fable by the children of the sun lindus alone has left any remarkable vestiges calirus and jalisus mentioned by strabo are totally destroyed leaving rhodes says strabo and sailing on with the coast to the right the first city we arrive at is lindus situated on the south side of the island and opposite alexandria the traveller then admires the famous temple of the lindian minerva built by the daughters of danaus cadmus enriched it with magnificent offerings the inhabitants here consecrated the seventh ode of pindars olympics which they inscribed in letters of gold the ruins of this noble edifice are still visible on an edifice near the sea the remains of its walls which were built with enormous stones discover the egyptian taste on the highest part of the rock we perceive the ruins of a castle that served as a fortress to the town it occupied a large space which is now filled with rubbish  the modern lindus is situated at the foot of this hill a deep bay which runs up far into the land serves it as a harbor before the building of rhodes this port was resorted to by the fleets of egypt and of tire it was enriched by commerce and a wise government profiting by its harbor and situation might still render it a flourishing city  the soil of rhodes is dry and sandy but the numerous springs with which it is watered render it extremely fertile corn thrives here admirably its yellow and heavy grain affords a flour as white as snow which makes excellent bread if half of the country capable of growing it were cultivated the rhodians would have far more than sufficient for their consumption and might export to foreign countries but the turks are no cultivators and the greeks discouraged by the fear of not enjoying the fruits of their labor let the finest fields lie barren it is certain that a single word from the pacha would enrich the country with the treasures of agriculture he is absolute and has but to assure the husbandman of his protection but he knows not whether he shall himself be in place tomorrow and would be fearful of laboring for the advantage of his successor besides a still more powerful reason prevents him from endeavoring any improvement the misery of the country constitutes his wealth rhodes not furnishing sufficient corn for the support of its inhabitants he sends to purchase the grain of caramania at a low rate he has this conveyed to market in small quantities to enhance the price but what is still more oppressive is that the rate fixed for the first bushel of the new crop serves as the standard price for all that is sold during the remainder of the year this infamous monopoly which rapidly enriches those who are concerned in it is productive of the most fatal consequences to commerce agriculture and the industry of the inhabitants what indeed can be expected from a nation in want of the first necessaries of life what exchanges can they make with foreign countries if their own be insufficient for their support and they have neither art nor manufactures and indeed the universal poverty and frightful depopulation of the island are indelible proofs of the vices of the government  there are computed to be seven thousand families in the island which reckoning five persons to a family gives thirtysix thousand inhabitants nearly of these twothirds are turks and the remainder greeks but the island is more than forty leagues in circumference here then is a vast space occupied by fewer people than is contained in a moderate town in england the state of the revenues of the island perfectly corresponds with the small number and poverty of the rhodians  table of the revenues of the island of rhodes  duties of casack or capitation    000 tenths on all produce of land   0 0 customs   00 tax on houses    0 on the farm of wax  0 00 on cattle  00 at the gate  00 on the farm of the baths   00 on salt  00 new polltax on every greek and jew  00 on vineyards  00  0 00  here then we have ninety thousand piastres which the island produces the grand signior from which we must deduct    00 piastres employed in paying the guards of the towns and villages the inspectors of estates repairs of the mosques and bread and soap distributed to the poor so that the grand signior receives only    00 piastres  a piastre is equal to halfacrown english  from this calculation the accuracy of which may be depended on it appears that this large island produces less to the ottoman emperors than many estates of only some miles extent in this country are worth to their possessors let it not be asked what is become of that powerful people who profiting by their advantageous situation their forests their harbors and the fertility of their country covered the mediterranean with their victorious fleets  they have lost their liberty and with it science and national genius rhodes now only affords a few indigent wretches without commerce arts or industry because they can have no property who wander over the desolate plains of this once flourishing island  the turks born in this island are of a milder disposition and possess more politeness and urbanity than in the other provinces of the empire less exposed than the greeks to the rapacity of the great and peaceably enjoying their property they lead a happy life in the bosom of their families and among them we meet with cheerfulness integrity and social manners the greeks live under the same sky but accustomed perpetually to crouch beneath the iron scepter that crushes them they become hypocritical deceitful and dishonest the proudest of mankind in prosperity and equally mean and cringing in adversity they are infected with all the vices which are the consequence of servitude yet compelled as it were by the force of climate they sometimes indulge in merriment their joy however is not the mild and tranquil joy of the turks but a clamorous and irrational mirth the festivity in short of slaves who forgetting for a moment their wretched condition dance amid their chains  the pacha is the governorgeneral of the island he possesses absolute power and presides at once over civil justice and military discipline he nominates to employments that fall vacant sentences to death and is to watch over the maintenance of good order all private litigations are as in the other islands and governments decided before the tribunal of the judge called the cadi his decisions are without appeal he partakes also of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction with the mufti  the greeks and jews have a chief named the monteveli who is their intendant general and has the regulation of the capitation tax he decides all differences that arise among them without its being necessary to have recourse to any other jurisdiction when the cadi has condemned a greek or jewish debtor to pay the money due to his creditor he sends his sentence to the monteveli who if he thinks proper carries it into execution  the rhodians have no troops in their island they are not warriors knowing themselves incapable of resisting the weakest enemy who may attack them in time of war they hire soldiers from caramania to defend their city these are undisciplined troops who abandon themselves to all the excesses of a blind ferocity and are more to be dreaded by the inhabitants than the enemy  chap xxx candia the ancient crete called also macaron or macaronesus i e the fortunate island in allusion to its fertility and the purity of the air is one of the largest islands in the mediterranean being in length above two hundred miles and in breadth in some parts about sixty this island which in some measure separates the archipelago from the mediterranean is formed by a long chain of mountains extending from west to east says tott and may be considered as a continuation of those which from the north of the adriatic pass over the morea and appear again in caramania where they join mount libanon the mountains standing thick together on the south side among which mount ida that famous mountain of antiquity towers far above the rest render this island almost inaccessible toward the mediterranean whence the northside derives all the advantages of culture of which a bad soil can be susceptible it is likewise to the excellence of the climate that it owes the richness of its productions  among all the countries i have seen says savary there is none whose temperature is so healthy and so agreeable as that of crete the heats there are not excessive and violent cold is absolutely unknown in the plains the winter properly speaking begins only in december and ends in january during this short season snow never falls in the plain and rarely is the surface of the water frozen the name of winter is given to these two months from the heavy rains the cloudy sky and violent north winds which blow at this time of the year no sooner is the month of february past than the earth is adorned with flowers and harvests the rest of the year is almost one continued fine day we never experienced as in france says the above author those cruel returns of piercing cold which nip the opening flowers destroy the fruits of the year and are so prejudicial to delicate constitutions the sky is continually serene and the winds mild and temperate the glorious luminary of the day runs his majestic course through the azure vault and ripens the fruits of the hills and plains nor are the nights less delightful a delicious coolness then prevails and the air less charged with vapors than with us discovers a greater number of stars to the observer the blue vault of heaven sparkles with gold diamonds and rubies which seem to dart forth brighter fires nothing can be more magnificent than this spectacle which the cretans enjoy for ten months in the year  to the charms of so delightful a climate are added other advantages which enhance their value the island of crete has hardly any marshes the waters there are never stagnant but flowing from the summits of the mountains in innumerable streams form delightful fountains or small rivers which lose themselves in the sea the elevation of the ground causes them to have a rapid course and they form neither lakes nor ponds for this reason insects cannot deposit their eggs in them which would be carried into the sea and the inhabitants are not tormented as in egypt with those clouds of gnats of which the sting is so painful for the same reason also the air is not loaded with those dangerous vapors which rise from the marshes in wet countries  the hills and rising grounds are clothed with various species of thyme savory serpolet odoriferous rockroses and a variety of plants myrtles and laurelroses border the rivulets which meander through the valleys on every side the country presents groves of orange lemon and almondtrees the arabian jessamine blooms in the gardens which in the spring are decorated with beds of violets vast fields are covered with saffron wild dittany which has a very fragrant smell lines the crevices of the rocks in a word the mountains valleys and plains exhale on all sides aromatic odours which perfume the air and render it delicious to respire clouds ice and snow are afflicting objects which throw a mournful veil over the face of nature they present to the eye gloomy images and excite in the mind melancholy reflections and painful feelings in the heart nay not unfrequently they are injurious to the health and produce a general indisposition but a clear sky has an effect the very reverse  when we travel through different countries or even through distant provinces of the same kingdom the change of air is perceived in a very sensible manner this impression indeed is greater or less according to the greater or less degree of sensibility of every individual nor does it wholly depend on the accidental circumstances of cold or heat we feel in respiring the vital element an odor a taste a savor which vary according to circumstances and the varieties of climates and seasons these sensations produce pleasure or an uncomfortable feeling as they are suitable or contrary to the actual state of our constitution nor are we to esteem this extraordinary the exhalations from the earth waters plants and flowers incorporate with the atmosphere and compose the air we breathe every man of understanding therefore who has any regard for his health ought not to be indifferent concerning the choice of his habitation as on it in a great measure depends the preservation of that most valuable blessing  the instant i landed on the coast of alexandria says savary i enhaled a fiery air with which i was nearly suffocated i felt a moist and debilitating heat which rendered me languid and deprived me of all strength of body or vigor of mind i concluded it was impossible i could live in such a country but a copious perspiration presently taking place the violent heat of my blood diminished and i soon found myself greatly relieved in the beginning of the spring when the orange trees round damietta were in flower and filled the atmosphere with their fragrance when heat as yet only moderate left the body in possession of its energy and activity i tasted in the most lively manner the charms of so delicious a temperature breathed with rapture a fresh and perfumed air and every pulsation of the heart was an enjoyment this pleasure though every moment repeated never produced satiety  in the same places when in the month of july the husbandman had turned up the mud of the morasses to plant his rice the atmosphere became loaded with exhalations which oppressed the breast and obstructed respiration the faces of the inhabitants were discolored sickness became general and had not the northerly winds which prevail at that season chased away the malignant vapors and the earth been very soon covered with harvests the most violent distempers would have ensued  in fact so large a river as the nile flowing through and periodically inundating egypt cannot but render the air humid which moderates the heat of the sun and renders the country habitable the air there is very salutary to the lungs disorders of the breast are unknown and galen who studied at alexandria and was well acquainted with the nature of the climate sent thither all his patients with pulmonary complaints and they commonly found the cure they sought  the beauty of man his powers and his health depend in general on the climate he inhabits his food and the nature of his occupations in crete the turk who is not tormented by ambition or the thirst of wealth whose mind is never occupied by the chimeras of intrigue who knows not envy nor exhausts himself in the pursuit of sciences to which we too often sacrifice our health the turk who lives on wholesome and simple aliments and passes his days amid the flowery fields he cultivates grows and rises into a colossus the salubrity of the air he breathes the sweet temperature he enjoys the delightful scenes perpetually before his eyes and the peaceful life he leads all contribute to strengthen his body and preserve his vigor even beneath the snows of age hither the sculptor devoted to his art and emulating the ancients should come in search of models he would see young men of eighteen or twenty six feet high who possess all the graces peculiar to their time of life their muscles have still a little plumpness which will soon assume a bolder character their cheeks gracefully rounded display an animated carnative and their eyes are full of fire  in men arrived at maturity the features and outlines are more developed their legs are naked and when their robes are lifted up the muscles appear boldly prominent their arms exhibit those signs of strength which were visible in those of the ancient athletae their shoulders are broad their chests full and their necks never straitened by the ligatures which from infancy confine those of the europeans retain all the beautiful proportions assigned to that part by nature no tight breeches or garters bind the legs below the knee that part of their leg therefore is never distorted or contracted nor is the knee too prominent in a word all their limbs unaccustomed to the fetters which confine our motion and which habit alone could render supportable preserve their natural form and that admirable symmetry which constitutes male beauty when they stand erect all parts of the body properly support each other when they walk they move with an air of dignity and bodily strength and firmness of mind display themselves in every gesture their majestic eye announces that they are accustomed to command pride and severity may sometimes be apparent in their looks but never meanness  the mahometans who inhabit the island of crete are such says savary as i have here represented them they are in general from six feet to six feet five inches high they resemble the ancient statues and in fact such were the men the artists of antiquity took for their models in a country where the men are so remarkable for bodily strength and dignity of aspect it may fairly be concluded that the women cannot be wanting in beauty and the graces their dress does not prevent the growth of any part of their body but is accommodated to those admirable proportions with which the creator has decorated the most lovely of his works all are not handsome all do not possess charms but some of them are extremely beautiful particularly among the turks in general the cretan women have a luxuriant bosom a neck gracefully rounded black eyes full of fire a small mouth a nose perfectly well made and cheeks which health tinges with the softest vermillion but the oval of their faces is different from that of the women in europe and the character of their beauty is peculiar to their nation  during the first year or two of my travels in the eastern countries accustomed as i had been to the elegant head dress of the ladies of france i could not endure the black hair of the oriental women so difficult is it for reason to disengage itself from the fetters of habit but after more mature reflection their long black locks artificially plaited without either powder or pomatum appeared to me well calculated to heighten their beauty the ebon color of their hair seemed to give more luster to the fairness of their complexions and the glow of their cheeks the rose water with which they wash their hair exhaled an agreeable perfume and i was delighted with the natural beauty of their tresses i then changed my opinion and could not help wishing that the european women would not spoil one of their most charming ornaments with the colors of art so much inferior to those of nature  the greeks says savary who inhabit the island of candia partake indeed with the turks the advantages of a serene sky a pure air and a happy temperature but they are oppressed by tyrants they live in perpetual anxiety and apprehension and frequently terminate their miserable lives in despair excepting the spaehiots who are less exposed to tyranny these unfortunate beings have neither the lofty stature the strength nor the beauty of the turks the stamp of servitude is visible in their faces their looks are crouching and their features distorted by knavery and meanness such is the character of those cretans who were once so jealous of their liberty those experienced and intrepid warriors who were courted by all nations and those friends to the arts which they cultivated amid their shady groves at present cowardly and indolent they live in debasement and we may read in their degraded countenances that they are slaves  the island of candia does not produce a multitude of reptiles very few serpents and those only small ones are to be found in it the ancients affirmed that this beautiful country contained no noxious animals pliny excepts the tarantula which belon who has written on the natural and artificial curiosities of greece calls phalangion they assert its poison is mortal it is a sort of spider almost an inch long with a scaly coat it hollows out in the sides of little eminences a pretty deep hole which it covers with a strong web of cross threads glued together this little passage at the bottom of which it lodges is closed externally by a valve that prevents the rain from penetrating and which it opens when going in quest of insects and closes again when it reenters if two or three of these tarantulas are shut up in a glass phial they sting each other and die soon after  the quadrupeds of the island are not mischievous we neither meet with lions tigers bears wolves nor even foxes in short no dangerous animal the wildgoats are the only inhabitants of the forests which cover the high mountains and have nothing to fear but the gun of the hunter hares are found on the eminences and in the plains the sheep feed in safety on the various species of wild thyme they are folded every evening and the shepherd sleeps in peace free from the dread of seeing death and havoc spread among his flock by wild beasts  it is a happiness for the cretans that they are neither troubled with musquitos nor have any thing to apprehend from the poison of serpents or the ferocity of wild beasts the young and lively maiden may dance upon the grass without finding like eurydice a viper concealed among the flowers the ancients ascribed these singular advantages to its being the birthplace of jupiter the cretans says aelian celebrate in their songs the bounties of jupiter and the favor he has granted their island his native and nursing land of being free from every noxious animal and of not even nourishing those which may be brought into it  among the medicinal plants dittany holds the first rank it is astonishing how highly the ancients have extolled its virtues theophrastus who gives us the received opinions of his time says of all the known plants which the earth has produced dittany is the most precious the father of medicine the celebrated hippocrates ordered an infusion of it to be given in several disorders of women and especially during the pains of a difficult labor for this reason the statue of diana was according to some writers crowned with dittany  i shall not here repeat says savary in his description of this island with several authors that the wild goats when wounded by the arrows of the hunter freed themselves from them by eating this precious plant that it possessed the virtue of healing them even when the arrows were poisoned and that its odor was so powerful as to drive away venomous reptiles and destroy them if it only touched them these accounts are evidently exaggerated but we are possibly on the other hand too indifferent to the real utility medicine might derive from this plant its leaf is extremely balsamic and the flower diffuses a delicious fragrance the inhabitants at present apply it very successfully on many occasions an infusion of the dried leaf with a little sugar yields a liquor more pleasing to the palate and more finely flavoured than tea it immediately removes languor of the stomach and restores it after digestion  dittany is peculiar to the island of crete and is not to be found in any other country it grows in the crevices of the rocks and at the foot of precipices pliny has not sufficiently discriminated it dittany says he has slender branches resembles pennyroyal and is hot and rough to the taste its leaves only are made use of it has neither flower stalk nor seed virgils description is more conformable to truth this plant bears shagged leaves which are crowned with purple flowers the wild goats find in it a remedy when wounded by the winged arrow  in a country where the air is extremely pure disorders are not frequent there are no epidemical diseases in this island fevers are indeed frequent in the summer but not attended with danger and the plague would never make its appearance had not the turks destroyed the lazarettos erected by the venetians since then it has been brought occasionally by the ships from smyrna and constantinople  but a malady which though less dangerous than the plague has something even more hideous in its symptoms infects this beautiful country i mean the leprosy this disorder had its ancient seat in syria whence it has passed into many of the islands of the archipelago it is contagious and instantly communicated by the touch those unhappy wretches who are attacked by it are confined to little huts built on the sides of the highways from which they are not allowed to come out or converse with any person they usually have a small garden round their cottages that supplies them with vegetables and poultry with which and the alms they receive from passengers they drag on a miserable existence their bloated skin is covered with a scaly crust full of red and white spots which occasion intolerable itchings they beg relief in a hoarse and hollow voice at the very sound of which you are apt to shudder their words are scarcely articulate as the disorder is internally destroying the organs of speech these wretched specter gradually lose the use of their limbs and live till the whole mass of blood becoming corrupt death is the consequence of putrefaction no sight can be more melancholy or more shocking than that of a leper no torments are comparable to those that he endures  the rich are not attacked by this malady which confines itself to the lower class of people and particularly to those among the greeks who observe strictly their four lents and live during that time on nothing but salt fish pickled olives and cheese and drink copiously of the thick heavy wines of the island it is possible this diet may inflame and thicken their blood and at length be the cause of the leprosy i am led to suspect this says savary from having observed that this disorder never manifests itself among such of the turks as are rich enough to procure animal food the whole year with rice and vegetables nor even among the greeks who inhabit the mountains and eat plentifully of sallads fruits and milk  elated with having been the birthplace of jupiter and proud of her hundred cities crete long continued more powerful than the other islands of the mediterranean at present her glory is eclipsed time has not spared a single one of all her cities of which we see nothing but the ruins candia is the modern capital and has given its name to the island  the three cities candia canea and rhetimo are the seats of the three pachalies into which the ottoman government has divided this island the first who enjoys the title of seraskier has preeminence over the other two  candia says savary is the seat of the turkish government the port usually sends thither a pacha with three tails here also the principal officers and different corpse of the ottoman soldiery are assembled this city so rich populous and commercial under the venetian government is greatly fallen from its ancient grandeur the harbor which is a handsome basin where ships are sheltered from every wind is daily filling up and at present only capable of receiving boats and small vessels lightened of a part of their cargo those freighted by the turks at candia are obliged to proceed almost in ballast to wait for their loading in the ports of standia four leagues distant where it is brought to them in small barks these difficulties which the turks do not endeavor to remedy are very detrimental to commerce which accordingly has extremely declined  candia greatly embellished by the venetians is divided into strait streets and decorated with well built houses a handsome square and a magnificent fountain but contains within its extensive walls only a small number of inhabitants several quarters of the town are almost deserted that of the market is the only one in which we perceived activity or affluence the mahometans have converted the greatest part of the christian temples into mosques they have left however two churches for the greeks one for the armenians and a synagogue for the jews the capuchins have a small convent with a chapel in which the french viceconsul hears mass for at present he is the only person of that nation who resides at candia the french merchants having retired to canea  the river to the west of candia was anciently called the triton and near its source minerva was born of jupiter whence is derived the epithet tritogenes beyond is a river on whose banks according to the fables of antiquity jupiter celebrated his nuptials with juno in the space of more than half a league round the walls of candia we do not meet with a single tree the country beyond abounds in corn and fruit trees and the adjacent hills covered with vineyards yields the malmsey of mount ida worthy a place at the table of epicures this wine little known in france is perfumed of a very agreeable flavor and in high estimation in this country  at no great distance from candia are the ruins of cnossus called by the greeks cnossou this was the royal city of minos who established there the seat of his empire and gave those wise and admirable laws so justly boasted by antiquity this city says strabo was a league and an half in circuit and long continued one of the most celebrated of the island united with gortyna polybius mentions that it gave law to almost all crete but falling afterward into misfortunes gortyna and lyctos profited by its decline and cnossus was for a time stripped of almost all its splendour but soon repairing these losses again resumed its station amongst the most flourishing cities of greece the romans to secure their conquests established a numerous colony there at length in the thirteenth year of the reign of nero the whole island suffering by a violent earthquake cnossus was totally destroyed the lightning during this tremendous calamity says philostratus did not proceed from the clouds but from the earth and the sea retreated seven stadia several tombs according to suidas burst open in one of which was found the works of dictys of crete containing die events of the trojan war  from that time the lofty cnossus humbled in the dust has never risen from her ruins but heaps of stones ancient walls half demolished the remains of edifices and the name of cnossou which the spot it stood on still retains enable us to assign its ancient situation these ruins were no doubt much more considerable before the building of candia because as they were so near it may well be supposed the venetians made use of them as materials for the ramparts and houses of that capital  about four leagues to the south of candia on the summit of a very deep mountain are a heap of stones half eaten away by time which the inhabitants of the country call the tomb of jupiter the third jupiter says cicero son of saturn who was king of crete has a tomb in that island jupiter having ended his days in crete his relations in obedience to his last commands erected a temple and tomb to his memory the temple still subsisted in the days of plato this philosopher who was well acquainted with the places he describes speaks of it thus in his first book of laws the road which leads from cnossus to the cavern and temple of jupiter is very pleasant we continually meet with alleys of large tufted trees whose foliage shelters us from the scorching heat of the sun if we proceed still further we find woods of cypresstrees of surprising height and beauty by the side of which are delightful meadows where travelers may repose and converse  from all these authorities we may conclude that a man called jupiter who by great actions merited well of his subjects and on whom divine honors were bestowed died in the island of crete that a temple was erected to him which has been destroyed by time that a tomb was shown with an inscription on it till the time of the roman emperors and that at present there is to be seen about three leagues from cnossus an eminence commonly called mount icarus on the top of which the inhabitants of the country point out a heap of stones which they call the tomb of jupiter as for the sacred cavern in which he was brought up and to which minos repaired every ninth year to converse with his father and receive his laws it may be presumed not to have been far distant but says savary we did not see it  in the mountains and on the road from candia to canea is a convent of greek monks possessing extensive lands which the turks have left them on condition of their exercising hospitality toward all travelers which they commonly do with a tolerable good grace both riders and horses are lodged and supplied with provisions these houses in a country where there are neither inns nor caravanseras are of great use without them the traveller would be obliged to carry with him a load of baggage and every necessary of life  as soon as we alighted at the above convent says savary several children came to take our horses by the bridles and walk them about for a quarter of an hour before they put them into the stable this custom is constantly observed in crete they never shut up the horses when in a sweat but always make a rule of walking them about in the open air hence the cretan horses are strong healthy and never tire they boldly clime the steepest rocks and descend the same into the valleys without stumbling  a magnificent repast was served up to us the superior set before us most exquisite wines the produce of the hills round the monastery on which we bestowed the highest commendation after supper we were conducted to a spacious hall where we perfectly well enjoyed the pleasures of repose to show respect to the french consul in whose company we were they had allotted him a separate apartment and placed two full decanters by his bedside in the morning he wished to wash his mouth and pouring out some of the supposed water found it to be white wine he took the other decanter and filled his glass but this proved to be pure brandy no doubt says savary these good monks are accustomed to make libations to the god of sleep or to console themselves for his rigours with the bottle  canea anciently cydonia the principal residence of the merchants and factors in the island of candia is well laid out the principal street is as strait as a line and the squares are decorated with fountains it possesses no remarkable edifices the greatest part of the houses have only one story and are built with terraces those which are round the harbor are ornamented with galleries which afford a most charming prospect the harbor admits ships of two hundred tons burden and if deepened would afford good anchorage to the largest frigates it contains at present about sixteen thousand inhabitants  the turks who inhabit candia are not so implicitly submissive to the orders of the grand signior as those of the other provinces of the empire they mutually support each other against the tyranny of the pacha and refuse to bow their necks to the yoke of despotism enrolled as janissaries at their birth they compose the principal soldiery of the island and it would be dangerous to drive them to revolt when their governors have been guilty of oppression they have been known to have recourse to arms and demand vengeance of this there was of late years a very remarkable example the pacha of canea had a kind of deputy who like the rest of those in office made use of every means to amass wealth and drew on himself the detestation of the people the greeks did not dare to murmur but the turks were not so patient they brought their complaints before the governor but either because he had a real friendship for him or was a sharer in his plunder he would not listen to them when on a sudden soon after says savary who was then at canea we heard a great tumult in the town the janissaries ran through the streets sabre in hand crying to arms and as in such circumstances foreigners are always in danger from a licentious populace we kept ourselves shut up in the consular house waiting the event  the house of the officer of the pacha which was a spacious building lately finished was opposite to ours on the other side of the harbor this was presently filled with upwards of five hundred persons pillaging and destroying every thing that fell in their way some tore out the sashes and threw them upon the quay others mounted on the terrace broke down the parapets while some were returning loaded with furniture a great number of them were diligently searching to discover the object of public hatred and in less than two hours the whole house was emptied and half demolished  an enraged multitude always proceed to excesses which no one can foresee the soldiers took possession of a high fort which commands the town whence they could thunder on the castle of the pachas against which they pointed several heavy pieces of cannon and after leaving a guard at the port proceeded in a body to demand justice resolving in case of refusal to bury their governor under the ruins of his palace the whole town followed with dreadful shouts which reaching the ears of the pacha who was an old warrior rendered respectable by many gallant actions he had himself conveyed in an armchair into the middle of his courtyard and when he saw the storm approaching and that the furious populace were preparing to break down the gates ordered them instantly to be thrown open at the sight of this venerable old man who had a long white beard the mutineers were struck silent and the most daring among them seemed motionless with astonishment at length none venturing to speak well my good people said the governor what do you ask of me they all cried out we must have the head of your deputy he is fled replied the pacha but if you find him i abandon him to your vengeance return to your duty lay down your arms and let every man go peaceably home this firmness awed even the most mutinous and a rebellion which might have had fatal consequences was appeased in an instant by the courage and prudence of a single man he had however concealed his favorite and in the night sent him on board a ship which immediately set sail for constantinople after his departure things returned to their usual channel and peace was once more restored within the walls of canea  quitting canea the traveller sees before him the white mountains at present called the hills of sphachia this chain of eminences is in height second only to mount ida which is the most extensive in the island they form in front of canea an immense rampart the summit of which is lost in the clouds and seems to separate that city from the rest of the island the lowest chain is but two leagues from the town and may be about six hundred yards high between that and the second opens out a vast plain three leagues in diameter and of considerable length this intermediate chain is far higher than the former beyond are lofty peaks to which without doubt the name of the white mountains were given from their being during a part of the year covered with snow which collecting in heaps in the deep valleys on the northside hardens and never melts the inhabitants cut it in large pieces which they bring to canea in the night and thus enjoy the luxury of drinking iced liquors in the hottest days of summer  these mountains are an appanage granted by the grand signior to the sultana valida and are entirely independent of the government of the pachas the sultana sends a person she can confide in to govern them and collect the tributes the greeks who inhabit them are called sphachiots they rear numerous flocks of goats and sheep keep bees and make excellent cheese which has the taste of parmesan  the sphachiots confined to their mountains are more distinct from the different nations who have possessed crete than the inhabitants of the plains they speak a dialogue less corrupt than the rest of of the candians and have retained several customs of their ancestors and certain peculiarities of their ancient character when belon traveled among them they were the best archers in the island they had very large bows and displayed more address strength and courage than the other greeks even since the musket has succeeded to the bow they are not less skilful in the use of the latter and in general are excellent marksmen  of all the cretans the spachiots alone have retained the pyrrhic dance this they perform clad in their ancient dress that is to say a short robe bound with a girdle breeches and buskins a quiver filled with arrows is fastened over their shoulder a bent bow hangs on their arm and by their sides they have a long sword thus accoutred they begin the dance which has three measures the first marks the step and they change feet in dancing like the germans the movements of the second are more lively and resemble the dance of the inhabitants of lower brittany in france during the third measure they leap backwards and forwards first on one foot and then on the other with great agility the dancers who answer them imitate the same steps and sing and dance with them to the same tune in the course of this dance they perform various evolutions sometimes forming a circle at others dividing and ranging themselves in two lines and seeming to menace each other with their weapons afterward they separate into couples and appear as if defying their antagonists to the combat but in all their movements their ear is true to the music and they never vary from the measure  in the ancient cretan republic the people were divided into two classes that of the youth and that of mature manhood this division is still preserved among the sphachiots but not in the purity of the first institution formerly the young men were subject to the reproof of the aged and obeyed them at present they wish to command this want of proper subordination has been productive of great misfortunes to the whole nation during the last war with the russians the turks imagined that the inhabitants of sphachia intended to give up the island to their enemies and pretended that some russian ships touching at the southernside of the island had formed a treaty with the sphachiots this was enough to make the mahometans take up arms they marched to the number of eight thousand and climbed without difficulty the first chain of mountains but it was not so easy to scale the second and a handful could have prevented them the class of men proposed to fight and defend their rocks but the youth no doubt seduced by the promises of the turks advised submission and while their fathers were making head against the enemy had the baseness to introduce them by secret paths to the summits of their mountains the moment they appeared the sphachiots took to flight and concealed themselves as they could in caverns of the rocks and among precipices the mussulmen cruelly abusing their victory destroyed whole villages massacred many of the inhabitants and carried off a great number into slavery without sparing either men women or children  near canea is the convent of acrotiri a frightful solitude in the environs of which nothing is seen but dreary rocks and at their feet the wild thyme briars thyme with the odoriferous flowers the laudanum and a few strawberrybushes the nuns here are not cloistered and make no other vow than that of virginity each chooses a companion and thus coupled they reside in small houses built round a chapel to which a greek priest comes to say mass these couples perform all the mutual offices of friendship assist each other and possess in common an enclosure more or less considerable appropriated to the double cell this is their garden and orchard in which we find orange almond and olive trees they likewise keep bees which are not shut up in hives and have no covering but planks laid crossways on two posts beneath which shelter these industrious creatures deposit their honey and wax the first combs are the largest and gradually diminish to a point they are all in the shape of an inverted pyramid and it is surprising how fast they are made by the bees the honey of these insects is produced from the flowers of the different kinds of thyme and an infinity of odoriferous plants and shrubs with which the country is covered nor can any honey exceed it in purity or fragrance  but to return to our nuns i have already said that united in pairs they inhabit a building consisting of three or four apartments each of these little dwellings contains various conveniences within itself they have here likewise a vast cistern a necessary precaution on an eminence without water a winepress an oven and one or two looms for making linen they generally rear silkworms and gather cotton which is an annual plant in this country one of the sisters spins while the other weaves and some of them knit stockings when they have provided themselves with what is necessary for their own use they sell the remaining fruits of their industry in the town  in their cells is neither sumptuousness nor magnificence we find only convenient utensils and absolutely necessary furniture which is kept neat and clean in a word these nuns without being rich enjoy a comfortable subsistence for which they are indebted to their industry cheerfulness is their constant companion and we see among them no melancholy faces in general a younger sister unites herself with an elder than herself to solace and relieve her from the burden of the more laborious employments i frequently says savary visited a greek lady who every year passed a few weeks in this monastery and always found among them voluntary nuns a mildness modesty and liveliness very remote from that sour and austere character absolutely inconsistent with virtue  at the moment i am writing adds the above writer acrotiri contains within its narrow precincts the decrepitude of age the vigor of riper years and all the charms of youth i have seen three of these females well deserving to employ the pencil of a skilful painter a nun of an hundred and nine years old another of thirtysix and a novice of sixteen the first bent like a bow with difficulty hobbled along by the aid of a small staff and seemed every moment ready to sink with feebleness she had still preserved all her senses though blunted and in a kind of stupor to extract any conversation from her she must have a a glass of cordial or of excellent wine which gradually revived her heart she told us she was born in the village of la sude which was then in the possession of the venetians and recollected the different times that fortress had been besieged by the turks their throwing the bombs upon the roofs of the houses and the terror it spread among the inhabitants after the taking of the fort she retired to this convent where she had resided near fourteen years  the second was tall with an animated countenance and elegant features her air was majestic her eyebrows black and her eyes sparkling but the roses of her cheeks and the lilies of her complexion began to fade she was still handsome but her beauty was the beauty of maturity the delicacy and softness of blooming youth was evidently past and each successive day robbed her of a charm  but the third to conceive a just idea of her beauty one must have seen her the powers of description are totally insufficient to convey it unite in imagination all the charms which sometimes adorn the fairest of natures works in all their delicacy and perfection in all their astonishing harmony and grace and it will give but a feeble image of the novice of acrotiri her features had uncommon animation and her eyes sparkled with a luster that seemed more than human and which it was impossible to sustain unmoved how indescribable must have been her smile would this beauteous virgin have consented to smile transcendant as were her charms her dress was of the most simple kind yet it seemed as if no ornament might be added that could embellish her every action every attitude made her appearance still more lovely absolutely unconscious of her beauty she waited with apparent pleasure on the nun whom she considered as her mother and anticipated all her desires her whole air and manner were free from the slightest tinge of affectation she appeared absorbed in sublime ideas and only aspired to be received among the nuns of acrotiri i cannot deny says savary that i was sensibly concerned at the thought of so many charms being for ever buried in the depth of a sad solitude and that she who seemed born to give the highest felicity to some favored mortal should be separated for ever from the society of man  let a painter try what his art can effect and if he would represent the bloom of youth the maturity of riper years and old age in her decrepitudes let him pourtray the three females i have endeavored to describe but he will fail in the attempt to succeed he must like me have seen the originals the imagination only traces with fidelity what the eye has observed then genius meditates and composes and by its powers become creative for perfectly to represent such objects is rather to create than to imitate this was the perfection to which protogenes attained the froth on the mouth of the panting dog appeared to him imitated and not natural an ordinary artist would have been satisfied but the rhodian painter aspired to the perfection of nature that is to be like her creator  rhetimo anciently rhitymna the third chief city of the island and residence of a pacha is a handsome town situated on the entrance of a rich and fertile plain it is not large and scarcely contains six thousand inhabitants a citadel built on a rock which projects into the sea would be sufficient for its defense were it not commanded by a high hill from which it may be battered with artillery the harbor which is nearly choked up is only capable of receiving barks and small vessels the turks never trouble themselves to prevent or repair the ravages of time and behold with unconcern the most useful works become heaps of ruins their harbors therefore are every where filling up and the commerce they attracted deserts them to seek more commodious situations the french had formerly a viceconsul at rhetimo to which place the ships of marseilles came to take in oil but for a long time past they have not been able to approach the town and the government have withdrawn an officer that can now be of no use  it is nevertheless much to be wished that the port of rhetimo may be restored the plains round it abound in various productions and oils cotton saffron and wax are extremely plentiful all which different branches of commerce would become still more extensive could the inhabitants convey their produce to a foreign market their gardens produce the best fruit in the island their pomegranates almonds pistachio nuts and oranges are excellent here we find the apricottree that produces the michmich a fruit of an exquisite fragrance and yielding a delicious juice it is a kind of alberge but more mellow and smaller than that of france  chap xxxi in continuation five leagues from this town an immense country opens between the western extremity and mount ida and the first chain of the white mountains in this large valley is the village of marguerites the most populous of any in the island which contains about ten thousand greeks who cultivate the rich adjoining plains and would carry their oils grain and other commodities to rhetimo if they had a harbor this village or rather town is but two leagues distant from the northern sea and not far from the road to candia close to it flows a small river which falls from the mountains in cascades the charming temperature and varied productions of this beautiful country invited the venetians to settle there they had built countryhouses in this district where they passed a part of the year several of which are still to be seen but it is with regret we find them occupied by ignorant greeks or barbarous turks nothing remains but the ruins of those gardens which art designed and nature delighted in decorating with a perpetual succession of flowers and fruits  the turks in this island do not reserve in their houses separate apartments for every person of the family the women only have distinct chambers the men sleep together in spacious halls on matrasses spread on the carpeting and provided with sheets and a blanket agreeable to this ancient custom says savary in his travels through the island we were shown into a large room round which our beds were placed on the ground only two centuries ago says the above author it was usual even in france for the whole family to pass the night in the same apartment since that time our manners have undergone a great change they have infinitely more delicacy and convenience nay perhaps more decency but are they more social  describing his reception and an entertainment at a country house of a turkish nobleman our author adds the table was spread in the garden under the shade of orange trees six of these beautiful trees planted in a circle united their branches which had never been mutilated by the shears and formed over our heads a roof impenetrable to the rays of the sun in the middle of a very hot day we enjoyed in this arbor which nature has so profusely embellished a delicious coolness on every side flowers hung in garlands over the guests and formed a crown for each the brightness of their colors their exquisite odours the beauty of the foliage gently agitated by the zephyrs every thing conspired to make us imagine ourselves suddenly transported to some enchanted grove to complete the whole a beautiful stream which descended from the adjoining hills passed under the table and contributed to preserve the pleasantness and coolness of our arbor on each side of us we beheld it gliding over a golden sand and winding its crystal stream through the garden in which a great number of small canals had been dug to convey its water to the orange the pomegranate and almondtrees which repaid with interest the moisture they received in flowers and in fruits  the table was now served the aga had endeavored to provide for us suitable to our taste we were presented with all the utensils common in france and our host himself conformed to our customs knowing that we were used to take soup he supplied us with a great dish of roastmeats covered with a delicious jelly round this were bartavelles almost as large as our hen there were besides excellent quails a roasted lamb and hashed meat dressed with rice perfectly well seasoned the wine corresponded with the excellence of the rest of our entertainment we were served with vin de loi malmsey of mount ida and a sort of perfumed red wine equally agreeable to the smell and the taste the vin de loi is rather bitter but leaves an agreeable flavor in the mouth and excites a gentle warmth in the stomach the malmsey of mount ida is more unctuous more agreeable to the palate and not less fragrant  our good patriarch wishing to imitate his guests and take his glass in defiance of the prophet had sent away his servants and his children laying aside the turkish gravity which never condescends to smile he chatted with much vivacity and frequently astonished us by the penetration of his understanding the aptness of his replies and the justness of his ideas when the dishes were removed we were presented with moka coffee and pipes the pipes made use of here are of jasmine and the part applied to the mouth of amber their enormous length entirely takes away the pungency of the tobacco which in turkey however is mild and being mixed with the wood of aloes produce a vapor neither disagreeable nor incommodious as in other countries  as soon as the great heat was over he called his sons and ordered them to attend us on a shooting party we descended into a plain where we found plenty of quails and had the pleasure of killing many without fatigue the darkness which now advanced over the hills brought us back to the house and as the nights in this climate are as clear and fine as the days are beautiful we supped in the arbor of orange trees rarely do we enjoy this luxury in france the night air has always a degree of chillness that makes us shudder or a copious dew falls injurious to health in crete these inconveniences are not felt the sky was without a cloud the coolness agreeable and the air so calm as scarcely to disturb the light of four large wax tapers which illumined the foliage in a thousand different ways and the varied productions of which produced lights and shades of an admirable effect the condensation of the air had collected the fragrant perfumes of the flower and shrubs and every sense was delighted  this turkish nobleman possessed several other country houses that to which we were invited he only occupied in the spring for he passes the violent heat of the summer in a charming retreat situated among the mountains then while the sun scorches up the plain and the whole atmosphere seems on fire he enjoys a delicious temperature and beholds the country round him clad in verdure and covered with fruits and flowers  during the whole time we passed at his seat we experienced from him nothing but the utmost politeness he made us no great compliments but studied our tastes and we were sure of finding on our table the dishes to which we seemed to give a preference one morning rising before my companions and walking among the neighboring orchards i perceived this venerable mussulman standing near a fountain contiguous to the house he was washing his face and hands and chaunting the first chapter of the koran that is to say one of the finest hymns ever addressed by man to the supreme being he seemed infinitely absorbed in the adoration he was paying to his creator and i conceived says savary a favorable opinion of a man who fulfilled with so much dignity the first of all duties  such is the life led by the rich mahometans in candia they pass threefourths of the year on their estates and repair in winter to the town to sell the superfluity of their produce which procures them very considerable wealth content with their possessions they aspire after none of the public employments which might endanger their safety but see them without envy in the possession of strangers uncontrolled monarchs on their own estates they command and receive implicit obedience possessing the handsomest women in the island they bring up their numerous offspring in the respect and submission due to the chief of the family these mahometans enjoying without pain anxiety or ambition all the bounties offered them by nature pass their days in tranquillity and happiness and retain even in a very advanced age almost unimpaired good health  the greeks notwithstanding the contemptible state of debasement to which they are reduced still retain a pride and vanity that can only be equalled by their ignorance of this we had a striking instance at the convent of asomatos in the mountains bordering on mount ida where we halted one evening says savary in our journey through crete the superiors of which thinking to amuse us proposed after supper that his priests should chaunt the kyrie eleison we accepted his proposal and immediately a number of children deacons and subdeacons made their appearance and on a signal given began the kyrie eleison they sang through their noses and produced so frightful a noise that it was with the utmost difficulty we could refrain from laughing but at length they concluded their discordant jargon and we clapped our hands in applause we were now in hopes this entertainment was ended but he begged us to go through the same ceremony in french on this a young man in our company struck up a lively song and we all joined chorus the superior and his brethren were delighted with the sprightliness of our kyrie eleison but affirmed their music was more solemn and majestic to which we readily subscribed these incidents says our author seem trivial but nothing can better describe the character of the people we visit the good cheer choice wines and excellent beds we met with were entirely owing to a little welltimed complaisance and the incense offered to the vanity of our host  the next morning we intended to have breakfasted at arcadi the handsomest monastery in the island and as it was only three leagues distant we expected to reach it in good time but the roads were dreadful we continued ascending for an hour and an half before we came to the first chain of heights that run parallel with mount ida and on which arcadi is built we met with steep paths cut out of the rock and our horses were obliged to clamber up steps of marble and granite without slipping or stumbling otherwise we must have been dashed to pieces on the stones or tumbled headlong into the torrent i do not exaggerate says savary the horror of the roads we had to pass the first time a man unaccustomed to such ways travels into crete he imagines his life in danger at every step but more experience soon relieves him from his fears for there is no place so dangerous and dreadful but may easily be passed with the mules and horses of the country  we were repaid for our fatigues by the beauty of the prospects which every where presented themselves to our view we traversed whole woods of strawberries and privets which never lose their verdure firs of a prodigious height rear their heads amid the snows and are the haunts of herds of wild goats in the valleys the course of the waters is traced by tufts of myrtle some branches of which were in flower and mingled the verdant luster of their foliage with that of the laurelrose the sheep were feeding on the brow of the rocks and the cottages surrounded with clumps of trees formed landscapes the eye was never wearied with admiring sometimes these prospects were sufficiently near to discriminate every object and at others distant and obscure presented only light shades pleasingly sketched in the horizon  after a fatiguing journey of three hours we arrived at the convent of arcadi where the superior received us politely and ordered breakfast to be prepared this monastery situated in mount ida possesses very extensive tracts of land which are carefully cultivated by its numerous monks and the oil corn wine and wax produced on them every year amounts in value to considerable sums the good fathers live much at their ease and are very hospitable to travelers  the apartments of this monastery are built round a large court in which is a handsome church whither the greeks of the neighborhood repair to divine service among this numerous body of monks there are but few priests the greater part of them do not enter into holy orders but some in quality of brethren and are employed in the most fatiguing labors of agriculture we visited the cellar in which a former traveller tournfort reckoned a hundred casks of wine but we saw only forty barrels full these however were of a stupendous bigness into this cellar the superior descends at the end of every vintage and the following is the very singular form of his benediction on the wine o lord god who love men look down on this wine and on those that shall drink it bless our casks as thou did bless the well of jacob the pool of siloam and the drink of thy holy apostles o lord who did condescend to be present at the wedding of cana where by changing of water into wine there manifested thy glory to thy disciples send now thy holy spirit on this wine and bless it in thy name amen  after a plentiful breakfast we desired to see the library of the convent of which we had heard so much from the good monks it was as they said the most valuable numerous and complete in the island we expected therefore to have found some literary treasures or at least the best authors of ancient greece they conducted us into an apartment where we saw about two hundred old volumes ranged on shelves and covered with dust which did not seem to have had the honor of a visit for many a day they consisted in general of books of devotion sermons and controversial divinity after turning over a great number without finding any thing that merited our attention except a manuscript homer which they would not sell we went to return our thanks to the superior and continued our journey  in our way to these convents we traveled along the sides of the hills which terminate mount ida to the southward two chains of these hills formed between us and that mountain a double amphitheatre above which it reared its majestic head we could perceive large clouds of a shining whiteness ranging themselves around its summit and circling it with a silver crown which illumined by the sun shone with a wonderful splendour these clouds obeying the law of attraction after encompassing for several hours the head of the mountain fell in imperceptible drops on all the surrounding objects and entirely disappeared others succeeded and were dissipated in the same manner  this attractive power which forces the clouds toward the tops of the lofty mountains is the origin of springs fountains streams and all the rivers of the globe in the higher regions of the air where the rising vapors are condensed by cold the water of the clouds is converted into hail and snow but if they attain only a moderate height when the cold is not very great they fall in mists rains and copious dews when the hills are covered with fruits the springs and rivulets become more numerous as the leaves of trees possess the peculiar property of attracting the humidity diffused throughout the atmosphere to procure water for a dry country nothing more therefore would be necessary than to plant fruit trees on the hilltops when we find the ancients bestowing the name of rivers on the glaucus and the zanthus which run through asiaminor and are now little more than inconsiderable brooks we are tempted to suspect them of exaggeration but if we reflect that the hills where these rivers rise are at present stripped of their trees and soil and no longer oppose a barrier to the passage of the clouds though formerly crowned with lofty forests which attracted them around their tops and drew from them all their moisture we shall find no difficulty in believing that they as well as many others at present but insignificant rivulets might anciently when fed with more copious supplies well deserve the appellation of rivers  the diversity of landscapes which constantly charmed the eye made us forget the dangers to which we were exposed for the space of a league we rode along the slope of a very high hill on one side the ground was as perpendicular as a wall and on the other was the channel of a torrent two hundred feet deep through which the water rushed over the large flint stones with a violent noise the path at last grew so narrow that when once fairly entered it was impossible to dismount but at the risk of throwing both ourselves and the horses into the abyss below in many places this road was not more than a foot and a half wide though on the brink of a tremendous precipice which no one could look down without shuddering we were now convinced of the excellence of our horses not one of which so much as made a false step they seemed to feel the danger trod with caution and examined where to put their feet in a wet place however mine made a false slip and tottered for a moment on the brink of a precipice but keeping my seat still firm he recovered himself  mount ida begins near candia and stretches from east to west as far as the white mountains it extends from the northern to the southern sea and is the highest in the island in many parts of it snow lies all the year from its summit we may discover the sea of crete and that of lybia the eye wanders over an immense horizon and discerns many of the scattered islands of the archipelago such as cytherea milo and argentum  in summer when the snows are melted vast plains situated on the declivity of the mountains afford excellent pasturage for the flocks on that part of it opposite to candia are forests consisting chiefly of maple and green oak the southern sides abound with the strawberrytree privets and rockroses the eastern brow is beautified with cedars pines and cypresses but on the west its perpendicular sides present nothing but piles of rocks inaccessible to scale it is enriched with an infinity of other plants which would delight the botanist such as the true melliot the yellow flowered marjoram etc abundant streams flow on every side from its summit some rush in torrents into the valleys while others water the plains which produce luxuriant harvests or distributed by art maintain fecundity in the innumerable fruit trees which go round the villages  the labyrinth as it is called runs under a mountain at the foot of mount ida the opening of it is natural and not wide we had brought with us says savary the thread of ariadne that is four hundred fathoms of twine to explore it to discern our way amid this gloomy abode we each carried a flambeau two greeks bore the clew which they unfolded or wound up as occasion required at first we lost ourselves in different allies without an opening but at length discovered the true passage which is on the right as we enter we arrive at it by a narrow path and are obliged to creep on our hands and feet for the space of an hundred yards the roof being extremely low at the end of this narrow passage the ceiling rises suddenly and we were able to walk upright in the midst of the impenetrable darkness that surrounded us and the innumerable ways which struck off on each side and crossed each other in different directions sometimes we were stopped short by a passage without an opening and at others after long circuits were astonished to find ourselves at the crossway from which we had set out frequently after encircling with our cord a great extent of rock we were obliged to wind it up and return the way we came it is impossible to describe to what a degree these passages are multiplied and crooked some of them form curves which lead insensibly to a vast empty space supported by enormous pillars whence three or four passages strike off that conduct to opposite points others after long windings divide into several branches these again extend a great length and terminated by the rock oblige the traveller to trace back his way we walked with precaution in the doublings of this vast labyrinth amid the eternal darkness that reigns through it and which our torches could hardly dispel the precaution we had taken of proceeding with the thread of ariadne and of fastening it at different distances lest it should break allowed us to advance further than belon tournfort and pocock we observed in several parts of the middle avenue the ciphers   00 written with a black pencil by the hand of the celebrated botanist an extraordinary circumstance which he remarks and which we admired no less than he had done is the property possessed by the rock of presenting the names engraved on it in relief  after straying for a long time in the fruitful cavern of minotaur we arrived at the extremity of the alley which tournfort followed there we found a wide space with ciphers cut in the rock none of which were of an earlier date than the fourteenth century there is another similar to this on the right to arrive at this place we had run out almost all our line that is to say about twentyfour hundred feet without reckoning our various excursions we remained three hours in the labyrinth continually walking without being able to flatter ourselves with having seen every thing  several authors among whom are belon and pocock pretend that this labyrinth is no more than a quarry from which stones were brought to build the city of gortyna situated at many miles distance the magnificent ruins of which are still visible mr tournfort has satisfactorily confuted this opinion he has proved that the stone of this cavern is too soft to be fit for building and that it would have cost immense sums to convey it across the steep mountains that lie between the labyrinth and that city it might have been much more natural for the inhabitants to procure their stone from the mountains in the vicinity of gortyna it is much more probable adds mr tournfort that nature produced the labyrinth and that the passage at the entrance has not been altered to show posterity what was the state of these subterraneous channels before they were enlarged by the hand of man  but for what purpose says savary was this labyrinth intended and was it there that the minotaur was confined the discovery of truth obscured by the lapse of time gives pleasure to the reader and amply recompenses the labor of investigation  in the first place it is certain that this immense cavern is not the labyrinth formed by daedalus on the plan of that of egypt all the ancient writers attest that the famous work of that celebrated architect was situated at cnossus john tzetzes very satisfactorily describes this famous edifice and informs us of the use for which it was intended daedalus the athenian made for king minos a prison from which it was impossible to escape its numerous windings were in the form of a snail and it was called the labyrinth this labyrinth subsists no longer it was indeed already destroyed in the days of pliny an antique gem corresponding with this description of tzetzes is still to be seen let us proceed to examine that which is still existing  taurus was the name of one of the principal men of crete who possessing the advantage of a fine person and having acquired great renown by his military exploits pasiphiae wife of minos king of crete became enamoured of him and had a son by him upon discovering that transaction minos would not however put him to death but according to ancient history confined him to the mountains to serve the shepherds in these solitary abodes he grew wild and fierce and lived by robbery and stealing sheep from the flocks having learnt that minos had sent soldiers to take him he dug a deep cavern which he made his place of refuge at length the king of crete sent him such criminals as he wished to punish with death his ferocity and this employment no doubt procured him the name of minotaur and induced poets and painters to represent him as a monster half a man and half a bull an ingenious emblem having reference to his birth character and odious services  theseus arriving in the island of crete says plutarch ariadne fell desperately in love with him she bore him a son and taught him how to escape from the winding passages of the labyrinth and he slew the minatour to distinguish this cavern from the famous edifice built by daedalus at cnossus claudian called it the labyrinth of gortyna the usual abode of the minotaur of the labyrinth of cnossus claudian says it forms different circuits which are neither inferior to the art with which the labyrinth of gortyna the usual abode of the minotaur is built nor the windings of the river maeander  we have now thrown all the light we have been able upon this wonderful cavern of antiquity and shall leave our readers to form their conjectures only begging leave to remark that it seems to us singular that the antique gem of the labyrinth of cnossus should have the figure of a minotaur in the center  the origin of gortyna is uncertain the opinions of authors varying on this subject it is however of the slightest antiquity homer speaks of it as of a powerful city defended by walls it was a flourishing city when lycurgus traveled into crete plato tells us it was built by a colony from gortyna a city of peloponnesus the lethe this river so celebrated in antiquity ran near gortyna it was called lethe because harmonia the daughter of venus forgot her husband cadmus on its banks  the ruins of gortyna cover a vast extent of ground and enable us to form some idea of its ancient magnificence such of its monuments as still subsist are not of the highest antiquity one of the most remarkable is a gate built with large bricks which have been formerly covered with free stone this edifice is of a considerable thickness and presents an extensive front it cannot be supposed more ancient than the time when ptolemy philopater undertook to rebuild the walls of gortyna beyond this gate we find a large open space in form nearly of a parallelogram on each side of which is a double row of pedestals the bases of the marble are buried and the tops appear above the ground the order in which they are ranged gives reason to conjecture they were part of the portico of a temple at different intervals we meet with heaps of rubbish and columns of marble and granite buried up to the middle of their shafts the capitals lie near them broken off but several of them have none near the farther end of these ruins on the banks of that beautiful river where harmonia forgot cadmus we enter a church one side of which is destroyed this is probably the ancient cathedral founded by titus the disciple of st paul  these ruins do not appear suitable to what might be expected from the grandeur and magnificence of gortyna but we must consider that the finest marbles have been carried off that we see in adjacent villages ancient columns employed in making gates for the turkish gardens and that the greatest part of its ornaments are buried under the earth which is considerably raised if the ground were dug into and proper researches made we should certainly find statues and valuable antiquities at present the husbandman passes his plough over them and covers with his harvest the ruins of the palaces and temples of gortyna such is the destiny of ancient cities they are the work of man and perish like himself those which in ages past were the ornament or terror of the world thebes memphis and babylon are now no more can we imagine that london that noble city which contains within itself all the arts and innumerable inhabitants will exist for ever can we doubt that the curious traveller shall one day wander amid heaps of rubbish in search of the situation of her temples and her palaces let us console ourselves that period is still very remote  this island is governed by three pachas who reside at candia canea and rhetimo the first who is always a pacha of three tails is as it were the viceroy of the island he is invested with the supreme power has the inspection of the forts and arsenals nominates to vacant military posts and to the governments of la sude grabusa spina longua and gira petra the governors of these forts are called beys they have under them a governor of the castle and three general officers one of whom is general of the artillery the other of the cavalry and the third of the janissaries the council of the pacha consists of a kyaia who has great influence in all public affairs and likewise of the principal officers of the army in the district  the great officers of the law are the muphti the supreme head of religion and the cadi the former expounds the law relative to the partition of property among children inheritances and marriages in a word all those laid down by mahomet in the koran and decides on every thing respecting the mohammedan religion the cadi cannot pass sentence in disputes originating in these laws until he has obtained in writing the opinion of the muphti his office therefore is to receive declarations complaints the presents of individuals and to decide in the common cases of litigation the pacha must consult these persons before he can legally put a turk to death but when he has attained the dignity of threetails he often raises himself above the laws and at once dictates the sentence of death and orders it to be carried into execution by his own authority  each mosque has its imam a sort of curate who performs divine service and schoolmasters are distributed in different quarters of the town these men are generally respected in turkey and bear the title of effendi a title of honor bestowed on persons considered as deserving respect  the garrison of candia consists of fortysix companies composing an army of about ten thousand men all these troops are not in the town but would be collected in an instant they receive their pay regularly and punctually every three months except the janissaries whose officers alone are paid the different appointments of officers in this militia do not depend on the pacha all promotions are regulated by a council of each company consisting of the officers on duty and the veterans these posts can only be held two years except that of captain which is purchased at constantinople and held for life the ousta or cook is continued likewise in his employment as long as the company are contented with his services there is a chaplain or iman to every company  the garrisons of canea and rhetimo regulated on the same plan are much less numerous the first consists of about three thousand men the other of fifteen hundred but as all the male children of the turks become members of the corpse of janissaries at their birth this number would greatly augment in time of war there is not much indeed to fear from them the greetest part having scarcely ever seen a musket fired they are never exercised in military evolutions and are totally ignorant of that dreadful art which in our days has been brought to such perfection and which reduced to certain rules triumphs without difficulty over blind force and numbers  a pacha of canea who distinguished himself in the last war with the russians was desirous to try the skill of the gunners of that garrison he ordered a bark to be anchored at the distance of half a mile from the walls and a large barrel placed on the deck the sea was perfectly calm and the mark exceedingly distinct but notwithstanding a reward was offered to the person who should knock it down the gunners kept firing the whole day without touching either the barrel or the bark  the pachas of canea and rhetimo are not less absolute within the limits of their governments than the pachas of candia they enjoy the same privileges and their council is composed of the same officers these governors are only intent on rapidly enriching themselves and use every means of extorting money from the greeks who are oppressed in a manner not to be described but to say the truth these unhappy people stretch out their willing necks to the chain that weighs them down their envious disposition is continually arming them against each other if one of them has the good fortune to acquire a little property others endeavor to discover something of which to accuse him before the pacha who avails himself of these dissentions to rob both parties it seems as if the greeks debased by their misfortunes were no longer capable of a generous sentiment nor are they in the least amended by the cruel examples they have every day before their eyes  it is not therefore surprising that under this barbarous government the number of greeks should daily diminish at present crete is supposed to contain at most only one hundred and fifty thousand greeks sixtyfive thousand of whom pay the capitation a tribute paid to the grand signior by all his subjects not mahometans but levied as we have before observed only on men arrived at maturity women and children being excepted the turks though they have only possessed the island one hundred and twenty years or thereabouts not being subject to the same oppression have multiplied and flourished on the ruins of the vanquished their number amounts to two hundred thousand is it not astonishing says savory to find so few inhabitants on this island which is above two hundred and fifty leagues in circumference may not this diminution of men be considered a sufficient proof of a destructive government  the hundred cities of crete have been celebrated by the writers of antiquity and geography has preserved to us their names and situations several of these contained thirty thousand citizens if therefore we allow six thousand to each this calculation for the hundred cities will give six hundred thousand inhabitants we may also estimate the cretans dispersed in the towns and villages at the same number which added together will make twelve hundred thousand this cannot be esteemed an exaggerated calculation when the venetians were in possession of the kingdom of candia it is said to have contained nine hundred and ninetysix villages  thus we find that when crete was a free country it maintained near a million more of inhabitants than it does at present but since those happy times this unfortunate island has been deprived of her laws by the romans groaned under the disastrous reigns of the corrupt princes of the lower empire been ravaged by the arabs during a hundred and twenty years exchanged their government for that of the venetians and at length has been finally subjected to the despotism of the turks who in all the countries they have conquered have occasioned a frightful depopulation  when candia was in possession of the venetians the towns of siria gira petra sisims and sphachia were crowded with inhabitants at present they are wretched villages with ruined fortresses and harbors nearly choked up candia the capital of the kingdom was very populous and carried on an extensive commerce in wines corn silks and wax it was indeed a second venice but is now almost deserted  it is true that the turks during a five and twenty years war destroyed many thousands of the canadians and that the plague the constant attendant of their armies followed them into this island and was the destruction of a still greater number but if the ottoman government had considered men of any importance it might have been able in the course of a whole century of peace and tranquillity to repair their ravages  the turks have left the greeks the free exercise of their religion but do not allow them to repair their churches and monasteries without permission which is only to be obtained by money and brings in considerable sums to the pachas they have as formerly twelve bishops the principal of whom assumes the title of archbishop of gortyna he resides at candia which is the seat of the metropolitan church nominated himself by the patriarch of constantinople he fills up all the vacant sees of the island he bears the triple crown on his tiara signs in red and is responsible for all the debts of the clergy to fulfill these engagements he levies heavy contributions on the other bishops and especially on the monasteries he is acknowledged as chief of the greeks whom he protects as far as his feeble influence extends to him the government applies in matters of importance and he alone of his whole nation has the privilege of entering a town on horseback  it may not be here amiss to give some account of the ancient government of this island so celebrated in antiquity a government that lycurgus took for his model in the institution he framed for lacedemon and which strabo has thought an account of not unworthy his pen and preserved its leading features in his immortal work  ten magistrates were annually chosen in a national assembly by the plurality of voices who were called cosmi they had the management of war and all the most important business they possessed the right of choosing counselors from among the old men and these in number twentyeight composed the senate of crete and were chosen from among those who had passed the office of cosmi or persons eminently distinguished by their merit and unimpeached integrity these senators held their dignity for life great deference was paid to their opinion and nothing finally determined without consulting them the wisdom of the legislator had intended them for a counterpoise to the ambition of the ten chiefs whose power was still farther circumscribed by limiting the duration of their magistracy to one year  this precaution did not end here as the votes of the people might be improperly obtained and their choice consequently fall on a person unworthy of so honorable a post he very wisely provided that whoever should disgrace the dignity of the cosmi might be removed either in an assembly of the people or by his colleagues only so excellent a constitution caused plato to say the republic which approaches too much to a monarchy and that which admits too unrestrained a liberty are equally remote from the just medium o cretans o lacedaemonians ye have avoided these two rocks and established your states on the most solid foundations  nothing can be more simple than this form of government a free people conscious they were unable to govern themselves name magistrates into whose hands they transfer their authority these chiefs invested with regal power elect senators to aid them with their counsels which counselors again can decide nothing of themselves but their office is perpetual which increases the respect paid them and enables them to extend their knowledge and information the ten chiefs of the republic have a powerful motive to incite them to act worthy the honorable station in which they are placed as on the one hand they are checked by the fear of disgrace and on the other encouraged by the hope of one day becoming members of the national council  this republic which was as ancient as the siege of troy still flourished in the time of julius caesar we know of no other of so long continuance the legislator founding the happiness of the cretans on liberty gave them laws and institutions fitted to form men capable of defending their freedom all the citizens were soldiers and all exercised and expert in the art of war for we even find that foreigners resorted to crete to be exercised in that art philopoemen says plutarch not enduring to remain inactive and ardently desirous of acquiring knowledge in the profession of arms embarked for crete where having exercised himself among that warlike people well versed in every military art and accustomed to lead a frugal life he returned to the achozans and so much distinguished himself by the knowledge he had acquired that he was immediately appointed general of the cavalry  on the other hand the legislator persuaded that conquests were usually only acts of violence and injustice which frequently enfeeble and almost always corrupted the morals of the victorious nation endeavored to prevent the cretans from trying to subdue foreign countries and from the time the government of the country first became republican till it was attacked by the romans we never find the cretans to have attempted any foreign invasion an honor reserved exclusively to them among all the people celebrated in history individuals might indeed serve in the armies of other states the kings and princes of which knowing their bravery and skill in archery strove who should first induce them to enter into their pay as each was desirous to have in his army a body of cretan bowmen since the whole world could not produce any more expert the arrows of gortyna says claudian happily directed carry certain wounds and never fail  the love of war did not extinguish in the cretans that exquisite sensibility which made them cultivate and encourage the fine arts the cretans displayed their munificence to homer by giving him a thousand crowns and glorying in a generosity not to be surpassed preserved the memory of their duration by a public inscription in crete adds ptolemy men are still more anxious to cultivate their minds than to exercise their bodies therefore when discord reigned among them the voice of wisdom and the charms of poetry brought them back to reason thales of gortyna the instructor of lycurgus was one of their most celebrated philosophers poets and legislators and he most successfully applied his knowledge and talents to restore concord to his fellowcitizens his poetry says plutarch in the life of lycurgus consisted of discourses in verse exhorting the people to unanimity and obedience to their superiors he possessed the art of conveying in the most harmonious meter the most solid and beneficial instruction so great was the effect of his poetry that his hearers who found their understanding as well as their ears equally persuaded and charmed gradually suffered all their animosity to subside and enamoured with the blessings of peace which he painted in the most lively colors forgot their intestine hatreds and ranged themselves under the standard of concord men over whom poetry and music had such power could not he enemies to pleasure and we accordingly find it to have been a custom with them to mark their happy days with white stones and their unhappy ones with black at the end of the year they examined the number of these stones and only esteemed themselves to have lived the days denoted by the white ones hence the inscription frequent on their tombs he lived so many days he existed so many  at length the fatal period arrived when the romans elated with their victories and proud of their power aspired to the empire of the world and would no longer admit of any distinction among the surrounding nations but that of slaves or subjects since that period that is during a space of nineteen hundred years the cretans have ceased to be a nation and have gradually lost their courage their virtues their sciences and their arts this deplorable debasement can only be attributed to the extinction of their liberty so true is it that man is born for liberty and that deprived of this support received from nature to sustain his weakness his genius expires and his courage languishes till he sinks to the lowest point of degradation  the olive tree that precious tree consecrated to minerva has almost disappeared from attica the albanians and turks who have alternately ravaged greece seem to have been intent on destroying it within twenty years they have cut down two hundred thousand feet of these trees thus has the morea so rich and flourishing when possessed by the venetians become a poor and miserable country  the island of crete has not in this respect suffered the same fate the olive trees which delight in a sandy soil a mild temperature and the vicinity of the sea grow in abundance on the hills and in the plains the cold is never severe enough to injure them and the heat is always sufficient to ripen their fruit we meet with some that seem coeval with the soil that bears them they grow to a vast size and attain the height of fifty feet their produce constitutes the chief wealth of the inhabitants and their principal branch of commerce the crops however are not equally abundant in two years one is generally excellent and the other moderate exclusive of the prodigious consumption of oil by the inhabitants besides what the turks of canea instructed by a native of provence make use of in their manufactories of soap which they export throughout the levant the turks annually load four and twenty ships with oil  the inhabitants of candia had no manufacture in their island and it is not long since a native of provence taught them to make soap of which they have now several manufactories at canea this betrayer of his countrys interest has greatly injured the trade of marseilles  the total exports from the island of crete savary estimates at little more than a hundred thousand pounds which is very inconsiderable for an island of such great extent the island says the above author does not contain a sufficient number of inhabitants for all the lands to be cultivated plains of three or four leagues extent and watered by fertilizing streams are frequently to be seen without the slightest traces of cultivation the indolent turk passes his life in the midst of his possessions without thinking of improvement and should the greek obtain permission to clear out a piece of ground after bedewing it with the sweat of his brow at the moment he is to enjoy the fruit of his industry his powerful neighbor wrests from him the produce of his labor  when the kingdom of candia was under the government of the republic of venice it produced great quantities of grain amply supplied the wants of the inhabitants and made considerable exportations to foreign countries at present the island is obliged to import corn this is not to be attributed to any change of the soil which is still warmed by the same sun and watered by the same streams the tyranny of the turkish government must alone be considered the cause  corn says pcysonnel is not scarce in candia the plains of messara and several other parts of the island furnish it in great abundance and the annual harvests are quite sufficient for the maintenance of the inhabitants but as the corn is incomparably fine the agas export a great quantity european turkish and greek vessels are perpetually engaged in this illicit commerce on which account candia is frequently obliged to depend on the morea for subsistence oil and soap indeed compose the two principal branches of commerce in this island but it likewise produces an infinity of articles of importance as very fine silk wax honey sufficient cotton for the consumption of the country and cheeses which a contraband trade exports to egypt the coast of barbary italy and provence  objects of the last importance adds savary which would infinitely extend the commerce of the cretans are almost totally neglected the mulberrytree thrives admirably in the island and nothing would be more easy than to rear silkworms the little cotton which is cultivated there is of a very fine quality and the wool though not remarkable for its fineness is so for its quantity yet there is not a single manufacture in the country which may employ these valuable materials little attention therefore is paid to the silkworm cotton and flax are cultivated in small quantities and never will it occur to the imagination of a turk that under a mild and favorable sky which would allow the flocks to be folded the whole year in the open air it might be possible by paying due attention to their feeding and properly crossing the breed to obtain wool even equal to that of spain  what advantages might not a polished nation derive from an island which after satisfying the most essential wants of man would still farther supply him with every thing that contributes to utility ease and even luxury how might they extend their various branches of commerce what benefits might they not derive from manufactures calculated to give them value the delicious wines of the country so little known would be in request over the whole world forests of pines oaks and cedars under proper management would be of use for shipbuilding the husbandmen excited by the hope and certainty of enjoying the fruit of their labors would clear out vast tracts of waste land now abandoned to sterility would sow every species of grain increase their plantations and after enriching the state live in plenty in the bosom of their numerous families men would multiply without end and in the finest climate in the world villages and impoverished towns would again become populous cities the arts would again return to their native country and again flourish in a word the superb island of crete would once more revive from her ashes to produce this extraordinary this happy change nothing is necessary but the encouragement and protection of a wise government  these reflections are not the dreams of a heated imagination or of a traveller who has hastily passed through the country but of one who continued in the island fifteen months who visited its mountains and the plains who was well acquainted with its productions who knows in what they are susceptible of improvement and who can take upon him to assert that in the whole world there is no country that combines so many real advantages the lofty trees of the frozen regions crown the summits of the mountains while less lofty hills are covered with the fruit trees in our climates the declivities are embellished with vineyards producing wines equally various as agreeable the valleys abound in trees bearing delicious fruits many of which thrive under the torrid zone while the plains are enriched with every species of grain the earth can produce let it be observed too says savary that nature has placed the finest harbors on the east west and north sides of the island as if its commerce was destined to extend to every quarter of the globe  chap xxxii cyprus this island has made such a conspicuous figure in the page of history that an account of it must prove highly interesting to those who are fond of researches into the situation of remote nations it lies under the fiftysecond degree of east longitude and the thirtyfifth of north latitude between the coast of syria and that of cilicia at present called caramania being in the most easterly part of the levant this country was formerly known by a great many different names pliny calls it acamantis cerastis asphelia amathusia macaria cryptos and colinia in other historians it may be found under the denomination of chetime erosa paphos and salamis and in the poets under that of cythera the latter made it the birthplace of venus and the abode of the graces hence those charming descriptions which they have given of it and those enchanting scenes of which according to their account it was the theater their ingenious painting has perpetuated the illusion and the names of pathos cythera and amathonte those spots more peculiarly consecrated to the goddess of pleasure still awaken the most agreeable and delightful ideas  it contained formerly nine kingdoms tributary to egypt and soon after to the romans from the emperors of the west it passed to those of the east but was taken from them by the arabs under the reign of heraclius a prince of the family of the comenii fired with ambition seized on the whole island and established himself sovereign of it in      our richard i deprived him of it together with his life being afterward sold by this monarch to the templars difference of religion caused the inhabitants to rebel against their new sovereigns and the knights apprehending they should not be able to retain possession of it delivered back the island to richard who renounced it in favor of guy de lusignan in    0 it came under the dominion of the venetians and was taken from them the succeeding century by the turks  this beautiful island is about two hundred and twenty miles in length sixtyfive in breadth and about six hundred in circumference including the gulphs a chain of mountains the highest of which are olympus st croix and bussavent divide it from east to west  the largest of its plains is that of messarea where the wandering eye loses itself in an extent of eighty miles in length and thirty in breadth while a variety of objects add to the pleasure arising from a view of this immense horizon  there are few rivers or torrents here the beds of which even in winter are not entirely dry and this arises from the great scarcity of rain the heavens are as it were of brass and historians assert that in the reign of constantine no rain fell in this island for the space of thirty years it may easily be conceived how injurious a drought of such continuance must have been to vegetation  there were formerly in this island a great number of cities of which at present nothing remains but the names and a few ruins there are some for the ancient situation of which it would be in vain to search famagusta and nicosia are the only places of importance unless larnic where the european merchants have their factory may be classed in the same rank besides these cyprus contains seven citadels which are commanded by the same number of governors  this island has produced many great men distinguished by their birth their virtues and their knowledge strabo does not hesitate to say that in this respect it is superior to most of the grecian islands  some authors assert that the air of this island is bad and unhealthful this prejudice prevents many strangers from remaining long enough in it to make the experiment but those who have inhabited the island for a twelvemonth have been convinced of its wholesomeness and of the error of ancient writers  tertian and quartan fevers are it is true very common and very obstinate in cyprus and in all the levant but these do not so much arise from the malignity of the air because it is easy to avoid them the excessive heat of the climate causes an abundant perspiration if people in this situation are so imprudent to expose themselves to the least breath of wind the pores become shut and perspiration is stopped which infallibly brings on a fever another cause of these fevers is the immoderate use of strong liquors and fruits particularly cucumbers and melons even the inhabitants seldom escape this epidemical disorder especially in summer but by slight bleeding and leaving nature to herself they are cured without physic or any other regimen than that of abstaining from fruits  this island was formerly one of the richest and most fertile in the world it abounded with mines of gold silver copper iron marcasite rock alum and even emeralds but of these ancient productions nothing remains besides the remembrance and the places from which they were procured the present government fetters curiosity and forbids every kind of research some centuries ago a great quantity of oil was made here but in the time of the venetians a spirit of speculation abolished that useful branch and the cultivation of olives was abandoned for that of cottons saffron rhubarb and other valuable productions are at present totally neglected deer roebucks asses wild bears and a great number of the most beautiful pheasants once enlivened the plains of cyprus but they are now all destroyed and it would seem as if these animals had refused to embellish a country which is no longer the seat of liberty  the principal productions of the island are at present silk cotton wool nutmegs wines turpentine kermes laudanum wheat barley coloquintida pitch tar glasswort salt st johns bread timber umbre and green earth  the soil here likewise produces pulse and all kinds of wild herbs a knowledge of which would be a valuable acquisition in botany but there are few trees and consequently few fruits nature however to make amends for this loss has been exceedingly lavish in flowers and the most beautiful and delicate plants of italy france and holland may easily be naturalized hyacinths anemonies ranunculuses and narcissuses both single and double which require so much care in europe thrive even upon the mountains without cultivation and render the beautiful plains of this island like an immense parterre nothing can be more agreeable than to walk near the spots where they grow at sunrising and sunsetting when the odoriferous particles put in motion by the heat of the sun or condensed by the coolness of the evening convey to the organs of smell a mixture of every perfume it is then that the enchanting dreams of fabulous antiquity are realized and that this island seems still the abode of pleasure and birthplace of love  among the wild flowers there is one called melissa or the beeflower which indeed has the shape of that industrious animal its root may be ranked among the class of bulbous plants the juice of it is an excellent specific for healing wounds  the cypriots cultivate a plant which they call chenna which is as tall and big as the pomegranate and resembles it in its trunk and branches its leaves are like those of the myrtle and its flowers like a bunch of grapes in blossom an oil is extracted from the fruit which has all the properties of balm the leaves either dried or green when boiled in water communicate a beautiful orange dye to cloth or stuff the cypriots use it for dying their hair which once impregnated with this color retains it for a long time after the turkish and some of the greek women rub their nails and the palms of their hand with it from an idea that it will render their skin white and give a higher bloom to the carnation of their cheeks in every country of the world one part of the women have endeavored to add to the graces of nature and the other to repair her faults all the scents and cosmetics invented by quackery have been often put to the proof but they have never been able to cure the insurmountable credulity of the sex  the venetians when masters of this island used to paint their horses but this custom is only continued in regard to white greyhounds and sheep  for want of hands great part of this island is uncultivated and produces nothing but thyme and other odoriferous herbs which perfume the surrounding atmosphere the luxuriance of nature left to herself sufficiently shows what happy effects agriculture would have on these fertile deserts  in the side of a mountain near paphos is a cavern which produces the most beautiful rock crystal on account of its brilliancy it has been called the paphian diamond it is cut and polished in the same manner as other precious stones people are forbid under severe punishment to carry away the smallest piece and the mountain is surrounded with guards  a similar prohibition has been made respecting the stone amianthus or asbestos of which there is a quarry near the village of paleandros incombustible cloth it is said has been made of it and fire instead of diminishing increases its whiteness this fact founded on the relation of pliny and dioscorides is in the opinion of the moderns one of those errors so common in the philosophy of the ancients the greeks at present call this stone caristia and some others the cotton stone  there are found here also red jaspers agates and three different kinds of stone the hills nearest to larnic consist wholly of tale which serves for the composition of that plaster used in all the houses of the country  no wild animals are seen here but foxes and hares the odoriferous plants on which the latter feed give their flesh an excellent taste and a most agreeable flavor hunting is the chief diversion of the europeans in this island and they maintain at a very great expense horses and packs of hounds no season can check their activity troops of hunters repair to the field by break of day and pursue without intermission their fugitive inhabitants  the most common of the winged tribe are rails partridges snipes quails and thrushes of waterfowl there is great abundance rails and partridges cost about twopence apiece snipes are something dearer as the inhabitants account them a delicacy all other birds are so cheap that they are rather given away than sold the beccaficos and ortolans are remarkably fat and so numerous that the peasants think they make a good market when they can dispose of them at the rate of a penny a dozen they are generally caught in greatest abundance near the village of s nappa a part of which they carry to the city parboiling the rest and putting them into vinegar with some ingredients proper for preserving them in this manner they keep them a whole year and sell them at the same price as the rest the grand vent for these birds is among the europeans of larnic who send them to france england holland and various parts of the ottoman empire there are exported every year from this island four hundred barrels containing from two to four hundred birds in each the usual method of dressing them in cyprus is to split them in the middle and put them on the gridiron with a slice of bread and a little parsley when broiled in this manner they make a most delicious meal  in the months of july and august the fields are covered with flocks of vultures but it appears this island is only a resting place in their passage to some other country all other birds the beccafico not excepted lay their eggs here though it is pretended that none of their eggs were ever seen in the island but this is no more true with respect to cyprus than of a thousand other places where the same thing has been asserted with as little foundation  among the venomous animals is a kind of serpent the greek name of which signifies the deafsnake its bite is mortal the body is about two feet long and an inch in diameter the color is black and yellow and it has two small horns on its head the greeks have given it a very improper name it being by no means deaf it generally frequents corn fields and the reapers besides wearing buskins six small bells to their scythes in order to frighten it away this precaution would be entirely useless if nature had deprived it of the organs of hearing at the village of tremitice is a greek family in whom the virtue of curing this bite is hereditary i saw two people wounded says mariti apply to a relation of this family who cured them merely by touching them all those who despised this remedy became victims to their incredulity and died some time after it is certain that all the virtue consists in a secret known only to these people for in touching the wound they dexterously apply a certain powder which causes a most acute pain but it vanishes in a moment  the tarantula of cyprus is a kind of spider of a brown color inclining to a black and covered with long hair its bite is not mortal but it is dangerous and often occasions excruciating pain accompanied with a fever  that of the galley is incurable this is a thin flat animal about a foot and a half long of a yellow color and furnished with a multitude of legs which it moves uniformly like the oars of a galley hence it has acquired that name  there is here also a black serpent about a yard or a yard and a half long but it is not venomous people take it in their hands without danger and having stripped off its skin broil the flesh which is said to be extremely well tasted  the horses of cyprus are not proper for the course but at paphos there are some highly esteemed for their pace called ciapcun a kind of accelerated trot which they will continue for six hours together over hills and plains without fatiguing the traveller the asses have the same pace as well as the mules which are reckoned the best in the whole levant  the oxen here are lean and of a small size the greeks never eat beef they hold it as a maxim that the animal which tills the ground is the servant of man and the companion of his daily labors and ought not to be used for food  the mutton is juicy and tender the tails of some of the sheep which are remarkably fine weigh upwards of fifty pounds and there are many that have three or even five horns nothing can be more beautiful than the flocks of goats seen in this island the great cleanliness of this animal the variety of its colors and its spotted skin afford a spectacle truly interesting when suspended from a rock or traversing the plains its agility and wanton gambols form an agreeable contract with the dignity of other animals  the greyhounds here are excellent for the chase and the lightning is scarce more rapid than their flight no sooner have they darted forward than they are seen on their prey and on this account those who wish to enjoy long sport take care to choose the heaviest greyhounds of a good breed have their ears and tail white and exceedingly soft their thighs long nervous and robust and the rest of their body red  chap xxxiii cities manners and customs etc having now given a general view of the face of the country in this celebrated island of antiquity and of its productions we shall proceed in this chapter to speak of the different cities and the manners and customs of the inhabitants  nicosia farmagusta and larnic seem at present the most important towns in this island of the ancient city of cithera so celebrated in the works of the poets and consecrated to the goddess of beauty no vestiges remain nor are there any of the ancient pathos which contained the celebrated temple of venus and was together with the city destroyed by an earthquake  nicosia stands in the center of the island in the middle of a vast plain and is surrounded by hills and mountains which bound it on all sides at the distance of ten miles  from the time of constantine till      the circumference of this city was ten miles but the venetians reduced it to three and fortified it thinking by this means the conquest of it would be more difficult nothing was respected they even demolished temples palaces and the most beautiful monuments and the gloomy policy of this people soon reduced nicosia to a heap of ruins there are still to be seen the foundations of a citadel erected by king james i of the lusignans and the remains of a conventual church in which were buried several sovereigns and among others hugo iv to whom boccace dedicated his book on the genealogy of the gods  a river named pedicus ran through the ancient city but in      its course was changed at present it is almost entirely dry and the little water seen in it during winter refreshes the neighboring plains  the city of nicosia under the family of the lusignans was the residence of the kings and the sea of an archbishop it contained a great many monasteries three hundred churches and a number of palaces and public buildings the year    0 was fatal to this city in the month of june of the same year the turks entered cyprus with a numerous army and after a siege of fortyfive days in which the inhabitants performed prodigies of valor nicosia was taken by a general assault of fifty thousand people who had retired within the walls for shelter twenty thousand were massacred and the rest put in irons  between the gate of famagusta and that of paphos are several tombs raised on a bastion one of which exceedingly beautiful and of the finest marble is said to be that of the officer who first planted the ottoman standard on the walls  the most beautiful edifice in this city is without doubt the church of st sophia where the kings of cyprus were formerly crowned it is built in the gothic style and consists of three large naves it contains the tombs of the lusignans and of several ancient cypriots and noble venetians as age has effaced the inscriptions they are absolutely unintelligible and the figures on the stones are so much mutilated that they cannot be distinguished  the church of st nicholas is at present the besisten a kind of hall where all sorts of provisions are sold the principal merchants likewise assemble here to transact business when i beheld a crowd of these merchants assembled in this ancient temple says mariti i could not help reflecting on that strange succession of events which puts conquerors into the place of the conquered converts a church into an exchange and makes an abode of peace set apart for prayer and devotion the center of all the petty interests of mankind  the seraglio is the palace of the muhassil the entrance is through a large court around which are various buildings and at the bottom the stables this edifice is built in the gothic taste and was the royal residence in the time of the christians it has experienced so many changes under a succession of bashaws that its original appearance is almost destroyed in the neighboring square is a turkish fountain affording excellent water for which this city is famous  from the ruins of the ancient buildings some idea may be formed of what this city originally was it plainly appearing the streets were spacious enough to display the magnificence of the palaces and building with which it was embellished this mode of building has been neglected and there is now no regular plan the greater part of the houses are perfect huts which destroy the charm arising from uniformity and make a ridiculous contract with the superb structures near them  the principal officers of the port to superintend the government of the island reside in this city it is also the residence of the principal greek and arminian families who by their different employments depend on the turkish government  the chief branch of trade is cotton cloth manufactured in the city though most of the other manufactures are carried on in the neighboring villages the turkey leather of this place has a more brilliant and lively color than that of barbary and the painted cottons instead of losing their splendour by being washed with soap become more beautiful the dye of the bucassins a kind of stuffs is composed of a mixture of the root of boia and oxs blood this red color well imprinted never fades  the country about nicosia is lively and animated from the top of the ramparts may be seen a great number of hamlets and villages some of which are very populous and flourishing the inhabitants do not confine themselves to agriculture but spin cotton and manufacture cloth which they afterward sell in the capital the greater part of these villages are ornamented with greek churches and groves of mulberrytrees which were formerly more numerous than they are at present  the mulberries in cyprus are planted at an equal distance from each other in strait lines and forming a small square grove composed of one two three and even five thousand plants they are somewhat more than five feet in height and about two feet in circumference these trees grow naturally taller but at cyprus the people lop the branches that they may have the leaves to give to their silk worms thus these trees are not suffered to grow old nor does the pruning knife even respect their first shoots care therefore is taken every year to plant new ones in order to supply a sufficiency of leaves no other attention is paid to them than to water them once or twice a day in summer a small reservoir made in the form of a vase is dug round each tree and the water being conveyed into it by small canals serves to refresh the roots  the city of famagusta was formerly called arsinoe from the name of the sister of ptolemy philadelphus who laid the foundation of it the name of famagusta comes originally from amocusta which signifies built in the sand and was given it on account of the thin sandy earth that surrounds it this city is situated on the eastern coast of the island it is built on a rock and is two miles in circumference the walls are thick strongly built and flat on the top they are surrounded by a deep ditch cut out of the solid rock and are flanked by twelve enormous towers the sides of which are four paces in thickness and enclose a circle five paces in diameter in      this city which may be called the key of the island was taken by the turks after a siege of ten months the ottoman army consisted of two hundred thousand men in the ten months during which the siege was carried on the turks fired five hundred and forty thousand bombs at present the remains of them may be seen in the neighboring gardens and fields and in the ditches which surround the city where they are still lying in heaps  we may form some idea of the bravery of the venetians from the number of turks who were killed before the place the garrison consisted of scarcely four thousand men and yet they destroyed above seventyfive thousand turks  famagusta in its external appearance is still in the same state as formerly the ditch is entirely dry and the walls are in good condition except a few towers which were damaged by the enemies cannon and which have not been repaired  the interior part of the city exhibits a very ruinous appearance the number of churches demolished is immense a very small spot only contained two hundred whereas at present there are scarce so many inhabitants in the whole city  at the distance of six miles from famagusta stood the ancient salamis which owed its origin to teucer whom his father drove from the island of salamis his native country this illustrious exile when at a distance from the spot which had given him birth wished at least to have an image of it and built this new salamis mentioned by horace no edifice has survived the wreck of time that can give us any idea of this city nothing is to be seen but scattered columns heaps of stone embrowned by age and the ruins of a building supposed to be a temple  salamis can boast of having produced a great number of illustrious men it was the country of aristo the historian of whom strabo speaks solon one of the grecian sages is believed to have been originally from this city cleobulus was born at salamis as was neocrion who commanded the naval army of alexander the great cum multis aliis  larnic distant from the port of salines about half a league is situated to the north of the ancient citium and even occupies a part of the ground on which it once stood it lies in the southern part of the island its origin is not precisely known but may be attributed to the proximity of the sea and the materials found in the ruins of citium the port of salines is one of the most flourishing in the kingdom this is owing no doubt to its happy situation and its proximity to larnic the center of the commerce of cyprus this place was formerly resorted to by people from all countries and the cypriots still regret those days of splendour when amidst so many nations customs and different languages each of them could like the ancient philosopher call himself a citizen of the world since that period things are greatly changed when i beheld this harbor says mariti at present deserted and called to mind its ancient celebrity i imagined i saw the bed of a dry river and that the multitude of foreign names inscribed and confounded on the neighboring stones were like those numerical signs which long after the annihilation of its waters are an evidence of its former abundance  the town of salines which stands on the borders of the sea extends much further in length than in breadth the citadel built by the turks in      is furnished with a great many pieces of artillery taken from the venetians this fortress full of fissures and embrowned with age toward the sea is falling fast into decay whilst its ancient walls are almost hid by a multitude of plants the offspring of time the tender and delicate shades of which form a charming contrast with the dark and gloomy color of its ruins  the adjoining city has been described by most travelers only as a pretty considerable town but if we observe that it is the storehouse of commerce for the island and that it holds the second rank in the kingdom though dependent on the government of nicosia it will be allowed we may be justified in styling larnic a city besides it is also the seat of a greek bishop and the place where the european consuls have fixed their residence  however this may be says mariti it is the most agreeable town in the whole island for i know nothing more interesting he adds than a commercial city i experience a secret pleasure in seeing a vast concourse of citizens and foreigners laboring in concert for the happiness of mankind and making of any metropolis a magazine for the whole world in my eyes the exchange is a vast assembly where all nations have their representatives factors in the commercial world are what ambassadors are in the political they negociate affairs sign treaties and keep up a useful correspondence between rich societies of men divided by seas and living at the two extremities of the earth i have often contemplated with a pleasing emotion an inhabitant of japan discussing his interest with a citizen of london or a subject of the great mogul entering into contract with a russian i was fond of being among these numerous agents of commerce distinguished by their dress their manners and their language and all searching for the same point by different routes here i beheld a body of armenians there an assembly of jews and a little further a group of dutchmen i became in succession a dane a swede a frenchman or rather i was a citizen of the world  all the buildings in this city are modern and it contains no monument of remote antiquity the mosque was formerly a latin church and is the only turkish place of worship in larnic the greeks have here three churches in which the people assemble three hours before day for all their religious ceremonies must be finished before sunrise  every greek and latin church is surrounded by walls the entrance is through a gate about three feet and a half in height which is made so low in order to prevent the turks from introducing horses and other animals into the enclosure  public edifices are all constructed of stone every other building is formed of bricks composed of a mixture of chopped straw and moist earth dried in the sun the cement used is nothing but the same clayey earth with the addition of a little fresh straw such in general is the construction of all the houses in the kingdom except in a few villages where stones are very common  the earthy color of these bricks gives them externally a dismal and melancholy appearance and travelers are agreeably surprised to find the inside of the houses airy and commodious the walls are whitened with a composition of tale  these houses have only one story above the groundfloor the roofs are formed of earth mixed with clay and the crevices produced by the heat in summer close of themselves during the rains in winter they are about nine inches in thickness and are supported by large beams over which are laid very thin laths covered with mats made of reeds they are however not proof against a continuance of wet weather and the inhabitants are under the necessity of giving them continual repair houses built after this manner have at least one advantage which is that they resist earthquakes sad experience has taught the cypriots to prefer them to houses built of stone they are paved with very soft white marble which easily exfoliates every house has a garden the cultivation of which is the principal amusement of the cypriots  among the private houses are some which on account of their grandeur and the richness of their furniture may be considered as palaces such is that of the english consul it contains a saloon capable of receiving five hundred people and is ornamented with ancient tapestry and excellent paintings all the other apartments equally beautiful look for the most part into a delightful garden kept in excellent order  the houses of the greeks and turks are generally pretty large and spacious but built in a whimsical style and laid out in an irregular manner  those who travel in the east cannot help observing how inferior architecture is there to what it was formerly in this art the orientals produced wonders without mentioning the tower of babel the foundations of which according to an ancient writer were still existing in his time like a vast mountain what could be more worthy of admiration than the walls of babylon its hanging gardens and temple of belus the height of which divided into eight stories of a furlong each was consequently a mile and on the summit of which was erected the observatory of this proud city to which might be added that immense rock cut into the figure of semiramis whilst some smaller ones represented tributary kings prostrated before her  many learned men have indeed ranked these wonders of art amongst the fables of antiquity but their incredulity in this respect is founded upon nothing else than the impossibility of erecting such monuments at present the ancients certainly enjoyed advantages we have not the earth was exceedingly fertile and the greater part converted into pastures which require much fewer hands than agriculture there was scarcely any commerce to employ the active part of mankind few arts and sciences to engage the attention of the sedentary and contemplative and besides this monarchs were absolute and when they went to war they put themselves at the head of all their people we are told that semiramis carried with her three millions of men and yet she found herself before an army still more numerous is it surprising then that this queen on her return from war as she could with a single word command all that multitude should have executed these wonders of her imagination in these climates also a succession of seasons was unknown and winter never fettered the activity of the labourer amongst other advantages might be reckoned the bitumen which according to historians covered the surface of the earth and this species of cement furnished by nature is probably the same which the scriptures tell us was employed in constructing the tower of babel do not the pyramids of egypt correspond with the descriptions given of them by the ancients nor have i the least doubt says mariti but that an ingenious traveller might still discover some remains of that famous labyrinth which covered a whole province and which in its vast circumference contained an hundred temples dispersed through its different divisions the chinese wall is also one of those constructions which make a considerable figure in the scale of human industry and were not this monument of oriental grandeur still extant would it not be classed among the number of historical fables and chimeras the doubts started respecting the existence of these prodigies of art attest much less the wisdom of our criticism than the narrow and confined sphere of our modern conceptions  the water of larnic was formerly very bad and the destruction of the ancient aqueducts of criticism was greatly lamented a bashaw zealous for the good of the public caused new ones to be constructed and these kept in proper repair continue to distribute throughout the city the excellent waters of a spring from the neighboring village of arpera  the city is governed by a digdaban or commissary this is the second office of dignity in the island and the power of appointing a person to fill it up is vested in the governorgeneral  the pretorian palace is the residence of the cadi and of the president of the codgias these codgias are virtuous old men whose counsels are listened to with attention and followed with punctuality  the sentences passed in this tribunal are only provisional but in some cases of little consequence no appeal can be made in those of importance the affair is referred to the tribunal of nicosia which determines in the last instance  three hours after sunset the guard of the culaches otherwise called the watch issues from the palace of the digdaban its business is to preserve peace among the inhabitants and whoever walks abroad at that hour without a light is made a prisoner subjects of the empire are conducted to the public prisons and europeans to the palace of their consul when they have committed no other crime they are discharged on paying a small acknowledgment to the guard  in the city of larnic or rather in the whole kingdom of cyprus there are people belonging to six european nations french english tuscans neapolitans venetians and ragusans each have their respective consul except the tuscans these are under the protection of the english consul who is honored even with the title of viceconsul of tuscany there are here also imperialists danes swiss dutch and genoese but as all these have long ceased to carry on commerce by themselves they entrust their commissions to correspondents whom they among the other nations have established in this island  in the neighborhood of this city are a multitude of cisterns covered with a viscous kind of cement impenetrable to oil which were formerly as it is said vast reservoirs for containing that liquid this cement is a mixture of marine salt lime and boiling oil  the country round larnic is not the most pleasant in the island the soil being extremely barren the sun falls almost perpendicular on these parched fields and while the fatigued traveller breathes a scorching air he searches in vain for some grove the shade of which may afford him shelter to recruit his exhausted strength if the fields however are dry and barren the orchards are rich and fruitful they are remarkably pleasant and watered by small canals formed in the earth the gardens are equally beautiful and abound with all kinds of flowers the citron and the orange trees thrive in them wonderfully  though this island does not seem to possess many considerable cities according to mariti it abounds with beautiful villages some of which are almost as large as towns and very populous among others he describes in glowing terms the village of piscopia near the ancient cythera this village says he is one of the most flourishing places in cyprus it abounds in citron orange and olive trees the trees are watered by a multitude of springs and the scenery around is delightful the pleasantness of the abode seems as it were to have been transfused into the souls of the inhabitants who are sprightlier and more amiable than in any other part of the kingdom they have lively imaginations which renders their conversation most agreeable they paint rather than speak and their comparisons like that nature which furnishes them with images breathes an air of delicacy and grace  dale another village to the south of nicosia is likewise described by mariti in animated terms this village says he is delightfully situated on an eminence and is rendered still more pleasant by the vicinity of a number of small groves its waters are remarkably limpid and the banks are ornamented with a thousand odoriferous herbs which enamel the plains and diffuse an agreeable fragrance throughout the surrounding atmosphere sweet marjoram is above all very common this plant and the spot where it grows are elegantly introduced by virgil in that charming picture he gives of innocence reposing peacefully in the bosom of beauty in a rural and solemn retreat dale was formerly called idalicum and one of the four villages consecrated to the goddess venus as she herself says in the tenth book of the aeneid  chap xxxiv having now furnished the cities towns and villages in this island we will proceed to the people their character customs manners and amusements with respect to their persons the cypriots are in general tall and wellmade they have also a noble and agreeable air and in their manner of living cypriots are very sober and temperate the women says mariti have nothing beautiful but their eyes their features are destitute of delicacy yet they have always been held in the highest estimation for their charms and it is from among them that our writers of lovesongs select their models but it must be confessed that the european ladies have no occasion to be proud of the comparison few of them being remarkable for their beauty in stature they are like the men very tall of an amorous disposition and much inclined to indolence and voluptuousness they for the most part attain to a good old age and it is no uncommon thing to see great grandmothers become tired of widowhood and enter again into the bands of hymen all the greeks are fond of pleasure but the cypriots give themselves up to a degree of licentiousness and consider the gratifying of their inclinations as an act of religion  the people of this island dress nearly in the same manner as the inhabitants of constantinople the ladies are distinguished by nothing but their light and lofty headdress this is a very ancient fashion and has hitherto been preserved in the island their dress according to the cyprian taste is much closer than that used by the turks and consists of a small vest and a petticoat of red cotton cloth their robe is of cloth velvet or silk it is a long piece of stuff proceeding from the shoulders which passes below the arms and hangs down to the ground it does not meet before and leaves that part of the body entirely uncovered their shifts are of silk and manufactured in the kingdom they wear breeches or a kind of drawers and to half boots of yellow leather are fixed toward the ancle sandals which serve them for shoes they have no stays a plain vest of cotton marks out their shape and preserves the pliableness of the body over the whole is thrown a very fine shift or light veil with which their modesty is not contented and to which they add one made of some kind of stuff less delicate and transparent around their necks they have gold chains and their arms are ornamented with pearls and jewels their headdress is an assemblage of beautiful printed muslin handkerchiefs arranged so as to form something like a helmet to the extremities of which they affix another handkerchief folded into the shape of a triangle and suffered to float over the shoulders this kind of helmet raises them a foot and a half and gives them a theatrical and gigantic appearance these pyramidical headdresses so fashionable in this island offend against taste and good sense the head of itself is the masterpiece of nature and these foreign ornaments destroy its effect it occupies the highest and most conspicuous part of the human figure nature has omitted nothing that could embellish the face she has spread over it a fresh and delicate complexion and rendered it still more striking by the beautiful enamel of two rows of teeth she has made it the seat of smiles and modesty the brilliant sense of seeing animates and enlivens the scene on each side are suspended the organs of hearing and the least motion in the human body becomes the agreeable source of enchanting expression she has given it attitudes graces and motions of which words can convey but an imperfect idea the hair hangs over it and like a floating shade sets off its beauty to admiration in short she has imprinted in it the seal of perfection and the head serves in some measure as a cupola to the most elegant of her works to overload it therefore with superfluous and preposterous ornaments is to destroy its admirable proportion and substitute in the places of real beauties childish and ridiculous toys among the cyprian ladies the greater part of the hair is concealed under these ornaments they however divide it on the forehead and extend it over each temple toward the ears behind they suffer it to fall in ringlets and those who have a great quantity form it into eight or ten tresses they are passionately fond of perfumes especially on the head which they cover with all kinds of flowers the catholic ladies in the island are remarkably coquettish and take great pains to display the elegance of their dress their eyes seem to invite adulation and the opinion they form of those around them is decided by their slowness or readiness to gratify their desires  the character of this people and the ideas they seem to have formed of love is different from that of european nations that ecstacy and delirium that union of souls which leads us into a kind of intoxication which deifies in our eyes the object of our affections and renders love a divine emotion and an indissoluble chain is never known here all the different shades of sensibility escape them they feel nothing of the moral influence of love and are acquainted only with its unbridled fury it is a want which they gratify and not a sentiment which hurries them away a european always embellishes the object whom he loves and every day and every moment discovers in her new charms and new graces he multiplies them as one may say and experiences even in constancy all the pleasures of variety such is love in temperate regions where the two powers of which man is formed are in harmony and where the physical sensation is subordinate to the moral sentiment but in those countries where the irresistible and continual action of a scorching atmosphere destroys the harmony of these two powers the violence of the sensation extinguishes the energy of the sentiment and man yields to the most impetuous of passions and not to the mildest of affections  as an instance of debauchery of manners in this island mariti mentions the adoration paid by the women to the abdales these are pious vagabonds or a sect of turkish monks who wander from one town to another without any fixed residence no sooner has an abdale arrived in any town than all the women go to visit him they flock round him and even make frequent assignations with him without the least scruple and some even do not blush to submit to his desires in the middle of the streets while a simple cloak conceals from view those superstitious orgies resembling in this respect according to bruce the inhabitants of abyssinia who like the cypriots in their amors seem lost to all sense of modesty  we shall now give a description of a cyprian hunting match which though chiefly remarkable for the extraordinary discipline of the dogs may not be displeasing to many of our readers we have already remarked the cypriots are remarkably fond of hunting gallantry hunting and the cultivation of their gardens seem to constitute the whole of their amusements a sportsman however in this island seldom goes out alone to pursue a feeble animal with his fusee and a couple of dogs the cypriots love exercise but they wish to enliven their excursions with jollity and mirth they therefore go in large parties mounted on horses and accompanied by whole packs of dogs the hunting match at which i was present says mariti was a very brilliant one it being that of the governor on our arrival in a spacious plain interspersed with clumps of mulberrytrees some ruins and thick bushes the sportsmen began to form a ring in order to enclose the enemy the barrier consisted of guards placed on horseback with dogs in the intervals the ladies of the greatest distinction in nicosia with a multitude of other people stood on a little hill which i also ascended and from that eminence enjoyed the amusement without sharing in the fatigue the governor and his suite were posted in different parts of the plain and as soon as the appointed moment arrived the hunt was opened with the sound of musical instruments part of the dogs were then loosened which ranging through the bushes and underwood sprang a great number of rails partridges and woodcocks the governor began the sport by bringing down one of these birds his suite followed his example and the winged tribe into whatever quarter they flew were sure of meeting instant death i was struck with the tranquillity of the stationary dogs for notwithstanding the instinct with which they were naturally spurred on not one of them quitted his post but the rest ran about in pursuit of the game and the plain was cleared in an instant the scene now changed a hare started from a bush the dogs pursued and while she made a thousand turnings to avoid her enemy they met her at every point she however often defeated the greyhounds and i could not but admire the sagacity of these animals which disdaining the assistance of those which were young and inexperienced waited until some of the cunning old ones opened the way for them and then the whole plain was in motion during this scene the beauty of the season the cheerfulness with which i was surrounded the barking of the dogs reechoed a thousand times from the hills the cries of the hunters and the sound of the horns exalted my imagination and kept me i may say in a kind of enchantment when the poor animal was just going to be a prey to his enemies the governor rushed forwards and throwing a stick before the dogs they all instantly stopped and not one of them ventured to pass the signal one of the swift greyhounds being then let loose pursued the hare and having come up with it carried it back and jumping on the neck of the governors horse placed it before him the governor took it in his arms and gave orders if it concontinued alive to shut it up in his park where he maintained many other prisoners taken in the same way such was the humanity of this governor a turk who thought it his duty to preserve an animal which had afforded him so much amusement  chap xxxv religion government population and language religions are very much diversified in this island the turks never carried their tyranny so far as to attempt to render theirs universal had this moderation been adopted by all sovereigns it would have saved abundance of human blood and not have so frequently placed a greater distance between the members of the same nation than is to be found between people separated by immense seas or inaccessible mountains the greater part of the inhabitants are greek schismatics besides a multitude of armenians there are here a great many maronites whose religious customs differ little from those of the roman catholics the latins are far from being so numerous and consist only of europeans and the brotherhood of st francis known throughout the levant under the name of the fathers of the holy land  the turks here have a mullah who is also in some measure the chief of the law the greeks an archbishop and three bishops the arminians a bishop the maronites a high priest and the latins two rectors one for the french and the other for the italians religious toleration in this island is extended to all nations  there are very few english in it and doubtless it is for this reason that they have neither a church a chapel or a minister of their religion should they happen to multiply they will endeavor to procure all these things here as elsewhere it is known that man is by excellence a religious being and that religion is the strongest bond which attaches a people to their sovereign by exhibiting him as the representative of the deity we have spoken pretty fully of the mohammedan worship under the article of religion in turkey we shall however offer some strictures from mariti on their mode of preaching in cyprus  were we to judge of their discourses from ours we should form a very false idea of them the mussulmans eloquence admits nothing of the common place kind less diffuse and less ornamented than the european oratory every foreign idea and every useless expression are carefully banished from it a turkish sermon is a continued series of maxims and sentences the minister never attempts to prove dogmas which no one doubts nor does he ever address himself to the audience as to unbelievers morality is the basis of their discourses which contain regulations for conduct in every circumstance of life and consolation for every kind of misfortune to which men may be exposed the person of the orator is as simple as his discourse and the profligacy of his conduct never destroys the beauty of his morality a young voluptuary is never seen declaiming against effeminacy and pleasure an opulent dignitary preaching the contempt of riches or an elegant beau satyrising vice and luxury these ridiculous contrasts so common and yet so little taken notice of in europe would highly offend these people who are fond of simplicity they would believe one ridiculed both them and their religion and the latter is an object upon which a good mussulman will never suffer raillery  the kingdom of cyprus was for a long time governed by a bachan but when the island began to lose its ancient splendour its expenses became excessive and the people were so oppressed by taxes that they complained of this burden and begged the ottoman port to give them instead of a bashaw a muhassil or simple governor this request was complied with but the cypriots by changing masters were not freed from oppression and being equally harrassed under the muhassil they again complained and petitioned for a bashaw all their supplications were however useless and they still continue to groan under a yoke they once thought less severe and less burthensome  the revenues of the kingdom are abandoned to the grand vizier who farms them to the highest bidder the purchaser furnished with a special mandate from the grand signior countersigned by the minister arrives in his government and like the clouds that precede tempests and conceal all those scourges that desolate our plains the presence of this subaltern despot impresses universal terror and presages every evil  if interest be here as it really is the sure path to preferment it is also the only rule which regulates the actions of the great there is nothing to check these avaricious governors they fall on the people with fury and their subtle tyranny invents a thousand means to get possession of their wealth and extort from them the fruits of their industry every day gives birth to some new tax and the governor after having fattened on the substance of the people  after having enriched the agents of his cruelty and become the object of public execration retires loaded with gold and maledictions and gives place to a new purchaser who to make himself amends for a bad bargain thinks that he is entitled to exercise equal rapacity and oppression the consequence is that this beautiful kingdom is reduced to the most deplorable condition and drained of all its specie in no country whatever are taxes more accumulated altogether they amount to about two hundred piastres for each citizen capitation throughout the whole turkish empire is forty piastres and it was only by a special favor that it was here reduced to twentyone  gold here is the universal agent and every thing is purchased by it says mariti even to the blood of the citizens the law it is true orders an assassin to be put to death but the criminal by paying a few hundred piastres easily avoids its vengeance the fine for murdering a man between thirty and thirtyfive years of age is five hundred piastres  the tribunals to which all civil and criminal cases are referred are called mehemes the president of these tribunals is in the capital a mullah and in towns or large villages a cadi  the military government of the island is in the hands of the alibey a general of the cavalry and the agajanissary commandant of the infantry their respective captains are called zaim and cioluagini there ought to be three thousand horses in the island and about eight thousand janissaries but there are scarce ever more than an hundred of the former and two thousand of the latter the pay however is always the same and is received by the commanders  when the turks conquered cyprus they reckoned in it besides women children and old people seventy thousand men subject to capitation such was always the number of its inhabitants in the short moments of its splendour and glory but despotism having overrun this rich island its sources of abundance are dried up and its population is so much decreased that the number of inhabitants scarce amount to forty thousand this calculation is perhaps not very accurate it being difficult to ascertain the exact number of inhabitants either in cyprus or in any countries of the levant the orientals do not like the europeans keep a register of births and deaths no notion therefore can be formed of this population but from the number of those paying taxes and who are not above a third part of the whole  chap xxxvi commerce of cyprus and its wines the three principal articles of commerce in the island of cyprus are cotton silk and wine the cotton on account of its whiteness softness and the length of its filaments is accounted the best in the whole levant the high price at which it sells is a sufficient proof of its superiority over every other kind used in europe and of the intrinsic value of this staple commodity of the island  the season of sowing this plant is the month of april the ground destined for the reception of the seed is prepared much in the same manner as that for corn as soon as the plants appear above ground the weakest are pulled up and none left but those which are strong and vigorous the crops are collected in the months of october and november and as some time is necessary before the seed can be freed from its cover or husk the first exportation does not take place till february or march in the year following  it is accounted a good crop when the whole produce of the kingdom amounts to five thousand bags about half a century ago the island produced eight thousand and under the government of the venetians thirty thousand  silk is another important branch of the commerce of the island of cyprus the method of breeding silkworms here is almost the same as that employed in italy but it is not subject in cyprus to those inconveniences which arise from a variation of the atmosphere the season at that epoch being always beautiful and favorable the quality of the silk depends on the places where it is collected the finest and whitest is that produced in the environs of famagusta and carpassia the orange and sulphurcoloured is made in cythera or the villages beyond the northern mountains and that of a goldyellow color is produced in the territories of paphos and the adjacent country the turks purchase the greater part of the orangecoloured silk for which they pay a piastre more and send it to cairo the people there are remarkably fond of this color and the silk besides is capable of being spun into much finer and more delicate threads this island produces one year with another twentyfive thousand bags of silk  the whole quantity of the best wines made annually in cyprus amounts to forty thousand jars or ten thousand barrels italian measure each jar contains five bottles florence measure  the principal part of the wine trade is carried on with the venetians for the wines of cyprus are drank at venice even in the coffeehouses these people however are not the nicest in their choice since the wine which they purchase is never above eighteen months old the price consequently is very low being never more than a piastre a jar a piastre according to mariti does not amount to quite three shillings english other writers make it equivalent to four shillings the wines exported to other countries are from five to six years old  almost all the wines on the island are sent to larnic which in all the ports of the levant is known to be the grand magazine for this commodity they are transported in leather bags and as they serve to hold indifferent as well as good wines they are pitched with very little attention  hence arises that pitchy smell observed in the new wines of cyprus which might be much less were care employed in pitching the skins as a proof of this it may be remarked that in the country where the vessels are better prepared the wines have not the same strong smell as those transported to the city  after it has been kept some time it begins to lose its pitchy smell and when it has attained to the age of twelve or fifteen years it loses it entirely  subterranean cellars are not known at larnic the cellars there are all above ground and very long and narrow the casks are placed upon joists or on small walls raised about a hands breadth from the ground these cellars are called kilaw and it is not thought of any importance in respect to the quality of the wine to build them toward any one point of the horizon more than to another they have very little light and the openings that admit it are constructed in the extremity opposite to the passage on each side of which the casks are ranged they are never opened but when it is necessary to perform some operation on the wine new wine when taken from the skins is put into earthern vessels and not removed into casks till after the expiration of a year  it is for the most part customary not to fill each cask entirely a certain vacuum is left in them and if they were only half full the wine would sustain no injury  cyprus wine does not leave on the sides of the vessel in which it is contained that calcareous brilliant crust which we call tartar it however deposits at the bottom a certain sediment which partakes of a black red and yellow color and which in drying acquires the consistence of a soft paste and assumes the color of spanish snuff  the price of the best wines is generally from two to three piastres that of new wines or those made within the course of a year is as we have before observed only one piastre they have also an ordinary wine which is never more than a quarter of a piastre per jar and in many villages not above half that sum  strabo the geographer describing the island of cyprus in the end of his relation passes a high encomium on its wines  pliny the naturalist reckons them among the most valuable wines of the earth  the vineyards of cyprus says gregory le grand are the most fertile of all those that i know and their wines which are in great request in all commercial countries are a sure source of riches  aponius admires the size of the grapes the abundant and delicate juice of which perfumes the mouth  one is surprised to read in a relation printed at bologna in      that selim ii emperor of the turks without respecting the talim went to conquer cyprus in order that he might be master of its wines  this prince had wasted his youth in the effeminacy and debauchery of the seraglio and the laurels of his predecessors appeared to him objects of contempt rather than envy as being too dearly purchased by the fatigues and dangers of arms a question however put to him by one of his women changed in an instant his pacific disposition some excellent cyprus wine with which the favorite was not acquainted being served up to them during a voluptuous repast she found it so delicious that she asked selim from what place he had procured it and whether the fortunate soil that produced it was contained within the vast extent of his empire the sultan finding himself humbled by this question suddenly quitted his new favorite and having convoked his council appointed piali admiral of his galleys and mustapha generalissimo of his forces and gave orders for all his troops to be assembled and hold themselves in readiness to receive his commands i propose said he to conquer cyprus an island which contains a treasure that none but the king of kings ought to possess  this expedition is described in a very interesting manner by father angelo of the order of st dominic and vicar general of the holy land he resided at cyprus at the time when nicosia was taken  we are almost tempted to smile when we find  historians telling us that selim undertook this enterprise from motives of glory  another monk called stephen lusignan who was also a witness to the defeat of the cypriots in some measure confirms this fact which we have related he says that the ottomans having in their researches discovered some wine eighty years old sent it with great care to the seraglio as the most valuable part of the booty these wines were reserved for the sick and to give an idea of their quality father stephen tells us that they kindled in the fire like oil  there is no longer any of these wines in cyprus the oldest that can be found are those preserved under ground in earthen vessels their age in general does not exceed twenty or twentyfive years and there would be none even so old were it not for the custom which the christians have at burying one of these vessels at the birth of each child to be served up afterward at their marriage this wine whatever may be the fate of the child is never employed in commerce  i do not know says mariti what may have been the properties of those wines eighty years old which were formerly very common in the island but i can assert that those kept at present for twenty years cure several diseases and even some that are inveterate as i myself have experienced  having been attacked for two months with a tertian ague which degenerated into a quartan i was beginning to despair of my condition when a cypriot whom i accidently saw made me acquainted with the remedy usually employed in such cases which is only a glass of old wine drank when the fit increases having followed this prescription i soon fell asleep and when i awakened i found myself perfectly well and was never troubled more with the disorder such cures belong to the marvelous no doubt but they are nevertheless true and appear very simple to the cypriots  cyprus wine is also employed with equal success for cleansing wounds if a rag is dipped in a glass full of this wine and applied to the injured part it becomes a salutary balm which does not fail soon to heal the wound and cause it to close entirely  these wines are not equally good at every season of the year if the spring and summer are favorable to them the winter is prejudicial to them in cold countries they appear then to have lost all delicacy and flavor on this account connoisseurs take the precaution to place them near the fire before they are drank  in warm weather it is of utility toward their preservation to put them into cool cellars as every place suits them equally they will keep as well on a wooden as on an earthen floor  by pouring cyprus wine from the bottle it may be easily known whether it be old when certain oily particles are found adherent to the glass it is a sign of age wine clarified by art is too much enervated to produce that effect it is not so easy to determine whether it be genuine because it may be adulterated a thousand different ways the most usual is to mix it with muscadines and perfumes to prevent any fraud in this respect nothing is better than to learn from what part it comes and never to purchase but from merchants of known probity  chap xxxvii of the modern greeks their character manners customs dress etc a greek gentleman is without doubt the most haughty and conceited being in the universe those men who by their birth or fortune hold the first rank among the greeks are called kings as the women who excel in beauty are denominated queens the kings of ancient greece were so numerous inconsiderable and vain that during the reign of the emperors the nobility might well style themselves kings which title they accordingly assumed and it remains with them to this day anciently the same appellation was given to the powerful and the rich horace calls them the sovereigns of the earth terence in conformity to the greek language gives to all the ladies of a certain rank the title of queens notwithstanding your rank and your income you may pretend what you will says martial to maximus we are equal i sup with you you supped with some one else last night i am coming to pay my court to you this morning you have already done so before me i accompany you as my patron and king and you likewise attend in the suite of another but it is enough to be a client without being the proud servant of any one he who can be king in his own house does not stand in need of another  the greeks ever vain and ambitious give more commonly the title of archondas and archondisa that is of prince and princess to those distinguished by their rank or opulence this word comes from the greek word archose which signifies a prince the archers at athens succeeded the sovereigns the second bore the name of king and that of archon has been since given to the first lords of the emperors court from hence the title of archondas is taken up by such among the modern greeks as pretend to a superiority over the rest of the people  there are no chimnies in the greek houses a brazier is made use of to heat the apartments and for those persons to warm themselves by who are cold this custom is very ancient all over the east the romans had no other and the turks have preserved it the brazier was placed in the middle of the apartment and dry wood burned in it with torches to give light it was placed as at present upon a tripod lamps did not come in use till long after  to protect the face from the inconvenience and heat of the brazier the tendour was invented this is a square table under which the fire is placed and is covered with a carpet which reaches to the ground over this is thrown a silk covering more or less valuable round which the company sit either on a sopha or on the carpet this utensil is chiefly in use among the ladies who in winter sit near it the whole day occupied in embroiderings and receiving the visits of their friends  embroidery is the chief occupation of the greek women they go out but little and those that are obliged to labor for the support of their families like our spinners work from morning to night together with their children and their slaves the picture of the industrious woman in virgils eighth book of his aeneid is an exact copy after nature  i have been says guys an eyewitness of this living picture the lamp of a female embroiderer my neighbor was lighted before daybreak and all her young maidens were seated early at their work and enlivened their labor with songs  we are indebted to the greeks for the art of embroidery which is of very ancient date and was carried by them to the utmost degree of perfection the cretans particularly excelled in this art when the talents of a young slave were mentioned by the ancients to be skilful in embroidery was all that was requisite they worked then as they do at present in the apartments with their mistresses  agamemnon disputing the fair chriseis with achilles says i should prefer her even to clitemnestres the queen nor is she inferior to her either in beauty in wit or in her skilfulness at all kinds of embroideries  the ladies of the highest rank prepared the wool for embroidering themselves and had no other occupation  the trojan women when their town was besieged seized with a rage for fighting wished to lay aside their spindles and embroidery in order to take up arms the prudent theano stops them and says return home i entreat you and resume your embroidery and other such like occupations and confide to men the task of driving away the greeks and protecting you  homer is frequent in his eulogium on the grecian embroideries antinous says he presented to penelope a mantle the embroidery of which was very elegant and the colors variegated with great art and skill  what the same poet says of the veils embroidered by helen and andromache has given rise to a discussion whether these embroideries were embossed although this art has made great progress by seeing what was done now some conjecture may be made of what was done in ancient times i do not think with the author of the origin of laws that they had recourse to painted patterns the design was drawn as it is at present upon the silk or linen and the embroiderer shaded it with her wool of different colors nature being the great model the embroidery at first imitated the most simple flowers of one or two colors and by degrees those that were more variegated figures and a mixture of shades were introduced in proportion as the art of dying colors and working them were brought to perfection it is certain that all the women in greece embroidered and that the men deemed it an honor to wear the garments that had been worked by them  quintus curtius in his history of alexander the great acquaints us that this prince having received a quantity of stuffs and rich garments after the fashions of his country sent them to sysigambis with the slaves who had worked them desiring she might be acquainted that if she approved of the presents her daughters might be taught how they were to be worked in order to fill up their time and make presents of them when finished at these words the tears which fell from her cheeks showed the little value she set on them and how injurious she thought the compliment that was paid her there being nothing which the women in persia think a greater disgrace than to employ themselves in works of this kind alexander finding she was mortified went to see her and told her that the robe which he wore was not only presented to him by his sister but even worked by her from thence says he you may judge that the custom of my country has misled me  the custom is still kept up in all the greek families of any rank of considering the person who nursed either the master or mistress as part of the family among the ancient greeks a woman who had brought up the daughter of any person of rank always continued with her even after marriage and was considered as her governess her confidant and counselor it is for this reason that in the ancient greek tragedies a princess scarce ever appears upon the scene without being accompanied by her nurse this custom is so well kept up that the modern name of nurse paranama is even more expressive than the ancient and signifies second mother she is always kept in the house after having nursed one of the children and is in some measure from that time incorporated as one of the family  the greek ladies still refuse to suckle their children in order to preserve their beauty their breasts and even their health which they consider as likely to be affected by it they have ever been told that their ideas in this respect were erroneous and that they made themselves no better than stepmothers by thus abandoning their children to the care and nourishment of strangers the force of example and custom has prevailed over all these reasons there is nothing that has been written in the present age on this interesting subject more forcible than the discourse of a greek philosopher preserved to us by aulus gellius and which is well worth being related this philosopher went to pay a visit to the wife of one of his people a person of high rank who had just been brought to bed when the first compliments were over he enquired of the mother of the lady if her daughter proposed to suckle her infant god forbid replied the mother would you have my daughter after the pain she has undergone take upon her so irksome and disagreeable an office ah madam replied the philosopher let her not be a halfmother and after having borne for nine months in her womb and nourished with her blood an unformed being whom she never saw nor knew refuse the milk which nature has given her to a human being who is come forth into the world whom she sees who exists before her eyes and implores her assistance by the most affecting cries  after the nurse come the slaves and the servants the female slaves are still treated as they were in ancient times with great humanity and gentleness and after a certain time have their freedom given to them they assist their mistress as they used to do formerly in their embroidery and do all the business of the house ariadne when she was abandoned by theseus exclaimed from grief how gladly she would be reduced to the condition of her servants she consented like a slave to make the beds to prepare the frames for the needle work to carry even on her shoulders a very a greek lady heavy pitcher and to give her dear theseus water to wash himself before he sat down to table  the servants do not remain at home when their mistress goes out they are obliged to follow her and this custom is still in practice among the greeks zaleucus disciple of pythagoras and legislator of locres in italy his native country to repress the luxury and vanity of the nobles enacted a law that no woman of quality should be attended by more than one servant except she was drunk  the numerous attendants which accompany a grecian lady is in greece what a fine equipage is in england with this difference that no woman of any character can go out alone she must at least have one servant with her those of high rank whose vanity induces them to make an ostentatious display of their grandeur have many slaves to follow them  i have already said that the daughters were scarce ever permitted to go out not even to church till they were married this last custom is not so scrupulously adhered to in the present age they dare not however appear even now in the company of men except in the presence of their parents nausicac says to ulysses which of us without the permission of her parents would appear in public with a man before she was married such were the wisdom and simplicity of manners in ancient times how very different are those of the present age  the wise phocydides said keep your daughters closely shut up and do not permit them to appear even at the threshold of your doors till they are married  the young greeks amuse themselves with different games they pass their time in embroidering or in looking at passengers through the blinds of their windows which are so contrived as to enable them to see without being perceived  they have also in greece another ancient custom which is to present their hands to their daughters their slaves and others who are their inferiors to kiss euripides makes alcestes in the tragedy call all her women about her by name one after the other and hold out her hand to them that they may kiss it  after the kissing of hands the greatest mark of respect in the east when accosting a person of superior rank is to kiss or touch the hem of his garment and then to approach the hand to their lips this is the manner in which the turks salute their patrons and for a turk to permit an inferior to kiss the skirt of his garment is considered as taking him under their protection on this subject i was witness says guy to an act of great generosity and humanity on the part of a turk  the late marquis de villeneuve after having concluded a treaty of peace between the emperor and the grand signior went to the audience of the sultan at the arsenal two french slaves perceiving the ambassador made their escape and went and threw themselves at the feet of the ambassador begging him to redeem them their master came up and m de villeneuve having asked him how much he required for their ransom they are free replied the turk and were no longer mine from the instant they had the good fortune to kiss the robe of the french ambassador m de villeneuve struck with the subimlity of this sentiment which charmed all the spectators pulled out a very fine watch which he had in his pocket and presented it to the generous mussulman  the young girls in greece have among them a game which consists in kissing each other on the eyes whilst they take hold of the ears this tender and affectionate mode of kissing is very ancient tibulius in his elegies notices it natusque parenti oscula compressis auribus eripiet lib   eleg   and the child snatches from his parent kisses seizing him by the ears  i do not like alcippus says a shepherd in theocritus because when i gave him a very handsome pigeon he did not take hold of me by the ears and kiss me  chap xxxviii dress lucian represents the greek ladies at their toilets surrounded with many attendants some of them held the glass others a ewer full of water then came the drugs which serve to darken the eyebrows to paint the cheeks and the lips then the chains necklaces bracelets earrings in short they were covered with gold and jewels from head to feet in the present age there would be rather something to add than to diminish from this description all these ornaments still subsist and particularly the gold chains which make a very necessary appendage to the dress of the greek ladies in going back to the times of homer we find the same embellishments for the toilette the deity who afterward fabricated the buckler for achilles had not before disdained amusing himself in making ornaments of this sort  when my mother says vulcan ashamed of having brought me into the world so deformed had thrown me into the sea that i might have been for ever concealed in its abyss i should have suffered a great deal if the beautiful thetis and eurynome the daughters of ocean had not picked me up i remained nine years in a deep cave occupied in making for them bracelets agraffs necklaces buckles rings and aigrettes for the hair hom iliad b     the ladies formerly as at present wore their hair tied and much longer than the men  leucippus says pausanias let his hair grow to make a sacrifice of it to the river alpheus after having tied it in the same manner as the girls he put on female attire and went to see daphne who was deceived by the disguise  the headdress of the greek ladies especially when it is low is generally set off by a herons feather and they then place in front another small black feather or a colored one frizzing the hair round with a low curl  may not these feathers bear some relation to the ancient custom spoken of by winkleman in his beautiful collection of antique monuments the muses had a dispute about singing in the island of crete with the sirens who challenged them to a trial of skill and were conquered the muses as a punishment for their temerity cut their wings and affixed to their headdress one of their feathers as a trophy the greek women therefore may have received this ornament from the muses they are fond at least of representing them when they dispute with each other as they do at present who shall carry off the prize in singing or when they sing couplets alternatively a sort of entertaining combat the object of which is who shall recite last and gain the victory over the others  besides they have different sorts of headdresses more or less ornamented which they vary many ways sometimes their hair falls in tresses down their shoulders it is often curled up all round the head or negligently tied up with flowers  the mitre which the women wore formerly had little fillets which coming down by the cheeks tied under the chin  the greeks have the same kind of ornament at present embroidered in gold with fringes they call it the mahoulika and it generally announces some indisposition  the greek ladies have ever been fond of covering themselves with jewels the buckles of their girdles their necklaces their bracelets are enriched with them and although they are fond of adorning their hair with the finest flowers of the spring diamonds are intermingled with the jessamin and roses they often dress themselves up when they have no intention of going out or of being seen merely to contemplate themselves these ornaments are never laid by but for some deep and indispensable mourning or for some poignant cause of grief  thus the celebrated sapho writes to phaon i have not dressed myself out since your absence nor even taken the pains to comb out my hair i wear no rings on my fingers no gold in my hair i do not perfume myself with the essence of arabia my dress is neglected and without ornament for whom should i wish to please  what sapho did for her lover the greek women with much more propriety do for their husbands and in their absence most of them take no pains in ornamenting their persons  in speaking of the ornaments and jewels of the greek ladies we will bring to our readers recollection an anecdote preserved to us by plutarch an ionian lady a friend of phocions second wife and who was on a visit to her took great pains in displaying her jewels to her which consisted in bracelets and necklaces ornamented with gold and precious stones she replied to her my only ornament is phocion who for these twenty years has been general of the athenians  among the modern greek ladies might be found similar traits of sentiment if there were but any phocions  to form some idea of the excess to which luxury has carried the greek women we must hear what st chrysostom says on the subject respecting the women of his time besides says he their earrings they have other jewels to ornament the extremity of their cheeks their eyelashes and their whole face are covered with paint their petticoats are netted with gold threads their necklaces are gold they likewise wear thin plates of gold on the wrists their shoes are black very shining and terminated in a point the form of the shoe is still the same but the color is changed they ride on cars drawn by white mules with a numerous train of slaves and attendants  the greek women of the present day when they would go to any distance not choosing to make a display of their diamonds in the streets have them carried with them to put on before they enter the house where they are going and take them off before they return when their visit is over this is a very ancient custom  another proof of adherence to ancient customs in the greek ladies is the fan and the manner of which they make use of it this fan is very large circular composed of peacocks feathers and has an ivory stick in the center is a small glass the ladies carry it into the country and when fatigued with the heat they repose themselves on a sofa a slave takes the fan from his mistress and ventilates the air with it to refresh her  athenaeus describes this fan and scites some verses from anacreon where this poet giving the portrait of one artemon a voluptuous and effeminate man says he carries with him a round fan with an ivory stick which serves him for a parasol like the women  in achaia on a marble tomb of which pausanias gives a description is seen says this writer a young person of great beauty seated in an ivory chair and near her one of her attendants who holds a large fan or parasol over her head  the use of the veil is of very ancient date since it has been discovered in times of remote antiquity the veil that symbol of modesty which not only conceals from the prying eye certain defects but tends likewise to make beauty more attracting which seems to announce modesty and cover the innocent blush of timid youth this degagee ornament has ever been a favorite with beauty and the graces no reproach can be cast on the greek ladies for not having faithfully preserved it it makes as formerly an essential part in their dress and distinguishes the different ranks that of the mistress and the servant of the free woman and the slave are very different there is an art in adjusting it to veil themselves decently and agreeably  a young beauty who veils her face says a greek poet is but the more ardently sought after and excites in her lovers great eagerness in concealing herself from their looks this useful lesson is as ancient as the world coeval with beauty and the veil the romans who were no less severe in their injunctions imposed on the women not to appear in public without being veiled  this veil covered as at present the head and a part of the body it was consequently very long and it was no doubt from its length that it obtained the appellation of macrama  yet the greek veil does not cover the face in the same manner as that of the turkish women for this reason the modern greeks make use of this latter to conceal themselves with more care especially when they go to any distance or in parts inhabited by the turks  in the east the veil seems to have been as ancient as the world abimelec king of gerar restoring abraham his wife tells him that he shall add some flocks and slaves of both sexes to attend her for you sarah continues the king there are a thousand pieces of silver which i commit to the care of this man whom you call brother it is proper to furnish him with a sum sufficient to purchase a veil suitable to the condition of one so respectable as yourself that your servants may always remember that you are the spouse of your master and to let all strangers know that you are a married woman never forget that by neglecting that mark of distinction common to persons of your rank in this country you have exposed yourself too much  the value which king gerar put upon this veil calls to mind what plato says that there were in persia large provinces one of which was called the girdle and the other the queens veil because in fact their revenues were appropriated to the expense of the veils and girdles of the queen  the origin of the veil is referred by the greeks to modesty and bashfulness properties which partake equally of timidity a very pleasant story is told on this subject recorded to us by pausanias about thirty furlongs from the city of sparta icarius placed a statue of modesty to perpetuate the following incident  icarius having married his daughter to ulysses entreated him to fix his residence at sparta to which ulysses would not consent disappointed in his wishes he made a similar application to his daughter and entreated her not to abandon him and seeing her ready to depart with ulysses for ithaca he redoubled his efforts to detain her nor could he be prevented from following them ulysses wearied with his importunities told his wife that she was at free liberty either to return with her father to sparta or to go along with him to ithaca on hearing this the beautiful penelope it is said blushed and without making any reply threw a veil over her face icarius understood her meaning and let her go with her husband but moved at his daughters embarrassment he consecrated a statue to modesty on the spot where penelope had thrown a veil over her face that henceforward it might be a universal symbol of delicacy with the fair sex  the veil worn by the greek ladies is generally of muslin bordered with gold that of the common people of a coarser sort of plain muslin it is always white such as the monuments of old represent the veils of hermione and helen  the modern greeks the men wear a sort of scarf about the neck which occasionally goes over the head and serves to screen it from the wind and rain the women also wear one of a similar kind but of a finer stuff than that of the men they use them against the inclemency of the weather  the girdle in ancient times as well as the present was considered by the eastern people as an essential part of dress david speaking of the punishment due to an impious man and a calumniator of his neighbor adds  he clothed himself with cursing as with a raiment let it be as the cloak that he has upon him and as the girdle he is always girded withal  the greeks wear a girdle like the inhabitants of the east that of the women which is richer and more luxuriantly ornamented is considered as a very important part of dress the girdle was with the ancients a token of the brides virginity and after the celebration of the matrimonial rites hung up in the temple of diana from whence it was taken down and carried away by the bridegroom as soon as he became legally entitled to it that is when the perfect consummation of the marriage was effected  the embroidered girdle of the greek ladies is frequently fastened by a buckle with diamonds or emeralds resembling that of venus which homer describes so brilliant and which was also quilted and embroidered  nothing is more ancient among the greeks than consecrating the girdle at their marriage  the greeks and turks likewise to this day wear a girdle in order to fasten their purse into which they put the money they receive or choose to carry about them this custom is so ancient that speaking of a man who has lost his all they say he has lost his girdle  chap xxxix diversions entertainments and festivals the greeks have ever been a people devoted to festivals the greatest solemnities of religion are but so many occasions of public rejoicing and they celebrate them accordingly with all the splendour of temporal festivity on these occasions their piety is not so conspicuous as their attachment to sublunary joys in the time of st chrysostom the ancient greeks had for occasions of magnificence tables surrounded with a border of massy silver and in the shape of a c such at present is the form of their tables in greece but they are no longer ornamented with silver and cushions placed round for seats conversation has no longer any charms for them their sole delight is to eat and that to excess the ancient greek term for a repast signified an assembly of persons eating and drinking together an idea very different from what the romans conceived of those entertainments such a meeting by them was called convivium or a circle of persons uniting at table to entertain each other agreeably cicero has not neglected to make this distinction in speaking of convivial meetings the supreme enjoyment of life says the roman orator is according to my idea to pass our convivial hours with worthy men of a facetious disposition by whom we are esteemed i would not be understood he adds to mean the sensual pleasure of the table but that harmony of mind and freedom of sentiment which arises from an assembly of familiar friends these only can form the pleasures of a repast accordingly we romans in giving to our feasts a name which signifies the act of living together have certainly described it much better than the greeks who in their denomination though of one word express simply the act of eating and drinking without any allusion whatever to society  the greeks still drink to excess in their entertainments their festivals seldom finishing until the guests are unable to proceed the romans when they used any excess of this kind called it pergraecari i e to drink after the manner of the greeks  in ancient greece the lovers of wine like those of the present age challenged each other to trials of drinking when alexander conducted his army into persia his officers abandoned themselves to the greatest excess in company with the natives who were renowned for their abilities in supporting the most unbounded libations to the god of wine  they always drink their wine unmixed says spon and when in company the toast and the glass circulate together  the custom of singing at table is very ancient with the greeks each in his turn drinks to the health of his mistress and generally repeats it in conformity to the number of letters contained in her name theocritus in the fourteenth book of his idyll gives the description of a rural feast which is the exact representation of a modern repast  those entertainments given in the country are called relaxations of the mind to which are joined the amusements of playing and dancing a table being provided accorded to the number of the guests in shape like the greek letter p the most distinguished persons place themselves at the bottom and are immediately joined by the master of the feast who instantly fills a bumper to the health of his friends who pledge him respectively in their turns lambs stuffed and baked with the skins drawn on are served up and are the principal dishes pitchers of wine go round in pretty quick succession the guests grow warm and presently the buffoon comedians enter songs set to slow grave tunes usher in their sports the music presently becomes more sprightly and freedom of sentiment goes round some seize the lyre while others rise to dance they generally begin first a dance performed by one or two persons this dance being brisk and performed with a bounding step resembles the rigadoon very much which indeed appears to be of greek origin they then proceed in irregular figures which cannot well be described until the whole ends in a general confusion  honey is in very great estimation with the greeks that gathered on mount hymettus was anciently consecrated to the use of religious festivals it is now much coveted by them even in the state in which it is taken from the hive  olives which greece and the country about athens in particular furnish in great abundance are much in request with this people they give the same name to pickled olives as the ancients cakes of meal also form a part of the greek feast and are in great request with them homer mentions that in his time they were always prepared by the women it is the same now on the eve of easter and other great festivals these cakes are always sent by the greeks as presents to each other  the ancient custom of eating their corn parched or roasted which must necessarily have preceded the present method of bruising or grinding it still subsists in greece turkish corn in the grain and chickpease boiled are a very general food  it is among the common people we must always look for ancient manners they refine but little and are ever tenacious of the traditions handed down to them by their ancestors and so much attached to them that they bear with them the force of so many laws in the reports of the modern greeks we find not only the ancient excess and simplicity of behavior but also those festal crowns which paint in such lively colors the heartfelt joy of the jocund revellers lovers also ornament their heads with crowns of flowers and make garlands of them which they afterward hang in wreaths and various festoons over the doors of their mistresses when a greek crowns himself with flowers it denotes that he carries the livery of love or that he is engaged in some festive debauch such was the crown worn by that young rake polemon at athens of whom a pleasant adventure is related by diogenes laertius sallying forth one day after a debauch and hot with the juice of the grape he stumbled unexpectedly into the school of xenocrates his dress though illsuited to the taste of a philosophic academy for he was crowned with flowers perfumed with essences and tricked out with all the arts of foppery was no impediment to his mixing in an assembly of so contrary a character taking a seat in the midst of the philosophers he began to interrupt the order of their school by illtimed questions and ridiculous observations xenocrates without any alteration of features or manner changed the subject he was then upon and turned all his rhetoric into an attack upon the folly of intemperance his oratory had such an effect on the young libertine that his reason immediately returned to him he tore the crown from his head and threw it on the ground at the feet of xenocrates stung with a sense of shame and remorse for his past conduct he was unable to bear the sight of those about him but wrapping himself in his cloak he at once concealed his fully and himself converted by this means to the love of philosophy he soon became one of his most assiduous disciples  athenaeus informs us that the gallants of his time decorated the doors of the fair they admired with flowers in the same manner that the doors of their temples were adorned it is no doubt from thence that the modern greeks derive the custom of crowning the doors of their own and their mistresses houses annually on the first of may on this day the young men present themselves before the doors of their favorite ladies walking to and fro endeavoring to draw them at least to the windows by songs and instruments in ancient times on these occasions the young men even addressed the houses where the fair resided in the most plaintive and moving terms sometimes in cases of obdurate treatment when urged to desperation they have not refrained from bursting open the doors but other lovers more patient under their sufferings quietly contented themselves with laying down at the threshold of the door which continued shut on purpose for their preclusion  nothing says guy has offered me greater pleasure and entertainment than the greek dances every country has some peculiar dances to itself and greece is not deficient in that particular on the contrary it has a great variety the greeks have some dances expressive of their national character which must be of very ancient extraction and as it were hereditary to them they are easy to learn imitation supplies the want of masters dances composed of many steps and intricate figures requiring great attention and precision are easily forgot but the common dancers of every country being more simple gay and easy are never lost because frequently repeated these last are practiced at every festival the young men and women are ambitious to excel in them and the old people delight to be spectators of their performances even children in their infancy who can scarce walk with firmness kick about their little heels in imitation of the dancers  a company of greeks in the country villages old and young hand in hand dancing and singing verses writ for the purpose in a style of altercation brings to remembrance the lacedemonian choirs when the old men attack the youth in these words we once were young and gay as you valiant and bold and active too   to which the youth answer it is now our turn and you shall see you never deserved it more than we   the children too bear their part in the ceremony crying out with their little shrill voices the day will come when we shall show feats that surpass all you can do   the passion of the greeks for dancing is common to both sexes who neglect every other consideration when they have an opportunity of indulging that passion we find a passage in herodotus which might serve as a lesson against the extravagant length they sometimes carry it  clysthenes prince of syconia having declared he would marry his daughter to that person who should possess the greatest valor invited to his court all those who might aspire to an alliance with the princess he proposed his guests should pass some time with him that he might be the better able to examine into their characters the two athenians who were candidates became his favorites and principally hypoclides son of tysander one greatly renowned for his courage  the day being come on which he was to make his choice he gave a superb entertainment to the suitors for his daughter after the repast they began to sing a free circulation of the bottle ensued and the guests became exhilarated hypoclides desired the performers to play a serious dance in the execution of which he seemed to take more delight himself than he afforded the spectators clysthenes attended to the whole but seemed to take no notice hypoclides after resting awhile ordered a second table to be brought in which he exhibited a dance after the spartan manner and afterward fell into the athenian figures at length being elevated to a most extraordinary pitch he presented the company with a dance which consisted of holding up the hands and clapping them clysthenes who had by this time conceived the greatest aversion for the dancer could no longer contain his indignation at such ridiculous behavior but calls out to him to desist with these remarkable words son of tysander thou has danced away a wife a young greek of the present age heated by dancing and wine would be likely to commit the same excess as hypoclides and dance away his marriage  this exercise is doubtless of all countries and of all ages but the greeks have carried it to greater excess than other nations among them the dance was formerly one of the gymnastic sports it entered into the science of physic and was prescribed by the faculty on many occasions even the military schools admitted it into their practice all conditions of people were fond of it in the end it was introduced as part of the ceremony at festivals it gave life and spirit to those meetings the poets themselves recited and sung their verses dancing at the same time plato aristotle xenophon plutarch lucian athenaeus and all the most famous greek authors of antiquity have written in favor of dancing anacreon the prince of jollity and pleasure was always fond of dancing he even practiced it in his old age aspasia whose very appearance was capable of exciting the most agreeable sensations in the minds of all beholders charmed socrates so much with her dancing that he could not refrain from imitating her you laugh says socrates to his friends because you see me dancing like young people you think it ridiculous then to practice so salutary an exercise and which tends to render the body light am i then to blame for endeavoring to diminish by dancing the corpulent state of my body you do not know perhaps that charmides who is here surprised me the other day when i was dancing in my own house it is true said charmides and i was so astonished that i thought at first you were out of your mind but when i had heard what you now repeat upon dancing i was impatient when i returned home to endeavor to imitate you aristides notwithstanding what plato said danced at a feast given hy dionysius the tyrant scipio africanus after their example entertained some company at his own house with a dance in which strength and agility were united cornelius nepos who wrote the life of epaminondas describing the great qualities of his hero expatiates on his talents for music and dancing  if men valued themselves for excelling in this art it must be an essential qualification for women it was from seeing helen dance at the festival of diana that theseus and perithous conceived the design of running off with her  dionysius the geographical poet mentions certain dances which the greek women of asia minor practiced on the banks of the caistor you will see says he the women dressed in their richest girdles performing the dances made for the festival of bacchus composed of figures in a circular form and executed with the greatest regularity and neatness the girls also join in them the delicacy of their form the elegance of their motions and the gracefulness of their robes gently waving with the wind presenting a most enchanting sight to the spectators  the modern greek ladies are equally capable of giving satisfaction to those who come to gaze upon them formerly the dances represented the actions and manners of the people for which reason lucian lays it down as a rule that a dancer to excel in his art ought to be well instructed in the fables and history of the heathen deities  at all their festivals they sung the praises of the divinity they met to celebrate and the dances which followed the songs described the principal actions of the god among others they danced the triumph of bacchus and the nuptials of venus the love of diana and endymion the judgment of paris and europas passion for jove all these dances were so many moving pictures where the gestures and step the motions of the limbs and the inflexions of the body described the most interesting situations in short all the movements the human body was capable of  the dancers who now exhibit in the streets or fields and run about hand in hand represent those ancient dances which composed part of the public worship the modern greeks never celebrate any festival or solemnity without dancing round the altar or at least about the temple agreeable to the custom of their ancestors  the greeks had different chorusses of songs and dances the orbicular choir which sang the dithyrambi and danced to that species of song in praise of bacchus had a particular figure which it also performed sometimes the hands were extended at other times folded together and at last they danced round the altar since the decline of the greek theater these choirs are reduced to a mere roundabout figure which the greeks still use they continue the same method of extending and folding the hands dancing sometimes to the sound of the lyre at others to the chanting of hymns but not round the altar of bacchus and the rest of their gods as formerly the modern greeks fix upon some towering oak and crown it with flowers and other decorations under the shadow of which they celebrate their most solemn festivals renewing the ancient orgies with the same licentiousness and excess  the present age very often exhibits an exact image of the ancient choirs of greek nymphs and when they dance hand in hand round the meadows or in the woods recall to mind those ancient descriptions given by the poets of diana and her choir whether on mount delos or on the banks of eurotas as virgil says she leads the mazy dance accompanied by the nymphs of her train  the eleusinian women instituted certain dances which they practiced about a well called callichorus these were accompanied by songs which they sung in honor of the goddess  in the like manner says guys i have seen in princesisland the young women who were assembled round a well in the evening to draw water suddenly strike up a dance while others sung in concert to them aristotle observes of the public wells that they serve as cements to society uniting the citizens of each village in the bands of friendship by the social intercourse of so frequently dancing together round them he adds the ancients composed verses which were sung by the people while they drew water and were called songs of the well  the ancient greeks had their nuptial dances as well as the present age musaeus mentioning the secret marriage of hero and leander says it was performed without the customary dances the nuptial bed it is true was prepared but the hymenaeal songs the epithalamium and the torch were omitted  the principal dances now in fashion among the greeks are the candian greek arnatic wallachian pyrrhic and the country dances  the first two are very much alike one appears to have been copied from the other except that the airs are different a young woman always leads in both holding in her hands a handkerchief or silken string  the candian is the most ancient of any of them we have an account of it in homer in his description of the famous buckler of achilles  after enumerating many of the subjects described on that wonderful piece of art vulcan says he represents a dance of admirable variety very similar to that which the ingenious daedalus invented in the city of gnossus for the lovely ariadne the young men and women join hands and dance together the women being dressed in robes of fine stuff have also crowns upon their heads the men wear beautiful habits of the most brilliant color sometimes the whole set close in a circle and dance round with so much rapidity and justness that the motion of a wheel is not more swift and even at other times they separate and dividing into parties describe an infinite number of turns and figures in their movements  the candian dance of the moderns is nearly similar the air is soft and tender and begins with a slow tune but presently after grows more lively and animating she who leads the dance performs a number of figures and traverse lines the variety of which produces a very agreeable and interesting spectacle  from the candian sprung the greek dance which the islanders are yet very fond of called ariadnes dance see the plate which exhibits the temple of minerva now standing in this dance the men and women begin with the same steps and figures but separately and joining afterward mix together without any order or regularity the woman who leads the dance after choosing a partner takes him by the hand and presents him with one end of a ribband or silken string holding the other herself the rest of the dancers pass and repass under this string being generally of a considerable length one party as if flying and the other seeming to pursue the movements thn become slower and the whole party forms into a circle the conductress after many turns and changes of situations rolls as it were the whole set about her the dexterity of the lady consists in quickly disengaging herself from this embarrassment and appearing again at the head of the dancers who are very numerous and by this time placed in ranks waving her hand with an air of triumph and exhultation she reposes the ribband as at the beginning  it will readily occur to our learned readers that the idea of this dance was taken from the labyrinth of crete callimachus in his hymn to delos mentions it and says that theseus who invented it first led the dance himself  eustathius in his strictures on the eighteenth book of the iliad says that anciently the men and women danced in separate parties and that theseus was the first who mixed them together in the dance performed by the youth he made the young men and maidens whom he had saved from the cretan labyrinth dance before him together in the same manner as daedalus had instructed them apart  in the monumenti antichi of winckleman an antique vase is described where theseus is represented before ariadne the hero has in her hand the famous clue of thread by which he escaped from the labyrinth of crete ariadne habited in the dress of a dancer with a caftan or greek robe has a string in both her hands precisely such as the modern dancers use when they lead the greek dance  the arnatic is another dance belonging to the greeks it is of a very ancient date and peculiar to the military formerly the greeks had many dances of this kind they even engaged the enemy fighting diodorus the sicilian relates the same of the lusitanians  the arnatic is led by a man and a woman the man with a whip in one hand and a stick in the other runs about animating the rest from one end of the set to the other stamping with his feet and smacking with his whip while the others joining hands follow him with the same kind of step but not so violent  the pyrrhic dance   the pyrrhic is the true military dance and has the honor of claiming its descent from pyrrhus king of epirus who sustained such a long war against the romans there are many dances which bear this name xenophon speaking of the thracians who exhibited at the festival of their prince seuthes says a dance was performed by armed men with a kind of jumping step to the music of flutes one party attacking very dexterously with their lances while the other with equal address parried the thrusts with their shields the poor subdued greeks of the presentage have nothing to do with these dances but their masters the turks have thought proper to adopt them in their exercises and are now the only people in greece who exercise the pyrrhic games the music of the pyrrhic dance as performed at present in constantinople is pleasing a few remains of this dance says guys are however yet to be found in that part of greece called magnesia and at misitra a country rendered famous by the spartans it is inhabited by a savage people of greek descent governed by their own laws who conscious of their inability to attack a powerful empire which if provoked might crush them are contented with preserving their independence and are now become the most daring pirates of the archipelago  the ionian dance which according to athenaeus was performed when the parties were a little exhilarated by wine may not be improperly mentioned in this class notwithstanding it was more gentle and regular it has a kind of tripping step which is much in fashion at smyrna and in asia minor where a taste for lascivious dances always predominated the turks take great delight in these dances  the greeks have also the wallachian dance which is of very ancient date in the country from whence the name is borrowed this dance which has but one uniform step and different from every other is very pleasing when well executed this dance most probably is descended from the dacians who formerly inhabited wallachia  the games or pastimes are nearly allied to the dances by games we do not mean those celebrated ones which were the epochs of the most glorious ages of the greeks they no longer exist it is only of the pastimes of the modern greeks of the amusements of their young people and even of their children that we intend to treat it will be necessary however to advert to the inferior pastimes of the ancients to show that the origin of our most trifling amusements may be traced back to the earliest ages from the ancients we derive the game of even and odd and other similar ones ludere par impar equitare in arundine longa hor sat iii lib    the lydians according to herodotus pass for the inventors of these games and their origin is singular hunger had as great a share in giving birth to them as indolence the lydians under the reign of athis were afflicted with a cruel famine and to avoid the violent exercises which excited a keener sense of hunger they invented the games of dice and osselets which are still in use among the greeks it is played with little shells and in a box where the respective players have their points before them they call it the mangala  the game of tennis is likewise of lydian extraction a fatiguing game which does not appear to correspond much with their intentions except that it helped from the eagerness it excites to what we call kill time the honor of inventing the game of chess is by the ancients universally attributed and from the same cause to palamedes the lovers of penelope passed their time in the court of ulysses in playing at this game they made use of dice and pebbles and each had a set of his own a mark was placed in the middle which they called penelope this was the object at which they were all to take aim and the players were ranged in equal numbers at a considerable distance and opposite to each other for that purpose  the top or gig which horace calls a greek game was formerly in great use  the game of cross or pile bore anciently the name of head or ship the coin at that time being struck with the head of janus on one side and a vessel or ship on the other the word pile comes from the greek word pilos which signifies a ship  the game we call even or odd was by the greeks called artios mon they made use of nuts almonds or pieces of money the romans according to horace were fond of this game equitare in arundine longa or riding on a stick is a play which has been practiced in all countries agesilaus and socrates are known to have amused themselves among the children in running about with a long reed between their legs  nuts afforded the ancients a variety of games which still subsist with some little variations indeed it is not possible that such simple and voluntary games should have any fixed existence ovid has been very minute in his account of them  the greeks celebrate the festival of the spring with great enthusiasm as announcing the return of the zephyrs and roses on this occasion the children at rhodes demanded a tribute and had a play and song which they still preserve from thence no doubt comes the present custom with us of demanding a tribute on the first of may not for the swallow as formerly but for the pretty maiden who is dressed out in her finest gown and decorated with all the flowers of the spring  the children of rhodes went about in companies singing and dancing and demanded a gift of those they met for the swallow that was newly arrived from thence the festival had its name from the greek word clidonia or the swallow their song began in this manner see see the swallow comes and spring with lovely days appears   the saw is a game much in vogue with the greeks the youth of both sexes particularly the girls take great delight in it while the fine weather lasts and as they balance themselves repeat alternately such airs as they have been taught to sing the greeks called this game aioras and the latins oscilla  another game of the ancients still in use is to draw a circle upon a large table or on the floor and to win it was necessary to throw a die or small pellet from a considerable distance into the middle of the circle sometimes a quail was put into it and he who by striking him with the finger only made him quit the circle so that the bird passed the boundaries of it either in retreating back or in touching the extremity of it with the tip of his wings if he extended them he was the winner they likewise practice another play with the quail by tying it to a little stake and taking every one a stick in his hand each in his turn being blindfolded is obliged to go twenty or thirty yards from the bird and if on his return he can hit the bird he is conqueror  the greeks still play at blindmansbuff an ancient and formerly an universal game all over greece it was formerly called muinda they put an earthen pot into the hands of the person who was muffled the others run about provoking him and crying out who has the pot he answers midas has it and the person he can lay hold of is obliged in his turn to be blinded and take it  the greeks still continue the hop he who goes furthest on one leg without resting is the winner the likewise fold the leaves of roses and poppies into the shape of little bladders in order to smack them upon the forehead and by the noise they make judge of the degrees of affection in their lover  the paintings of herculaneum recall to mind the barbarous custom of whipping and beating children which unhappily is the practice of our schools as well as the greek what sort of fathers must those be who commit to a stranger the power of inflicting at his own will an ignominious and public chastisement upon their children who would have supposed this practice could have prevailed in any nation except where rigorous punishments were used in correcting slaves i have seen says guys the parents in greece hold out the rod to their children when they offended as if no method could be devised but that of punishing them like slaves from the greeks is derived that shameful practice of schoolmasters who so indecently bare the backs of innocent children at the same time that they impress marks of the greatest cruelty upon their tender bodies they render their minds callous to that sense of shame which should ever predominate in liberal minds here then we have the origin of those torturing instruments so lavishly inflicted by the pedantic tyrants which martial not improperly calls sceptra pedagorum the custom of ancient greece was to fasten the child to a post or to have him held by some person in the english method of horsing while the master was mauling his flesh this species of punishment was called catomium a custom which to the reproach of mankind has ever since been in practice perhaps to glut the sanguine dispositions of those masters who are are desirous of making reprisals on the backs of others for what they had suffered on their own these wretches exercise the same inhumanity in their turn on the tender delicacy of youth which on the contrary demands all possible indulgence and regard  to discover the success of their amors the greeks no longer apply the leaves of roses which as anacreon informs us they did by smacking them between the hands and which the children do at present it is the clidona which now discovers every thing and the oracle which the greek youth consult  on the evening of the day appointed for this ceremony two girls to whom the management of it is confided apply to the young men and maids desirous of being concerned in it from each of whom they are to receive a pledge of some kind or other such as a ring a piece of money etc which are afterward put into a vase these conductresses then fill the vase with water from some sacred fountain and cover it with myrtle and laurel leaves observing the most profound silence during the whole time the vase is afterward exposed in the open air and carefully attended till the next morning the parties concerned being then assembled one of the vestals opens the vase while the other sings or recites a couplet of lines composed for the game which is called the overture of the clidona each person in turn is now required to recite a greek distich while they draw one of the pledges from the vase this distich is considered as an answer to his or her enquiry to whom the pledge belongs sometimes when many of the parties are dissatisfied all the pledges are again put into the vase and the game recommenced this is but a repetition of the first play except that the players oftentimes being soured and disgusted with a second instance of ill fortune divest themselves of all regard to decency and utter such abandoned sentiments in the couplets they recite as to oblige all those to retire who have the least sense of delicacy  the young greeks of both sexes know by heart a great number of these couplets and songs of all kinds which they repeat with wonderful facility there are also tragedies written in modern greek which only serve to show the great difference between the ancient and modern muses  the custom of bathing so frequent among the ancient greeks is not less so among the moderns it is practiced at present with all the minutioe of former times besides the public baths which are generally much frequented persons of condition have them in their houses they pass immediately from the bath to the couch on which they take their repast from thence most probably came the ancient custom of eating in a careless recumbent posture  the greeks took but one repast in the four and twenty hours which was in the evening and the use of the bath immediately preceded the entertainment a practice continued through succeeding ages to the present time the attachment of this people to local customs is worthy of imitation the ancients never used any but the hot baths the turks and modern greeks follow their example  we are fond of magnificence in dress says alcinous to ulysses delight in the hot baths in gallantry and in dancing the modern greeks may say the same if the use of hot baths is pernicious to beauty as it is generally represented to be the force of custom must be wonderful since the women have ever followed the ancients in this particular but it is certainly very salutary to the constitution and particularly to that of old persons whom it strengthens instead of enfeebling by facilitating that gentle and necessary perspiration which otherwise is with difficulty performed by reason of the dryness of their skin the pores of which are closer than those of younger men it is certain the use of the hot bath prevents many of those disorders which attack men of an advanced age and that disorders of the breast are very rare among this people  the greeks and turks particularly the women make use of a glutinous kind of earth to wash their head and hair with while in the bath it is found in the islands of the archipelago and on the coast of the black sea the greeks formerly used the same kind of earth for washing linen and it supplied the place of soap pliny takes notice of the ghian earth which the women he says made use of for the hair and skin it is used by the modern greeks for the skin which by gently rubbing it renders softer and more smooth ghio anciently cius is a city of bythinia near the gulf of mondagna belon who traveled through greece in      in a discourse entitled que les femmes de turquie sont belles par singularite et nets comme perles mentions a passage of dioscorides that this earth which softened the skin gave also a freshness to the complexion  the greek women bathe at least once in every month formerly the laws prescribed it oftener  at the neomenia or new moon they never failed to perform this obligation  an intended bride on the eve of the nuptial day is conducted to the bath with great ceremony and with the sound of several instruments  when naomi in the bible instructs the young widow ruth how to appear to advantage before boaz to induce him to marry her she says to ruth  wash thy feet therefore and anoint thee and put thy best raiment on  chap xl marriages midwifry paternal affection and hospitality we may easily conclude that a people devoted to festivals could not proceed to solemnize the marriage without adding all the brilliancy and decorations of which such an event is susceptible among the most savage nations we find that men celebrate the day on which they form a lasting attachment with the fair as the most joyful and important of their lives but to exhibit marriage under the most pleasing aspect we should present it with simplicity of manners and accompanied with the gaiety purity and innocence with which that rite was performed in the earliest times the greeks of the present age adverting to the customs of the ancients have retained most of the ceremonies which were formerly used in the celebration of nuptials they considered an early entrance into the marriage as the indispensable duty of a good citizen and therefore engaged in it very young the laws of sparta were extremely rigorous in marking those for infamy who remained in a state of celibacy at sparta upon the celebration of a certain festival the women were permitted to seize the young men who remained unmarried to drag them before the altars and to chastise them with whips  the chaste theognis told the greeks that he was the richest and happiest man who possessed a gentle and virtuous wife but why consult philosophy which often becomes embarrassed and falls into an uncertainty worse than the darkest ignorance a young man applying to socrates for his opinion whether he should marry or not was told by the philosopher that to which ever opinion he adhered he would infallibly repent if he preferred a life of celibacy that he would not enjoy the pleasure of having children of his own and that his wealth would go to a stranger if he took a wife that he might expect eternal vexation and endless strife if she was well dowered incessant reproaches must be expected on that head the pride also of her relations and the tongue of his stepmother would become insupportable and if handsome that he would have to dread her gallantry and be in continual doubt as to the paternity of his children after this says the sage let him judge if he can and choose if he dare  themistocles being asked by a rich man who had an only daughter whom he should prefer as a husband for her a man of character without a fortune or one who was rich but a scoundrel i should rather replied themistocles have a man without money than money without a man  the modern greek has no philosophers to consult and therefore no deliberations about marriage hence population is better promoted among the greeks than the turks the latter also living under a military government destroy without remorse but never think of repairing from this cause the most considerable cities of greece have never been rebuilt by their conquerors beneficence and vanity have indeed produced among the turks a few public edifices but in a country where property is held by such precarious tenure they can have no idea of perpetuating any possession nor can they contemplate the situation of their posterity with satisfaction or tranquillity  in the mean time the greek the armenian and the jew people that abound in the turkish empire and whom the turks hold in such contempt as not to fear the number of their slaves abandon themselves to their natural inclinations these confide in the hope of a numerous posterity who shall at some future period recover all those territories which the conquerors of greece have ravaged from them marriage must of course be an institution favorable to their hopes and celibacy is accordingly very rare among them  the modern greeks have no fixed seasons for the celebration of their nuptials the ancients usually celebrated them in the month of january from thence called gamelion but they have as formerly mediatrices whom they still call proxenetes and these are as necessary as ever for the young women being almost constantly immersed in the gynaeceon a man can decide on the merits of the lady who is proposed to him only by the report he receives from the mediatrix the moment a lady has dropped her veil to any man he is engaged to her beyond the power of retracting  anciently the possession of a woman was only to be purchased by a term of actual servitude to the father that imposition was afterward removed and the servitude converted into certain presents still says montesquieu the custom prevails among the greeks that he who marries should purchase his wife by presents made to her parents  a greek says guys no doubt always makes presents to the bride these however are neither obligatory nor as the purchase of his wife but spontaneous he would not most probably have taken her without a portion suitable to her condition  the ancient greeks always scrupulous observers of the primitive laws of marriage abhorred bigamy euripides makes hermione in the tragedy say it is contrary to good order that two women should be at the same time under the dominion of one man charondas went further in the code he formed for the thurians these according to diodorus he directs that those who bring a stepmother to their children should be excluded the public councils he judged that men capable of rendering such an ill office to their family could have no good intention toward their country for says he if the first marriage has been happy there they should stop on the contrary if it has been miserable they must be mad to risk a second engagement the greeks of the present time though less free than their ancestors would not submit to such a restraint as the thurian code imposed  unequal matches were as common in former times as in the present a man of rank says theognis stoops to espouse a rich woman who dishonours him and a virtuous girl marries a villain for his wealth they the good and bad are promiscuously joined and from thence springs a degenerate race  telesicles father of the famous archilocus tarnished the luster of his birth by a disproportioned marriage with enipo a slave the greeks says the abbe sewin in commenting on this passage beheld unequal alliances with sovereign contempt and the shame was often reflected on their children modern greeks call the offspring of such marriages the children of a slave they observe exactly the ancient precept si vis nubere nube pari if you will marry marry an equal so well illustrated by the epigram of callimachus and carefully avoid disgraceful alliances  among the greeks the ceremony of marriage is preceded by festivals the ancients called them prolusoria the same appellation that they gave the preludes of the solemn sacrifices to juno and diana marriage says a shepherd of theocritus brings neither cares nor vexation but is always attended by mirth and festivity  homer has described the ceremonial of nuptial pageants on the famous shield of achilles the bride and bridegroom going from their house are received by numbers of persons ranged in the most exact order who conduct them through the streets with a blaze of torches the air resounding with the chant of hymeneal songs some precede others follow the procession dancing to the melody of flutes and trumpets  the greeks still observe the same disposition in their nuptial processions numerous attendants and music are always to be found upon these occasions the processions are generally opened to the harmony of a variety of instruments and with dancing the bride profusely adorned with looks abashed proceeds in a solemn pace supported by her friends and nearest relations during which the epithalamium is performing the bride formerly wore a red or yellow veil a custom still continued by the armenians this veil called flammeum covers the head and descends almost to the feet  the splendid torch of hymen that torch so well known and celebrated by the poets even to consecration as an emblem of marriage still maintains its place among the modern greeks this torch blazes in their processions and is an attendant afterward on the bridal bed there it is placed to wait the arrival of the new married pair and remains until the whole is consumed if by any accident it should become extinguished the most unfortunate presages would be drawn to prevent which unremitting vigilance is used the sacred fire could not be more attentively watched by the vestals  among the ancient greeks the nuptial torch was carried by the mother of the bride it was her office to prepare and adorn the bridal bed she officiated as pronuba and led the bride to her chamber as the nearest relation she acted likewise as paranymphus and conducted the bridegroom in like manner  the pronuba and paranymphus are represented by the modern greeks in the persons of the marriage sponsors who accompany the married pair through every part of the ceremony  the bride and bridegroom before their presentation at the altar are each adorned with a crown or chaplet which during the ceremony is changed by the priest he first presents the man with the crown taken from his wife and then delivers that of the man to her this ceremony which has its origin from the ancients is still practiced by the moderns  the greatest part of the dowry consists in precious stones and in magnificent dresses which are exhibited with uncommon ostentation  in this they follow the ancient greeks hermione says in andromache the ornaments of gold which now adorn my head and that variety of robes i possess came to me neither from achilles nor from peleus i brought them from sparta menelaus my father presented them to me with a dowry still more considerable to the end that i might speak with freedom  the grecians celebrate their marriage feasts with various diversions of dancing and play vaulters and tumblers are provided at those times to entertain the guests with exertions of strength and agility homer paints a scene of this kind in a manner much resembling the moderns telemachus and the son of nestor arrived at the court of menelaus whilst he was celebrating the marriage of his daughter they found him at table among his friends the palace resounding with the cries of joy mixed with the melody of various instruments and the loud chorusses of the singers one performer distinguished in a circle introduced says a poet by the skilful touch of his lyre the most divine harmony whilst the vaulters and buffoons by dances of agility surpassing belief astonished and delighted the whole assembly this species of dancing was in subsequent times deemed licentious and the council of laodicea held about the year     thought itself obliged to prohibit such kind of dances at the celebration of nuptials  among the greeks a widow seldom remarries according to pausanias second marriages were forbidden by the ancients he says also that gorgophona who married oebalus was the first instance of a woman espousing a second husband  the modern greeks are by their religion solemnly enjoined continence the first night of marriage the fourth council of carthage held after the defeat of gildon in     at which st augustine with one hundred and fourteen bishops assisted directed that the married pair out of respect to the holy sacrament of marriage should on the first night observe the most rigid forbearance of nuptial pleasures  a bride bears the same appellation among the modern greeks by which she was distinguished among the ancients she is called by those of her own family from the greek word neumphae nymph penelope says in ovids epistles that nymphs speaking of the brides joyfully bear their offsprings to the altars that the gods may preserve their husbands grata ferunt nymphae pro salvis dona maritis  the art of physic is not only exercised by the women in most of the greek islands but the delivery of women in childbirth is their peculiar province the appearance of a surgeon on such occasions being extremely obnoxious to the greek women montesquieu who has made the most profound researches into ancient customs has not omitted to relate the account of a young female athenian who when the republic had proscribed the practice of physic or midwifry to that sex disguised herself in the habit of a man to learn the obstetric art that she might be enabled to relieve the women from the embarrassments they suffered in being compelled to seek assistance from men on occasions of childbirth their delicacy being so great in such cases that many of them perished for want of assistance the young female athenian found no reason to complain of want of business in her newly acquired art on the contrary the whole practice of the faculty centered in her from whence suspicions which were soon after verified she was brought before the court of the areopagus to answer for her conduct agnodice for that was her name had no great difficulty in justifying her proceedings she confessed the disguise but produced the most authentic testimony of her having assumed it generally for the benefit of human nature and of her friends in particular the justice of the court admitted her excuse the proscription was taken off and the women were permitted to follow the profession without restraint which they have ever since continued to practice a midwife is a character greatly esteemed by the modern greeks  conjugal affection is to be found in as great a degree among the modern greeks as in the descriptions we meet of it in the times of ancient greece all that claudian says of the dignity of the mother who by that title alone preserved the same rank in her husbands affections which the attractions of her youth had before obtained is exactly verified in the present age  paternal affection and filial affection are also virtues still subsisting and without the least diminution in greece they shone it is true with greater luster in the first ages because poets paid more attention to them homer when he describes the joy of ulysses at the prospect of his safety after having been floating a long time on the waves compares it to that of a child beholding its father whom it tenderly loved restored to health after a long and desperate illness which had reduced him to the brink of the grave and such says homer was the joy of ulysses when he first got ashore  hospitality is another virtue in which the greeks are never deficient the arrival of a stranger puts the whole house in gala and the best apartments are destined for his use  the primitive christians were the first who practiced hospitality after the example of the greeks and romans among the latter inns were frequented but by the lowest class of vagabonds only persons of distinction or reputation never traveled without letters of recommendation to all the towns through which their affairs required them to pass the persons to whom these letters were addressed always received and lodged such travelers in their houses this intercourse of recommendation as the abbe fleury observes became in process of time hereditary to the different parts of greece and italy and joined the natives in the strongest bands of friendship and alliance they even regarded hospitality as a duty of religion jupiter himself presided at the hospitable feast and not only the table provided for the guests but the person of the stranger was sacred in all places  diodorus relates that gellius the richest man in agrigentum retained a certain number of domestics for the express purpose of inviting all strangers to come and take up their lodgings at his house and that several of his fellowcitizens followed his example in a certain degree  chap xli funerals having now seen the greeks on their days of festivity and marriage we shall draw a portrait of them in tears lamentation and sorrow such indeed are the transient passages of this short life that one generally follows on the footsteps of the other in greece we no sooner quit the jocund revels of the laughing meadows but we encounter some dreary walk planted on either side with the mournful cypress it is sometimes even pleasant to repose under its gloomy shade  follow me into that house says guys where the piercing cries of the slaves and domestics proclaim the approach of death see thou not a woman who swooning is supported in the arms of her attendants she is a distracted mother whose daughter has this instant given up the ghost her grief too mighty to be endured in silence forces its way in loud exclamations her attendants answer with bitter sighs and floods of tears hear her cries  o my child my daughter thou who first gave me a right to the tender name of mother thou who no sooner saw the light but crying i received thee into my arms art now deaf to the cries of thy parent these cries shall pierce the very inmost recess of the tomb where thou art going to descend even the highest heaven shall hear them it is thy mother calls my child my child did i say my soul my life the prop of my existence and can thou abandon me thus has life forsaken thee in the strength of thy age and in the flower of thy youth no thou only slumberest a profound and tranquil sleep has seized thee it is i who die grief has robbed me of life o sleep of death eternal sleep night more horrible than the close of creation thy shadows surround me thou has ravished from me a daughter who will never return let me follow her reunite me with all i held dear in the world barbarians why do you interrupt me why do you prevent me i go to seek my child she is waiting for me hark she calls she is not dead for pitys sake do not undeceive me at least i will embrace her coldclay corse perhaps the mothers touch may raise it again to action renew the springs of life  oh heaven no  the cries of death and the dismal echo of bewailings too fatally pronounce my error now now they tear her from me  stop your your hands barbarians  i go  support me my dearest child i come thou draggest me with thee into the tomb of death  the afflicted mother in this state of distraction follows the funeral procession the nearest relations and friends attend it as heretofore women and girls with hair dishevelled and weeping follow being arrived at the place of interment their tears then flow most copiously this also agrees with the ancients as related in the first scene of the andrian  the greeks conform to the ancient custom of washing the body before interment in which they are followed by the turks they hire as formerly a certain number of women who walk in procession before the body tearing their hair and singing the praises of the deceased in euripides they will not believe the death of alceste because the proxy for the people or the choir says i see no water prepared to wash the body no tearing of hair neither do i hear the cries of women circumstances which always make part of the funeral obsequies  at present when a death happens the women of the house cry without ceasing and for a considerable time refuse either nourishment or sleep formerly the women expressed their grief on these occasions by plucking off their hair and rending their garments the gentle hero perceiving the body of her dear leander floating at the break of day upon the sea begins to tear her vestments and with the most piercing cries takes leave of the world then plunging into the sea she shares the fate of her beloved husband  the myrmidons and briseis herself tore off the hair and covered the tomb of achilles with it the greek women still act the same part but this is now principally confined to hired mourners  the greeks formerly conceived that injustice was done to the deceased by keeping the body a long time above ground at present interment follows the death with all possible expedition  when a virgin dies the body is dressed in the richest habits of the deceased and the head crowned with flowers the women throw roses and scatter scented waters on the bier as it passes along the streets  anciently the corpse was decorated with several crowns of flowers as marks of triumph to show that the deceased had at length surmounted the miseries and vexation of life for which reason a corse was called estephanomenon i e crowned the survivors of the famous greek soldiers who served under xenophon in asiatic thrace after having buried their deceased friends erected a cenotaphium and a grand funeral pile on which they scattered crowns of flowers xen de cyr exped lvi c   in aristophanes a woman says receive this crown from me a second and a third let me present you with this charon waits for you these crowns are described in the bas reliefs of m de peysonnel as are also the nuptial crowns in the collection of comte de caylus is a similar bas relief menius lying dead appears crowned by his son neopolis his wife who died some time before also lies crowned by one of her relations  we must not omit the funeral feasts demosthenes in his harangue for ctesiphon where he so vaingloriously boasts of being chosen in preference to eschines and other fountains of eloquence to deliver the funeral oration for those who were killed at the famous battle of chaeronea says not to the public voice alone am i obliged for my election to this honorable office the parents and brothers of the deceased whose duty it was to take charge of their funeral obsequies joined their unanimous suffrages that i should be appointed even the funeral repast which our religion has enjoined shall be conducted at the house of the deceaseds nearest relation was made under my roof upon whom indeed could their honors be so properly conferred as upon him who had the care of their eternal fame  the funeral feast is neglected by the modern greeks the nearest relation is charged with the preparation and these terminate the funeral ceremony  parents we have already remarked always follow their children to the tomb on such interesting occasions the public expect to be witnesses of the pangs felt by an inconsiderable parent sappho to express her sorrows in the absence of phaon tells us she has pierced the air with her cries and torn the hair from off her to paint the excess of her grief in stronger colors she compares herself to a mother following the dismal procession of her childs funeral overwhelmed with misery and dissolving in tears  in greece they mourn a considerable time for their children the custom is very ancient in this country among numberless examples one may suffice and this eschines has furnished us in that speech where he employs all his art to render demosthenes obnoxious to the athenians this wretch speaking of demosthenes in less than seven days after the death of his daughter and before he had paid one tribute of sorrow to her memory or any of those duties which nature and the laws of his country require appeared publicly crowned with flowers and habited in the splendid dress of an assistant at a festival thereby most scandalously violating every ordinance of the gods and men not even the remembrance of that precious gift which the immortals had bestowed on him and the only opportunity he ever enjoyed of being called by the tender appellation of father could restrain him from so gross an act of impiety i speak not with a design to insult his misfortunes but to make the world acquainted with his true character  the learned notes of m tourreuil who has translated this author prove by many quotations from the greek writers that parents always wore mourning on the death of their children iphigenia preparing for the sacrifice says in her prayer do not after my death either cut your hair or assume the habit of mourning she asks the same favor of her sisters  thus to whatever side we turn our attention we shall find that this people resembled each other in all ages the greeks of the present age are the greeks of any past period and yet this truth says guys stands in need of new proofs to undeceive those who still think that merit is only to be found among the ancients  the tombs of the greeks like those of the turks and other oriental nations are situated on the highroads leading into towns and villages they are not surrounded with walls but are nevertheless a sacred asylum for fugitives  we have hitherto spoken of their customs as meriting our attention from their antiquity but with respect to their tombs we may observe that if they are always out of their towns it is because reason and the natural order of things has pointed out this as their proper situation that the abode of the living might be distinguished from that of the dead in greece the temple where the eternal is adored will never be found sullied as with us by the infection of dead bodies the incense burnt in our churches seems more properly applied to dissipate the pestiferous exhalations which arise from putrefactions than to the holy purposes of divine service if some great men as a token of peculiar benefits conferred by them upon mankind have anciently received the honor of interment in cities if the emperor constantine from a motive of piety directed his body to remain after death in the church of the holy apostles which he himself founded if since that time the same distinction has been granted to a few bishops and other persons of exemplary life if indeed the emperor leo granted permission to bury in churches the practice has been so much abused in succeeding ages that the continuance has been forbidden by several of the general synods or councils not merely to maintain the dignity of the church but to guard the lives and health of its faithful children this practice is now however pursued to a shameful excess in catholic as well as protestant countries the ancient greeks most scrupulously observed this wise law which prohibited interment in their temples or even within the walls of their cities the marble the ornaments and the epitaphs on the tombs distinguish the rank and occupation of the deceased on the tomb of a sculptor will be found a chissel arms on that of a soldier and so of the rest this custom is of long standing among the greeks  meniskus says sappho decorated the tomb of pelagus his son who was a fisherman with an oar and a net instruments expressive of his dangerous and laborious calling  thus the ghost of elpenor says to ulysses erect a tomb to my memory near the sea that my disastrous fate may be made known to the traveller do not forget also that an oar be engraved thereon as a mark of my profession and of the services i rendered you in my lifetime  archimedes according to plutarch desired his relations to put no ornament on his tomb but a cylinder and a sphere which were to serve him likewise for an epitaph  the modern greeks still preserve that simplicity in their epitaphs which was so characteristic of the ancient ones  the indian philosopher who threw himself into the flames at athens in the presence of augustus and to the great astonishment of the greeks had no other epitaph on his tomb than this simple inscription  here are deposited the ashes of zarmano choegas an indian of bargosa who according to the custom of his country encountered a voluntary death  most of the ancient inscriptions show what respect the greeks entertained for the ashes of the dead and the tombs that enclosed them we find an example of this at thyatira attested by smith spon wheeler and peysonnell  fabius sozimus caused this tomb to be erected near the consecrated olive tree which stands in the chaldocian field by the side of the great road at the entrance of the city for the reception of himself and his dear wife aureliana pontiana and for them alone should any impious person dare to violate this foundation he will not only incur a fine of thirteen hundred denarii of silver but suffer the punishment assigned by the laws to those sacrilegious felons who disturb the ashes of the dead to rob their tombs  this species of robbery was formerly very common in the time of s chrysostom the prisons were filled with malefactors committed for that offense the ancient greeks forbad the interment of many persons in one tomb except they were of the same family the epitaphs which still remain inform us that penalties were affixed in cases of disobedience  though the magnificence of tombs is produced in many instances from the cultivation of vanity and riches we shall find them oftener the recompense due to valor and merit and in particular to those heroes who have signalized themselves in the service of their country cyrus bewailing the fall of abradatus to panthea promises in order to console him that he would erect a superb monument to the memory of their deceased friend  who can read without emotion the following inscription upon an ancient tomb at thebes  my father and mother honored my corpse with their tears performing around my insensible tomb the customary funeral rites but my soul is gone to the mansions of the just my father was an italian by birth named adeus my own name nedymus and without vanity it may be said i died regretted of many i lived only a few years being born to enjoy but a short life by the cruelty of an inconstant age we must all submit to fate kings themselves are not exempt from its laws my father zosimus who sighs incessantly after my immortal soul caused this epitaph to be inscribed on my tomb  the ancient epitaphs frequently contained a short description of the personal beauties of the deceased an instance of which may be still seen at athens on the tomb of a young woman called cilitia charitopis who died in the flower of her life her hair was of a light color her eyes soft and languishing her complexion of snow etc  exclusive of these tombs they have small gravestones which anciently as at present served merely to acquaint the reader with the name of the person buried there  at athens says pausanias those brave citizens who fell in the service of their country were interred by the side of the road that leads to the academy their tombs are known by pillars set up for that purpose whereon are marked the names of the deceased and the places of their nativity  can we turn our eyes toward those immense plains once covered with flourishing cities the seat of arts the glory of the universe but now strewed with the ruins of temples and the dreary monuments enclosing the remains of that great people can we i say behold them without shedding a tear of regret at the instability of human grandeur  life is held by the most brittle tenure youth full of liberty and dissipation mispends the present hour regardless of the future man arrives at maturity of judgment but by slow degrees and then the remaining part of life is too short to make an advantageous use of the acquisition the instant he comes to the perfection of his reason his powers decline for nature is always in motion she must either advance or recede in this position all things are involved every being bears in its progress the cause of its destruction the fruits of the earth having gained a a perfect maturity begin to corrupt the most stoical insensibility would be moved at the sight of the devouring havoc death has made in this country  the tribute of a tear to the remembrance of our departed friends is justly their due faithful to this principle the greeks deplore from time to time the loss of those who have been dear to them in life either by an affectionate sight or a tender tear vented on the tomb of the deceased how different from the formal ceremony observed by us on such occasions and that by the injunction of our religion but what surprise is there in our being so much estranged from nature we who reject with indignation as gross and indelicate every circumstance capable of exciting our natural sensibility  during the time that the greeks celebrate the festival of easter which is attended with great splendour one day of that season is also set apart for a visit to the tombs when they resort in great numbers to bewail the loss of their friends and relations  the greek women of the present age are satisfied with tearing some hair from their head and spreading it on the tomb formerly their long and beautiful tresses were always a devoted victim to their relations and friends that beautiful ornament the hair of which the sex were so tenacious on all other occasions was offered without reluctance at the tomb they cut it off close to the head and deposited it upon the monument  here lie says sappho the ashes of the lovely timas who was snatched from the altar of hymen to inhabit the gloomy regions of proserpine her companions lamented her death with the usual demonstrations of sorrow the fine sacrifice of beautiful hair scattered about her monument are precious tokens of their grief  a sacrifice of this kind considering the estimation in which the fine flowing tresses of hair were held by the greeks was no equivocal mark of tenderness and grief o charming prospect says guys how many precious moments have i passed in contemplating the tombs of greece yes my imagination has hovered over their whole extent like those melancholy birds that take so much delight in fluttering round them  yet do not imagine this view of mortality among the scattered tombs is altogether dismal and forlorn the species of horror such a spectacle impresses on an honest and gentle mind is greatly alleviated by the variety of surrounding objects curiosity and humanity find a sweet satisfaction from the inscription which give as it were language to the tombs and where too often unfortunate mortals receive the first recompense of their virtues from society envy being silenced the veil is then removed that kept merit and justice asunder how much is it to be regretted that artifice lying and hatred should poison so many of the springs of life on the tomb only can we expect our virtues to be blazoned and even then we must stand indebted to the piety of our relations or the fidelity of our friends for this act of justice an agreeable walk is generally the avenue to these monuments where our principal dewlling place is already marked out this scene in some degree unites us again to our friends from whom fate seemed to have for ever separated us and indeed never fails to furnish very useful reflections  chap xlii of the religion and superstition of the greeks the whole greek church including every sect is of considerable extent containing not only the christians of the turkish empire who in many parts are more numerous than the mahometans but also the muscovites russians cossacs ethiopians abyssinians circassians georgians mongrelians and the inhabitants of the different islands in the mediterranean and archipelago we shall here treat of those under the turkish dominion who are governed by four patriarchs the chief of which resides at constantinople the second at antioch the third at jerusalem and the fourth at alexandria though these four sees are independent of each other that of constantinople is considered as the principal because it is under the eyes of the ottoman court  the investiture of it is generally given by the grand signior or his vizier notwithstanding this the greeks acknowledge it this dignity as we have already observed in our account of turkey is sold to the highest bidder and after having obtained possession he is not sure of retaining it long if he cannot find means of furnishing considerable presents to the turkish government to be able to accomplish this he draws as much money as he possibly can from the clergy and people belonging to his jurisdiction he likewise endeavors to save enough to enable him if disgraced to lead a life of ease indolence and tranquillity  his jurisdiction is very great and extends not only over all the turkish provinces in europe and the islands of the archipelago but likewise over most of the provinces in asia minor in his letters missive he styles himself by the mercy of god archbishop of new rome constantinople and ecumenical patriarch  the patriarch of antioch has syria and mesopotamia under his jurisdiction and styles himself by the mercy of god patriarch of the great city of antioch and of all the east his usual residence is damascus  the patriarch of jerusalem has palestine and part of arabia under his jurisdiction and styles himself a before and patriarch of the holy city of jerusalem and all palestine sometimes he is styled patriarch of jerusalem the holy mount of sion syria arabia beyond jordan cana of gallilee and of all palestine  the patriarch of alexandria whose jurisdiction extends over egypt lybia and part of egypt styles himself by the mercy of god pope and patriarch of the great city of alexandria and ecumenical judge sometimes ecumenical patriarch it having been the chief see before constantine and founded by st mark from whence alexandria is frequently called the throne or seat and chair of that apostle his usual residence is grand cairo  these three patriarchs are appointed by the bashaws the other sects of christians have also their patriarchs such as the armenians maronites jacobins etc  the second rank in the hierarchy is occupied by the archbishops and bishops under the inspection of their respective patriarchs though careless respecting religion and dissolute in their private life says mariti these prelates require that those who either write or speak to them should address them with the title of your holiness and your blessedness the first belongs to patriarchs and the second to bishops to add a luster to their office their menial servants are generally in deacons orders  they cannot be reproached however with neglecting their dioceses they begin their visitation every twelfthday and do not disdain to enter even the poorest cottages how noble these visits would be did they not proceed from interested motives the pontiff in the name of heaven draws from the unhappy peasant all his money and leaves him nothing but a useless benediction for this reason while the rest of europe complain they never see their bishops the inhabitants in turkey lament they see them too often  the religious orders of s basil s elias and s marcel have from time immemorial enjoyed the exclusive privilege of furnishing bishops and patriarchs these monks make the same vows of poverty fasting obedience and chastity as those of europe they are forbidden by their regulations to say mass but in order to become pontiffs they forget this prohibition and i could easily see adds mariti they paid as little attention to their other vows  i must however do them justice to say that their whole lives are not spent in contemplative idleness they cultivate their own lands and exercise useful callings  confined to the most rigorous fasting they live on pulse and never eat fish but on days of great solemnity one may readily guess that this austere life is not followed by their chiefs  the latter are known by the title of igumenos which answers to that of abbe  the first order among the greeks conferred upon those who devote themselves to the service of the church is that of reader called anagnostis the only duty of which is to read the sacred scriptures to the people on festivals  the next order is that of the psaltis or chanters which conducts immediately to the deaconship and subdeaconship  when a person is admitted into this second order he is permitted to marry but only once the candidate must choose for his spouse a chaste and beautiful virgin and the reason the greek canons give for this is that a minister who corresponds with angels ought not to profane his flesh with vice and ugliness the candidate has not the sole right to judge of these three points he is obliged to conduct his young sweetheart to the bishop of the diocese and ask him in a humble manner if she appears to be chaste beautiful and a virgin when the prelate really thinks her so he smiles kisses her cheek and gives her his benediction on the contrary when he finds her disagreeable his blessedness says to the candidate return to the holy ghost and by that it may enlighten thee  a married priest is forbidden to enter the bed of his spouse the evening before he administers the sacrament and the wife is forbidden to appear in church without a veil left the sight of her charms should divert the attention of her husband from his duty  the breviary of the greeks is divided into seven parts and the daily prayers would take up some several hours were the whole recited which is scarce ever done  the churches are as in europe divided into a nave and a choir old churches have a porch and a vestibule  the church is surrounded with several rows of benches as far as the entrance of the choir these benches are pretty much like those in our churches except that they are higher and narrower and have no footboard because the greeks never kneel they make devotion to consist in frequent salutations and inflections of the body few sit down as they prefer remaining with their elbows leaning on the arms of their benches  custom has established it as a rule that the women should be separated from the men a barrier in the form of an orchestra is raised in the lower part of the church behind which the former are placed and there are certain days in each month on which they must not even pass the vestibule or the first door of those churches which have not a portico they are forbidden likewise on these days to kiss the images of the saints  the manner in which the greeks make the sign of the cross is not different from that of the roman catholics except that they unite the thumb and the middle fingers in the form of a triangle pressing the other two down to the palm of the hand  baptism is performed by immersion and children are plunged three times into the water it is customary to present them for baptism the eighth day after their birth  after baptism the priest anoints the childs forehead eyes nostrils mouth ears breast hands and feet with holy unction and immediately after gives it the sacrament  auricular confession is practiced among the greeks and is become an object of great profit to the priests as people do not receive absolution unless they pay a certain sum in proportion to the enormity of their transgressions should fate have condemned a person to absolute indigence says mariti he can find no minister who will condescend to hear him what then must those do who thinking confession necessary possess no money prostrated on the steps of the church they must beg the rich to give them a small alms and thereby enable them to be delivered from their sins and save their souls  it is amusing to hear the greek casuists the following is a case of conscience the solution of which may appear very singular if a penitent accuses himself of having committed a theft the confessor asks him whether the person robbed is a greek or an european in the first case he is absolved upon making restitution but in the second he is considered as not having finned by dividing the produce of the robbery with the confessor  the sacrament costs a piastre and holy unction the same to procure a ready sale for the latter the priests persuade the people that the consecrated oil confers both health of body and purity of soul  such of the assistants as wish to communicate go and place themselves before the principal door of the sanctuary and the priest laying the book of the ritual upon the head of each communicant presents them in their turn with the consecrated bread and wine  there are reckoned to be four principal lents in the greek church in the course of the year the first precedes easter and continues two months milk and fish are allowed in the first week but forbidden in the other seven certain kinds of fish such as oysters and some other shellfish are excepted from this prohibition the law which forbids fish only because they contain blood considering these as not possessed of any  in the second lent which is forty days before the nativity of christ fish of every kind is allowed  the third lent begins on whitmonday and ends on st peters day it was instituted in memory of the apostles and its duration depends on the advancement or retardation of easter during this lent milk is permitted  the last is solely intended in honor of the virgin mary it begins on the first day of august and ends on the day of assumption this lent is observed with more strictness than any of the rest on account of the great respect entertained for the mother of christ  old men children women with child and even the sick are not exempted from observing these four lents and so great is the superstition of the greeks that they think it less heinous to rob prostitute themselves publicly or even to commit murder than to transgress their precepts for fasting  the modern greeks hold seven sacraments baptism unction the eucharist penance holy orders marriage and prayer  the laity are enjoined to receive the communion four times every year and this is never omitted at least twice a year namely at christmas and easter it is received fasting at the third hour of the day or about nine in the morning the communicants take it standing and bending at the same time their bodies but they never kneel that those who are sick or dying may not want this comfortable viaticum a sufficient quantity of bread is consecrated on holy thursday which being dried over a chafing dish is put into a box of silver or wood and being enclosed in a silk case is hung up behind the altar with a lamp or two burning before it if the priests have occasion to make use of it they moisten it with wine before they carry it to the house of the sick communicant  every person is obliged to confess four times a year except the poor of whom it is required only once in lent from very devout people a monthly confession is expected if a person dies before he has received absolution he is considered to be in a desperate state but should he die excommunicated his corpse is supposed to feel the dismal effects of it in the grave and that it will grow hard and swell like a drum while the sentence of excommunication is in force this the greeks say is occasioned by the devils entering into it the bishops when they prohibit any thing in their briefs particularly threaten the offenders that after death they shall swell and be undissolved but when the excommunication is taken off then the body will dissolve and return to dust  the ceremony of anointing the sick with oil is another of their sacraments and similar to that of extreme unction with the roman catholics  how shall i describe to you says guys the religion of this people it has no doubt experienced the same revolutions with the greek empire like every thing else in this nation we find it obscured with the darkest ignorance and the grossest superstition the greek religion has retained no part of its original institution except the ceremonies ornaments and solemnities serving as signs by which it may be known  the religion of a people conducted by the most illiterate priests who scarcely know how to read at best can only be expected to preserve the exterior form and likeness of what it originally was thus the glorious light which once shone upon this people and dissipated the darkness of paganism and its absurd tenets is dwindled into a glimmering resemblance of its former splendour  the ignorance of the clergy necessarily includes that of the nation the gaudy trappings of their priests the festivals and ceremonies with a few ornaments for the monasteries and altars are all that remain to the poor captured greeks the turks indeed have continued the use of their churches and beyond these they have no religion this nation the parent of polytheism fraught with the pagan principles of the ancient greeks continued even in the first ages of christianity to multiply the objects of devotion though they had the happiness of knowing the true god abandoned formerly to the opinions and errors of their philosophers they had found in the gospel and in christian morality what philosophy had in vain attempted to unfold human curiosity ill satisfied with the lights of faith which would subdue reason and the pride of mortal judgment endeavored to assimilate with christianity the ancient doctrine of the two principles of a good and evil genius errors to which the greeks had been invariably attached from hence innumerable heresies and a multitude of sects have been engendered in the bosom of the greek church which still continues to be the nurse of error and falsehood  the history of the emperors who from the time of constantine until the separation between the greek and latin churches were oftener engaged in theological disputes than in managing the political concerns of the empire may be more properly called the history of commotions and civil wars on account of religion at length the greek clergy educated in the principles of eternal controversy were silenced by the last conqueror of greece mahomet ii contented himself with naming a patriarch and graciously left the free exercise of their religion to this poor undone subdued people which put an end to those disputes so repugnant to the military fanaticism of the turks for mahomet the prophet an absolute despot who pretended to be inspired having established his religion by force of arms ordered every one to believe and would have no arguments  under such masters how could the monks and greek priests ever trembling and having no longer opportunities to exercise themselves in disputation cultivate theology and letters we may from thence conclude that the modern greeks having no fit pastors to guide them in their religion have added to that which they profess all the traditions and practices which credulity and custom could preserve and by their attachment to ancient usages have retained innumerable superstitions in a word these people are credulous in proportion to their ignorance thus we find them excessively attached to prodigies auguries omens and dreams as they are also constant observers of fasts and other customs derived from their ancestors  the greek religion is now become that of the russian the latter toward the end of the tenth century received a metropolitan into their kingdom who was sent by the patriarch of constantinople to baptize and instruct them in process of time that patriarch became supreme of the russian church but in the year      the russians shook off their dependence on the greek hierarchy without introducing the least innovation in its doctrine thus the greeks and russians profess the same religion and the priests of both nations are habited alike but these are the only particulars they hold in common with each other  austere and frequent fasts the customs of public prayer and of assembling in church before sunrise the dread of being excommunicated and of an exclusion from the assembly of the faithful in short the greatest respect for their patriarch and the bishops are usages which the greeks have retained from the primitive christians  but to go still further back we must examine the religious festivals which they celebrate in the country villages they will call to mind the bacchanals and the devotion of the ancients for a sacred fountain or an ancient forest which were with them objects of veneration and worship  the greeks have still their venerable caverns and their consecrated waters they go in crowds on certain days of the year and drink of them and these days have the honor of being numbered among their religious festivals the borders of these fountains are ornamented with little pieces of linen or stuff as trophies of the virtues of the spring in having restored so many to health they observe the same method of returning thanks to the saint they chanced to invoke in any calamity or disorder and if the event proves propitious an offering is made of a bit of stuff or some little trinket affixed to the images the credulity of the ancient greeks and of the heathens in general with respect to all sorts of presages is well known the oracles those lying instruments were not sufficient for their purpose they had recourse to fate to divination and to fortuitous expressions to all of which they yielded the most implicit faith the greeks still draw presages from a thousand incidents which happen accidentally thus a taper or candle which chances to emit a spark announces the arrival of some person they expected  chance expressions and particularly those of infants had the force of an oracle with the ancients the epigram of callimachus on this subject is much admired a stranger says he consulted the sage pittacus of mitylene which of two young women who were offered him in marriage he should take for a wife the estate and rank of the first were suitable to his own but the other was much his superior in both pittacus instead of answering the question himself pointed out with a stick to some children who were whipping their tops in the public square and bid him take his answer from them which would clear up his doubts the stranger approaching hears them call out to each other  take your equal  these words were sufficient he sought no other oracle but took the woman whose circumstances assimilated the nearest to his own and was happy  profit by the example says the poet and marry with your equal this tract which paints in such strong colors the sweetness and simplicity of the ancients is really interesting  the greeks have also their good and evil days the fortieth day is sacred to lyingin women who never go out before the expiration of that term anciently it was celebrated by them as a festival and before the arrival of this period the women were not allowed to enter into the temple and even now a certain time must elapse before they are admitted into it  their attachment to superstitious and vulgar prejudices is not weakened we may be certain by long custom few nations have any good reasons to offer in justification of their particular habits precedent and usage is the only answer they have to give a detail of all the superstitious practices of the greeks would be enormously voluminous and consequently tiresome we shall mention those only which are their present characteristics  the ancient superstitions are described by theophrastus the modern greeks have rather augmented than diminished their number  s chrysostom relates the bigotry of his own times which still remains to the present age nothing can equal says this author the women in these particulars with respect to their young children the instant one is brought into the world all the lamps of the house are lighted and the infant is called by the name of some person who has lived to a great age to procure long life for it they tie threads of scarlet about their hands to preserve them from accidents the womennurses and sometimes the slaves go and put their fingers into a kind of clay which is found at the bottom of the baths with which they mark the forehead of the child in order to avert from it the evil sight or envy some write on the hands of the child the names of rivers and streams while others make use of ashes tallow and salt for the like purpose all this is done to avert the evil sight which they dread to this day  a quick imagination easily inflamed and nursed in a system of vulgar errors and fables that exaggerate every thing cannot but be susceptible of the slightest impressions accordingly adds the same reverend father their souls are always occupied by the most terrible apprehensions going out this morning says one such an accident happened which portends the most grievous misfortunes my rogue of a valet says another on presenting me my shoes gave me that for the left foot first a sure sign i shall sustain a loss or an affront a third informs you that he came out with the left leg foremost an infallible token of mischief  the modern greeks are subject to the same weaknesses the same fears the same credulity in studying a nation in following the people step by step we find in all climates that they exactly resemble those who went before them what we say of individuals is true of whole nations  nothing more strongly characterizes the credulity of a people than the faith they place in dreams and their manner of interpreting them plinys astonishment at the credulity of the greeks was very natural religion has destroyed the famous oracles of greece but reason has not done her part in assisting to diminish the credit given by the greeks to dreams ancient authors of the greatest reputation have treated them in the most serious manner while the lively imagination of the poets who like lovers are the creators of their own fancies have not given them such a favorable reception in their minds if some of the great writers of antiquity have joined in a belief of the efficacy of dreams others of no less authority have rejected them as delusive imaginations of the brain signifying nothing  plutarch as assiduous in relating the dreams as the bon mots of the great men whose lives he writ says that sylla in his writings asserts nothing was more certain than the intelligence given to mankind in their dreams  augustus in consequence of a particular dream imposed upon himself the ridiculous and superstitious drudgery to assume on a certain day of the year the character of a mendicant holding forth his hand to receive alms from the passers by whence comes it so much weakness should reside in a soul of such superior nature  the famous dream of cicero in his exile which announced to him a speedy and glorious return though it was verified in every particular did not alter the sentiments of that great man respecting dreams he was of opinion they were not deserving credit because one among numbers should be realized any more than that a notorious liar should be believed who had spoken truth  the attachment of the ancients to this species of superstition was almost general among the people a set of gods were established whom they worshipped under the title of dii somniales the modern greeks have also certain rules and methods for interpreting dreams which no doubt came to them from the ancients there are numbers of old women who procure the means of subsistence in exercising this mystery i made a point says guys of visiting some of the profession in order to be acquainted with their method a single example of which will be sufficient to elucidate it  a young greek applying to one of these oracles said i dreamt a stranger came to me and presented me an aigrette with several flowers after lighting a slambeau he disappeared here is the whole of the mystery said the old sibyl whom she consulted the aigrette signifies you shall be married the lighted flambeau indicates that the time is near and the number of flowers mark the number of children that you will have thus spoke the oracle i desired no more says guys nor did i ever take the trouble to enquire into the verification of his prophecies in general the rule is to interpret the dreams upon a contrary footing these sinister accidents indicate good fortune while the day which succeeds a pleasant dream is a day of sorrow to the person who has dreamt it  the greeks in order to obtain propitious dreams prepare themselves as formerly by fasts a young maid tempted by an ardent and impatient desire to know her destiny by marriage will not eat of any thing on the evening she proposes to make the essay except a piece of dirty cake which however she must not accompany with any kind of liquor left the charm should be interrupted she then takes three clews of thread of different colors white red and black which she places under her pillow after this preparatory arrangement the man who first appears to her and presents her something to drink is to be her husband when she wakes she is to take one of the threads promiscuously from under her pillow the black prognosticates her lot to be cast for a widower the white signifies an old man but the red denotes a young and rich husband or one according to her wishes we should not engage the attention of our readers with such puerile relations but that it is impossible to study mankind to any advantage without descending into their minute absurdities as well as criticizing their glaring follies the present race of men who arrogantly boast their superiority over former times are they more exempt from such weaknesses than those ages they contemn  chap xliii commerce and navigation the greeks who received their sciences arts fables and romances from egypt imbibed also from the egyptians their inclination for maritime commerce in ancient histories of greece we find the names of very great personages of antiquity enrolled among the sons of commerce the sage thales plato hippocrates and the legislator solon had all been merchants zeno chief of the stoics was the son of a cyprian merchant sappho also the sister of charaxus a dealer in wine a traveling merchant first discovered the value of homers poems and took the pains to collect them in a word hesiod himself gives lessons to his brother on the article of commerce  the custom of merchants assembling in some public place for the purposes of traffic is of very ancient date in greece this we learn in herodotus from the answer of cyrus to the threat of the ambassadors from sparta i never says he entertain the least dread of those men who have a place in this city where they assemble to deceive each other by the grossest perjuries these words says the same author alluded generally to the greeks for every city in greece had some place appropriated to the purpose mentioned by cyrus  what cyrus insinuates concerning the perjuries of the merchants refers to the ancient method of making bargains or contracts a practice still in use among the greeks as soon as the buyer and seller come to an agreement the manager or broker joins their hands which is of the same efficacy with an oath in binding the bargain in conformity to this practice we find engraven on the ancient monuments and particularly on the intaglios two hands united which were no doubt designed as the emblem of commerce  this custom is not confined to the greeks we find it prevail in all nations where any traces remain of the plain dealing and honesty of the ancients  the greeks still entertain a strong propensity to commerce the poorest cruise from one island to another whilst those of more extensive capitals enlarge the bounds of their commerce to egypt and the black sea some of the great merchants trade to the east indies by way of bassora and bring from thence callicoes and stuffs of various kinds others hold a correspondence with russia for skins furs etc the greeks like the ragusans having no inclination for extravagance live at a very small expense as the most certain means of gain those who cannot find an encouragement at home seek an establishment in holland or venice  they are not only good merchants but excellent artificers they have established several manufactories at scio where stuffs are made exactly resembling those of india persia and even of lions besides these articles furnished at scio they make carpets of a very superb quality at salonica and smyrna cyprus is famous for coverlets as candia is for soap and oil santorin produces a kind of cotton stuff called dimity and at tinde they make silk stockings in the days of ancient greece samos and miletus bore the reputation of excelling in carpets corinth in coverlets sicily in cheese and argos produced the best of metals  the greeks were early acquainted with the art of navigation which may be gathered from the number of vessels they fitted out for the expedition against troy the passage from island to island in the archipelago and again to the adjacent continents was not very difficult by reason of the vicinity of those places commerce was then carried on by barter of one commodity for another the merchants who furnished the greeks with wine from lemnos during the siege of troy received in return brass iron skins etc  thieving was no crime among the ancient greeks but a calling of ingenuity and industry being held in no disgrace the earliest navigators became thieves of the first rank under the denomination of pirates the uncivilized greeks of the present age who have preserved the simplicity of the ancient manners are now the pirates of the archipelago in consulting homer upon the customs of the primitive greeks we have the purest source of knowledge on that head ever before us  ulysses having touched at the island of pheacia euryalus was desirous of provoking him to enter the lists with him either in the skilful management of the lute or the swiftness of course but ulysses declining to engage in either the young euryalus who was hot and passionate made use of these rough expressions am i then to consider you as one of those shipmasters who pass their lives in going from place to place to traffic or plunder or in the still more despicable light of the purser of a vessel one who keeps a register of stores and prizes  the greeks are in some measure seamen by nature the turkish ships of war are manned with them they make use of the compass but have no charts to direct them and are therefore obliged to trust to their knowledge of the coasts for the safety of their navigation they of course never venture far from the land most of their ships resemble those of the ancients having but one mast which is crossed with very long yards they have also great sails and a high flat poop sometimes ornamented the prow projecting like that of theseuss ship a greek may frequently be seen seated on the poop of his volik sailing on that beautiful canal the black sea the coasts resounding with his lyre while a favorable wind swelling the sails wafts him along the water with a pleasing rapidity  fishing which was the prelude and if we may be allowed the expression the parent of navigation has not been neglected by the greeks one of the finest poems that ever was handed down to us from the greeks was written by oppian in celebration of the art of fishing a poem in so much esteem in the age that produced it as to obtain the appellation of golden verses  whole nations have followed the art of fishing as their only means of support while others have derived their whole subsistence from the pursuit of terrestrial animals the latter being the most healthful and agreeable exercise and the success attended with greater eclat has been in all ages the principal diversion of youth and favorite sport of princes and heroes while on the other hand fishing has been the occupation of the meaner sort of people and attended with greater danger the greek fishermen described in the history of former times or on the monuments of antiquity are exactly represented by those of the present age who are provided with the same kind of implements as their predecessors being in general more skilful and industrious in their profession than their neighbors they are also more successful of the industry of the fishermen of antiquity strabo relates the following anecdote  a celebrated musician employing his talents one day in the streets of jassus the inhabitants of which were for the most part fishermen drew about him a great number of people but the signal being presently given for opening the fishmarket his whole audience forsook him except one man who happened to be a little deaf the musician unacquainted with that circumstance was highly flattered by his attention felicitated the man on his taste for music and praised him much for the regard he had shown to a piece which as the musician said had great merit a circumstance the more remarkable in the fisher considering what an universal depravity of taste appeared in his fellowcitizens by quitting his music at the first sound of a bell to sell their fish how replies the supposed man of taste is the signal given i did not hear it and instantly followed his brother fishermen with equal precipitation  homer who was the first to lay all nature under contribution in order to furnish that crowd of images which are dispersed over his works did not forget the fishers describing the defeat of penelopes suitors he represents them after the combat scattered on the ground and panting for breath like fishes taken from the net just thrown upon the shore laid in heaps on the dry sand says homer the finney race thirst for the moist element which they so long enjoyed they palpitate in every part from the heat and avidity of the air just ready to destroy them thus fell the lovers of penelope thus they found one common grave homer then mentions fishing with nets which practice was very ancient in greece and in egypt but the greeks according to athenaeus existed some time before they could eat fish and dacier observes that at the siege of troy warriors abstained from the use of fish as food of too delicate a nature for men of that profession menelaus in the odyssey excuses his companions who remained with him in the island of pharos for having fished with a line by observing that hunger had carried them to such lengths they were glad to eat whatever they could get  after the greeks had adopted the art of fishing they brought it to the greatest perfection pollux has been more particular than even theocritus in describing every utensil necessary for carrying on this employment it is to them we owe the origin of the xiphias or swordfish carried on by the people of marseilles of the pilchard fishery and that of the tunny this latter fish appeared formerly in sholes and were esteemed the best and largest fish of the sea a company of them according to pliny once pursued the ships of alexander his whole sleet was seized with terror and formed themselves into a line as if attacked by an enemy this fish was in great estimation among the ancients as now with the moderns they were served at the best tables and the romans like ourselves greatly esteemed the flavor according to aulus gellius our pickled tunny and botargo are more ancient than we imagine the carthaginians always provided the tunnyfish to be served at weddings and it had constantly a place in the grecian banquets before the newmarried couple were put to bed  the tunnyfish still continue to pass through the straits of gibraltar in large companies about the commencement of spring there is a great fishery of them as we have before remarked near cadiz at a village called conil from which place and its environs the duke of medina sidonia is said to draw the clear sum of eighty thousand ducats yearly  at salines a port in naxios an island of the archipelago the greeks have a great fishery for eels and mullet by the means of snares made of reeds and manufactured into a certain form these snares are very pliable and so disposed that the fish once lodged in them cannot get out  the sturgeonfishing is also carried on in a very singular manner an enclosure of willows with a door being placed in the water is so contrived to admit all the fish which come that way without the possibility of their getting out again  tunny fishing is carried on by the people of marseilles in great perfection after a manner which they inherit from the greeks the fish are detained by an enclosure placed in the water much resembling the folds used for enclosing cattle in the middle of a field  end of vol xiii
