neatly engraved on a large broadside and dedicated to dr mead by the same author introduction the stone in the bladder is a distemper which for ought we know to the contrary is as ancient as any other to which the humane body has ever been subject and hippocrates to whom we owe the first accounts of that as well as of all the other diseases he has mentioned informs us that in his time the operation of extracting the stone by cutting was already in use and that there were men who made it their chief business without intermedling with any other part of physic or surgery which then and for a great while afterward made up but one and the same profession all this is evident from that clause of hippocratess oath in which he makes his disciples swear not to cut any person for the stone but to leave that operation to such who exercised themselves in that art and made a particular profession of it  and from these words there may be some ground to think that hippocrates never practiced this operation himself  what was the method of cutting then used we know not thus far however we may be sure that the incision was not proposed to be made in the body of the bladder because hippocrates every where declares it to be his opinion that wounds there are mortal  says he aphor      and in his book de morbis    the only further conjecture that can with any probability be formed is that as celsus is universally allowed to have borrowed his whole system both of physic and surgery from the greeks the method of cutting for the stone which he has described may likewise have been taken from them and perhaps they knew no other but that ammonius surnamed lithotomus from the instrument he invented to break the stone in the bladder when it happened to be too large to pass through the wound entire practiced this method at alexandria in the time of herophilus and erasistratus that is perhaps about   0 years after hippocrates and meges practiced it at rome in the reign of augustus it is celsus who has preserved us the names of these two famous lithotomists and it is evident from what he says of them that he believed their method of cutting to be the same with his and as they lived at a great distance both of time and place from one another and the first of them so near the age of hippocrates it becomes from thence further probable that the operation for the stone described by celsus was the most ancient and perhaps the only one that had ever been practiced before his time  whatever solidity may be in these conjectures for i give them only as such celsus is undoubtedly the first author now remaining who has taught us any thing like a method of cutting and the same without any considerable variation is described by the later greek writers particularly paulus aegineta by the arabians avicenna and albucasis and in general by all chirurgical authors down to the beginning of the sixteenth century rogerius rolandus brunus theodoricus gulielmus de saliceto lanfrancus mundinus guido and others these authors do little more than copy one another and what is worth remarking about them is that it does not appear that any of them ever saw this operation performed guido alone excepted but even he does not seem ever to have cut himself  during all this long interval no other method but this being known we are not to imagine that it went by any other name than that of cutting for the stone or operation of lithotomy  but when johannes de romany had invented his new method of cutting which happened some time near the year   00 at least in all probability nearer that than    0 as is said by gourmelenus and the generality of writers since his time it then became necessary that names should be appropriated to these two methods by which they might be distinguished from one another  the principal difference between them consists in the instruments used and in the manner of using them and therefore it was natural that the names applied to them should be taken from thence accordingly we find that de franco calls marianuss operation la cure de la pierre avec gros ferrement and from thence undoubtedly came the appellations of major and minor apparatus by which these two operarations have since been most commonly expressed first used as far as i can find by paraeus and gourmelenus as well as the french names which answer to them le haut and le petit appareil the english names of cutting upon the staff and cutting upon the gripe are of a much later date we probably borrowed them from the dutch in which language these two ways of cutting are expressed by terms analogous to them and perhaps they came to be taken into the english language by being used by lithomists whom we have had oftener than once from holland  the second of these methods the apparatus major was as i have said invented by johannes de romany and practiced by him at rome but it was first published there by his scholar marianus sanctus barolitanus in the year      not at venice in      as some have said and it is upon this account that authors who do not so much attend to discoverers as to the publishers of discoveries have given it the name of methodus mariana or mariniana  this operation being suited to persons of all ages whereas that of celsus was formerly thought practicable only upon children soon gained a general vogue and brought lithotomy much more in fashion than it had been for many ages before celsuss method however was not quite laid aside but continued to be practiced and perhaps even more frequently than it had ever been since aeginetas days with this advantage also that the success of the other method being experienced in full grown persons as well as children encouraged lithotomists to break through the narrow limits of time fixed by the ancients and extend the use of celsuss method much further than celsus himself had prescribed  from this time downwards the practice of lithotomy becoming still more common a great many improvements were made in both methods especially in that of marianus and other varieties introduced in them as best suited the genius of particular operators the condition of the patients or the humor of the times and in all these the parisian lithotomists must be allowed to have had the principal hand  in the year      de francos treatise of hernias etc was first published and in that he gives an account of a new method he once made use of in order to extract a stone all the others proving ineffectual and that was by making an incision above the os pubis though the operation succeeded yet he thinks fit to dissuade all persons from ever following his example and indeed his advice was so far complied with that for above twenty years after his book appeared authors are as entirely silent about this extraordinary operation as if it had never been known and in all probability would have continued so much longer had not a lucky chance engaged a person of rossetuss learning and sagacity to undertake the introducing of the caesarean operation for in order to recommend this unheard of and dangerous practice one method this great man thought it for his purpose to take was to compare it with some others then in use and amongst the rest with the common ways of cutting for the stone this led him to so clear and terrifying a view of the cruelty and barbarity of both of them that a person of his talent for invention needed no more to put him upon the search of a new one and the pains he had been at to consider the nature and consequences of wounds in the abdomen was undoubtedly what gave him the first hint of that which he invented de franco must indeed be owned to have published an instance of this operation before rossetus endeavored to introduce it but rossetus is not for that reason to be denied the glory of having invented it for to say nothing of the circumstances of de francos story which every body is now sufficiently acquainted with rossetus was led to the theory he established by the mere force of his own judgment his knowledge of the structure of the parts concerned in which he exceeded all that went before him vesalius himself not excepted and consequences drawn from facts among which that mentioned by franco appears to have no place rossetus having discovered his method before ever he had seen that authors book as he affirms himself and in a manner that gives not the least ground to suspect him of a falsehood  but if it should be granted that he took the first hint of his method from franco be must still be allowed by all who have read and understand his book to deserve a greater share of praise as an improver than the other can claim as an inventer and i believe it will be found upon a strict examination that the honor of many discoveries which we now enjoy is given to persons who had no better title to them than he has to this even supposing he had borrowed from de franco all that he could possibly borrow from him he must be very little acquainted with the history of inventers who does not know that many of their inventions are owing to more favorable accidents than reading de francos book can have been to rossetus  though this great author lived to publish a complete account of his new method of cutting for the stone which has by writers in latin been generally called sectio hypogastrica by the french le haut appareil and in english the high operation yet he never had an opportunity of performing it upon a living body and for above   0 years after him none seemed ever so much as inclinable to make trial of it the writers of lithotomy during that time have most of them indeed mentioned this operation but in such a manner as shows very plainly that few of them had ever read rossetuss book and that not one of them understood it the authority of de franco who forbids the attempting of this method and of hippocrates who thought all wounds in the bladder mortal are the common topics they make use of to cry it down and all this most commonly in the compass of half a page from which an intelligent reader can gather no more than barely that it had been once proposed in france to cut for the stone above the os pubis dionis it is true has been at a little more pains about it than the rest and had probably heard something of rossetuss method but then he is so supinely negligent in all the parts of his account that one would be ready to think he mentions it at all not so much with a design to recommend it to practice as to have something to say and to make way for a new figure in his book which should not be found in the other treatises of chirurgical operations  from these lame and imperfect scraps my brother took the first hints of this method having as i am very well satisfied never seen rossetuss latin treatise till he had composed the whole theory of his operation and performed it successfully on living bodies to him therefore may be applied what i have said about rossetus supposing that author to have read de francos story before he invented his operation but even rossetus himself must yield to him the honor of having introduced the practice of it and for this considering the discouragement he met with the difficulties he had to overcome and on the other hand how highly this method has already conduced to the preservation of mankind no praise nor no reward can be too great  from this short view that i have given of the history of lithotomy it will appear that properly speaking there are but two ways possible of extracting the stone out of the bladder by incision and these are making the wound either above or below the os pubis the first of these if rightly practiced admits of no considerable variety in the second there is a greater latitude not only in respect of the instruments used and the several steps of the operation but also in the place of the incision all these may be and actually have been compounded and combined together by lithotomists in a great many different manners and it would be hard to prove that any two of them ever cut exactly the same way but to avoid as much as can be done all unnecessary subdivisions i think the different methods of extracting a stone by cutting below the os pubis may be reduced to three kinds that of celsus that of marianus and what i have chosen to call the lateral way first practiced by friar jacques the two first as has been already observed differ from one another chiefly in the instruments and steps of the operation and the last differs from both these in the place of the incision  to this method i shall confine myself at present referring the complete history of the other two together with the high operation to another opportunity and in treating it i intend to observe this order  first i shall set down from all the authors i have met with the history of friar jaques his two methods of cutting males and the success with which they were attended  secondly i shall compare the different accounts which have been given of the several parts of his operations with one another that thereby it may clearly appear wherein they really consisted  thirdly i shall relate the opinions of authors concerning his operations and the grounds upon which their opinions have been founded these as is easy to conceive are chiefly the observations made on the dead bodies of such as he had cut  fourthly i shall set down his method of cutting females and the judgments that have been made thereof  under these four general heads will be contained the whole history of the lateral operation for the stone as it was performed by this monk and from thence we are naturally led to consider the improvements that have been made of it first those proposed by monsieur merry and then such as were contrived and put in practice by professor rau  for the matter of all this history i must be obliged to books nothing can be called mine except the order in which i have digested it what authors i have chiefly consulted the reader will see in the beginning of the first chapter  before i close this introduction i must further acquaint the reader that i intend that the history of this lateral operation shall be followed in a very short time by that of the other three general methods of cutting for the stone in three separate treatises to these i shall add a fifth containing the anatomy and figures of the parts concerned in them all the figures of all the instruments that have been used and lastly my own observations concerning the advantages and inconveniences with which each of them are attended and in what cases i judge any of them taken all together to be preferable to the rest  chap i the history of friar jaques methods of cutting males the first account that i find to have been ever published of friar jacques operations for the stone is contained in a letter written by mr bussiere a skilful and experienced surgeon in london and f r s to sir hans sloane and inserted in the philosophical transactions for the month of march      the author begins by describing the instruments used in these operations and the method of performing them according to the informations he had received from paris then he sets down the opinion of his french correspondent about them and lastly subjoins his own founded on several experiments he had made on dead bodies  much about the same time dr lister published his journey to paris and amongst other curiosities he has given us some account of friar jacques the doctor went physician to the earl of portland who was sent ambassador to france by king william after the peace of reswick and during his abode at paris he had the good fortune to see friar jacques several times cut for the stone  soon after that appeared a french treatise with this title observations sur la maniere de tailler dans les deux sexes pour lextraction de la pierre pratiquee par friar jacques par jean merry chirurgien de la feue reine and anatomiste de lacademie royale de sciences printed at paris and presently afterward at amsterdam both in the year   00 this excellent author has left almost nothing unsaid that relates either to the history of friar jacques operations or the various success with which they were attended in france and he has likewise shown at very great length the reasons of the inconveniences that follow upon them and the way by which he thinks these may be remedied but as it is to him that we must be chiefly obliged for all that can with certainty be affirmed about them it is unnecessary to make any more particular abstract of his book in this place  the same year that monsieur merys observations were published the leipsick journalists gave an extract of it but as i shall have occacasion to remark as i go along they do not seem always to have hit the true sense of the author  saviard in a collection of chirurgical operations published at paris in   0  has likewise mentioned those of friar jacques for the stone but refers entirely to merry for an account of them and indeed by the few things he has said about them he appears to have been very unfit for that task himself  monsieur dionis is the next who affords us any thing further remarkable upon this head in his book of chirurgical operations published at paris in   0  he has given a very distinct and methodical history of friar jacques operations the principal facts he mentions are or might have been taken from merry and to these he has added some others which as he lived and practiced in paris while friar jacques was there and saw him several times cut it could be no hard matter for him to collect  goelick in his history of surgery      has transcribed the extract of merys book from the leipsick acts and mr cheselden in his treatise on the high operation for the stone      has abridged the account of friar jacques given us by dionis but yet differs from him in some things  the learned professor albinus has made a few observations on the same subject introductory to the accurate account he has lately published of mr raus method and it is from these nine authors that i have extracted the following history of friar jacques operations for the stone though in reality they may all be reduced to three the other six having told us nothing worth minding but what they have borrowed from bassere merry and dionis  we know but very little concerning this mans original education life or character in any other respect than as a lithotomist the name he gave himself was jacques beaulieu and he said he was born in beaufort a town or village of the district of long saunier in what is called the county of burgundy    all our authors agree that he was a monk of some one kind or other but of what order or institution is not so certain mr bussiere calls him an hermit   and this seems to be confirmed by what we are told by dionis that he had framed to himself a rule of religion backed with vows which he left it to his bishop for the time being to dispense him from at pleasure   for at this time as i have been informed an hermit in france is commonly a person who being without education and having either spent his substance or been born to none associates himself with one or two never more of the same stamp and finding means to get a gift of some few acres of ground in a solitary place near a great town and liberty from the bishop of the diocese to erect a hermitage together with what they call a rule to be observed in it first build themselves little cells and then by manuring the rest of the land selling little trinkets which they make and the charity of welldisposed persons supply themselves with all the necessaries and most commonly even the conveniences of life what makes it further probable that our monk was of this kind is the ignorance and want of education which both merry and dionis have observed in him  merry tells us he was a brother of the third order of st francis a set of mendicant monks who differ indeed very much from hermits because they live in great communities and are tied up to a stricter rule of life but amongst those they call brothers of that order there are many so perfectly void of all sorts of education that they cannot so much as read their own mother tongue    dionis says he wore the habit of a recolet except that he had shoes instead of sandals and a hat instead of a cowl the recolets are such monks of the first or great order of franciscans called in france cordeliers or freres mineurs who embraced the reformation that was some time ago made amongst them and if what dionis here says be strictly true our monk might still be a hermit but could not be of the third order as merry pretends he was    but of whatever order he was or whether of any order or not none of these authors give us the least ground to think he was ever admitted to holy orders and the appellation of friar jacques which dionis says he took to himself is proof enough to any body who has had occasion to inform himself of the customs of these monks in france that he never was   and therefore it is i believe pretty much without ground that mr cheselden terms him an ecclesiastic   a name seldom given to any but the secular clergy and never to a friar who is not a priest dr lister indeed and his correspondent mr probie both call him pere jacques but he is never so termed by the french authors who understand the propriety of such designations better than strangers  albinus contents himself to call him in general a monk and such in some sense or other he undoubtedly was and this is all that can with any certainty be affirmed about his profession    his ordinary residence he pretended was in an hospital called la charity at besancon the capital of the province of franche comte erected for the maintenance of poor aged people and children  0 his outward behavior had all the appearances of probity and simplicity he lived on nothing but bread and ordinary soupes despised money and never asked for any but only a few pence to set his instruments and mend his shoes     but to come nearer our present design the history of his operations for the stone merry informs us that his natural character was very much suited to them he was of an intrepid and undaunted courage and resolution had a sure and steady hand and went about whatever he undertook without the least hesitation faultering or sign of fear these natural talents were however the only ones he possessed art he was a perfect stranger to being altogether ignorant of anatomy and the regular operations of surgery    neither is it without ground that dionis observes that the intrepidity and quickness with which he performed his operations were owing to nothing so much as his being insensible of the danger that attended his miscarriages  this being the case it may be justly wondered how he came ever to attempt cutting for the stone at all this is a mystery which no author but merry has endeavored to explain and he has done it but very imperfectly by comparing his natural character with that of raoux a famous impostor their curing of hernias and likewise their method of operating for the stone he imagines that friar jacques might have been raouxs disciple and learnt some part of his operations from him and from thence and what he had taken from the method commonly practiced when he began to cut have invented the rest    but this will be better understood when we have explained wherein his operations consisted and that together with the series of his practice as far as our authors have handed it down to us is what we now proceed to  that he had cut for the stone many times before he went to paris is evident from the great number of attestations which he brought along with him from besancon and several towns and villages in burgundy and other provinces of france he boasted extremely of the success he had had and his credentials seemed to confirm all he said however it appeared soon after by letters from these provinces that these attestations were given upon too slight grounds and before any other effect of his operations besides bare extracting the stone could be perceived his way being to run from place to place where there was any employments for him and as soon as he had performed an operation to engage the most considerable of the spectators to sign a certificate in his favor without ever allowing them time to see whether the patient recovered or not and when he had cut all that came in his way in one place he immediately left it and hastened to another being sollicitous about nothing but to make his dexterity appear in taking out the stone and not at all about what should become of the patient after the operation     this is all we know of him before he arrived in paris which happened in the month of august      the occasion of that journey he gave out to be no other than to teach the surgeons of the hospitals there a new way of cutting for the stone and having found means to get an acquaintance with monsieur marshall afterward first surgeon to the french king he endeavored by his interest to obtain leave to cut in the hospital of la charity but the surgeons there as well as those of the hotel dieu being unwilling to trust the lives of their patients in the hands of a stranger of whose abilities they were altogether ignorant desired him first to make some experiments in their presence upon dead bodies which he readily consented to and accordingly as monsieur dionis relates he performed his operation on a body into the bladder of which a stone had been conveyed before by the surgeons of the charity but not at all to their satisfaction     monsieur merry who was appointed by the first president of paris whom the leipsick journalists have mistaken for the president of the royal academy    to inspect these experiments of friar jaques operation says nothing of any that were performed at the charity and concerning those which he was witness to at the hotel dieu he makes quite a different judgment from what dionis says was made by all the surgeons who were present at that which he mentions  on the  th day of december says monsieur merry i received orders from the first president to go to the hotel dieu and be present at the extraction of a stone out of the bladder of a dead body by friar jacques he performed the operation in this manner  having introduced into the bladder a solid round staff without a groove and of a different figure from those used in the old way of cutting he took a bistoury like the common ones only longer and with that made an incision on the left and inside of the protuberance of the ischium and cutting obliquely from below upwards he divided whatever came in his way between that protuberance and his staff which he kept still in the bladder his incision being finished he thrust his finger through the wound into the bladder to find out the stone and having observed where it lay he introduced an instrument into the bladder of the figure hereafter represented to dilate the wound that the stone might have more room to come out upon this dilator which he calls his conductor he thrust in a pair of forceps and then drew out the conductor having felt for and laid hold of the stone he pulled the staff out of the urethra then his forceps and the stone along with it all this he did with a wonderful facility notwithstanding the stone was as big as an hens egg  the operation being finished i dissected the parts which had been cut in presence of the physicians and surgeons of the hotel dieu by that means and by comparing at the same time these parts with those of the other side we observed that friar jacques had cut first about an inch and an half deep in fat that from thence he had carried his knife between the musculus erector and the left accelerator but without wounding either of them and lastly that he cut through the whole length of the neck of the bladder on one side and about half an inch of the body of it  two days after this experiment i waited on the first president to give him an account of my observations and at the same time my opinion concerning friar jacques operation my report was conceived in these terms  sir  friar jacques method of cutting appears to me to be much preferable to that commonly practiced because the incision being made both in the neck and body of the bladder and the stone extracted at the broadest part of the angle made by the ossa pubis comes out with great ease and without the least force but in the common operation as the incision is only made in the urethra and the stone drawn through the neck of the bladder which remains entire and at the narrowest part of the angle of the ossa pubis it is evident that the extraction of the stone through such strait passages must be very difficult and require a great deal of force when of any considerable bigness from whence it is easy to conclude th friar jacques operation will not be liable to such dangerou accidents as are found to attend the other and that for these reasons    because in his way of operating he cuts none of the muscles of the penis whereas in the common way the two accelerators are entirely separated from one another by the incision which is made of the place of their union that is at their origin by which means these muscies happen very frequently to lose their action    in making his operation it must be owned indeed that he cuts the body of the prostates the whole neck of the bladder on one side and a little of the body but these parts having no considerable blood vessels belonging to them an haemorage is not so much to be feared as in the common operation in which the incision is made in the spungy and thick part of the urethra which receive a great quantity of blood from the two arteries of the penis    his operation can neither be followed by an echymosis fluxion nor suppuration in the membranes of the scrotum which happen so frequently after the other because the place by which he gets into the bladder has not the same communication with the scrotum as the perinaeum in which the other lithotomists begin their incision    by making a large wound in the neck and body of the bladder through which he easily draws out the stone he evites the contusion and tearing which in the common operation almost constantly happens both to the neck of the bladder and prostates which are joined to it and even to the urethra itself when the stone is large or its surface rugged and from hence it comes to pass that the parts which he divides being only simply cut will very easily reunite after the operation and by this means fistulas be in a great measure prevented whereas in the common method the parts suffering most commonly cause a violent contusion and a considerable loss of substance by suppuration their reunion is retarded and thus fistulas are occasioned but however i am inclined to believe that if friar jacques made his incision two inches higher up than the place where he now begins it he might get into the bladder in the same manner and yet the wound not be so deep and consequently sooner healed supposing always that wounds in the neck and body of the bladder are not mortal as has been hitherto believed and that the sphincter muscle may be reunited as exactly as it was before which experience alone must determine  as for the instruments he uses i cannot find that they are any ways preferable to ours on the contrary his staff seems to be much more inconvenient both because it forces the lower part of the urethra too far outward and because not being grooved it cannot be so surely cut upon for let friar jacques have never so steady a hand the point of his bistoury must be apt to slide either to one side or other upon a staff which is exactly round  the conductor which he thrusts into the bladder after the wound is made is not at all proper to direct his forceps thither and can be of no manner of service to dilate the incision made in the neck and and body of the bladder because that incision is longer than the conductor is broad and besides the wound may be dilated by the forceps with this advantage that the dilatation will never be more than is necessary which is what no other dilator can do   the account i have here given of monsieur marys observations made on dissecting the parts cut by friar jacques in this first trial of his operation did not properly belong to this part of my history in which my design is not to consider either the structure of the parts concerned in this method of cutting nor the judgment that has or may be formed from thence concerning the advantages and inconveniences thereof this i reserve for a distinct head but as monsieur merry did afterward retract the greatest part of the favorable opinion he had here conceived of friar jacques upon a more full insight into his operation and as this is the first trial that we have any certain account ever to have been made of it i judged it necessary in entering upon the history of this method of cutting to make the reader thus far acquainted with the nature of it that the sequel of this relation might be the more easily understood  what effect this report had upon the first president and the other persons to whom it was communicated monsieur merry has not informed us nor of any thing else that happened before the second experiment was made which was just a week after the first  on the   th day of the same month of december continues our author i went to the hotel dieu by a second order of the first president to see friar jacques perform his operation a second time he cut the dead body of a child between twelve and fourteen years of age and likewise of a woman into the bladders of which stones had been put as before he cut the boy exactly in the same manner as he did the man and i dissected the parts cut in presence of the physicians and surgeons of the hotel dieu     what was the result of our authors observations we shall see elsewhere as likewise the account he here gives of friar jaques method of cutting women it is sufficient to remark in this place that the judgment he makes of both these operations was not near so favorable to the monk as the former had been and it may very well be that this was the reason of his leaving paris so abruptly as monsieur dionis informs us though he has by mistake placed the time of his journey two months too early  the court was then at fontainbleau and thither our operator resolved to steer his course upon his arrival he addressed himself to monsieur du chesne first physician to the princes of the blood having found means to procure some letters of recommendation to him and we may be sure he did not forget to show him his whole bundle of certificates monsieur du chesne was charmed with the account the monk gave him of his design in going to paris his method of cutting and the great number of operations which he had performed and out of a zeal for the welfare of his fellow creatures which can never be enough commended he mentioned him to monsieur fagon first physician to the king to m bourdelot first physician to the duchess of burgundy and to several others besides who all concluded that it would be worth while to see him cut and for this purpose a shoemakers boy of versailles then at fontainbleau and who was troubled with the stone luckily offered himself monsieur du chesne immediately sent him to a nurse and ordered him all manner of necessaries friar jacques performed the operation in presence of the physicians and of monsieur felix then first surgeon to the king the success answered their expectation and they were all perfectly satisfied with what they had seen especially monsieur felix who from that moment took friar jacques home to his house and kept him there all the time he staid at fontainbleau  this operation we may easily conceive made a great noise and was published all over the court the princes of the blood were informed of it by monsieur du chesne and he gave them an account every day of the progress of the cure as for his own part he looked upon the monk as a man sent by god for the relief of those who were afflicted with the stone by a more easy and less dangerous method than any that had till then been known and indeed the first effects of his operation on the shoemaker were extremely happy it was performed very quickly the urine came out through the ordinary passage a very short time after no bad accident superveend and the patient was able to go abroad in three weeks time     this was the first operation that ever we hear friar jacques performed after his arrival at paris on a living body it happened at court to which he went of his own accord not by invitation as we are told by mr cheselden and by the success of that not by the reputation he had acquired by those he had cut before he recommended himself to the court  monsieur dionis goes on to friar jacques manner of cutting but the account thereof sent to mr bussiere from paris being prior to his in order of time it must for that reason be inserted before it here is the description says mr bussiere to sir hans sloane of the way of performing the operation for the extraction of the stone out of the bladder by brother james an hermit in france as i received it from paris  he makes use of a steel staff much bigger and shorter than those which are commonly made use of it is shorter from the top to the bending of it it bends more than ours he has but two one for men and another for children  his conductor is slender and longer than ours the point whereof which goes into the bladder being of the figure of a lozenge is wide and open in the extremity  his forceps have longer branches than ours but the holds of them are shorter and wider with many large teeth within  the eurethra with which he draws the sand or gravel which remain sometimes in the bladder after the stone is out is shorter than ours  his knife is much longer and slenderer than ours  he causes the patient to lie flat upon his back either upon his bed or upon a table whereupon is a soft quilt in such a manner that the fundament is three or four fingers over the table some servants supporting his legs and thighs he uses no ligature to fasten the patient giving him more liberty than we do he causes his legs to be bent against the thighs but not the thighs against the belly except the left which in his operation he uses more or less as he thinks fit  then he introduces the catheter or staff into the bladder which though bigger and shorter than ours yet seems to run in easier very often he holds it himself with his left hand pressing it close toward the fundament in order to dilate and extend the membranes of the bladder then he feels with the fingers of his right hand to find cut the staff through the skin so having felt it he runs his incision knife at the bent of the left thigh upon the fat protuberance below the ischium bone directly upwards by the rectum to the bladder which he pierces by its neck and sometimes a little above it when he cutteth the cutting parts of his knife are turned upwards and downwards having thus pierced the bladder which he knows by the urine running out then he turns his knife and thrusts it a little further in order to open the bladder wide enough that his finger may go in easily then he withdraws his knife and enlarges the wound in the outward parts of the length of two or three inches after which he thrusts his finger into the bladder in order to know more precisely the bigness and situation of the stone and make it loose but chiefly to dilate the overture of the bladder by tearing its membranes  then he introduces his conductor into the bladder along this finger which is in it  when the conductor is in the bladder he takes the staff out and introduces the forceps by the conductor into it with which he gets hold of the stone and draws it out  if he finds any difficulty either in getting hold of the stone or in drawing it out he uses all the ways commonly used raising the left thigh more or less putting his finger in the fundament and sometimes times the bladder in order to examine the situation of the stone and loosen it in case there might be any adhesion with the membranes of the bladder having found out and removed the cause of the difficulty he thrusts the forceps again into the bladder and gets hold of the stone and pulls it out  it is to be observed that this second time nor any other he uses no conductor the forceps running in very easily he never thrusts his finger or any instrument into the bladder without steeping them in oil of roses he never uses any dilatatorium or canula or tents in the wound except some small dossils in the lips of the outward wound to keep them open for a little while he uses no ointments at all for the wound applying only a pledget steeped in oil of roses upon it for he understands nothing at all of the way of dressing wounds nor in the diet which the patient is to observe which things he does not value in this way he operates as dexterously as any of our best operators     wherein this account of friar jacques operation differs from the rest and also wherein they all differ from one another we shall be better able to show when we have gone through all that belongs to the history of it  the next author in order of time who has said any thing further about the method of performing it is saviard and he has only told us that friar jacques who cut several patients in the hotel dieu in the year school used to leave a large illcontrivd catheter in the bladder til he had extracted the stone  0  dionis to whom we now return begins his account of friar jacques method by observing that he took no pains to prepare his patients for the operation and cared not whether they had been blooded and purged beforehand or not he places the patient upon the edge of a table set in a good light and then lays him upon his back with only a pillow under his head he raises his thighs separates them wide from one another bends his legs so that his heels and buttocks almost meet and sets two strong men to keep him in that posture without binding him at all but trusting entirely to the strength and management of these assistants  the patient being thus in a proper situation he introduces a greased staff not groovd into the penis and holding it in his left hand he thrusts out that part of the bladder where he designs to make his incision then taking in his right a long bistoury shaped like a dagger he plunges it near the point of the left buttock two fingers breadth from the perinaeum and pushing it straight toward the bladder he cuts into the body thereof as near the neck as he can making an incision as wide as the size of the stone requires it before ever he takes out his bistoury  he makes use of a conductor in order to direct the forceps which is made pretty much of the same shape with ours but very often before he introduces this instrument he thrusts his finger into the wound to discover the situation of the stone as soon as he lays hold of it with the forceps he pulls it out suddenly and roughly never reflecting on the bad consequences that such violence may be attended with if there be more stones than one he extracts all of them after the same manner and when he finds there are none left he believes his whole work to be done for he never thinks of getting any apparatus ready beforehand nor of dressing his patients after the operation he uses no astringents nor defensives all he does is to apply a little oil and wine to the wound and when he is put in mind of the necessity there is of the patients being well looked after his answer is i have extracted the stone i leave god to cure the patient     mr cheselden in order to explain friar jacques newinvented way of cutting for the stone thinks it sufficient to tell us that it was by the direction of a staff into the bladder near the rectum and as he supposes this to be the same with that practiced afterward in holland by mr rau we may gather this further that he thought the incision was made in the bladder exactly betwixt the ureters     albinus informs us that the parts proposed to be cut in friar jacques operation were not the neck of the bladder as had been anciently practiced nor the urethra as was commonly done at that time but the bladder itself on one side near the neck and a little toward the lower and back part in order to this the patient was laid upon his back with his knees erect his thighs bent and kept at a small distance from one another the incision was begun on the side of the anus and afterward the knife was thrust obliquely inwards and a little upwards all the way to that part of the bladder already described and lastly a pair of forceps introduced through the wound to lay hold of and extract the stone  these are all the accounts that i can find ever to have been published concerning friar jacques method of cutting upon the staff and i have placed them all together merys alone excepted which came in more naturally before that it may be easier for the reader to compare them with one another or at least to perceive the truth and exactness of the comparison i shall lay before him in its proper place  friar jacques was sufficiently caressed at fontainbleau not to think of leaving it while the court remained there but i hear of no other operations he performed during his stay it had one good effect however by giving the news of his extraordinary success and the kind recepception he met with at court time to spread over paris he found his reputation as a lithotomist much better established upon his return than it could otherwise have been though he had made a thousand experiments before the physicians and surgeons of the hospitals the approach of the court to paris contributed further to this and therefore no sooner had the king left fontainbleau to go to versailles but friar jacques resolved to try his fortune once more at paris if that can be called a trial in which he knew the genius of his nation too well not to be sure to succeed  he arrived there about the beginning of april school having been between three and four months absent a very few days after his return he cut a woman named de lorrain a boy between sixteen and seventeen years of age two men and another boy and three more at which monsieur merry was not present the days of the month in which all these operations were performed are not set down but they must all have followed very close upon one another for before the end of april he had made a journey to versailles cut four people in an hospital there was returned to paris and had cut in the hospitals of that city having obtained what he so much desired leave so to do in the manner we shall presently relate  concerning the fate of these twelve patients for i do not find that he cut any more though it is very probable he did monsieur merry informs us that one of the parisians died two days after the operation another in three days another in the month of september following having never been cured the rest lived but in such a manner as did this new method no great honor as we shall hear in the proper place merry says nothing of his journey to versailles but dionis who mentions it owns that all the patients he cut there recovered in some sort or other     one of the three last of the paris patients he cut upon the gripe this is the first time we hear of his cutting for the stone in that manner and monsieur merry has given us the following account of his method he introduces the fore and middle fingers of his left hand through the anus into the intestinum rectum and pressing upon the bladder behind with his two fingers and before with his right hand upon the belly he thrusts the stone toward the perinaeum and keeps it there by means of the two fingers which he holds firmly behind it in his right hand he takes his bistoury and beginning at the protuberance of the ischium he cuts all the parts that lie between that and the stone so that his two ways of operating differ not in the course of the incision but only in the instruments he uses and the manner of extracting the stone for whereas in the great apparatus he cuts upon a staff and uses forceps to draw out the stone in this he cuts upon the stone itself and takes it out by means of a curete of about an inch in breadth first of all he dilates the bottom of the wound by thrusting his conductor into the bladder then forces in his curete between the stone and the upper internal surface of the bladder and having got it behind the stone he raises the handle of it with his right hand the two fingers of his left remaining still in their former place and thus in the same manner as a weight is raised or any other obstacle removed by a lever he forces out the stone     mr bussieres correspondent has likewise taken notice of this method of operating brother james he says very often cutteth the patient upon the gripe almost in the same manner as was used formerly except that he makes the incision in the same place as for the former this way he likes better than the other and it seems to be more favored by him and indeed it is surer though the pressing upon the belly which he does is a very bad method     neither dionis nor any of the rest of our authors have so much as mentioned this second way of cutting the success that attended it we shall see as we go along  we are now come to that period of friar jacques transactions at paris in which as his wishes seemed to be entirely crowned so a speedy foundation was laid for the ruin of that reputation which he had so unaccountably acquired the operations which he had performed immediately upon his return from fontainbleau had so far succeeded as that but two patients died out of twelve that we know he cut this joined to the favorable character that some physicians from the provinces gave of him at court and the great merit that was made there of what had already happened to him at fontainbleau made the magistrates of paris not the king as far as we can learn either from merry or dionis    begin to think seriously of allowing him to cut in the two great hospitals of that city in order to that however the first president thought it proper to call together the administrators of the hotel dieu the physicians and surgeons belonging to it and also mesieurs merry and bessiere who had before been commissioned by him to inspect friar jacques experiments on dead bodies to hear their sentiments upon a matter wherein the lives of the sick people in that hospital were so nearly concerned the assembly was held in the archbishops palace on the   th day of april and monsieur merry was desired to give his opinion the first he has set down at length the discourse he made upon that occasion in which he endeavors to oppose the monks being allowed to cut as strenuously as he had in his former report recommended him  none of the other physicians nor surgeons pretended to dispute either the facts alleged by monsieur merry or the consequences he drew from them but they thought that considering the great number of successful operations which he had performed in the provinces as they were informed by the physicians there residing it would be hard to condemn his new method altogether upon account of a few unlucky experiments he had made of it at paris especially since the public was so much prejudiced in his favor and therefore they gave it as their opinion that the surest way was to admit him to make new trials which he could by no other means do so well as by being allowed to cut in the hotel dieu and this was accordingly resolved on     he was at the same time admitted to the charity and in these two hospitals he cut sixty patients forty two in the first and eighteen in the second during the space of one season that is at farthest between the   th of april and the beginning of july for by the  th day of that month he had left paris reached orleans which is  00 miles distant from it and there performed an operation  the crowds to see him cut were inconceivable there was not a physician nor surgeon who did not strive to get in insomuch that they were forced to have guards to keep off the press and there have been two hundred persons present at once at his operations  of these sixty patients dionis tells us more died than lived and at the time he wrote that may be true but by a computation which monsieur merry made of the different fate of them about september following as near as i can guess since no part of his relation appears to have been written after that time and it is certain it did not exceed a full year because toward the latter end of it he calls the time in which friar jacques cut in the hospitals the last spring by this computation i say it appears that twenty five died soon after the operation thirteen went from the hospitals perfectly cured as was thought though afterward he was informed that some of their wounds had broke out afresh and twenty five remained in the hospitals some afflicted with incontinence of urine others with fistulas and all of them so very low that according to the information he had received from the officers and servants of the hospitals there was on the  0th of july very little hopes of their recovery on this day our author says he ended his observations but as in other places of his book he mentions facts which did not happen till september it is plain they were retouched after that time     monsieur merry was at pains to examine the bodies of such as died after friar jacques operations with a great deal of care and he has set down the observations he made upon them by these we may with great certainty judge of the merit of these methods of cutting for the stone but before we can proceed to that some few facts more belonging to the history of them must first be related  it is not mentioned neither by merry nor dionis how many died out of each hospital but it is probable that the number was greater in proportion to those he cut in the charity than in the hotel dieu dionis says that seven died there in one day and from thence and from a quarrel which friar jacques is said to have had with some of the monks of that house it was that he and his friends took occasion to trump up a fictitious story that the monks sometimes poisoned his patients and sometimes cut other parts in dressing their wounds than those which he had touched in order to discredit his operation this story how unlikely so ever gained the belief of great numbers of people and the death of friar jacques patients turned as much to his honor as his having saved the lives of the rest but at length when upon dissection of the dead bodies especially of those who had been cut at the hotel dieu in which there was no suspicion or any fraud the ignorance of the operator and the inconveniences of the operations came to be plainly discovered this accusation vanished into smoke and with it the reputation of friar jacques and his interest at paris which he had reason to think so well established so that it was soon afterward resolved that he should be no more allowed to cut in either of the hospitals     what contributed very much to this sudden disgrace of friar jacques was the death of the marshall de lorge which happened in the most cruel and lamentable manner the very next day after he had been cut by him while at the same time monsieur fagon who notwithstanding all the solicitations that were made to him to put himself in the hands of friar jacques resolved rather to trust the art of monsieur marshall a skilful and regularly bred surgeon recovered perfectly after undergoing the same operation  0  friar jacques finding his credit quite sunk at paris and that there was no hopes left of getting any more employment there thought his best way was to withdraw to some other city in france and orleans was the place he pitched upon there between the  th and   th day of july he performed eight operations five in the public hospital of that city and three elsewhere as we are informed by a letter which monsieur noel a physician of orleans wrote to monsieur merry dated sept    school the success of these operations was every bit as bad as those he performed in the hospitals of paris three of the eight patients died within a few days after the operation a fourth before september that is in less than two months after he was cut one recovered perfectly and the other three continued in a languishing state being either troubled with an incontinence of urine or very gross symptoms of a fistula     dionis says he cut afterward at lions and in other cities in france but he must certainly be mistaken since by an advertisement in the amsterdam gazette dated the  th of august it appears that on the   th of july that is allowing for the difference of the style only    days after his last operation at orleans he arrived at aix la chapelle the substance of that advertisement is as follows   friar jacques operator for the stone to the most christian king arrived at aix la chapelle on the   th of july to cut a man for the stone and he hereby gives notice that whoever are afflicted with that distemper the gravel or any kind of hernia or rupture he will undertake to cure for nothing the rich as well as the poor only out of charity and benevolence to mankind he offers to all surgeons to teach them his way of cutting and all his other operations gratis and to all physicians to show them infallible remedies against the gravel he lodges at monsieur blondels a physician his operations are all new and of his own invention that for the stone in particular never endangers life and no fistula is to be feared after it he has performed it on multitudes at paris and versailles in presence of the physicians and surgeons of the king of france and met with an universal approbation     the style of this advertisement shows that it was published by the monks own order and from it as well as several other particulars of his history it appears sufficiently that he must have been a most profligate abandoned wretch and that under an outward air of simplicity and selfdenial he concealed some secret design or other which perhaps the multitudes of persons that died under his hands prevented his ever putting in execution  he gives himself out here not only for an operator for the stone but a curer of ruptures he had made some experiments of his talents that way in paris and more at orleans his patients all of them recovered after the operation at least we hear of none that died but as it was always accompanied with castration it soon met with a general disgust and therefore he laid it aside during all the rest of the time he remained at paris     what reception he found at aix la chapelle i have not as yet learned nor whither he went from thence it is certain he was afterward in holland and cut for the stone there as we learn from albinus in the following words while rau taught anatomy and practiced surgery at amsterdam friar jacques arrived there to practice his new method of cutting for the stone as he had already done in france for this purpose he obtained a permission from the civil magistrate and rau was frequently present at his operations which he highly blamed and condemned this freedom of his gave some umbrage at first and he found himself obliged to hold his tongue but afterward when they saw that all he had said was confirmed by the event friar jacques permission was taken from him and rau made public lithotomist in his room  chap ii a comparison of the several descriptions that have been given of friar jaques methods of cutting males in the foregoing history i have collected all that i can find in authors concerning the two methods used by friar jacques in cutting men but as these accounts are not only some of them more full and complete than others but likewise differ from one another in several particulars i have thought it necessary to compare them together it being impossible to judge as we ought concerning the true merit of an operation except we be first thoroughly acquainted with the true manner of performing it  to begin therefore by the preparation of the patient the first step toward all operations of this kind dionis the only author who has said any thing about it assures us that friar jacques looked upon blooding purging and every thing else that goes under that name as things indifferent and of no consequence to the success of the operation and indeed this agrees so well with the character we have given of him and especially the short stay he usually made in the places where he cut that there can be no room to doubt of the truth of it  the instruments he made use of were first a catheter or staff in describing this all our authors agree well enough and from what they have said we may conclude that it was made of steel solid round without a groove thicker and shorter than those used in the common way shorter from the top to the bending and bent more that he had two sorts one for men and one for children differing only in size and that before he used it he always dipped it in oil of roses or some such thing  his incision knife or bistoury as it is called in french differed from the common one chiefly in length bussiere adds that it was slenderer and dionis that it was shaped like a poinard or dagger  merry has given us a figure of his dilator or conductor by which it will be better understood than by any description that has been made of it dionis says in general that it is pretty much of the same shape with the common one which i believe is pretty far from being true but mr bussieres description will agree very well with merys figure his conductor says he is slender and longer than the common one the point whereof that is all that part which goes into the bladder being of the figure of a lozenge is wide and open in the extremity  his forceps no author has described except mr bussiere that is they all believed it to be like the common one but he tells us that the branches are longer and the holds shorter and wider with many large teeth within it is for the same reason that they say nothing of his scoop but mr bussiere takes notice that that instrument which he calls an eurethra is shorter than the common sort  the situation of the patient number and office of the assistants follow next in order about all these monsieur merry is entirely silent bussiere dionis and albinus agree except in a very few particulars the patient is laid upon his back on a bed or table with a soft quilt under him or only a pillow under his head in such a manner that the fundament is three or four inches over the edge of the table the thighs erect not bent toward the belly and at a good distance from one another  albinus says they are bent and not much separated the legs bent so as that the heels do almost touch the buttock and in this posture he is kept by two strong assistants without the help of any ligature so that the operator is at liberty to move any part as he thinks convenient  the patient being placed in this manner merry tells us that friar jacques introduces his catheter into the bladder and bussiere adds that though it be bigger and shorter than the common ones yet it seems to run in easier that he very often  dionis says always holds it in his left hand and presses it close toward the fundament in order to dilate or thrust out that part of the bladder which he designs to cut till he can feel it with his fingers through the skin albinus seems to think that friar jacques made use of no staff in his operation for besides that he does not mention it in the account he has given us he makes the addition rau made to friar jacques operation to consist in a staff which he compares not with the staff used by him as he naturally ought to have done in order to show wherein raus was preferable to his but with that used in the great apparatus  when friar jacques had felt the catheter through the skin he began to make an incision on the left and inside of the protuberance of the ischium and so cutting on obliquely from below upwards he divided whatever came in his way till he reached his catheter and it appears by all merys dissections from whom these words are taken that his design was to cut the neck of the bladder lengthways and as much of the body of it as the size of the stone required  bussiere describes his incision thus he runs his knife at the bent of the left thigh upon the fat protuberance below the ischium bone directly upwards by the rectum into the bladder which he pierces by its neck and sometimes a little above it this account disagrees with the former chiefly in the course of the incision from its beginning till it reached the bladder  according to dionis the knife was plunged near the point of the left buttock two fingers breadth from the perinaeum and from thence pushed directly forwards into the body of the bladder as near the neck as he could and all this before ever he took out his knife here the neck of the bladder is supposed to remain entire which is contrary to both merry and bussieres observations  the first part of mr cheseldens account of his way of cutting that it was by the direction of a staff into the bladder near the rectum may be either true or false just as he understood it but the second part that the bladder was cut exactly betwixt the ureters can never be true this shall be shown in describing the structure of the parts concerned in this operation  albinus has copied dioniss mistake about the neck of the bladder not being cut but what he says further that the incision was begun on the side of the anus and afterward the knife thrust obliquely inwards and a little upwards into the side of the bladder near its neck and a little toward the lower and back part is exactly agreeable to what we have heard from merry  this being the part of friar jacques method which is of the greatest consequence to be rightly understood i thought it proper to bring here under one view all that has been said about it  the incision being made mr merry acquaints us further that he thrust his finger through the wound into the bladder to find out the stone and having observed where it lay he introduced his conductor to dilate the wound if the bigness of the stone required it and also that it might direct his forceps into the bladder as soon as the forceps had entered there he drew out his conductor and also the staff out of the urethra then having felt for and laid hold of the stone with the forceps he extracted both of them together  bussieres account of this part of the operation disagrees with merys chiefly in this that he supposes the wound to be dilated by the knife and finger only not by the conductor that he makes him enlarge the outward part of it two or three inches after the first incision is finished and that the staff is taken out before the forceps is introduced he has likewise made this very considerable addition to mr merys relation that when the monk found any difficulty either in getting hold of the stone or in drawing it out he used all the ways commonly practiced raising the left thigh more or less putting his finger in the fundament and sometimes into the bladder in order to examine the situation of the stone and loosen it in case there might be any adhesion with the membranes of the bladder having found out and removed the cause of the difficulty he thrusts the forceps again into the bladder gets hold of the stone and pulls it out and at this time he used no conductor the forceps running in very easily  saviard makes the staff remain in the bladder till the stone is extracted this i take to be a mistake because it not only contradicts the two former accounts but because by this means it must have been more difficult to search for and lay hold of the stone with the forceps  dionis agrees with merry in the few things he has said without having made any material addition and albinus has mentioned the extraction of the stone with the forceps in very general terms  as for the care of the patient after the operation and the dressing of the wound both bussiere and dionis inform us that friar jacques neglected that almost entirely or at least left it to other people and amongst all the operations that he performed in the hospitals of paris i cannot learn from merry that ever he applied the least thing to any patient whatever  in the comparison which i have here made of friar jacques first method of cutting i have taken care to point out the mistakes of the several accounts we have of it as far i could with any certainty conclude there were any to be found as for the other particulars in which they disagree and about which i have not ventured to determine any thing it may very well be supposed that they have all of them a real foundation since it is more than probable that at different times and on different subjects the monk may have operated different ways  there is no room for such a comparison of his method of cutting upon the gripe for besides that the only thing in which it differs from the old operation that goes under that name was in the place where the incision was begun we have no particular account of it but from monsieur merry and that has been already set down  chap iii judgments concerning friar jacques method of cutting males having now finished the history of friar jacques operations for the stone and compared all the parts of his method of cutting as far as there is any thing to be met with in authors about it we are fully in a condition to understand the judgments that the same authors have made concerning the advantages and inconveniences that must attend it together with the reasons upon which their several decisions have been founded  monsieur bussiere as has been already said was the first who ventured to publish his thoughts about these operations first in the name of his correspondent and then in his own  his friends opinion is that friar jacques way of cutting is not so sure as the ancient way by which he means that of marianus and that for these two reasons first because the point of the knife not being directed by the staff he is always in danger of piercing all the membranes of the bladder through and through and secondly because the place whereupon he makes the incision being full of considerable vessels one can hardly avoid cutting of some of them and accordingly it was observed in almost all that died in his hands that there was a great deal of blood in the bladder and in some in the cavity of the abdomen  the author goes on to illustrate these two reasons in this manner he succeeds better when the stone is big and large than when it is small by reason that a big stone not only extends the bladder but it stops the point of the knife he did refuse to cut one in whose bladder there was but a small stone which confirms me in the opinion that the unsuccessfulness of his operations proceeds from the point of his knife not being stopped neither by the staff nor stone for when there is but a small stone the bladder being empty he must necessarily cut the whole bladder thoroughly and consequently cut some of its own vessels which causes the hemorrhage which is the better voided when the stone is large  thus far monsieur bussieres friend and what he adds as his own opinion is not much different except in the experiments he has made to prove how reasonable it is i cannot approve the hermits way says he on all occasions yet i think it might be successfully improved by which he can mean no more than that it might be used in some particular cases what these cases are will appear by the observations he made about it after he had received his friends account  i took a body continues he in the bladder of which i put a stone the staff being in the bladder i did press it downwards hard enough as to be felt through the egments and made the incision upon it in the bent of the thigh in order to know whether it would not be a surer way by securing the point of the knife by that way i got my conductor and forceps into the bladder and drew the stone very easily but afterward by the dissection of the body i found that the artery of the penis and the vesiculae seminales were cut through and through which cannot be avoided because the artery and vesiculae lie immediately under that part of the bladder which the staff presses upon  i took another body and having put in the bladder a small stone i made the incision much lower and pierced the bladder under the staff by which incision i drew the stone then dissecting the body i found the bladder cut through and its arteries which can hardly be avoided the bladder being then so much contracted that both sides of the bladder are cut before the operator either feels the stone or sees any urine running out  i took a third body in the bladder of which i put a very large stone the staff being in it i made the incision upon the fat protuberancy under the ischium bone and piercing the bladder below the staff i found immediately the stone with the point of the knife with which i cut the bladder the length of an inch through which having introduced the conductor and then the forceps i got hold of the stone and drew it out very easily then i did dissect the body and found that neither the vesiculae seminales nor any artery had been cut by reason that the weight of the stone pressed the bottom of the bladder lower than the vesiculae and arteries  monsieur bussieres two first experiments we see confirm his friends two reasons against this method and the third serves for a foundation for his own opinion in favor of it in some particular cases that is he thinks that this way might be made use of when the stone is very big and willingly i would prefer it says he to the old way for by this way we avoid that extraordinary and violent dilatation of the neck of the bladder which the stone causes when it is very big and which is the cause of the inflammation and mortification of the bladder that kills the patient but when the stone is very small or but of an indifferent bigness the old way is easier and surer  monsieur bussiere has given us his judgment of friar jacques method of cutting on the gripe likewise i cannot approve says he the cutting upon the gripe because in that way one cutteth through the prostates which destroys the parts of generation i have observed that all those who have been cut by that method were never fit for generation    dr lister was at paris when friar jacques was there and saw him frequently cut the principal thing to be remarked in what he has said about his method is the favorable judgment he makes of it and therefore i have chosen to insert the whole passage in this place  another popular disease at paris says the doctor is the stone and there are men well practiced in the cutting for it there are also two hospitals where great numbers are cut yearly la charity and hotel dieu but that which i shall here most insist upon is the new way practiced by pere jacques a monk about the  0th of april he cut in the hotel dieu ten in less than an hours time the third day after all were hearty and without pain but one  he cuts both by the great and little appareil in both he boldly thrusts in a broad launcet or stilleto into the middle of the muscles of the thigh near the anus till he joins the catheter or staff or the stone betwixt his fingers then he widens the incision of the bladder in proportion to the stone with a silver oval hoop it that will not do he thrusts in his four fingers and tears it wider then with the ducks bill he draws it out  i saw him cut a second time in the hotel dieu and he performed it upon nine persons in three quarters of an hour very dexterously he seemed to venture at all and put me into some disorder with the cruelty of the operation and a stouter englishman than my self however i visited them all in their beds and found them more amazed than in pain  pere jacques cut also his way in the other hospital la charity much about the same time eleven at twice here monsieur marechal the best of the surgeons now in paris for this operation harangued against him before the governors who coldly answered they would be determined by the event which way was best  of those cut at la charity one died and being dissected it was found he had his bladder pierced in four or five places also the musculus psoas sadly mangled also the left vesiculae seminales cut notwithstanding this if this method was well executed by a skilful hand it might be of good use to mankind  since my return i had a letter from mr probie a very learned and industrious young gentleman who was with me to see the operation that part relating to this matter i shall here transcribe indeed i mightily longed for an account of this matter the success of which i came away too soon to learn any thing for certain  paris august       pere jacques reputation mightily slackens out of forty five that he cut at the hotel dieu but sixteen of them survive and of nineteen in the charity but eleven he has practiced at the hospitals at lions but it is said with more success than at paris i am sensible he has got abundance of enemies which makes me very much question what i may hear said of him dr fagon the kings physician told dr tournefort when he went to present his book to him that he had cut seven at versailles and that six of them are alive and as well as if never cut the person that died was so distempered that he was not expected to live and it was thought if he had not been cut he had not lived so long the surgeons have a great mind to cry down the man though they practice his method for marechal has since cut after pere jacques manner only with this difference that marechals catheter was canulated la rue the second surgeon of the charity hospital cut after the old manner at the same time when marechal cut pere jacques way but had not so good success as marechal had for all that marechal cut are alive and well whereas the other lost one or two of his number besides those that lived were not so soon cured no not by a month or six weeks thus far mr probie   i now go on to monsieur merry and in relating the many observations he has given us concerning friar jacques operations i shall observe this order first to set down the observations themselves in the same order of time in which they were made and secondly make a methodical extract of the reasonings and conclusions he draws from them  what the first experiments made by friar jacques furnished him with upon both these heads has been already taken notice of upon dissecting the body of the boy on which the second trial was made our author observed that the monk had cut the accelerator muscle which remained untouched in the former and that the beginning of the urethra the neck and that part of the body of the bladder which lies near the back part of the os pubis were so much torn as to be almost entirely separated from the rest these accidents he judged were to be imputed to the tenderness of the parts the largeness of the monks finger which he thrusts into the bladder and the too great length of his staff and from this we may probably infer that he was not at that time provided with such a staff proper for boys as we are assured he afterward made use of     the first living person he cut at paris was a woman out of the second he extracted four or five large stones the patient lost a great deal of blood in the operation and three days afterward a very great hemorrhage happened the blood coming out through the wound the penis and anus at the same time which made it plain that the intestinum rectum had been cut and accordingly he voided two worms by the wound and excrements were found upon the tents applied to it he had afterward a fistula and died about two months after the operation but his body was never opened     of three others which monsieur merry saw friar jacques cut soon after one died of an hemorrhage in two or three days another was afflicted with a tumor in the groin different from an hernia and an incontinency of urine though his wound was cicatrizd the third our author could hear nothing of     the first person that he cut upon the gripe died two days after the operation and being opened his bladder was observed to be torn as with an iron comb by the forceps and curette which had been several times thrust into the wound     the other observations which monsieur merry has given us were made on the bodies of such as friar jacques had cut in the two hospitals the first dead body he dissected was of a man who died five days after the operation his scrotum penis and bladder were gangreend and the left levator any cut according to the direction of the fibers in the bladder remained one piece of stone of the size of a mans thumb and another smaller which was lodged between the membranes of it  in the second the intestines were all over inflamed and some parts of them gangrened the cavity of the abdomen was filled with a stinking serous matter the thickest parts of which glewed the intestines to one another and also to the bladder peritonaeum and mesentery the bladder itself was gangrened and there was a wound in the bottom of it by which the cavity of it had a communication with that of the abdomen this wound was round and consequently in all probability made with the catheter there was likewise a wound in the neck of the bladder on that side which lies next the rectum two inches deep and one broad with a bit of stone still sticking in it  the third body had been cut on the gripe and the operator had begun his incision an inch and a half higher than in the rest the cavity of the abdomen was here likewise filled with a stinking pituitous matter which glewed the intestines in the hypogastrick region to the bladder and they were also very much inflamed the neck of the bladder was quite separated from the urethra and the whole body of it inclining to a gangrene it was thicker and harder than ordinary and between it and the peritonaeum there was found a great quantity of urine and extravasated blood the intestinum rectum was bruised and shattered and of a livid color  merys fourth observations were made on five dead bodies four of which had been cut two days before the other some time longer but in this last the lower belly was so much corrupted that it was impossible for him to examine whence that terrible disorder proceeded in the rest he found the urethra cut off from the bladder and the bladder separated from the os pubis so that the nerves arteries and veins of the penis being by this means either broken or cut there was a great quantity of blood between the peritonaeum and the viscera of the hypogastrick region the most part of which were very much bruised in one of these bodies the intestines were every where inflamed and in some places gangrened the cavity of the abdomen being filled with pus in two others it was filled with a serous matter died with blood four of these patients as monsieur merry was informed had been cut upon the gripe  his fifth observations were made upon the bodies of six children some of whom had been cut upon the gripe and others upon the staff in all of them he found the bladder separated from the urethra and os pubis the blood vessels of the penis broken or cut the rectum and all the parts thereabout bruised because the monk had thrust his fingers into the anus of them all moreover in one of them the bladder was cut with the bistoury from the back to the fore part in another from the left side to the right near the neck he found likewise a great deal of extravasated blood which together with the contusion of the parts had produced in some of them inflammations and gangreens in others considerable abscesses the matter of which run out at the wound  the next were made on the body of a boy between thirteen and fourteen years of age whom friar jacques had cut upon the gripe besides that the bladder was separated from the os pubis he found the haemorroidal arteries cut which had produced an haemorrhage at two different times and that together with the mortification of the wound were the chief causes of his death what was further peculiar to this operation was that in pushing his knife toward the bladder friar jacques had opened three different passages one at the lower part of the scrotum the second between the bladder and the rectum the third between the peritonaeum and the outside of the bladder  the seventh dead body was of a child which had likewise been cut upon the gripe the cavity of the omentum as well as the abdomen was full of a serous stinking matter the sediment of which had glewed the intestines to the bladder and all of them were gangrened at the place of their union the rectum was livid and that as well as the bladder surrounded by a fetid ulcer the matter of which run out at the wound in order to extract this stone friar jacques run his knife from the protuberance of the ischium between the rectum and peritonaeum and entered the body of the bladder without touching either the neck or urethra making a wound about five inches deep which he could not do without cutting a great number of blood vessels and cruelly dilacerating the parts  the eighth body was of a child who died near a month after the operation but not having been opened the only observation that could be made was that during all that time the wound continued open and that the urine came out that way  the next male body was likewise of a young boy who died six weeks after he had been cut the wound remained still open and was of a very livid color between the rectum os sacrum and peritonaeum there was a fetid ulcer the matter of which run out at the wound the neck of the bladder was parted from the penis and the vessels of the penis cut the rectum was wounded and gangrened and by this last accident it appears that this child had been cut upon the gripe the cavity of the hypogastrium was filled with a serous purulent matter  the next observations are taken from great numbers of dead bodies and in respect of the rest may well be called general observations in three patients cut by friar jacques says our author worms were seen to come out in one through the wound in the other two through the urethra which makes it plain that the intestinum rectum had been cut in all of them and a communication opened in the first between that and the wound and in the rest between it and the bladder again it was observed that most of his patients died with convulsions and all of them with a greater loss of blood than commonly happens to those who are cut the old way  the two last observations were made on the same body partly before and partly after the death of the patient about seven weeks after he had been cut his wound was looked upon to be in a very good state but as far from being closed as at the beginning both urine and a purulent glearious matter mixed with gravel continued to run through it and the patient was still in a very weak condition in nine weeks after he died and his body being opened he was found to have a fistula the entry thereof was very narrow but farther in it was an inch broad and five inches in length reaching from the bent of the buttock moignon de la fesse to the neck of the bladder and from thence between the body of it and the rectum into the innermost part of it run matter from an abscess which lay between the os sacrum and the rectum all the parts contained in the hypogastrium were very black and as there is no room to doubt but that the first cause of the fistula was owing to the incision it is likewise probable that before or after having cut that part of the urethra which joins to the neck of the bladder he had lost his way since the body ot the fistula lay between the bladder and the rectum and since it was evidently impossible for him to make an incision five inches deep without cutting many vessels and also making the parts suffer an extreme violence in extracting the stone there is reason to think that from these two causes proceeded that fluxion which produced the abscess the matter of which had corrupted the parts  0  these are the observations which merry has given us concerning the accidents which either attended or followed upon friar jacques operation and by seeing them all here at length the reader will not only have the satisfaction of observing all the various kinds of them but likewise which of them happened most frequently and in how many different manners they were combined in different subjects  what the author has remarked in several places concerning the particular parts cut in particular operations will serve to confirm and illustrate an observation i have already made that it is not always a proof that where the accounts which have been given of friar jacques methods of cutting are different from one another some of them must be false since by the instances our author has here set down it is evident that in the course of his operations at paris he differed as much from himself as those accounts do from one another  i go on in the next place to the conclusions which monsieur merry has drawn from these observations as far as they relate either to the operations themselves or to friar jacques as the operator  to begin by the operations the first conclusion concerning these which i shall mention from monsieur merry is that in both friar jacques methods of cutting it is a very difficult matter not to separate the neck of the bladder from the urethra this proposition he proves thus that part of the urethra which is joined to the neck of the bladder being situated in the angle formed by the union of the ossa pubis and the at part of the incision knife being laid to the inside of these bones and of the protuberance of the ischium it is impossible to reach the urethra but in an oblique line it must therefore necessarily be cut obliquely accordingly when he used the staff he cut it half thorough and consequently destroyed half its force wherefore the resistance of the urethra being now weaker than the effort which he must make to draw the stone through the neck of the bladder which in this case remains entire the rest of the urethra is quite torn off and broken to which this likewise very much conduces that as he draws the stone from above downwards in the direction of the wound the neck of the bladder is forced out of the direction of the canal of the urethra and by this means more easily separated from it the same accident may likewise follow from the violence he is obliged to use in order to introduce either his forceps or his finger into the bladder  when he cuts upon the gripe the case is still more evident for as here in making the incision he has not the staff to direct and resist his knife the urethra is liable to be cut quite through at once as often as he meets with that part of it which lies between the inside of the os pubis and the neck of the bladder and to this as we have seen was owing the death of many of the children whom he cut this way     a second conclusion drawn by monsieur merry is that it is almost impossible to prevent both incontinency of urine and fistulas in friar jacques ways of operating to prove this our author begins by observing that in these methods it is absolutely necessary that either the urethra alone be cut or the neck of the bladder alone or the body of it alone or lastly the neck and body together if the urethra alone be cut and be not torn afterward from the bladder he thinks such patients may recover perfectly if either the neck of the bladder alone or the neck and body together are cut it is evident that the sphincter must be cut likewise and as this muscle can never recover again its former tone an incontinency of urine must ensue though the wound be never so well cured if the body of the bladder alone be cut a fistula is inevitable which he thus proves the use of the sphincter is to shut the bladder and hinder the urine from running out except when the bladder being compressed by the muscles of the abdomen the urine is by this means and by the elasticity of its own fibers driven toward the neck of it with a force which is greater than the resistance of the sphincter but if when this force is applied at the time that the bladder is wounded the resistance will be less this way than that which is made by the sphincter and consequently the urine must flow out at the wound by the continuance of which a fistula will be formed     thirdly the incontinence of urine and fistulas which happen from this way of cutting are altogether incurable both these inconveniences our author observes may attend the old method but then as the fibers of the sphincter may not be quite destroyed it is possible for them to contract again and recover their former tone whereas when that muscle is cut quite through this can never be hoped for fistulas likewise which are so situated as that causticks and other proper remedies may be applied to them are curable but in those caused by friar jacques method of cutting this is impossible     in the next place the staff which friar jacques makes use of is altogether insufficient to guide the point of his knife or hinder it from slipping sometimes to one side and sometimes to the other if his knife passes the staff toward the fore side of the os pubis it will be apt to enter the lower part of the scrotum and by wounding the vessels opens a passage for the blood amongst the membranes which have been cut by this means abscesses inflammations and gangrenes in these parts are produced if the point of the knife runs in behind the os pubis besides the accidents mentioned in the foregoing conclusions he is liable to wound the bladder through and through and by this occasion abscesses etc in all the parts contained in the hypogastrium  again the place in which friar jacques makes his incision exposes him very often to wound the intestinum rectum  in fine besides the convulsions haemorrhages and other mortal inconveniences which often happen upon his cutting the blood vessels of the penis etc if any of these patients should recover they must be impotent all their lives after     this is the sum of what monsieur merry has told us concerning the inconveniences which he thinks may be gathered from the nature of friar jacques operations as well as from the observations which experience furnished him with as for what relates to friar jacques himself as an operator it is but of very small importance for any body now adays to know wherein his particular miscarriages consisted they may be in general reduced to these two heads his ignorance of the structure of the parts joined to a defect of judgment which he discovered on many occasions and rashness and want of attention in performing his operations to the last of these were owing the wounds he often made in the bladder with his staff and the different passages by which he forced his way into the stone with his knife fingers forceps etc in the same person  monsieur merry has likewise made a comparison between friar jacques method of cutting with what was commonly practiced at that time but as all the particulars upon which that comparison is founded have been partly already taken notice of in this history and the rest belong to that of marianus it would be a useless repetition to insist any further upon it  before we leave monsieur merys book it will be proper to insert that part of the letter mentioned to have been written to him from orleans by monsieur noel which contains the history of the operations friar jacques performed there  friar jacques way of cutting says monsieur noel differs from that which is commonly in use only in the place where the incision is made for instead of the region of the perinaeum he begins his in the fold of the buttock ply de la fesse from thence he goes obliquely directing his knife as much as he can toward the neck of the bladder but as the different thickness of the parts in different subjects varies his operation considerably it is no wonder that the incision is not always in the same place of the bladder especially since it does dot appear that he has any certain rule for this but cuts sometimes higher sometimes lower sometimes further back sometimes further forward however this new operation never succeeds better than when either by chance or by the dexterity of the operator the incision happens to be in the neck of the bladder  friar jacques performed eight operations in this city five in the hotel dieu and three elsewhere the first was upon a man of fifty years of age and both physicians and surgeons who were present assured me that it was done with a great deal of dexterity the stone was much of the size and figure of an egg and none that saw it doubted of the success  however five or six days after the patient was afflicted with a considerable haemorrhage and on the tenth with another since that time he has felt extreme pains in the region of the perinaeum anus and scrotum caused by an abscess in these parts which is at length broken by means of proper remedies applied to it it opened in the lower part of the scrotum and there came cut a great quantity of purulent matter ever since the urine runs both that way and through the wound though in a less degree than before i have seen him dressed several times and by examining both wounds i find them disposed to remain fistulous the patient is in a very low habit of body and in no condition to undergo any further trials for a cure  the second operation was on a man of sixty it was very long and troublesome he lost the stone several times and at last it broke it was of an oval figure and about the size of a pidgeons egg when it was out there was a part of the inner membrane of the bladder found sticking to it and another portion of a membrane followed it some time after in which some gravel was wrapped up the incision contrary to his usual custom was begun at the extremity of the scrotum and from thence run obliquely toward the fold of the buttock the operator had no incision knife but was obliged to make use of a razor ever after the operation the patient was troubled with the hickup a looseness and a great tension in the abdomen the penis scrotum and anus were bruised and of a livid color almost like a gangrene which was prevented only by the care and skill of the surgeon employed the wound was always foul and rotten notwithstanding the strongest detersives that could be applied it resembled the mouch of a lampray both in figure and color and the patient complained of an excessive heat in the scrotum and end of the penis through which his urine passed sometimes but with extreme pain and it never ceased to come out at the wound which remained in such a miserable state that his death was not surprising to any his body however was not opened  the third person friar jacques cut was sixty six years of age he extracted two smoorh oval stones both of them of the size of an egg i was informed that this operation was performed very dexterously and in very little time the incision was made lower than in the rest that is at a greater distance from the scrotum in five or six weeks time the patient was perfectly recovered he has no incontinency of urine and it came through the wound only for the first eighteen or twenty days  the fourth patient was about eleven years old but his wound is not as yet healed what is particular in him is that though some urine still continues to flow out at the wound yet the greatest quantity comes through the penis and not involuntarily neither his wound seems now to be in a very good disposition if the urine that runs that way does not hinder the cure  the fifth was of the same age but he died the fourth or fifth day after the operation with a fever and vomiting this operation was very troublesome and violent and upon opening the body we found that the incision had been made on one side of the neck of the bladder some part of the sphincter and a little of the body being cut the figure of the wound was triangular oblique and transverse it having been made at different times  the sixth patient was cut upon the gripe and with a great deal of ease he extracted two stones both of the bigness of a walnut with the husk on the thirty fifth day after the operation the urine began to come out the right way but the greatest part of it passes still through the wound and in all appearance it will remain fistulous  the seventh operation was made on a young man of twenty two years of age friar jacques could neither find the stone nor staff with his knife which made it a long while before he could extract it the patient died in four days with a high fever and vomiting and when he was opened we found the whole sphincter cut transversely     to this place likewise may belong the reflections which monsieur saviard has made upon friar jacques in obs  0   on the   th of july school it is printed by mistake      i was sent for to the abbey of st germain des prez together with monsieur jacquemier doctor of physic monsieur tursan deputy lieutenant to the kings first surgeon mess collot tolet and coliguon lithotomists to examine the wound of a benedictine monk who had been cut by an operator named friar jacques beaulieu we found the patient extremely fallen away with a slow fever which had continued upon him ever since the operation his wound which we were told had been corrupted was then ruddy enough without any hardness or tumor about it but as wide open as the first day it was made we saw the urine run out at it together with a glairous purulent matter and a gravelly sediment  it was our opinion that the bladder was ulcerated and that there were but little hopes of his recovery we ordered what we thought proper but he died the   st of september following the wound remaining always open  this friar jacques was and is still looked upon by some people as a very wonderful operator notwithstanding all the discoveries that have been made of his miscarriages and that for four or five reasons   because he operates differently from the other lithotomists   because he shows a great deal of courage in cutting and assurance in bragging of his feats   because he appears to be disinterested   because he wears a religious habit and has a great air of devotion   because he pretends to have received all that he knows in surgery by inspiration and as it cost him nothing so he is willing to teach other people gratis  these are the foundations of his pretended merit and it is a very easy matter to examine the solidity of them  for in the first place what inference can be drawn touching his abilities from this that he cuts differently from other lithotomists he is not a bit the better operator for that except his method were preferable to the rest which it certainly is in no respect except in killing a greater number of patients as appeared by the trials made of it at the hospitals  again is he a better operator because he is bold and forwards no certainly for though assurance be very commendable in an operator yet still it is to be looked upon only as a subordinate talent and presupposes knowledge and skill for otherwise it is pernicious and that friar jaques was of this kind is plain from the number of persons who died under his hands  his readiness to boast of the cures he had performed has always been looked upon as a thing very unbecoming in any body but much more when founded upon lies and falsehoods this is friar jacques case for as soon as he arrived in paris he gave out that by his new method he cut without pain that his patients would recover in much less time than is usual and that without any danger of a fistula or other accidents all this has been found to be false his method of cutting is much oftener attended with fistulas and haemorrhagy than the others he causes great pains in operating and his patients are a great while in recovering his boastings therefore ought rather to make him be despised and undervalued than be looked upon as any thing extraordinary  can his disinterestedness be reckoned a proof of his ability this is no doubt a very commendable quality in him but he does not possess it in a greater degree than the other lithotomists as far as the poor are concerned for all who cut in the hospitals do it gratis and even to such as are not there there are very few who would refuse their assistance upon the same terms when it is needful but i must own if friar jacques pretends to extend his charity to the rich he outdoes the rest but at the same time he exceeds the bounds of his duty by a zeal which according to the gospel phrase is not according to knowledge  his religious habit and air of sanctity are but equivocal signs we are all used to see such dresses every day and therefore ought not to wonder at any body who wears them but with relation to friar jacques the wonder is this how if he is really and truly a monk his superiors should ever have sent him on such an unaccountable errand as to go all over the kingdom and cut people of both sexes for the stone which he cannot do without viewing objects which must put that chastity of which he has made a vow to a very severe trial or if he be not a monk but only wears the habit how the church should suffer such a disguise which must infallibly scandalize great numbers of people  but the greatest wonder of all is that friar jacques should be esteemed an excellent lithotomist merely upon account of his dress as if that were sufficient to give him more sure and unerring knowledge in physic and surgery than the most famous universities the reading good books the lessons of the best masters and a long practice can give to others  i doubt not but friar jacques devotion has gained him the confidence of many people for this is a ready way to lead people wherever we have a mind but i doubt very much if true devotion can be consistent with the visible prevarication which the exercise of surgery must engage him in if he be truly a monk or with the disguise he puts on if he is not  we have only now to examine if he has obtained all that he knows in surgery in a supernatural way as he gives it out himself now the surest means to judge of the nature of a cause is by the effects it produces if therefore friar jacques is directed and immediately inspired by god in all he undertakes he ought always to succeed and in that case he would certainly be the most excellent lithotomist in the world all that the others know they are very ready to own comes to them either from the instruction of their master or their own labor but as every body must now be convinced from what happened at both hospitals that friar jacques is less successful than they it is impossible to believe he is divinely inspired except it be by the evil principle of the manicheans  having thus enquired into the reasons of so many peoples being prejudiced in favor of friar jacques i leave every body to judge if these prejudices be well founded or ought not rather to be looked upon as proofs of the ignorance and unskilfulness of this religious lithotomist  as for the proposals he makes in the public gazettes to teach all surgeons his method gratis it is the magistrates business to hinder these offers from being accepted because as his method is pernicious it ought rather to be abolished than perpetuated whatever he may pretend that he has corrected his first method that he has made good use of the advices given him in the hospitals of paris and that he now uses the same instruments with the other lithotomists for all who are judges must know that in order to make him a good operator   he ought to retain nothing which makes his method differ from the common which is certainly much better   he ought to lay aside a great deal of his forwardness in operating because to that is owing the temerity with which he thrusts in his instruments to places which he knows nothing of from whence irreparable disorders ensue   he ought to lay aside the opinion he has of himself of being the best lithotomist in the kingdom than which nothing can be more false both because his method is bad and because he knows nothing of the parts concerned or to be shunned in the operation neither has he any tincture of surgery to enable him to remedy the accidents which may befall his patients while he retains this presumption of his own skill it will be in vain to think of his making any progress in the art he professes   he ought to cut for five or six years in the hospitals under able masters who might direct him in his operations tell him of his faults and explain the consequences of them for it is in this manner that all the great lithotomists in france have been formed whereas friar jacques while he continues to be fond of his own bad method intrepid in his ignorance obstinate in his operations and presumptuous to excess will never rise above the level of a quack and a vagabond  dionis has made a great many remarks on friar jacques methods of cutting males but none of them are new and therefore it will be sufficient to sat down here the conclusion he draws from the whole history of them though i do not approve of friar jacques way of cutting says he yet i do not absolutely condemn it for there is something good in his method and i am persuaded that a surgeon who is a good anatomist knows how to guide his instrument and is so far master of it as to carry it where he pleases may succeed in the practice of friar jacques operation by reason that he would avoid all those pernicious accidents which attended his performance but it would be to expose the patient to too great dangers to cause him to be cut by that monk who being wholly ignorant of the parts to be cut his bold assurance in thrusting in his poynard proceeds only from the want of a sufficient stock of knowledge to foresee the consequences     this judgment of dionis is very different from that given by merry merry pretends to prove from the nature of the method itself that it ought to be quite laid aside as well as from the character of the monk that he in particular ought never to use it dionis on the contrary is of opinion that the inconveniences that were found to attend it were owing more to the operator than to the nature of the operation though at the same time it must be owned that take all his words together they amount to no more than this friar jacques operation may be practiced with success by those who are able to avoid whatever the want of success in it is owing to  mr cheselden by supposing that friar jacques operation was the same with raus and that rau practiced his with great success declares sufficiently what was his opinion of it notwithstanding all the inconveniences which he had just before mentioned from dionis these therefore he must have looked upon to be all owing to the operator and thus his judgment will coincide with that of dionis with this difference only that his he reckons to be confirmed by matter of fact which the other does not pretend to     albinus conformably to the description we have heard from him of friar jacques method has given us his opinion of it in these words this way of cutting says he could not well be more dangerous than either the making an incision into the neck of the bladder or into the urethra and as by this means both these remained untouched and altogether free from the bad consequences which usually attended the thrusting in of instruments the violent dilatations and the extracting of large rugged stones in a most cruel manner through such narrow passages this method seemed highly preferable to all the rest but on the other hand as this part of the bladder lies altogether hid it was a very difficult matter to get at it yet when this operation was rightly performed no part lay in the way of consequence enough to hinder the success of it  the danger and difficulty of it consisted both in the thickness of the parts to be cut through and the nearness of some noble viscera which were by all means to be avoided for if either the surgeon should happen to thrust his knife too far in or too much to one side he runs the risque of cutting the opposite part of the bladder of hurting the intestinum rectum and vesiculae seminales of wounding or cutting quite through the ureter erector penis corpus cavernosum majus the urethra it self and of other such melancholy accidents  likewise after the wound is made it is an easy matter to mistake in introducing the forceps by thrusting it not into the bladder but amongst some other parts which it ought to have passed by and thus open and dilate them and pull out whatever came in its way which would not only frustrate the design of the operation but bring on many other inconveniences such accidents we have both heard and read to have happened to friar jacques who neither knew the structure of the parts nor had any certain method of guiding his knife or forceps which last mr rau looked upon to be the only defect of his operation  wherefore we are so far from commending friar jacques method of cutting that we are not afraid to assert the practice of it to be highly pernicious and destructive to mankind and had it not served as a hint to lead rau to the discovery of the best of all methods it had better never have been heard of     chap iv friar jaques method of cutting females we have already mentioned in several places that friar jacques cut women as well as men but we have delayed till now to give an account wherein these two operations differed and the judgment that has been made of this part of his method  mr bussieres friend tells us upon this head that friar jacques cutteth women upon the staff and in the same place as men he did perform this operation continues he in my presence upon three one whereof was a girl of eleven years old which makes me believe that he uses the same way in all though in them he did cut the internal neck of the uterus his opinion therefore is that this way of cutting is not so sure in women no more than in men as the ancient way  mr bussiere subscribes to his correspondents judgment though i have not tried this way upon women says he yet i cannot approve it at all since one cannot avoid cutting the neck of the uterus the cicatrix of which might prove to be of some ill consequence in case the woman should come to be with child     one of the three experiments which monsieur merry saw friar jacques make upon dead bodies was upon that of a woman and he has given us a particular account of his method of operating the incision he says was made on the right side near the protuberance of the ischium the same staff he used for men being first introduced into the bladder it was about an inch and an half long and by measuring the situation of it by the means of cross lines he found that the lower part of it answered to the anus the upper to the external orifice of the uterus and the middle of it to the raphe the inward progress of it was in this manner after having passed about an inch and an half of fat it went in betwixt the levator any and the accelerator of the clitoris cutting this muscle at its origin and from thence pierced the vagina quite through beginning at the backside of it and thus reached the body of the bladder which it wounded lengthways from the beginning of the urethra to the insertion of the ureters but without touching either of them the incision in the vagina and in the bladder were each of them an inch long  though merry was at this time as much prejudiced in favor of friar jacques as he was afterward against him yet his method of cutting women disgusted him from the very first moment he saw this experiment this appears from the reflections which he subjoins to his description of it if we judge says he of friar jacques way of operating upon women by the structure of the parts and by the incision which he makes in the vagina and body of the bladder i cannot believe th the stone can be extracted in them with the same ease and advantages as in men if he always follows the same methods in both as i have hitherto seen him i mean if he begins his incision on the inside of the ischium for if we consider that the urethra in women is but six lines in length beyond the os pubis that the cavity is but a line and an half in diameter and that it lies along the middle of the fore part of the vagina which is two inches broad it will be easy to conceive that whatever care friar jacques takes to put the vagina out of his way and not to wound it it will be very difficult for him to shun it and almost impossible to get into the bladder by the urethra in the way he takes since it is so very short and lies so close to the vagina since therefore the stone cannot be extracted by this method without cutting the body of the bladder i cannot believe it less dangerous than the common way of drawing the stone through the urethra as an incontinency of urine most commonly happens in this way so in that used by friar jacques a fistula of the bladder into the vagina appears to me inevitable which is at least as great an inconveniency since the urine flows equally involuntarily here  0  the living bodies which friar jacques afterward cut were but too evident proofs of the truth of the reflections monsieur merry here makes the first of these was madam de lorrain he began the incision two inches higher than he did upon the dead body and pierced the vagina quite through as appeared by the quantity of blood which run out of it what other accidents followed upon this operation monsieur merry has not told us but we may judge what they were by the observations which he made on other subjects     on the   th of may following says he friar jacques cut two girls at the hotel dieu one upon the staff and the other upon the gripe the youngest was but four years of age and went out of the hospital the   th of june the outward wound being cured but she continued to be troubled with an incontinency of urine the other was fourteen years old and went out the   th of the same month in the same state with the other just as she was to leave the hospical i was sent for to examine the cause of her incontinency of urine and i found that it came partly through the urethra and partly through the vagina another surgeon that was there injected barley water through the urethra into the bladder which presently flowed out at the vagina by which we discovered that though the exterior wound all the way to the vagina was healed the other incision from the vagina to the bladder was still open     now besides the incontinency of urine which attends this accident there are other consequences no less terrible that must follow upon it especially if we take in the danger there is in this method of falling into many of the same inconveniences which have been already observed in men women must by this means be rendered for ever barren since the continual flux of urine into the bladder must necessarily hinder the action of the semen and as the rectum may likewise be pierced the gross excrements may come out the same way at the same time from these and such like observations drawn partly from experiments and partly from the analogy of the structure of the parts to be cut in both sexes monsieur merry concludes that friar jacques way of cutting women ought upon no account whatever to be put in practice     of the eight patients which friar jacques cut at orleans one was a girl between ten and twelve years of age but she died the fourth day after the operation and monsieur noel in the forementioned letter to merry has given us the following relation of it friar jacques set her upon the knees of a surgeons servant and made two others hold her thighs he began by making a violent pressure upon the hypogastrium with his fingers half bent as if he had a mind to bring the bottom of the bladder nearer its neck then he introduced a silver catheter into the bladder and pulled it out again as soon as he had drawn off the urine contained in it afterward he put his two fingers into the rectum to command the stone and so made his incision in the ordinary place only a little higher and directing his knife toward the stone he cut the bladder this being done he made several motions in the wound sometimes with his forceps sometimes with his scoop pressing anew upon the hypogastrium to bring down the stone but all to no purpose so that at length he was obliged to thrust his fingers a second time into the anus and to use his knife once more in order either to make a new incision or enlarge the former thus by keeping the stone well down with his fingers after two or three efforts he at length extracted it with his forceps  the operation was no sooner over but the patient began to be tormented with pains in her belly fever and vomiting which never left her till she died upon opening her body we plainly discerned that the incision had been made in the middle and membraneous part of the bladder that it was transverse and a little oblique with three angles observable in it occasioned by his having cut several times the bladder and all the parts near it were filled with pus and in many of them there were abscesses formed the lower parts of the abdomen such as the pyramidal muscles and the extremities of the recti were very much bruised livid and tending to a gangrene though there was no blackness nor swelling to be seen upon the skin     we are told by dionis that one of the four patients which friar jacques cut in the charity of versailles was a girl of seven years of age who died three days after the operation dionis opened her in presence of monsieur felix one of friar jacques patrons and found the bladder wounded in the body near the neck in the vagina there was a wound of the length of a nail made by the edge of the knife in thrusting it along that part to come at the bladder on this occasion friar jacques said that the wounds of the vagina are of no consequence and that he frequently happened to pierce it     dionis saw him cut two women more and in both the same accidents happened as appeared by the blood which came out at the vagina as soon as the incision was made and he observes further that the same thing fell out in almost all the women he cut

the stone is very far from being to their advantage the most favorable thing that has been said of them by any body who was in a condition to judge of their true merit is that it is possible they may succeed when performed by a skilful hand and that some few cases may happen in which they may perhaps be preferable to the ancient methods but monsieur merry who has been at more pains to examine them than all the other authors put together declares himself altogether against the practice of them in any case not only on account of the bad success they were attended with in the hands of that ignorant inconsiderate monk but also by comparing the structure of the parts concerned with the nature of the operation itself and from thence deducing the many grievous accidents with which the practice of them will most commonly if not always be attended  all this however is to be understood of these operations taken by the lump for when they are pulled to pieces monsieur merry even in the midst of all his declamations against them cannot help seeing some parts of them which he thinks preferable to what answered to these in the former methods of operating it was natural for a thinking man to endeavor to bring such valuable parts into practice by joining to them either from his own invention or what was already in use whatever he judged proper to complete this whole operation of extracting the stone freed from all the disadvantages which friar jacques methods taken all together seemed to him to labor under  this is the general view which not only monsieur merry but all the other improvers of them proposed to themselves in their improvements what these have been and by whom made i now go on to relate that is to explain such methods of cutting for the stone as differ from and were posteriour to those of friar jacques but to the discovery of which the authors of them have been led by hints taken from what they observed in his  of these improvements the first that i hear of were made by monsieur merry but before i proceed to them it will be necessary to say something concerning this great mans life by abridging the eloge which the elegant monsieur fontenelle has given us of him in the memoirs of the academy of sciences for the year      printed in       john merry was born at vatan in the province of berry the  th day of january      his father was a surgeon and after having sent his son for some time to school finding that whether for want of inclination or by the fault of his masters his genius was not turned to letters he resolved to bring him up to his own business  at eighteen years of age he went to paris to improve himself in the hotel dieu the best school in the world for young surgeons there not satisfied with the exercises of the day he used as often as he had an opportunity to convey a body out of the hospital to his lodging and hide it in his bed till he had time to dissect it  in      he drew up a description of the ear at the desire of monsieur lay doctor of physic to be inserted in the second edition of his book de lae sensitive it was in that year likewise that he was made surgeon to the queen  in      monsieur louvoy then first minister of state appointed him surgeon major to the hospital of the invalides  the year after the king of porlugal having desited that a paristan surgeon might be sent him his queen being indisposed monsieur merry was pitched upon as the properest person to execute that commission the queen was dead before he reached lisbon but by the other extraordinary cures which he performed during his stay there he gained the esteem of the portugueze so much that they made him most advantageous offers in case he would resolve to settle among them he had like proposals made to him in spain through which he passed but he chose to accept neither of them but to return to his own country which he did timely enough in that same year to be admitted a member of the royal academy of sciences by the recommendation of monsieur de louvois and to be appointed surgeon to the duke of burgundy then a child whom he accompanied in a journey the court made to chambort a royal palace near blois  in      he was sent by the court on a secret commission to england and indeed it always remained so for to this day no body can tell what he went about  in   00 he arrived at the height of his ambition being named by monsieur harlay first president of paris to be first surgeon of the hotel dieu the functions of that post together with his place in the academy took up his whole time no considerations but friendship could ever persuade him after that to practice in the city or teach anatomy to any but his pupils in the hospital and it was by his means that the anatomical theater was erected there  his great talent lay in the exactness of his observations he thought it sufficient for his purpose to see things precisely as they existed in nature without being often at pains to build systems upon the phenomenon he had discovered when he ventured so far as that he was convinced it was upon very sure grounds and therefore was very stiff in maintaining his own opinions his hypothesis concerning the circulation of the blood in a foetus was an instance of this and his defense thereof against the numerous attacks that were made upon it together with his observations on the methods of cutting practiced by friar jacques a francomtois make up the only book he ever published there are a great many papers of his amongst the memoirs of the academy and he left behind him a vast number of valuable preparations of the parts both of men and other animals  he applied himself much to the knowledge of the blood vessels and nerves but used to give it to his friends as an instance of the imperfection of human knowledge that the nature and actions of the fluids contained in them had not been discovered anatomists he told them might be compared to porters who know all the streets and corners of a town but are entirely ignorant of what passes within doors  they who conversed much with him attribute to him several discoveries which pass under other peoples names of which the glands ascribed to mr cowper are one instance  he died on the third day of november      in the   th year of his age leaving six children behind him  it appears from the reflections monsieur merry has given us on friar jacques operations that he had seen but very few of them before he began to think of carrying them to a greater perfection it would be to no purpose however to trace all the observations which lie scattered up and down his book to this purpose he having saved us that trouble himself by bringing them all under one view in the last chapter of that treatise in which we may se distinctly first by what steps he was led to the improvemnts he has made wherein they consist and lastly what are the advantages that he thinks may be expected from them  as to the first of these he acquaints us that since the principal disorders which appeared in the dead bodies of such persons as had been cut upon the staff by friar jacques and which he had opened proceeded only from this that his staff being solid and round it was impossible for him with all the steddiness of hand he was master of to guide the point of his knife upon the unequal part of it so surely as not to miss it upon most occasions one would be apt to think that in order to rectify his operation and evite all the dismal accidents that attended it nothing should be requisite but to make use of a furrowed catheter and to adjust the length of it so exactly as not to run the risque of piercing the bottom of the bladder as he frequently did  but if we consider further says our author that the only cases in which friar jacques extracts the stone with more facility than the other lithotomists are when he cuts both the neck and body of the bladder which is the most astonishing part of his operations and was the chief thing that procured him the liberty of cutting in the two hospitals and if we consider on the other hand that the wounding of these parts is the evident cause of the incontinency of urine and fistulas with which the most part of those who survived his operations were afflicted when these two things are attended to i say we will see that the improvements i have mentioned are not sufficient but that it is moreover absolutely necessary to abstain from cutting the neck and body of the bladder  again if we reflect that the reason why friar jacques ever wounds the rectum is only because he begins his incision too low down and that the opening of the nerves and blood vessels from whence proceeded the hemorrhages abscesses and convulsions which carried off so many of his patients happened by thrusting his knife too far forward we must conclude that it would be a much surer way to begin the incision in the urethra and end it at the beginning of the neck of the bladder  al eutree du col de la vessie which is very often dilated by the stone which the contraction of the fibers of the body of the bladder has forced into the cavity of it  and therefore it is that i am inclined to think that the greatest difficulty which the most expert lithotomists find in extracting a stone proceeds more seldom from the neck of the bladder than from the urethra because as they cut the urethra on the foreside of the  au devant of the ossa pubis and the neck of the bladder lying behind these bones there remains at least an inch of the urethra under that angle formed by their union which is not cut and through which the stone must pass that is by a way which is narrower than the neck of the bladder it is this therefore which must cause the difficulty  upon these principles our authors improvements are founded wherein they consist he goes on to explain in the following manner  in order to rectify the ancient operation end that of friar jacques likewise and evite the accidents which either accompany or follow them i believe it would be proper the patient first being placed and tied in the ordinary manner to begin by thrusting a furrowed catheter into the bladder with the right hand then to hold it with the left and turn that end of it toward the right groin that the concave part being directed to the inside of the left os pubis the groove may lie a little obliquely afterward taking in the right hand a crooked bistoury well fixed in the handle between three and four inches long three lines broad or thereabout the edge on the unequal side and ending in a very sharp pointed stilet about an inch in length thrust it directly into that part of the groove which lies in the angle made by the junction of the osia pubis conduct the stilet all the way into the neck of the bladder  conduire le stilet du bistouri dans le col de la vessie the point of it being kept firm in the groove of the catheter then lowering the hand make the incision down from the neck of the bladder along the inside of the os pubis all the way to the protuberance of the ischium the incision being made introduce the conductors or gorgeret and forceps in the ordinary manner  the leipsk journalists have rendered this passage of monsieur merry conduire le stilet du bistouri dans le col de la vessie pars aculeata scalpelli usque in vesicae collum adigenda by which it is plain they conceived that the neck of the bladder was to be pierced by the stilet it being in that sense only that there could be any force required which is implied in the word adigere but this is very fat from being the authors meaning the principal part of his improvement consists in leaving the neck of the bladder untouched and by conducting the stilet into the neck of the bladder he understands no more than that as soon as the stilet was in the groove of the staff the operator should run it along that all the way into the canal or cavity of the neck of the bladder which in collum veficae adigere can never be imagined to express  the patient must be made to lie upon the right side because by this means the urine not having so easy a descent toward the wound will more readily be directed into its former channel which will very much facilitate the reunion of the divided parts and the common practice of binding the patients thighs near the knees must not be omitted  in this manner according to monsieur merry may the operation for the stone be improved and the benefit which will result therefrom he thinks will be very considerable for first the stone may be extracted with as much facility as in friar jacques method without any danger of the accidents which attend it likewise the greatest part of those inconveniences which accompany the common operation will be evited because the urethra will be cut all the way to the neck of the bladder without touching the muscles of the penis or wounding any part of the scrotum which is most commonly attended with fluxions inflammations and gangreen lastly by following this method we shall never be under any necessity of cutting upon the gripe either men or children except when the stone is got into the urethra and sticks out in the perinaeum and in that case the common way of performing this operation suffers no difficulty    this is the account that monsieur merry has given us of his own method of cutting males in order to extract the stone whether ever he put it in practice or not is uncertain but if we will be at pains to compare it with marianuss operation and that of friar jacques both together it will be found that what is new in it is only the place in which he makes his incision and the figure of his knife and if we compare it with each of these methods by themselves it will deserve rather to be called an improvement of that of marianus than of friar jacques for properly speaking it was the place in which he observed this last to make his incision that led him to alter the place where marianuss followers make theirs and pitch upon a new one equally different from both the other parts of monsieur merys operation he has no manner of title to but still since the merit of an invention is only to be determined by its usefulness did this small improvement rid his operation of the inconveniences which the others are liable to he might justly claim the same share of acknowledgment from mankind as if he had invented a method entirely new  monsieur merry had no sooner seen friar jacques make an experiment of his method upon the dead body of a woman but he thought of rectifying that part of his operation likewise for having made the reflections which have been already mentioned concerning the inconveniences of it he adds that if it should appear from experience that his conjectures about these inconveniences were ill grounded and that both the wounds of the vagina and body of the bladder are easily cured he has a way to propose for cutting of women which must still be preferable to that of the monk his method is this let a furrowed catheter such as is commonly used for men be introduced into the bladder and with the unequal part of it press down to the entry of the external orifice of the uterus a lentree de lorifice externe de la matrice that part of the vagina which lies under the extremity of the body of the bladder and the beginning of the urethra which is joined to it then cut that part of the vagina upon the groove of the staff and thus it will be easy to get into the bladder without hurting the urethra if the incision is made but a very little way up in the vagina  by this method the stone may be extracted out of the bladder of a woman with the same advantages that friar jacques does it in men because as it must pass through the vagina it will pass out at the broadest part of the angle which is formed by the union of the ossa pubis  it may likewise be made use of in young girls and is undoubtedly more sure and less painful than that used by friar jacques the wound made in the vagina needs not be above two lines deep whereas in his method there must be several incisions which taken all together are at least three inches deep for he not only pierces the vagina twice but the wound he makes from the buttocks into it is altogether unnecessary  this method seems moreover to be better than that of drawing the stone through the urethra because as both that and the sphincter of the bladder remain untouched there is no danger of an incontinency of urine which most commonly follows the other    the suppositions upon which monsieur merry builds the advantages of this new method of cutting women are we see that wounds in the vagina and in the body of the bladder may be cured but though upon the trials he afterward made on dead bodies he was fully satisfied how easily it might be put in practice yet the observations he had occasion to make of such as had been cut by friar jacques convinced him at length that these suppositions were false and consequently that this method however improved was altogether to be rejected this he testifies in the following words as for friar jacques way of cutting women and young girls since there remains always a fistula from the bladder into the vagina it is evident that neither that nor the method in which i proposed it to be amended ought ever to be put in practice there is no other way left but to draw the stone through the urethra and though an incontinency of urine should remain it does not make them incapable of conceiving which is very much to be feared from that which proceed from a fistula    before i take leave of monsieur merry i cannot forbear remarking that something very like the way he here proposed for cutting of women is mentioned by monsieur bussiere but as that author had put it in practice before friar jacques operations were known to him it cannot be called an improvement of these and therefore i did not take notice of it in that place which as being published before that of monsieur merry it would otherwise have deserved  in women says mr bussiere when the stone is but indifferent big the old way is preferable to any other but if it was very big then i had rather thrust my finger into the vegina and bring the stone as near the neck of the bladder as can be and cut the membranes of the vagina and bladder upon the stone i did cut a woman in hambourgh by that way of which i drew a stone weighing five ounces and an half who did recover very well by this way we did prevent the incontinency of urine which follows always the extraction of great stones in women    references   merry a p    ad  0   ib p  0   ib p  0   phil trans      p  0  chap vi professor rau s method the next improvement of friar jacques operation for the stone was made by mr rau in holland but before i lay before the reader wherein it consisted i think it necessary to make him a little acquainted with that great mans life by a short abridgment of the elegant and faithful account which the learned professor albinus has lately published of it  john james rau was born at baden a small town in the circle of suabia in the year      his father was a wine merchant and in such indifferent circumstances that he was obliged as the best provision he could make for his son to bind him apprentice to a surgeon in strasburg before he was full fourteen years of age there he remained three years and in that time thinking he knew enough of his business to gain his living in any part of the world he resolved to bid adieu to his own country and try his fortune somewhere else after he had traveled through some part of germany he went to hamburgh from thence to norway where he lived at bergen with mr franen the surgeon and soon after to amsterdam being unable to endure the rigorous cold of that climate at amsterdam he had the good luck to get to be surgeon of a man of war in which he went to spain and other countries and upon his return to holland he went on board the vice admiral of that fleet which brought king william to england  during his service at sea he found means to save as much money as enabled him to go to leyden and there study physic for some time after which he went to paris to improve himself in anatomy and surgery under du verney merry marshall roumart old petit and others in      he returned to leyden and there took his degree of doctor of physic being then but twentysix years of age  being by this time weary of a wandering course of life he resolved to settle at amsterdam and to teach anatomy and practice physic and surgery he remained there something more than eighteen years but two of them were not past before he had already acquired so great a reputation in anatomy that the magistrates of that city appointed him to dissect in the public theater he was likewise so successful in the practice of surgery that he was sent for all over holland by those who needed his assistance and for the sake of no operation so much as that of cutting for the stone which he performed upon above sixteen hundred people with the greatest applause and equal success  in   0  he was sent for to leyden to give some public lessons of anatomy and in      he was made professor of physic anatomy and surgery in that famous university upon the death of doctor bidloo while he remained in health he was extremely diligent in discharging the functions of that honorable profession but his health abandoned him above four years before his death which happened in a very lamentable manner on the   th day of september      in the fifty first year of his age  besides the anatomical treasure which he bequeathed to this university and of which we are obliged for a very ample and methodical account to the author of his life he left the world his oration de methodo anatomen docendi and discendi pronounced on the day of his reception as professor at leyden a latin letter de inventoribus septi scroti and a defense of it against dr ruysch together with several improvements both in anatomy and surgery the chief of which may be justly reckoned the discoveries he has made of the true method of cutting for the stone  as for d rs character i cannot give it better than in the words f his elegant historian fuit corpore magno and robusto says albinus gregiaque and virili plane forma vultu severo and torva nonnihil tuente fuit animo generoso and alacri

tulerit rmati and fagi imus  thus far concerning the life of our famous lithotomist we go on now to the same albinuss account of his lithotomy  amongst the other parts of surgery which rau had learned at paris the operation for the stone by what is called the great apparatus was one and it is certain that for some time after he fixed at amsterdam he practiced it in that manner himself but upon seeing friar jacques cut in holland and having examined the bodies of many such as died in that monks hands he from that time changed his method of cutting in the manner which we are now to explain  several accounts have been published and many more handed about concerning this method of professor rau but all of them trifling false and imperfect and had not the learned d albinus who has often seen rau cut and is a perfect judge of these matters thought it worth his while to oblige the world with an accurate and particular relation of all the seeps of his operation we must have despaired of ever having a true knowledge of it  i shall trouble the reader but with two of these accounts both of them printed the first by a saxon physician and the other of which something has already been said by mr cheselden  we are told by the physician that in his travels through england and holland he arrived on a certain time at amsterdam and being there resolved to attend dr raus courses of anatomy and surgery amongst other curiosities he saw there one was the operation for the stone performed by him  the  th day of february   0  says the traveller i and mr wickham went with our master rau to cromenic a village near harlem where a boy was to be cut which was done in the presence of two surgeons and burghers of the said town after the body was disposed in a proper posture with his arms bound and his posteriours laid higher than his head and his feet so tied that the part to be cut could not be moved mr rau kneeling with one knee upon the table sets himself directly before the patient thrusting in a common catheter moistened with oil into the yard at last meeting with the stone he withdraws that and puts in another catheter so deep that he might feel it upon the perinaeum with his fingers then he makes an incision in the left side of the perinaeum four fingers breadth from the tuberosity of the os ischium or huckle bone and a fingers breadth from the anus which place of incision the catheter depresses toward the perinaeum his incision knife was guarded a thumbs breadth looking like a common launcet which was not laid above the length of the first joint of the finger first he cut the skin and then making an incision through the fat and the muscles he applied his itinerary after which he penetrated the neck of the bladder then putting in the penknife into the wound holding it strongly with his hand he delivered it to me but in the mean time snatched up his forceps and drawing out his penknife he thrust it in betwixt the itinerary and conductor dilating the lips of the wound by those two said instruments by which means he happily drew our the stone when it was extracted it was of the size of a little hens egg moistened with blood and on one side surrounded with a small little membrane where perhaps it had an adhesion to the side of the bladder it was almost of a round figure and uneven like a large sand or gretty stone cleansing the wound with a sponge he applied nothing but a little lint and so binding up the patient he put him to bed placing under his buttocks some oatmeal to receive the urine that would run from the wound and the faeces upon occasion he ordered the curtains of the bed to be drawn close that the light might not disturb the patients rest to compose whom he ordered an anodyne emulsion to be drunk ad libitum after the operation and the sick being just laid upon the bed he cried out of exquisite pains in the glans of the yard when the stone was taken away which happens by consent in all which the membrane of the urethra has with the inward membrane of the bladder  on the  th of march i saw another lithotomy or operation for the stone performed by my master on a jewish boy of seven years old in which besides what i have already told you nothing particular happened except the falling down of the intestinum rectum occasioned by the cries of the patient which lubricating with oil he put up again with his fingers least it should hinder him in his operation  by comparing this account of raus operation with that which is given by albinus it will be very easy to see how full it is of mistakes that is how much it is of apiece with all the rest of this authors book  mr cheselden makes raus method to be the same with that of friar jacquesfor after transcribing some few things from dionis about that he tells us that the late mr rau professor of anatomy at leyden performed it afterward in holland cutting exactly between the entrance of the ureters and with great success  it is not a little surprising how mr cheselden who is so perfectly well acquainted with the true structure of these parts of the body came to let himself be so grossly imposed upon by the person that gave him this account of raus operation which the least reflection must have convinced him to be false and impossible as shall be presently shown what he has added is i believe very just at least it deserves the attention of all such as shall ever undertake the practice of mr raus operation in my opinion says he this way of cutting exceeds the two former that is the greater and lesser apparatus and would be yet better if the bladder was filled with water before the operation  these and many other such as these accounts have been given of mr raus method of cutting for the stone and i have only set down two samples of them to show what need there was of a more exact and complete explanation of an operation which the success wherewith it was attended must recommend to our most serious thoughts this the ingenious dr albinus has fully executed in the manner which we now proceed to show  after having explained the method of cutting used by friar jacques and given his opinion of it which as we have already seen he concludes with this observation that it had better never have been heard of had it not served as a hint to lead rau to the discovery of his he goes on to inform us that rau having fully examined the structure and situation of these parts which are either to be cut or shunned in this operation discovered the only defect of friar jacques method to be the want of some way whereby the instruments might be safely and securely directed toward the proper place of the bladder this he also found out and used it with the greatest success it cannot therefore be denied but that friar jacques showed rau the way for this however he ought always to be praised and valued that by his own skill and industry he made that addition to the operation by which alone it is rendered sure and safe and preferable to all that have hitherto been invented whereas before it was dangerous uncertain and oftentimes fatal  his addition consisted in a catheter furrowed or grooved on the unequal side which he thrust through the urethra into the bladder that unequal side pressing against the part of it which was to be cut so as to be felt without and by this means serving to direct him in making the wound in the skin in thrusting in the knife so as to cut the bladder upon it and in introducing the other instruments which guide the forceps strait into the wound as was practiced in the great apparatus  but as the common catheters made use of by those who cut the urethra in the perinaeum are for the most part too little bent to be able to press sufficiently against the proper place of the bladder he invented a new one different from the others first in that where the crooked part and consequently the groove begins the curvature was greater and also in that the rostrum or beek at the other extremity of the crooked part was straiter and longer that the knife might be at more liberty to un both ways upon it and so make a large wound in the bladder the comparison of the structure of these parts in the humane body with what was to be done in the operation seem to have led him to these things  he placed the patient tied him and ordered him to be held almost in the fame manner as they who cut the urethra in the perinaeum except that he laid him upon his back on a low table in such a manner as that his back was lower than his buttocks for the more convenient situation of the part to be cut  then he kneeled down before the patient upon his right knee his left leg being erect and making an acute angle with the thigh the better to support his body  next laying hold of the penis with his left hand with his right he thrust the catheter artfully into the bladder  then taking the handle of the catheter between the fingers and thumb of his left hand he turned it gently and warily toward the patients belly and right groin that the furrowed unequal side thereof might be applied to that part that was to be cut that is as has been already said to the left side near the neck and something toward the lower and back part  this being done he pressed the catheter gently toward that part and at the same time put his right thumb upon the soft place of the buttocks on the left side of the anus between that and the great protuberance of the os ischium upon which we sit just opposite to the unequal part of the catheter  then pressing the catheter gently toward his right thumb and at the same time his right thumb toward the catheter from the left and lower parts to the right and upwards he discovered and marked the exact place on the outside which was opposite to the unequal part of the catheter for there the incision was to be begun  this place was on the left side of the anus about an inch or two fingers breadth from that toward the protuberance of the ischium he chose it no nearer the anus for fear of hurting the intestinum rectum and no further from it that he might not be obliged to thrust the knife too obliquely toward the catheter however according to the difference of age and stature structure and largeness of these parts he cut the skin sometimes nearer the anus sometimes farther from it and sometimes a little higher or lower but the unequal pare of the catheter which pressed upon the bladder always directed him to the place  this being discovered he began by cutting through the skin and a small part of the fat he made the wound strait and long from above downwards and a little inclined outward toward the protuberance of the ischium to keep farther from the intestinum rectum about this first incision however he was not very sollicitous  as soon as it was made he thrust into it that part of his right thumb or forefinger which is opposite to the nail to feel the staff which he kept with his left hand applied to that part of the bladder which he was to cut with all possible steddiness  when he had found the staff he pulled back his thumb and thrust the point of his knife immediately into the wound not very deep at first and directing it with all the caution he could toward the staff he cut gently all that came in his way and for fear of wounding the intestinum rectum he most commonly first thrust his finger into the anus to examine the situation of it precisely that so he might be able to shun it with the greater certainty  when by these gentle steps his knife had got almost to the bladder he thrust his thumb or forefinger again into the wound to feel for the catheter as before to replace it if by any motion of the patient it had changed its situation and also to remind himself of the position of the unequal part of it upon which he was immediately to cut the bladder  in doing this he used more caution and circumspection than before he first begged of the assistants not to let the patient move any part especially his buttocks and of the patient himself to keep as quiet as possible then holding the catheter fixed in its place with the left hand with the other he approached the knife toward it through the wound without making any further incision but only carefully directing the point this done he thrust it into the groove of the catheter with all the attention and wariness he was master of and it was easy for him to know when he was right by the point of his knife pressing upon the bottom of the groove and upon the sides of it when he moved it gently either way  then carrying the knife along the groove both upwards and downwards but mostly downwards and favoring the motions of it by the position of the catheter he made a pretty large wound in the bladder the situation of the staff made the incision incline a little from above outward and the security of the neighboring parts made it necessary it should do so  he continued to take care that the staff should not slip from the wound and with his fingers examined the largeness of it feeling at the same time for the naked catheter it he had any suspicion that it was out of its place for it was necessary that the groove should be close to the incision that he might with the more security thrust the male conductor into it  therefore having again desired the patient to lie still he took the male conductor into his right hand and pushed it carefully and steddily through the wound toward the catheter and after some few trials fixed it in the sulcus without any thing being intercepted between them which it was easy to judge both by the resistance and hardness of the staff  when he was assured of this he pushed the conductor with more force and thrust back the staff drawing the handle of it gently toward him at the same time  by this means the unequal part of it retired from the wound into the cavity of the bladder and the conductor remaining still in the sulcus was safely guided thither likewise and by moving it gently up and down he discovered either by its touching the naked staff or the stone that it was really in the cavity of the bladder where he wanted it to be  the other parts of this operation were performed as by the great apparatus for with his right hand he kept the male conductor in the bladder and with his left drew the catheter out through the urethra then he took the male conductor into his left hand and upon that directed the female into the bladder with his right afterward holding the two conductors at a sufficient distance with his left fingers he thrust the forceps between them into the bladder with his other hand and presently drew out the female conductor  then he felt with the forceps for the stone that he might be sure that instrument had not missed its way but was really within the bladder and afterward drew out his male conductor likewise  he used to open the forceps with a considerable force several times together both to dilate the wound and bladder and loosen it as much as he could from the stone  when this was done he searched for laid hold of and extracted the stone with the forceps with all the same precautions which they commonly do and always ought to use who perform this operation by cutting the urethra in the perinaeum  as soon as one stone was taken out he thrust other instruments into the bladder to discover if there were any more behind and with a proper scoop and very often with his forefinger he brought away any small bits of stones sand or clotted blood and then the patient was laid in a bed upon his back  he put neither tent plaster nor bandage upon the wound but kept it open for some days after the operation and in the mean time ordered the patient as much ptisane or weak emulsion as he could drink that the urine flowing first copiously into the bladder might wash it thoroughly and then running out at the wound might carry along with it the sand blood or whatever else might remain afterward he cured the wound as other fresh wounds usually are  with how great dexterity and in how short a time he always performed this operation there are innumerable witnesses to testify among whom i could name several persons of probity learning and character who are still alive how well and how successfully he operated the event afterward proved for the far greatest part not only survived the operation and did very well after it but recovered in an incredibly short time so perfectly as never to be afflicted with a fistula involuntarily flux of urine barrenness or any other accidents which so oftend attend those in whom the urinary passages have been cut  and though this method may seem more difficult to be put in practice upon women yet even these he cut the same way provided they were maids or had never had children neither are there instances wanting of his success among such as had  this excellent account has dr albinus given us of raus method of cutting for the stone in which he has omitted nothing that can any way contribute to its being fully understood if it is not that he has set down no observations made on the bodies of such as died before the wound was cured by which we should have had a more certain account of all the parts cut than is to be found in this relation at present  but now if we compare a little this method with all those that went before it it will be found to contain nothing of any consequence that can be called new except the extraordinary skill and dexterity of the operator and his cautious prudent and attentive manner of operating it is to these things only that is owing any difference to be observed in either his instruments or the several steps of his operation which differences deserve not so much to be called new inventions as the making the best use of what was already invented the principal thing wherein his way of cutting differs from that of marianus is in the place in which he makes his incision but this his historian owns to be the same with that where friar jacques made his though as i have sufficiently proved that monks design was to make it in another place again he differs from friar jacques methods in the instruments he uses and the manner of using them but all this he took from the great apparatus except the strait rostrum of his staff as merry had done before him though i do not think it at all probable that he had seen merys book before he had composed the theory of his own operation mr raus principal merit therefore consists in having made a judicious collection of the parts of several methods which were attended with the greatest advantages and least inconveniences and framing these into one regular operation which in his hands has been perhaps more successful than any hitherto discovered but whether it will continue so to be if brought into practice anew must be left to experience and time to determine  finis postscript in the beginning of the foregoing chapter i observed that though several accounts of professor raus operation for the stone have been published and many more handed about by those who pretend to have seen him cut yet they are all both imperfect and full of mistakes and that it is entirely owing to the learned and accurate dr albinus that this great mans method was not for ever lost to posterity  as soon as the doctors book was published at leyden he did me the honor amongst several of his ingenious friends here in london to send it me in a present and at the next meeting of the royal society i thought proper to lay before them an abstract in english of that part of it which relates to mr raus operation for the stone together with several preparations from which i demonstrated and described the parts concerned in it  these preparations i have had now a good many years by me they make part of a complete collection that i have made by which all the possible ways of getting in to the humane bladder in order to extract a stone may with the greatest clearness be illustrated and the advantages and inconveniences of each of them as far as these depend on the structure of the parts with the greatest certainty determined  of these ways i always reckoned that practiced by professor rau to be one long before i had heard any thing of his true method or even of that of friar jacques from which it is taken and indeed my preparations will serve to direct in every step of his operation and point out the parts that are either to be cut or avoided in it as fully as if i had had albinuss book before me when i went about them and i will venture to say that the examination of such preparations as these when fresh subjects cannot be had which every surgeon and anatomist must know is too often the case with us is the surest and easiest way to enable us to understand and make the right use of what has been written upon the subject of lithotomy which of late years has made so much noise in our phyisical world  but to return from this short digression if i may judge by the event what i then offered to the royal society was by many members of that honorable body thought no unsuitable entertainment for them for from that time several worthy physicians and surgeons having carefully read albinuss book and examined my preparations began to think seriously of introducing the practice of it amongst us and i most willingly embrace this opportunity of doing justice to the ingenious dr bamber and mr cheselden by declaring in a public manner what i had many opportunities of knowing having assisted at most of the experiments they made on dead bodies that as it was their turn to cut in the two great hospitals of this city the following season i beheld with the utmost pleasure the alacrity industry and application with which they soon made themselves masters each in the way that suited his genius best of the true method of performing an operation which they thought they had all the reasons that theory could furnish to prefer even to the high way of cutting which both of them had for a considerable time practiced with great success  on the  th day of last august dr bamber made the first trial of it on living bodies in st bartholomews hospital and since that time he has made several more in all these operations he has thought it proper to follow every step of mr raus method except that he filled the bladder moderately with water and therefore as his dexterity and skill in every operation he goes about are sufficiently known there remains no more to be said about them save only that as far as can be judged from the number he has cut his success is hitherto at least equal to that of mr rau  mr cheselden began to cut in st thomass hospital a few days after dr bamber but as he has thought fit to vary professor raus method considerably i must beg leave to insist a little more on his operation  i have already mentioned an account of raus method given by mr cheselden in the preface to his treatise on the high operation for the stone published      as he had received it from those who had been scholars to mr rau and several times present at his operations his informations were indeed very lame and imperfect but yet even from these he had conceived so favorable an idea of that method as to think it preferable either to that of celsus or marianus and withal that it would be still more so if the bladder was first filled with water  albinuss late treatise has as i have already remarked given this ingenious and most expert surgeon an opportunity of examining the whole matter with more clearness and certainty than he had done before and the fruit of the pains he has been at is not only to confirm him in his former favorable opinion of it but also to bring it to such a degree of perfection as in his judgment makes it preferable to all the methods of cutting that have ever been invented  now as mr cheseldens method must be reckoned an improvement of that first attempted by friar jacques a description of it such as a spectator is able to give does even upon that account very well deserve a place in the history i have ventured to write of the lateral operation for the stone and if in what i shall say about it i shall happen to mistake or omit any material circumstance i wish that may serve as an inducement to the happy improver to rectify and complete whatever is amiss or wanting in mine by obliging the public himself with a more accurate and full account of his own operation  the table upon which the patient is placed is highest at that end upon which his buttocks rest and by means of a pillow laid under him there and another under his head when he lies upon his back his belly is lower than any other part of his body  his buttocks are placed upon the edge of the table and his knees being separated from one another and bent as much as they can be conveniently his wrists and ancles are tied together and he is kept in that situation by three assistants one at each leg and a third at his head who presses with his two hands upon the patients shoulders to keep him from retiring backward from the operator  the patient being brought from his bed in a nightgown and situated in this manner the operator thrusts an hollow grooved steel catheter through the urethra into the bladder and with a syringe mounted with an oxs ureter injects as much warm water into it as the patient can bear without pain in the same manner as is done in the high operation into one patient of about eighteen years of age and who had a stone weighing six ounces and a quarter mr cheselden injected seven ounces of water but he thinks the quantity may always be determined by the complaints of the patient without observing any other rule  when the water is injected and secured from running out by tying round the penis a narrow slip of flannel he gives the end of the catheter to an intelligent assistant to hold whose principal care is to keep it from rising but not at all to direct the groove to the place where the incision is to be made for a reason that we shall hear presently  then the operator having feared himself upon a chair the height of which is suitable to that of the table on which the patient is laid takes a pointed knife with a unequal edge and beginning about an inch above the anus on the left side of the raphe between the accelerator urinae or as i name that muscle constrictor urethrae and the erector penis he makes an incision downwards by the side of the sphincter any a little obliquely outward as it descends from two and an half to four inches in length according to the age of the patient or size and structure of the parts this first incision he endeavors to make all at one stroke so as to cut through the skin fat and all or part of the levator ai which lies in his way  as soon as this is done he thrusts the forefinger of his  into the middle of the wound in order to press the intestinum rectum to one side that it may be in less danger of being cut and taking a crooked knife in his other hand with the edge on the concave side he thrusts the point of it through the wound close by his finger into the bladder between the vesicula seminalis and os ischium of the same side then lowering his hand he continues this second incision upwards till the point of his knife comes out at the upper part of the first  this incision being finished he thrusts the forefinger of his left hand through the wound into the cavity of the bladder and having flt it and secured the stone he introduces his forceps upon his finger and endeavors to lay fast hold of the stone with it then he pulls out his finger and taking the forceps in both hands he extracts the stone with greater or less facility according to the size thereof or largeness of the wound he has made  if there are more stones than one he feels for the rest with his finger then introduces his forceps and extracts them in the same manner  during the whole operation the catheter remains in the bladder and all that the assistant who holds it has to mind is as has been already said to keep it from rising by this means mr cheselden thinks the bladder is pressed down sufficiently to facilitate the entry of the forceps upon his finger without the use of any director and it being filled with water there is no occasion to cut upon a groove neither is there any danger of laying hold of the catheter with the forceps if due care is taken to manage that rightly after it is in the bladder  in this method of operating there are but one or two arterial branches cut from which there is any danger of an haemorrhagy and not always from them neither however if after the wound is well cleansed and washed with a wetted sponge any quantity of blood continues to run he ties the vessels immediately and then having applied pledgets of dry lint and other proper dressings the patient is afterward carried to bed   regular method of cutting and when  accident happens which it was impossible to be aware of before the operation he has been seldom above a minute sometimes less between the beginning of the first incision and extraction of the stone  there are circumstances however in which he finds it necessary to ary some steps of his method these as far as i have been witness to or can remember them are as follows  first when having laid hold of the stone with the forceps he finds by the force it takes to draw it out or other signs that it is very large rather than expose the patient to the danger and pain of a violent diaceration of the parts he chooses either with a pair of scissars if it is the upper part or his knife if the lower to enlarge the wound by an additional incision  secondly if after the second incision is made he finds by the finger which he endeavors to thrust into the bladder that the catheter has slipped into the wound which by the straining of the patient and other accidents sometimes happens then he withdraws his finger and instead thereof thrusts a gorgeret into the groove of the catheter upon which he introduces his forceps in the ordinary manner it is only with a view to this accident that he prefers a grooved catheter to one entirely round such as was used by friar jacques  thirdly when the assistant who holds the catheter gives him any ground to think that he his laid hold of that with the forceps instead of the stone which though he believes it will rarely happen yet is not impossible be orders it immediately to be pulled out and then endeavors to lay hold of and extract the stone without that convenience which the prssing down of the bladder would afford him if he should be obliged to introduce his forceps oftener than once  fourthly when by the smallness or situation of the stone he finds this method to be eaie or more sfe he thrusts his fingers into the anus and having pressed the stone toward the orifice of the wound he pulls it out with his other hand without using any forceps at all  lastly when he feels either by his finger or the resistance the stone makes to the force with which he strives to draw it out that there is any kind of constriction either of the ureters or membranes of the bladder about it he endeavors by thrusting his fingers into the anus or other proper methods to bring that part near the orifice of the wound and then with his knife he cuts these membranes which had formed the sphincter and thus the stone being disengaged is extracted with the greatest ease  as i have here described mr cheseldens new operation nearly in the same order that albinus has followed in that of mr rau it will be easy for the reader to perceive what additions or alterations are owing to him or in one word what improvements he has made so that it would be altogether superfluous to lengthen this postscript any further by comparing them together  mr cheselden has hitherto cut but seven patients this way that i know of and whoever has heard of the wonderful success which attended his practice of the high operation will have but little room to doubt of the happy event of his present method in which even these first trials have succeeded equally if not beyond whatever he could boast of in the former  to conclude were i not afraid of being thought to pass the bounds i prescribed to my self in this history of only relating and comparing facts together without interposing my own judgment i might add that in my opinion there is nothing wanting in mr cheseldens method of performing the lateral operation by which it can in any respect be improved except the use of crooked forceps upon some occasions for i have frequently observed at both hospitals that the stone is much more easily extracted when it lies on that side of the bladder in which the incision is made then when it lies on the other especially if the cavity to be observed there is of a preternatural depth or breadth as it sometimes happens therefore when this is the case i am of opinion that if the forceps were a little crooked the stone might with less difficulty be laid hold of than by the strait ones which have been hitherto used it is true that crooked forceps will be weaker than the others but the difference in strength would be more than compensated by the facility of charging the stone because in this rather than in the force necessary to extract it when laid hold of the inconveniency i am talking about seems to consist
