printed for edward and charles dilly in the poultry and t cadell in the strand  mdcclxxi  to george colman esquire dear sir when i inscribe this tragedy to you i mean to pay myself a very high compliment the utmost i could possibly say of you would by no means extend your reputation but it will do me much honor to declare that so celebrated a writer has distinguished clementina with the most essential attention and that so valuable a man has given me leave to sign myself what i truly am  dear sir his most faithful and most obliged humble servant the author  advertisement the author of this tragedy has printed several lines for the closet which in the representation were omitted for the sake of brevity  the chief business of this advertisement however is to acknowledge his obligations to the inimitable performance of mrs yates and to thank mr bensley mr savigny and mr wroughton for their great goodnature in undertaking their respective characters at the short notice of a week when mr ross unexpectedly returned the part of anselmo this circumstance obliged mr by who was cast for palermo to undertake mr savignys part which was originally granville  mr savigny taking anselmo and mr wroughton palermo  which had been in his possession above a fortnight and left it no more than barely possible for the utmost diligence of these gentlemen to exhibit a piece which the public have since been kindly pleased to honor with the most generous approbation  prologue by george colman esquire spoken by mr bensley in these our moral and religious days men dread the crying sin of writing plays while some whose wicked wit incurs the blame however they love the trespass fly the shame if a new holy war with vice to wage some preacher quits the pulpit for the stage the revrend bard with much remorse and fear attempts to give his eveninglecture here the work engendered to the world must rise but yet the father may elude our eyes the parish on this trick of youth might frown and thus unownd it is thrown upon the town at our directors door he lays the sin who sees the babe relents and takes it in to swathe and dress it first unstrings his purse then kindly puts it out to you  to nurse should some young counsel through his luckless star by writing plays turn truant to the bar called up by you to this high court of wit with non inventus we return the writ no latitat can force him to appear whose failure and success cause equal fear whatever fees his clients here bestow he loses double in the courts below grave solemn doctors whose prescribing pen has in the trade of death killed many men with venurous quill here tremblingly engage to slay kings queens and heroes on the stage the great if great men write of shame afraid come forth incog  and beaux in masquerade some demireps in wit of doubtful fame though known to all the town withhold their name thus each by turns ungratefully refuse to own the favors of their ladymuse wooed by the court the college bar and church court bar church college leave her in the lurch it is yours tonight the work alone to scan arraign the bard regardless of the man if dullness waves her poppies over his play to critic fury let it fall a prey but if his art the tears of pity draws ask not his name  but crown him with applause  dramatis personae anselmo mr savigny granville mr bensley palermo mr wroughton adorno mr gardner clementina mrs yates elizara miss pearce citizens guards etc  scene venice  time  the time of representation  clementina a tragedy act i an apartment in anselmos palace enter clementina and elizara clementina distraction here so soon  elizara this very hour  your good your noble yet misguided father this moment chilled me with the hated tale then seizing eagerly my trembling hand tell clementina tell your stubborn friend cried he in accents positive and stern that brave palermo just returned from chains chains greatly purchased in his countrys cause must now receive such welcome such affection as suits her virtue and anselmos daughter  tell her my words irrevocably given and bid her guard the honor of her father  clementina why let the storm exert its utmost rage and burst in thunder on my wretched head let this severe this unrelenting father cast me a houseless wanderer on the world yet shall my soul with unabating firmness deny her sanction to palermos claim o elizara you who know the cause the endless cause of clementinas tears who saw the awful though the secret rite that gave this hand now widowed to rinaldo is there in all the various rounds of woe a curse so great a pang so exquisite as this poor breast is singled out to feel  elizara indulge not thus a painful recollection  clementina oh memory even madness cannot lose it mangled with wounds amidst unnumberd foes my hapless husband for his country fell yet the sad story of our loves concealed i was allowed no privilege of tears but doomed to hide the anguish of my heart  and now in all the fullness of despair to have another forced upon me horror it is not to be borne  but i am resolved and will devote the remnant of my life to lost rinaldos memory or die some little hour before my griefs would end me  elizara alas i feel the sorrows of your bosom with all the ardent sympathy of friendship and know how souls so delicate as yours must spurn the idea of a second lord yet blame no more the sternness of anselmo the ancient hate too long too idly cherished between your angry father and rinaldos first urged the measure of a private union a stranger therefore to your grief anselmo claims but the right which custom and which nature have long given parents over their childrens hearts  clementina what claim what right misjudging elizara can tyrant custom plead or nature urge to force the free election of the soul say should affection light the nuptial torch or should the rash decision of a father doom his sad race to wretchedness for ever no elizara custom has no force nature no right to sanctify oppression and parents vainly tell us of indulgence when they give all but happiness to children  elizara true  yet a cruel crisis in your fate has much to offer for the good anselmo he fondly thinks his daughter disengaged believes too fondly that palermos merit must touch the gentle bosom of my friend if then determined to reject his choice at once throw off constraint  at once be open and seal his lips for ever on the subject by a frank mention of your fatal story  clementina what and expose my dear rinaldos kindred to all the fury of enraged anselmo the now acknowledged ruler of the state who though renowned for wisdom and for justice yet in the points the cruel points of honor is rigid stern and fatally severe no elizara though these fading eyes no more must hope to gaze upon rinaldo though the soulswelling language of my woes falls unregarded on the silent tomb and boasts no power to call my slaughtered hero from the dark dreary mansions of the dead still let me guard whatever he held dear nor pluck down added ruin on his house  elizara anselmos justice will overcome his hatred  were he inclined to make his will his law or wished for means to gratify resentment he has the power already but his mind superior ever to the thought of wrong can feel no passion to disgrace his virtue  clementina the best may err nor will i tempt his rage the mighty measure of my woe is full  why then when fates unmerciful decree has cursed me up to such a height of ill why should i shudder at the gathering storm or seek for shelter in anothers sorrow i now have no asylum but the grave though did peace court me from the bowers of bliss my soul would scorn to hear the charmers voice if she required me to perform a deed that either shocked my justice or my honor  elizara then summon all your firmness clementina for here anselmo comes and brings palermo o that your terrors for rinaldos kindred may stiil subside and hear the voice of reason your soul is ill adapted to disguise and without cause to disappoint his views must be as fatal as to tell him all  clementina they are here  let us retire  palermos presence is now a thousand deaths  and though prepared with fortitude to act  still elizara while i can shun the conflict let me spare spare even the feelings of a cruel father exeunt  enter anselmo and palermo anselmo gone so abruptly  gone at our approach  and yet my son the crimson hue of virtue will always deepen at a lovers sight who comes to ask his certain day of transport and knows the hour of apprehension over  palermo it is just my lord  but still however lovely the soft emotion of these gentle terrors spreads in the blooming daughters of perfection still clementina might have kindly given a long lost lover welcome from his bonds and nobly told him that his ruined fortunes were even deemed merit with anselmos daughter  anselmo think not palermo of your ruined fortunes my clementina with her fathers eyes regardless looks on dignity and wealth and holds the mind preeminent in both that boasts a bright preeminence in virtue  palermo when sharp adversity has stung the mind it makes us doubly conscious of neglect and sure a soul less sensible than mine had room to start at clementinas coldness judge then by all that headlong fire of youth which once swelled up your own impassioned breast if i could let indifference pass unnoticd he never loved that bore a slight with temper nor ever merited a worthy heart who meanly stooped contented with a cold one  anselmo no more my son  this day rewards your sufferings for clementina shall today be yours and while love courts you with his ripest roses the golden sun of honorable greatness shines out to crown you with his warmest beams  our native land  but what exceeds all price our native liberty shall soon be ours and soon palermo nobly shall revenge on haughty ferdinand that scourge of earth the wrongs illfated venice has sustained the wrongs which heedless of a soldiers glory the imperial plundrer on my son himself so poorly meanly infamously heaped when in a base exaction for his ransom he seized his all nor left the indignant warrior a home to rest in from the weight of chains  our french ally the noblyminded lewis this hour dispatches an ambassador to give our country renovated being and burst asunder every yoke of spain  palermo the glorious news oerpays an age of bonds o for a curse a quick dispatching curse to blast the ruthless tyrant on his throne and mark him out through all succeeding ages a dread example to despotic kings but say and bless me with some certain hope on what foundation does the royal lewis bid us thus boldly considently look for instant vengeance and for instant freedom  anselmo that i am yet to learn  but noble still i ever found him in our various treaties and therefore cannot will not doubt him now sunk by his late distresses ferdinand now mourns his dreams of universal empire and shrinks in secret at the arms of france  palermo eternal praises to the god of battles yes sceptered savage we may reach you yer and boldly tell you in the face of nations that royal robbers from unerring justice demand a double measure of perdition  the needy ruffian in his hour of hunger has some excuse for prowling on his neighbor but when the arm the mighty arm of kings that should protect all mankind from oppression is stretched to seize on what it ought to guard then heavens own brand in aggravated fire should strike the illustrious villain to his hell and war in mercy for a groaning world  anselmo oh nobly said  our cause is just and heaven fights on our side for late the spanish troops in two great fields were wholly overthrown and filled the plains with myriads of their dead our navies too though some venetian cities lie humbled still beneath the tyrants yoke fill spain with constant and with just alarms for such a blaze of unexampled glory has crowned the fleets entrusted to my care that though deprived of more than half our realm we still remain a formidable foe and rule triumphant over the boundless wave  palermo how the bright prospect bursts upon my view and lifts me up in fancy to the stars o did the fair the matchless clementina view me with eyes less rigidly severe this one blessed hour had maddend me with rapture  anselmo again palermo  but i cease to chide and go my son to end your doubts for ever  if i know aught of clementinas heart twill beat in honest unison to mine and give an added welcome to your claim because you have now an added need of fortune  palermo too generous anselmo  anselmo nay no thanks the man who bears not to a friend distressed a double will to ratify engagements stands selfconvicted at the bar within the base assassin of his native honor exit  palermo alone why did i wound his venerable bosom with any doubt of clementinas truth and yet disquiet hangs about my heart a secret voice incessantly suggests that clementina was not born for me but let me not anticipate misfortune when fate has struck it is time enough to feel and he is best prepared against the blow whose conscious virtue never has deserved it exit  scene changes to clementinas apartment clementina alone now clementina  now the trial comes  call up the inherent greatness of your soul and show anselmo show this rigid sire that his own firmness animates his daughter what does he think that force can move my temper no sacred spirit of my dear rinaldo it kindly hovering round your wretched wife you still observe her in this world of woe look and applaud her in an hour of terror look and behold how faithful to her vows she braves a sure destruction for your sake braves all the stings of poverty and scorn her fathers fury and her houses hate to live the ceaseless mourner of your fall  enter anselmo anselmo well clementina  have i yet a daughter  clementina say rather sir  if i have yet a father  anselmo yes clementina an unhappy father who now implores compassion from his child i see i see with infinite regret your scorn your fixed aversion to palermo and though i came determined to exact a strict a rigid instance of your duty my aching soul quite melted at your tears rejects the sterner sentiment of force and bends the weeping suppliant to a daughter  clementina o could the secret volume of my heart be laid this moment openly to view my father there would read my pride to please him let him ask all from clementinas duty which wretched clementina can perform let him do this and he is at once obeyed but when he asks her to direct her wishes to turn the mighty current of the mind and join the streams the everwarring streams of boundless love and limitless aversion there he exceeds her utmost stretch of power and only gives occasion for her tears  anselmo look round on all the accomplished sons of venice and say who shines superior to palermo take then his hand and bless your doting father  let us not now in poverty desert him nor aid the arrow of a galling need with the keen dart of disappointed love no clementina let us nobly claim a great alliance with his ruined fortunes and give a bright example to our country that worth is all things with the truly worthy  clementina palermos merits and palermos wants alike receive my praises and my pity but venerable sir if ever my peace my souls dear peace was tender to your thoughts spare me o spare me on this cruel subject let the brave youth so honored with your friendship partake your wealth but do not kill your daughter do not to give him a precarious good doom me to certain wretchedness for ever i have an equal claim upon your heart and call as much for favor as palermo  anselmo a little time sweet soother of my age will charm that gentle bosom into rest and even return palermo love for love then clementina o my souls whole comfort refuse a kneeling father if you can kneels here at your feet the author of your being who never stooped to aught before but heaven begs for compassion  must he beg in vain  clementina o mercy mercy will you kill your daughter rise sir o rise and save me from distraction  anselmo rising my word my child has never yet been broken  do not in age expose me to dishonor  save your poor father at the verge of life o nobly save him from the guilt of falsehood in this reversal of palermos fortunes the slandrous tongue of all my houses foes will mark me out to universal shame and tell the world his poverty alone has lost the daughter of the base anselmo  clementina no more  i yield  and am a wretch for ever  anselmo o say not so my hearts supreme delight applanding heaven shall bless your filial virtue and give your heart that joy you give your rather my transport grows too mighty to be borne  o let me hasten to the brave palermo and raise him from despondency to rapture exit  clementina alone rinaldos widow wedded to palermo where shall i now find refuge from reflection or how root up the agonizing thought that brings this horrid marriage to my view i was prepared for all a fathers fury but was not armed against a fathers tears how could i see him weeping at my feet tossed in a whirlwind of contending passions and yet retain the purpose of my soul even if the sainted spirit of my husband from the bright mansions of eternal day beheld the anguish of his struggling heart it must have kindly prompted me to pity  o this palermo  this detested union  married to him  the widow of rinaldo  give me ye blessed ministers of peace some instant portion of that soothing stream which pours a deep oblivion on the mind and drowns the sense of memory for ever  act ii an apartment in anselmos palace enter granville and elizara elizara and is it possible do i once more behold rinaldo   granville yes my elizara yet oh take heed sweet maid alone to know me for what i seem  the ambassador of france as such alone anselmo has received me and such my king confirms me  but declare how fares my clementina  how does she support the often proclaimed the general tale that now six moons has ranked me with the dead  elizara she bears it like a wife that truly loved  but by what miracle again restored acquaint me  for concurring multitudes beheld your fall in battle and reported that in a pile of greatlyslaughterd heroes a gallic squadron bore you from the field  granville i fell indeed amidst the general carnage and lay some hours among the honored dead for whom the vanquished frances generous sons made one bold effort to obtain a grave here a brave youth of that exalted nation close by whose side with emulative fire i sought for venice on that hapless day beheld the man he deigned to call his friend and by a kind of miracle restored me  then to the king in terms of warmest weight proclaimed my fancied merits  royal lewis received the story with a gracious ear and poured profuse his favors on rinaldo  elizara why then o why distinguished thus thus honored did not rinaldo sooth his sorrowing friends and ease the torments of a wifes despair  granville o elizara how my soul has felt for all the anguish she was doomed to suffer that heaven which knows the greatness of my love alone can witness  but the conquering arms of widely wasting ferdinand cut off our commerce with the world  and had not fate in two late fields propitious smiled upon us rinaldo yet distracted and forlorn had dragged a chain of miserable being nor known as now he shall the extatic bliss of speaking peace to weeping clementina  elizara but whence this transformation  why concealed beneath the garb of france does brave rinaldo so closely seek to hide himself in granville  granville for ends of moment  if the charge i bear meets as i hope and as i think it ought a warm reception from anselmo  then i come determined to avow my marriage and gracious lewis will i trust remove the fatal feuds that shake our angry houses  elizara but should anselmo disapprove your charge what measure then remains to be pursued and what becomes of weeping clementina  granville there my disguise is suited to assist me should he refuse to join the views of france my orders are that instant to return and my design to bear off clementina  elizara you talk rinaldo with an air of triumph think you the first of our venetian daughters can in a moment thus be borne away borne from her palace compassed round with guards surrounding virgins and a watchful father  granville my name concealed and all my train instructed my kings credentials bearing but the title which he himself has given me and which yet has reached no ear of venice but your own can there exist a doubt of my success unknown  unnoticd  unsuspected quite a trusty friend shall lead her to the beach if clementina like myself disguised will venture aught to bless her faithful husband  elizara rinaldo should pursue a different course a course more suited to his worth and honor now independent now so raised in france what can you dread from venice or its leader your fortunes now are equal to your birth should then your embassy displease anselmo act like yourself  throw off this dark disguise and nobly claim your wife  you know his justice and know besides he cannot hate you farther  granville fain gentle maid would i pursue this counsel and in the face of day assert my right but if the purport or my public business which heaven avert should raise anselmos anger my life once known must expiate my crime i come i hope to blese the state of venice but i come also with a foreign ruler  this you know well is death by law declared nor could the ambassador of france preserve the offending subject from the stroke of justice  elizara may heaven indulgent smile upon your hopes but oh i dread i dread a disappointment and see impatience frowning on his brow hither anselmo comes  let me fly hence and bless my friend with tidings of her lord exit  enter anselmo with papers anselmo well sir the views of lewis are at length revealed and here i see he speaks them plainly  granville why sage anselmo this offended brow i trust my masters offers have deserved your highest approbation for they breathe naught but attachment and regard for venice  anselmo is this the basis of his love for venice has he stood forth a champion for our freedom merely himself to tread us into slaves and saved us from the arm of haughty spain to make us bear his own oppressive yoke go tell your king and tell him from anselmo that france and venice can be friends no more tell him to us all tyrants are the same or if in bonds the neverconquerd soul can feel a pang more keen than slavrys self it is when the chains that crush us into dust are forged by hands from which we hoped for freedom  granville and what idea does my business raise of slaves or tyrants servitude or chains it is true the gracious lewis has proposed to take the state of venice to his care if sage anselmo her illustrious leader approves the scheme of wellconcerted empire  he sees with deep with noblyminded sorrow how still exposed to every powerful neighbor you fall a victim to alternate spoilers hence with paternal tenderness he wishes to enroll your sons among the sons of france and make the subjects of his different realms one equal common and united people if this be slavery   anselmo it is the worst of slavery tamely to bend our necks beneath the yoke and suffer fraud to talk us out of freedom  if we must yield before superior force let us at least deserve the name of men let us fall nobly if we are to fall and give the world in characters of blood eternal causes to lament our fate but never one occasion to despise us  granville far from my bosom be the abject thought to stoop the servile minister of greatness or crouch the advocate for lawless power the heir myself of heavndescended freedom i wish the same bright heritage to all and inly scorn a brotherhood with slaves yet sure some form your government must know the reins of state must somewhere be devolved and he who holds them name him as you please must be your prince and you must be his subjects why then if lewis solemnly shall swear to hold your rights inviolably sacred still to maintain the spirit of your laws and never know another line of action why should you turn indignantly away and slight the offer of a mighty monarch who knows that form of government is best which best secures the welfare of the people  anselmo because your monarch in this very offer seeks to subvert our glorious constitution seeks to erect hereditary rule where virtue only gives superior rank and where the genius of descended rome has levelled all distinctions but in goodness what is his promise to maintain us free sir well maintain that freedom for ourselves and to maintain it we reject your master the power so safe in his benignant hand is safer still retained within our own we know the worth of liberty too well ever to cast the blessing basely from us or still more basely to survive our honor  granville you need not cast the mighty blessing from you  the king my master wishes for no more than such mere title to the realms of venice as to his subjects and the world may warrant a warm exertion of continual care for this his dear ally  and mark my lord shewing a paper the moment venice owns him for her sovereign this instrument confirms the viceroys office with all the active rule to great anselmo and his heirs for ever   anselmo am i awake or can i trust my reason  patience  patience are all the bright achievements of my life unable now to save me from disgrace thus to the winds i give the vile proposal tearing the paper thus tear the record of imputed shame nor let succeeding ages be informed that mortal man has dared to doubt my honor  granville no more my lord my king i see has erred in offering peace and happiness to venice yet let me mourn for you her wretched race her slaughtered sons and violated virgins for you her shrieking matrons and for you o ye unconscious wnoffending babes  driven from your humble yet your cheerful homes to timeless graves or everlasting exile anselmo dooms you to this dreadful fate and spurns the friendship offered to preserve you  anselmo eternal curses on the baleful friendship that seeks to cheat us of our native justice and did your mean your poorlythinking prince suppose anselmo would betray his country hang up his name to everlasting scorn and sell the brightest birthright of a people to gain a robbers portion of the plunder what could repay me for internal peace or give distinction where i sold my honor the wildest prodigal the world can know is he who madly casts away his virtue and though he gains a scepter in return he is still a wretched loser by the change   granville enough my lord we end our confrence here  venice it is true admires the good anselmo and trusts her present safety to his wisdom  yet if his fellowcitizens shall hear how light their happiness is held when weighed in glorys grand though too romantic scale well may they mourn this honorable madness this dread through bright delirium of the mind which seeks for safety in assured destruction and blindly murders nations to preserve them  anselmo whenever they show such turpitude of soul make them again an offer of your chains  but now the purport of your business over and public character thrown wholly off in the plain province of a private man let me salute the noble lord of granville and beg while venice boasts of such a guest he will not disdain the dwelling of anselmo  granville my lord with equal gratitude and pleasure i meet your kindness for my little stay my scarce furled sails must quickly court the wind and bear me back to my expecting master  anselmo the assembled senate now requires my presence  my lord farewell  i treat you as a friend  i never dealt in ceremony yet and you will excuse the unpolished manners of venetian sailors  granville the generous frankness of your temper here bespeaks a native honesty and wisdom that makes me doubly anxious for the state and doubly mourn your harsh reply to lewis  anselmo mourn not for us my lord  a freeborn people can have but two bright objects of ambition a life of honor or a death of glory and when for virtuous liberty they fall they share at least the second greatest blessing which heaven ever poured in mercy on mankind exit  granville alone how i admire his fortitude of soul and love his pride though adverse to my wishes once my own bosom vehemently flamed with all the phrenzy of his noble zeal and looked on death more eligible far than even a government of certain bliss beneath the reign of any foreign ruler  but i now wake from all this glittering dream of fancied virtue and ideal honor  my clementinal   enter clementina clementina my longlost rinaldo it is he  it is he and elizara erred not the grave has given him back  allseeing heaven in kind compassion to a wifes despair by some benignant miracle has raised him and these transported arms again enfold the best beloved the most deptord of husbands  granville my lifes great bliss here let me grow for ever  clementina it is too much  i shall run wild with rapture  how are you saved and wherefore thus disguised yet do not answer  partly elizara has told me of your views  and it is enough i see you safe  that providence be praised whose mercy sent you at an hour of dread to snatch me from destruction   granville o my love i cannot tell you half of what i feel words are too poor  yet say my chiefest good say do you love with such transcendent truth that if the kindness of indulging fate should point out ways of flying with rinaldo to some secure some hospitable coast alike propitious to our peace and fortune would clementina would a wife prefer the fond the ardent bosom of a husband to the stern mansion of a ruthless father  clementina would she prefer  o quickly let him lead her through dreary wastes and nevertrodden wilds where heat cold famine in their dread extremes at each new footstep strike an added horror through the noonblaze of fierce autumnal suns over burning deserts instantly conduct her or where the stiffning nations of the night in more than winter freeze beneath the pole through these bear off your faithful clementina and though a filial anguish drowns her eye at what her poor her reverend father feels o never question if she loves rinaldo  granville thus let me press you to my grateful bosom thus speak the raptures of my swelling heart  clementina o i have much to tell you of my sorrows  but what are sorrows now  the gracious being who from a precipice of guilt and woe in this dread crisis snatched me by your hand oerpays me tenfold for my past afflictions and all my tears were ministers of joy exeunt  act iii anselmo s palace enter anselmo with a paper and adorno anselmo from ferdinand himself   adorno from ferdinand  anselmo from him adorno  but observe his words  touched with the various miseries of venice the first of europes kings salutes the senate and offers peace nay friendship to their realms peace unconditiond and eternal friendship  adorno what has the royal ruffian been informed that france has sued us to become her subject and does he fearful of our base assent fearful his rival should obtain our homage give up his own despotic claim upon us and rather choose to set us wholly free than see his foe acknowledged for our master  anselmo too plain  perdition on his recreant head his motive may be seen  too plain his fears would now usurp the guise of highsould virtue but though we know the source of this proposal though we are certain that his late defeats joined to his dread of our receiving lewis have dragged the trembling tyrant from his throne to dastard supplication  still his offers demand our prompt acceptance  he consents to yield up all our towns  our captive sons  to cease for ever his detested claim and treat us henceforth as a separate nation a dear ally but independent people  adorno but say my lord what minister he sends to sign these terms of unexpected peace fraud and the royal hypocrite are one nor can we trust securely to his word when once his interest urges him to break it  anselmo that very interest is our hostage now  and here too conscious of our glad concurrence he speeds his alva to confirm the treaty who comes beneath safe conduct from colonna supplying now my absence in the fleet and will arrive at venice ere the eve

palermo and i have news that howled in deepest hell would make the demons tremble  clementina   anselmo ha what of her palermo  palermo is false persidious   anselmo how  palermo doats on another  anselmo beware palermo this capricious temper doubt seldom lodges in a noble mind and he scarce merits to be treated justly whose jealous soul on light foundation questions the unsullied luster of anothers virtue  retract then quick this hasty accusation and kindly say my hapless child is dead but dare not once to tell me she is worthless  palermo on light foundation did i doubt my lord this sharp reproach had been indeed deserved but if incessant coldness if contempt if open insult for protesting love and even a noonday fondness for a stranger are honest grounds of rational suspicion then have i cause for rage and indignation   anselmo by heaven it is false nor shall my child be wronged by any coinage of a dotars madness her soul superior to the slandrous charge has proved its worth to more than roman greatness and if she meant not to accept your vows her sense  her pride  her virtue had repulsed them  fond of a stranger  tell me sir  what stranger what mighty object has alarmed your fears and kindled hells most fiercely blazing fire the fire of groundless jealousy within you  palermo why will anselmo treat me with contempt and wound the wounded with the darts of scorn think you i rave or that my restless brain ingenious seeks out sources of misfortune but what if hid within yon secret arbor you should yourself detect them  what if there you knew them long concealed what if you saw her alabaster arm as i have seen it o damning sight thrown round the happy villain would you not then with me conclude her lost and think this ample evidence to prove the plain perdition of her monstrous falsehood  anselmo and were you sir like me a father like me a doting father  had your child through life maintained an unsuspected honor and rose in virtue as she rose in beauty would you believe at reasons full meridian a maid thus pure thus eminently spotless could plunge at once in infamy eternal and set fame fortune happiness at naught through instant passion for a total stranger  palermo my lord i come not with an idiots tale or wish anselmo in an angry mood should as an insant chide a thoughtless daughter no i disdain the thought  i come to guard no less his honor than my own  to show our mutual danger  and advise that granville may be this moment ordered to his france  as yet though highly erring clementina cannot be completely guilty  send then her newfound favorite instantly from venice  she still is undestroyd and granville though thrice my sword avengingly was drawn safe from this arm enjoys the law of nations  anselmo rash  desperate youth forbear to urge my temper  or by yon heaven the friendship which i hold you no more oerlooks this treatment of my child  she false  she shameless  kneel blasphemer kneel fall at her feet and own you have lost your reason for naught but madness can excuse the wound which virtue feels in injured clementina  palermo they are in the arbor yet  convince yourself  and see how far i wound the cause of virtue in this report of faithless clementina  anselmo i will this instant  but remember sir unless your charge proceeds from some mistake of probable appearance  unless it springs from some plain source of obvious misconception the purposed union never shall take place  i prize my childs repose too dearly sir to trust it with a madman  nor will she be ever prevailed on to receive a lover who dares to think her capable of baseness exit  palermo alone to think her base  o that i could not think it  what though her person spotless and unsullied may vie with zemblas nowdescending snows what though her error is ideal yet and actual guilt has stamped no sable on her is not her mind that allinall of virtue polluted stained nay prostitute before me do i not take o

and is he gone so soon  o hapless girl but yet palermos not to blame  rinaldo provoked his fate  he urged him to the combat and the survivor conscious who has fallen deplores most deeply the disastrous blow  clementina hence with his more than crocodile complaining hence to the inferior monster of the nile let him teach tears of yet unfancyd falsehood  there lies my husband slaughtered by his hand heavens worst of woes  heavens worst of woes upon him and thinks he now with founds of lamentation to charm down griefs of magnitude like mine no here i shake off wretchedness and life here i attend my dear rinaldos spirit and leave the world to beings like palermo stabs herself  anselmo o clementina  o my child  my child had you no pity for a weeping father was i not cursed enough enough a wretch without this blow to rend my breast asunder  clementina i scarce know what i act  my reason totters yet while an interval of sense remains o see me sir with less endearing goodness  wretched

once delighted me is lost o wretched child  o miserable father but let me not blaspheme good heaven  good heaven i yield submissive to the dreadful stroke and only ask that this unhappy story to future times may forcibly point out the dire effects of filial disobedience exit the end epilogue by george colman esquire spoken by mrs yates from otways and immortal shakespeares page venice is

in venice we have placed our scene where i have been  lived  died  as you have seen yet that my travels i may not disgrace let me  since now revived  describe the place nor would the tour of europe prove our shame could every macaroni do the same the citys self  a wonder all agree  appears to spring like venus from the sea founded on piles it rises from the strand like trifle placed upon a silver stand while many a lesser isle the prospect crowns looking like sugar plums or floating towns horses and mules never pace the narrow street where crowded walkers elbow all they meet no carts and coaches over the pavement clatter ladies priests lawyers nobles  go by water light boats and gondolas transport them all like one eternal party to vauxhall now hey for merriment  hence gries and sear the jolly carnival leads in the year calls the young loves and pleasures to its aid a threemonths jubilee and masquerade with gaiety the thronged piazza glows mountebanks jugglers boxers puppetshows masked and disguised the ladies meet their sparks while venus bails the mummers of st marks there holy friars turn gallants and there too nuns yield to all the frailties  flesh is heir to

the sea and cries  thus we thy sovereign marry thee oh may thou never like many a mortal spouse prove full of storms and faitbless to thy vows one word of politics  and then pve done  the state of
