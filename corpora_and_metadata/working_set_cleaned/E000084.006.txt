    chester majorgeneral putnam to majorgeneral putnam chester   august       dr sir i have this moment received intelligence by express that the enemys fleet yesterday morning about eight oclock sailed out of the capes in an eastern course this surprising event gives me the greatest anxiety and unless every possible exertion is made may be productive of the happiest consequences to the enemy and the most injurious to us i have desired general sullivans division and the two brigades that left you last immediately to return and recross the river and shall forward on the rest of the army with all the expedition in my power i have also written to general clinton requesting him instantly to reinforce you with as many militia of the state of new york as he can collect and you are on receipt of this to send on an express to governor trumbull urging it upon him to assist you with as many of the connecticut militia as he can get together and without a moments loss of time   the importance of preventing mr howes getting possession of the highlands by a coup de main is infinite to america and in the present situation of things every effort that can be thought of must be used the probability of his going to the eastward is exceedingly small and the ill effects that might attend such a step inconsiderable in comparison with those that would inevitably attend a successful stroke upon the highlands connecticut cannot be in more danger through any channel than this and every motive of its own interest and the general good demand its utmost endeavors to give you effectual assistance governor trumbull will i trust be sensible of this i am c    george washington   august      philadelphia to the president of congress philadelphia   august      sir your favor of this date with its enclosures is now before me at the same time that i express my thanks for the high mark of confidence which congress have been pleased to repose in me by their resolve authorizing me to send an officer to command the northern army i should wish to be excused from making the appointment for this many reasons might be mentioned which i am persuaded will occur to congress upon reflection the northern department in a great measure has been considered as separate and more peculiarly under their direction and the officers commanding there always of their nomination i have never interfered further than merely to advise and to give such aids as were in my power on the requisitions of those officers the present situation of that department is delicate and critical and the choice of an officer to the command   may involve very interesting and important consequences  it is certainly necessary that a body of militia should be immediately called out to reinforce the northern army in the conference which your committee honored me with yesterday evening i mentioned the number which i thought sufficient but my opinion on this point and the apportioning them to the different states i wish to submit to congress who can best determine the quotas that should come from each i would only observe that connecticut and new york are already and may be again called on to afford succors to the army at peekskill i have the honor to be c    george washington   august      philadelphia governor trumbull to governor trumbull philadelphia   august      sir i have been honored with your letter of the   th ultimo i confess the conduct of the enemy is distressing beyond measure and past our comprehension on thursday and friday last their fleet consisting of two hundred and twentyeight sail were beating off the capes of delaware as if they intended to come in from this circumstance nobody doubted but that philadelphia was the immediate object of their expedition and that they would commence their operations as soon as possible they have stood out to sea again but how far or where they are going remains to be known from their entire command of the water they derive immense advantages and distress us much by harassing and marching our troops from post to post i wish we could fix on their destination in such case i should hope we would be prepared to receive them i had been advised before that the northern army had taken post below fort edward i am told by those acquainted with the country that fort edward is not tenable and that the grounds where the army now is are good and pretty defensible i hope they will prove so on trial if fort edward was so situated and the evacuation necessary though i regret the expense incurred in building the barracks etc yet their destruction might be advisable as otherwise they would have afforded shelter and protection to the enemy i should be happy if i could spare the reinforcement of continental troops which you mention but it cannot be done we now feel   sensibly the fatal consequences arising from the deficiency in our regiments and that languor which has but too generally prevailed throughout the states if the quota of men exacted from the states were complete we could with great ease check the progress of general burgoyne and bid defiance to all their armies i trust however though this is not our condition and though matters do appear somewhat gloomy at present that a steady perseverance and our spirited exertions will put things right again it behooves every man to turn out and act with vigor at this juncture every motive of selfpreservation of liberty and happiness has a claim upon our efforts and requires our aid surely the militia do not mean to be supine spectators of their own and their countrys ruin i cannot entertain so ungenerous a thought and one so unworthy and derogatory of their former characters the panic i flatter myself is nearly subsided and i doubt not but they will give the army every possible assistance the inquiry you mention will certainly be made and in the course of a short time i suppose as soon as circumstances will admit it i have the honor to be with great respect sir c george washington   august      philadelphia governor henry to governor henry philadelphia   august      sir the great expense and loss of time which has attended the recruiting service in most of the states and the little advantage derived from it has induced   congress to recommend the executive powers of each to adopt certain new regulations for promoting this important and essential business and for taking it entirely out of the hands of the officers of the army the resolve on this subject and the regulations recommended passed on the   st ultimo and will i presume be transmitted you by the president  i will not urge the expediency of carrying this proceeding into immediate execution i shall only observe that the necessity is obvious and that it demands our most active attention the principal cause of my troubling you at this time is to request that after the persons recommended are appointed in your state you would be pleased to transmit me their names their places of residence and those designed for the rendezvous of recruits and deserters as soon as i am advised upon these subjects i shall recall all the officers who are recruiting and order them forthwith to join their respective corps before i conclude i would beg leave to mention that the success of this interesting business in all its parts   will depend much upon a judicious choice of those who are to be employed in it and that i think the districts should not be too large and extensive i have the honor c  george washington   august      philadelphia to the council of safety of new york philadelphia   august      gentlemen i have been duly honored by your several favors of the   th   th   0th of july the misfortune at ticonderoga has given a very disagreeable turn to our affairs and has thrown a gloom upon the prospect which the campaign previous to that event afforded but i am in great hopes that the ill consequences of it will not continue long to operate and that the jealousies and alarms which so sudden and unexpected an event has produced in the minds of the people both of your state and to the eastward will soon subside and give place to the more rational dictates of selfpreservation and a regard to the common good in fact the worst effect of that event is that it has served to produce those distrusts and apprehensions   for if the matter were coolly and dispassionately considered there would be nothing found so formidable in mr burgoyne and the force under him with all his successes as to countenance the least degree of despondency and experience would show that even the moderate exertions of the states more immediately interested would be sufficient to check his career and perhaps convert the advantages he has gained into his ruin but while people continue to view what has happened through the medium of suspicion and fear there is no saying to what length an enterprising man may push his good fortune i have the fullest confidence that no endeavors of the council will be wanted to bring your state with the distresses of which i am deeply affected to every effort it is capable of making in its present mutilated situation and they may rely upon it that no means in my power shall be unemployed to coöperate with them in the danger that presses upon the state and through it threatens the continent if i do not give so effectual aid as i could wish to the northern army it is not for want of inclination nor from being too little impressed with the importance of doing it it is because the state of affairs in this quarter will not possibly admit of it it would be the height of impolicy to weaken ourselves too much here in order to increase our strength there and it must certainly be considered more difficult as well as of greater moment to control the main army of the enemy than an inferior and i may say dependent one for it is pretty obvious that if general howe can be completely kept at bay and  0 prevented effecting his principal purposes the successes of mr burgoyne whatever they may be must be partial and temporary nothing that i can do shall be wanting to rouse the eastern states and excite them to those exertions which the exigency of our affairs so urgently demands i lament that they have not yet done more that so few of their militia have come into the field and that those few have behaved so inconsistent with the duty they owe their country at this critical period but i have nevertheless great reliance upon those states i know they are capable of powerful efforts and that their attachment to the cause notwithstanding they may be a little tardy will not allow them long to withhold their aid at a time when their own safety that of a sister state and in a great measure the safety of the continent call for their greatest zeal and activity  i flatter myself that the presence of generals lincoln and arnold in the northern department will have a happy effect upon them those gentlemen possess much of their confidence particularly the former than whom there is perhaps no man from the    state of massachusetts who enjoys more universal esteem and popularity and in addition to that they may both be considered as very valuable officers you intimate a wish that some assistance could be drawn from the southern states at this time but while things remain in their present posture and appearances however illusory they may prove afford the strongest reason to keep their force at home to counteract the seeming intentions of general howe i could neither ask nor expect them to detach any part of it to the succor of the northern states which are so well able to defend themselves against the force they now have to oppose i hope an exaggerated idea of the enemys force may have no injurious influence on our measures there is no circumstance with which i am acquainted that induces me to believe general burgoyne can have more than six or seven thousand men and if the force left in canada is so considerable as the information you send me makes it he cannot have even so many the representations of prisoners and deserters in this respect are of little validity their knowledge is always very limited and their intention particularly the former is very often bad beyond what regards the state of their own respective companies no attention is due to what they say the number of regiments your informant mentions agrees with other accounts but in the number of men in each company he gives the establishment not i am persuaded the actual state the british army in canada last campaign though they    suffered little by action must have decreased materially by sickness and other casualties and if the recruits both from england and germany bore any proportion to those who have reinforced general howe the state of their regiments must be greatly inferior to what your information supposes reasoning from analogy as far as it will apply i cannot imagine that the british regiments can exceed two hundred and fifty men each fit for the field or that the foreign troops can amount to much more than three thousand men the appointment of general clinton to the government of your state is an event that in itself gives me great pleasure and very much abates the regret i should otherwise feel for the loss of his services in the military line that gentlemans character is such as will make him peculiarly useful at the head of your state in a situation so alarming and interesting as it at present experiences for the future agreeable to your desire i shall direct my applications to him  i have the honor to be c george washington   august      germantown john augustine washington to john augustine washington germantown near philada   august      dear brother your favors of the   st of june from westmoreland and  0th ult from fredricksburg are both to hand since general howes remove from the jerseys    the troops under my command have been more harrassed by marching  countermarching than by any thing that has happened to them in the course of the campaign after genl howe had imbarked his troops the presumption that he woud operate upon the north river to form a junction with general burgoyne was so strong that i removed from middle brook to morristown and from morristown to the clove a narrow pass leading through the highlands about eighteen miles from the river indeed upon some pretty strong presumptive evidence i threw two divisions over the north river in this situation we lay till about the   th ult when receiving certain information that the fleet had actually sailed from sandy hook the outer point of new york harbor and the concurring sentiment of every one tho i acknowledge my doubts of it were strong that philadelphia was the object we countermarched and got to coryells ferry on the delaware about thirtythree miles above the city on the   th where i lay till i received information from congress that the enemy were actually at the capes of delaware this brought us in great haste to this place for defence of the city but in less than twentyfour hours after our arrival we got accounts of the disappearance of the fleet on the   st since which nothing having been heard of them we remain here in a very irksome state of suspense some imagining that they are gone to the southward whilst a majority in whose opinion upon this occasion i concur are satisfied they are gone to the eastward the fatigue    however and injury which men must sustain by long marches in such extreme heat as we have felt for the last five days must keep us quiet till we hear something of the destination of the enemy i congratulate you very sincerely on the happy passage of my sister and the rest of your family through the smallpox surely the daily instances which present themselves of the amazing benefits of inoculation must make converts of the most rigid opposers and bring on a repeal of that most impolitic law which restrains it  our affairs at the northward have taken a turn not more unfortunate than unexpected the public papers will convey every information that i can on this subject to these therefore i shall refer with this addition that a public enquiry is ordered into the conduct of the genl officers in that department which will give them an opportunity of justifying their conduct or the publick one of making examples this however will not retrieve the misfortune for certain it is that this affair has cast a dark shade upon a very bright prospect our accounts from that quarter being very gloomy but some reinforcements being sent up and some good officers it is to be hoped the cloud will in time dispel  one thing absolutely necessary is    that all the gentlemen in every state should exert themselves to have their quota of troops compleated for believe me the whole are most shamefully deficient i have from the first been among those few who never built much upon a french war i ever did and still do think they never meant more than to give us a kind of underhand assistance that is to supply us with arms c for our money and trade this may indeed if g b has spirit and strength to resent it bring on a war but the declaration if on either side must i am convinced come from the last mentioned power i have taken col p p thornton into my family as an extra aid this i dare say his own merit as well as the great worth of his father well entitles him to my love and best wishes are presented to my sister and the rest of your family and with sincerest affection believe and be assured i am c p s aug  th being disappointed in sending this letter i have to add that we have no further account of the enemys fleet and therefore concluding that they are gone to the eastward we have again turned our faces that way and shall move slow till we get some account of it     george washington   august      germantown to the president of congress camp near germantown   august      sir i have been duly honored with your letter of yesterday and with its enclosures i shall pay attention to the resolves transmitted and as soon as circumstances admit shall propose to genl howe an exchange between ltcolo campbell and the hessian fieldofficers and a like number of ours of equal rank in his hands  i would beg leave to lay before congress a copy of a report made by a board of genl officers held on the  th instt to consult of several matters respecting the army in the course of their deliberation they took into consideration the subject reported i shall only add that this matter has been long complained of by the officers and the more so as the indulgence they pray could not nor    can be ever attended with the least possible injury to the public and is what i believe is allowed in most armies congress i am persuaded will give it their attention and if no good objections of a public nature appear against the measure will grant what the officers wish and the board have recommended i perceive by the resolves of the  0th ulto   st inst for recalling genls schuyler and st clair that they are directed to repair to headqurs i also find that a committee had been resolved on to digest a mode for inquiring into the reasons for evacuating ticonderoga and mount independence and into the conduct of the genl officers in the northern department at the time of the evacuation as these gentn have received the letter upon this subject by this time and will probably be down in the course of a few days i shall be glad to be informed what i am to do with em when they arrive i may be then at a great distance from this and in such case should be at a loss what to say or how to conduct myself respecting them without receiving some directions which i request to be favored with by the earliest opportunity i have the honor to be c george washington  0 august      german town to the president of congress headquarters camp near german town  0 august      sir the disappearance of the enemys fleet for so many days rendering it rather improbable that they will again return i have thought it adviseable to remove    the army back to coryells where it will be near enough to succor philadelphia should the enemy contrary to appearances still make that the object of their next operations and will be so much the more conveniently situated to proceed to the northward should the event of the present ambiguous and perplexing situation of things call them that way i was the more inclined to this step as the nearness of the army to the city beside other disadvantages afforded a temptation both to officers and men to indulge themselves in licenses inconsistent with discipline and order and consequently of a very injurious tendency  but before my departure i esteem it my duty to communicate to congress the result of my examination into the nature of the river defence proper to be adopted according to the means in our possession to prevent the success of any attempt upon philadelphia by water—i therefore beg leave to lay before congress what appears to me most eligible considering all circumstances and comparing my own observations with the different opinions of the gentlemen whom i consulted on the occasion it is generally a well founded maxim that we ought to endeavor to reduce our defence as much as possible to a certainty by collecting our strength and making all our preparations at one point rather than    to risk its being weak and ineffectual every where by dividing our attention and force to different objects in doing this we may disable ourselves from acting with sufficient vigor any where and a misfortune in one place may pave the way for a similar one in another in our circumstances we have neither men cannon nor any thing else to spare and perhaps cannot with propriety hazard them on objects which being attended with the greatest success we can promise ourselves can be productive of only partial and indicisive advantages and which may possibly fail of the end proposed may have some serious illconsequences and must at all events have some disadvantages it is then to be considered where our defence can be most effectually made—whether at billingsport or at fort island it appears to me that the last deserves greatly the preference billingsport has but one row of chevaux de frize fort island has three and in addition to them a boom and another chevaux de frize ready to be sunk in the channel on the approach of the enemy of course the obstructions in this respect are four times as great at the one as at the other the gallies and floating batteries that could be brought for the defence of the chevaux de frize at billingsport would be unable to maintain their station when once the enemy were in possession of the commanding ground on the jersey side to which they would be entirely exposed and notwithstanding the works raising there even supposing them complete the strongest  0 advocates for making our defence in this place do not pretend that that event can be protracted more than fifteen or twenty days at most at the end of which time we should be obliged with the loss of our cannon at least to abandon the defence and leave it in the power of the enemy to remove or destroy the chevaux de frize at pleasure nor is it by any means certain that a single row of chevaux de frize would be an impenetrable barrier to the enemys ships experiments have been made that lead to a contrary supposition and if they should hazard one which it might be well worth their while to do with some of their less valuable ships under favor of a leading breeze and tide and should succeed in it—the consequence might be the loss of our gallies and floating batteries which i apprehend might be intercepted and with the assistance of their gallies and small armed vessels taken and this would greatly weaken the opposition we might otherwise give at fort island and tend powerfully to render it abortive but if they should not attempt this contenting themselves with safer though slower operations i have already observed that it is agreed on all hands in fifteen or twenty days they would be able to possess themselves of infallible means of frustrating our opposition there by the capture of our works and if we add to this that it might very possibly happen in less time—if from no other cause—yet from the garrison being intimidated by a consciousness of its own inferiority and inability to support itself against a so much superior force of numbers—which might occasion a conduct    destructive to itself—there will remain no sufficient reasons to justify the making this the principal point of defence at fort island the boom and chevaux de frize are an ample security against any forcible impression of the enemys ships which it would be imprudent in them to attempt on the jersey side the situation of the ground is such that the gallies floating batteries and forts employed in the defence of the obstructions would have little to fear from any batteries erected there redbank seems by its elevation to be the only advantageous spot for annoying them but as it is computed to be above   00 yards from fort island the distance is rather too great to allow any battery raised there to act with so much effect as to be able to silence our fire on this side the ground by dykes and sluices may be laid under water to so considerable an extent as to leave no danger of our river force being annoyed from thence for which purpose suitable precautions ought at once to be made against it may be necessary to carry them into effect but though a battery upon redbank would not in my apprehension be able to prevent the efficacy of our defence or give any material disturbance to fort island in particular yet it might serve to make the situation of some of our gallies rather uneasy and this perhaps makes it worth while to preoccupy it in order to keep it out of the enemys hands erecting a small but strong work there capable of containing about two hundred men with six or eight pieces of light cannon and a proportionable quantity of stores    as the approaches to it are difficult on account of the adjacent creeks and a communication can be kept open between it and our army by which means the garrison might receive succors from time to time though we could not expect to make it impregnable yet we should have a prospect of holding it much longer than we could the work at billingsport in the position which from my present view of it i should think it best for our army to take the left wing of it would be nearly opposite to redbank and therefore in a condition to relieve and support it whereas billingsport being more remote from the probable position of the army and detached from any other work could not easily derive any assistance from without and must rely wholly upon its own strength either at billingsport or at fort island i believe there is not much to be apprehended from the fire of the enemys ships unaided by land batteries for as by the information of those who ought to be acquainted with the fact not more than three ships can act abreast at a time at either place and as the gallies not requiring the same depth of water can extend themselves at pleasure and besides carry a superior weight of metal to that which frigates commonly have a much superior fire could be opposed to them than any they could bring and from the difference of size and make between the frigates and gallies to much better effect than theirs the comparative extent of the river at billingsport and at fort island has been assigned as a motive of preference    to the former the river being narrower there than at the latter and supposed to admit of fewer ships operating at a time but as it is asserted by the gentlemen in the river department that the sand banks and shallowness of the river in most places near fort island compensate for the width of it and make it impossible for more than three ships to act together at a time this reason of preferring the position at billingsport seems to have no foundation and if we consider that our whole force of gallies and floating batteries would be collected at fort island assisted by the fort itself and that it would not be safe to trust them all out for the defence of billingsport for fear of the disaster already suggested it seems evident enough that this is the place where our defence may be most successfully made one of the most weighty considerations with me is that our army as before intimated could more conveniently cooperate with the defence by water here than at billingsport the ground on this side is better situated here than at the other place and the army being so much nearer the city it is so much the less likely that the enemy should be able by a circuitous rout to fall into the rear of it and separate it from the city which is a circumstance that ought carefully to be attended to some gentlemen are of opinion that our principal dependence ought to be upon fort island and its appendages but at the same time that we should make a part of our defence at billingsport proposing for that purpose that the works there should be continued    on the new contracted scale to be garrisoned by four or five hundred men the reasons for this are—that it would serve to delay the enemy and give our army time to come up should it be at any distance and that it would prevent those disagreeable impressions which never fail to accompany the abandoning works that have been once raised and plans that have been once in execution especially when the persons concerned in the defence of them repose a degree of confidence in them—which is said to be the case in the present instance but these reasons may perhaps not be so conclusive as tis imagined—for tis a question whether if our army was so remote as to make such a delay necessary the enemy would embarass themselves with removing the water obstructions in the first place but would not rather debark and make a rapid march by land possessing themselves of the city and of those positions which would make the surrender of the gallies c in some sort a natural consequence and it is worthy of consideration whether the abandoning the works begun at this time which will probably allow some leisure for any disagreeable impressions it might make to be effaced will not be less injurious than the abandoning them hereafter when they have cost more expence time and labor and in the critical moment of an attack when every misfortune and the loss of the most inconsiderable post is too apt to have a much worse influence on the mind than the real importance of it will justify add to this the possibility that the garrison dismayed at the approach of numbers so superior to their own    might not answer the end expected from them and might even be lost by their timidity—the certainty of losing the cannon after the time limited for the defence and thereby weakening that of the upper position—the chance of losing the gallies and floating batteries requisite for covering the chevaux de frize by a hazardous and successful attempt to break through them and the garrison with them which would fall of course upon such an event—it is however submitted to congress to ballance the advantages and disadvantages and determine accordingly i would only beg leave to give it clearly as my opinion that our principal dependence ought to be upon fort island and the obstructions there and that billingsport ought not by any means to be defended more than as a secondary object and to that end i would recommend that the works on fort island which on their present construction are by no means calculated for the defence of the chevaux de frize be immediately altered and adapted to that purpose taking care at the same time to make them defensible with a small number of men against any sudden attempt to land in boats and carry them by assault—but whatever scheme is pursued i could wish the greatest diligence and despatch may be used in bringing it to maturity for though the danger which lately threatened seems to have subsided there is no knowing how soon it may return and certainly it will be prudent to do every thing in our power to be prepared for it as we can lose nothing by being so and may lose a great deal    by neglecting to improve the interval of leisure they have given us should it be their intention to revisit this quarter as the means to this—it will be necessary to furnish mr coudray to whom the superintendency of those works is intrusted with a competent number of workmen tools and what other things he may want to enable him to carry them on with propriety ease and expedition on the whole i am of opinion that the obstructions in the river with the help of gallies floating batteries and with tolerable industry to put the land works in a proper state will be extremely formidable to the enemy and authorise a reasonable expectation of their being effectual the fire ships also will contribute to this end for though there are many obstacles that render their success precarious and a happy concurrence of circumstances is necessary towards it any of which failing may disappoint the project and there is therefore no room to be sanguine yet there is some probability of its succeeding and they will be at least an embarassment and terror to the enemy and will oblige them to use precautions inconvenient to them and serviceable to us as an accurate knowledge of the country is essential to a good defence and as the enemys approach may be sudden and we may be called to act without having time when it happens to examine it sufficiently if it is not done beforehand it would answer a valuable purpose to have it immediately carefully reconnoitred and sketches taken of all the landing places great roads and byepaths in camping grounds    heights rivers creeks morasses and every thing that it can be of any importance to know marcus hook seems to be the most advanced place at which it is conjectured the enemy will land the survey should therefore comprehend all the country between that  philia mr du coudray has offered his services with his engineers to do this business if authorized by congress only requiring that they be supplied with horses and a hand or two if congress approve of it i shall be glad they may be desired to enter upon it without loss of time i have the honor c  george washington    august      bucks county majorgeneral putnam to majorgeneral putnam camp in bucks county    august      dear sir i recd yours of the  th instant at this place i was upon the march with the army to recross the delaware upon a supposition that the fleet had certainly gone to the eastward but i was last night overtaken by an express from philadelphia with an account    that they had been seen on the  th instant off sinepuxent inlet about sixteen leagues to the southward of the capes of delaware upon this i have halted for further intelligence under the present situation of affairs i can give you no better direction than to remain at your post and collect all the force that you possibly can the season of the year is to be sure inconvenient for the militia to be out but the necessity of the case requires that as many as possibly can must be retained in service for if genl burgoyne persists in his advance upon our northern army we must afford them support or suffer him to make himself master of all the country above my last letter to you directed you to consider well whether you could spare the two new york regiments to genl schuylers army if genl clinton is left upon york island with the number of men you mention it is undoubtedly for some other reason than merely to keep the post it is probably to attack you below while burgoyne comes down upon you it is a matter of great consequence to ascertain that fact deserters and people of that class always speak of numbers from report indeed scarce any person can form a judgment except they see the troops paraded and can count their divisions but if you can by any means obtain a list of the regiments left upon the island we can compute the number of men within a few hundreds over or under i beg you will use every method to come at a knowledge of this let your spies also be very particular in their inquiry whether genl clinton is actually upon the    island for an officer of his rank and military estimation would scarcely be left to keep garrison only  it has been reported that there was a collection of wagons and horses making at kingsbridge if so it can be for no purpose but to move out and this therefore is another fact of which you should endeavour to know the truth till you are fully satisfied in the above particulars i think you should upon no account keep any more than light parties down towards kings bridge for if there is any design against your post from that quarter they might by a sudden embarkation and a favorable wind get between you and the mountains should you fall down with any considerable body i am glad to hear that govr clinton has determined to resume the command of fort montgomery for there cannot be a properer man upon every account i am c   0 george washington augt         lieutenants bird richard dorsey john craig n buxton moore george gray to lieutenants bird dorsey craig moore and gray  camp at the cross roads augt         gentn in answer to your respective letters without date but presented to me yesterday you will please to be informd first that the pay of the horse officers was fixed in december last and at the same rates now existing and secondly that i am not conscious of ever having said or done any thing that could lead to a belief that the rank of a lieut of horse was to be equal to a captain of foot for the obvious reasons that neither justice or usage would authorize it how it came to pass then that you should conceive your selves entitled to the rank and pay of such officers is neither my business nor inclination to enquire into—this however i shall add—that if your respective applications to resign is the effect of hasty resolutions you may take till tomorrow to reconsider and recall your letters—but if on the other    hand you shd then be in the same mind i shall be ready to receive your commissions if they have been deliverd or give dismissions if they have not— your wishes to resign at such a period as this after time is allowed for reconsideration will be sufficient evidence with me that it is a disinclination to the service and not the mere disappointment of rank and pay that causes it and therefore it may be unnecessary for me to add that any future application from either of you to get into the continental service will be improper and as far as it is in my power to make it so unavailing—i am c  george washington    august      governor clinton to governor clinton camp at cross roads    august      dear sir your favor of the   th with the inclosed papers are before me— i wish the accounts of the two actions near fort schuyler had been more clear and intelligible than they are as more dependence could then be placed on the authoriticity of the particulars and a stronger assurance formed of the advantages being as fully on our side as they are there represented if the loss of    some of their most spirited leaders which happened on these occasions do not operate too forcibly on the minds of the people in that quarter i should imagine these little successes might be productive of valuable consequences the indians we know are not a very persevering people but on the contrary are apt to be discouraged by the most trifling miscarriages and two rebuffs like these would be no inconsiderable inducements with them to abandon the british troops and leave them to prosecute the business alone these little reverses of fortune will also have their influence in abating that confidence which their former uninterrupted success has inspired into the enemy and will tend proportionably to revive the drooping spirits of our army—i shall be obliged to you when you receive any more explicit intelligence of what has happened to communicate it to me i see with the most sensible pleasure the exertions of your state dismembered as it is and under every discouragement and disadvantage i lament that any causes are sufficiently powerful to prevent that effectual aid from your eastern neighbors which the interest of the public cause and the immediate safety of your particular state so pressingly demand at this time but though it is dilatory in coming i cannot but hope it will still come before it is too late i imagine one cause and not the least material of their delay is an apprehension of general howes army it were to be wished his designs were once reduced to a certainty this i should be in hopes would serve to remove that inactivity and indecision which    i believe proceed in a great measure from suspense and uncertainty i am however advised that a body of new hampshire militia under general stark had joined general lincoln at bennington and another of massachusetts militia was partly arrived and the rest arriving at the same place a tolerable body of men once collected there would make mr burgoyne anxious for his rear oblige him to advance circumspectly and to leave such strong posts behind as must make his main body very weak and extremely capable of being repulsed by the force we shall have in front i should not be very uneasy for the issue if i could once see our northern army recovered from their present dejection and restored to a tolerable degree of confidence and animation in addition to the two regiments that are gone from peekskill i am forwarding as fast as possible to join the northern army colonel morgans corps of riflemen amounting to about five hundred these are all chosen men selected from the army at large well acquainted with the use of rifles and with that mode of fighting which is necessary to make them a good counterpoise to the indians and have distinguished themselves on a variety of occasions since the formation of the corps in skirmishes with the enemy i expect the most eminent services from them and i shall be mistaken if their presence does not go far towards producing a general desertion among the savages i should think it would be well even before their arrival to begin to circulate these ideas with proper embellishments throughout the    country and in the army and to take pains to communicate them to the enemy it would not be amiss among other things to magnify numbers  i am of opinion with the council of safety that your presence to the northward might have a very happy influence and if it were compatible with the many other calls there are and will be upon you i could wish to see you with the northern army at the head of the militia of your state from some expressions in a letter which i have seen written by general lincoln to general schuyler i am led to infer it is in contemplation to unite all the militia and continental troops in one body and make an opposition wholly in front if this is really the intention i should think it a very ineligible plan an enemy can always act with more vigor and effect when they have nothing to apprehend for their flanks and rear than when they have and it is one of the most approved and most universally practised manœuvers of war to keep their fears continually awake on these accounts and when circumstances permit to be actually in condition to give them serious annoyance in those parts independent of the inconveniences that attend a situation where the rear and flanks are constantly exposed to the insults of light parties which may be at every moment harassing them the necessity of never losing sight of the means    of a secure retreat which ought to be the first object of an officers care must be exceedingly embarrassing where there is a force in such a position as to endanger it if a respectable body of men were to be stationed on the grants it would undoubtedly have the effects intimated above would render it not a little difficult for general burgoyne to keep the necessary communication open and they would frequently afford opportunities of intercepting his convoys if there should be none there he might advance with security leaving small posts behind and might draw his supplies regularly and without interruption than which nothing could tend more to facilitate his operations and give them success these reasons make it clearly my opinion that a sufficient body of militia should always be reserved in a situation proper to answer those purposes if there should be more collected than is requisite for this use the surplusage may with propriety be added to the main body of the army i am not however so fully acquainted with every circumstance that ought to be taken into consideration as to pretend to do any thing more than advise in the matter let those on the spot determine and act as appears to them most prudent i am c p s it is most probable that genl schuyler will have put it out of the enemys power to avail themselves of the convenience of water carriage by removing all boats out of the way if however this necessary precaution should not have occurred to him it would be proper to remind him that all means of    facilitating their progress down the river should be cut off as speedily as possible  george washington    august      benjamin franklin to benjamin franklin in paris headquarters    august      sir i have been honored with your favor of the  d of april by monsieur de cenis written in behalf of that gentleman on the credit of monsieur turgots recommendation i should have been happy had it been in my power in deference to your recommendation founded upon that of so respectable a character as monsieur turgot to afford monsieur de cenis the encouragement to which his zeal and trouble in coming to america to offer his services give him a claim to but such is the situation of things in our army at this time that i am necessarily deprived of that satisfaction our troops being already formed and fully officered and the number of foreign gentlemen already commissioned and continually arriving with fresh applications throw such obstacles in the way of any future appointments that every new arrival is only a new source of embarrassment to congress and myself and of disappointment and chagrin to the gentlemen    who come over had there been only a few to provide for we might have found employment for them in a way advantageous to the service and honorable to themselves but as they have come over in such crowds we either must not employ them or we must do it at the expense of one half of the officers of the army which you must be sensible would be attended with the most ruinous effects and could not fail to occasion a general discontent it is impossible for these gentlemen to raise men for themselves and it would be equally impolitic and unjust to displace others who have been at all the trouble and at considerable expense in raising corps in order to give them the command even where vacancies happen there are always those who have a right of succession by seniority and who are as tenacious of this right as of the places they actually hold and in this they are justified by the common principle and practice of all armies and by resolutions of congress were these vacancies to be filled by the foreign officers it would not only cause the resignation of those who expect to succeed to them but it would serve to disgust others both through friendship to them and from an apprehension of their being liable to the same inconvenience themselves this by rendering the hope of preferment precarious would remove one of the principal springs of emulation absolutely necessary to be upheld in an army besides this difficulty the error we at first fell into of prodigally bestowing rank upon foreigners without examining properly their pretensions having led us    to confer high ranks upon those who had none or of a very inferior degree in their own country it now happens that those who have really good pretensions who are men of character abilities and rank will not be contented unless they are introduced into some of the highest stations of the army in which it needs no arguments to convince you it is impossible to gratify them hence their dissatisfaction and the difficulty of employing them are increased these obstacles reduce us to this dilemma either we must refuse to commission them at all and leave all the expense trouble and risk that have attended their coming over uncompensated or we must commission them without being able to incorporate or employ them by which means enjoying the public pay and an unmeaning rank they must submit to the mortification of being mere ciphers in the army this last to some of them may not be disagreeable but to men of sentiment and who are actuated by a principle of honor and a desire to distinguish themselves it must be humiliating and irksome in the extreme from these considerations it would be both prudent and just to discourage their coming over by candidly opening the difficulties they have to encounter and if after that they will persist in it they can only blame themselves i am sensible sir that it is a delicate and perplexing task to refuse applications of persons patronized as i suppose often happens by some of the first characters in the kingdom where you are and whose favor it is of importance to conciliate but i beg leave to suggest whether it would not be    better to do that than by compliance to expose them to those mortifications which they must unavoidably experience and which they are too apt to impute to other causes than the true and may represent under very disadvantageous colors permit me also to observe to you that even where you do not promise any thing but simply give a line of recommendation they draw as strong an assurance of success from that as from a positive engagement and estimate the hardship of a disappointment nearly the same in the one case as in the other i am c  george washington    august      benjamin harrison to benjamin harrison in congress neshaminy bridge    august      dear sir if i did not misunderstand what you or some other member of congress said to me respecting the appointment of the marquis de lafayette he has misconceived the design of his appointment or congress did not understand the extent of his views for certain it is if i understood him that he does not conceive his commission is merely honorary but given  0 with a view to command a division of this army it is true he has said that he is young and inexperienced but at the same time has always accompanied it with a hint that so soon as i shall think him fit for the command of a division he shall be ready to enter upon the duties of it and in the mean time has offered his service for a smaller command to which i may add that he has actually applied to me by direction he says from mr hancock for commissions for his two aidsdecamp what the designs of congress respecting this gentleman were and what line of conduct i am to pursue to comply with their design  his expectations i know no more than the child unborn and beg to be instructed if congress meant that this rank should be unaccompanied by command i wish it had been sufficiently explained to him if on the other hand it was intended to vest him with all the powers of a majorgeneral why have i been led into a contrary belief and left in the dark with respect to my own conduct towards him this difficulty with the numberless applications for employment by foreigners under their respective appointments adds no    small embarrassment to a command which without it is abundantly perplexed by the different tempers i have to do with  different modes which the respective states have pursued to nominate  arrange their officers the combination of all which is but a too just representation of a great chaos from whence we are endeavoring how successfully time can only tell to draw some regularity and order i was going to address congress for instructions in the case of the marquis de lafayette but upon second thought concluded to ask some direction of my conduct in this matter through a member and therefore have imposed this task upon you let me beseech you then my good sir to give me the sentiments of congress on this matter that i may endeavor as far as it is in my power to comply with them with respect to commissions for his aiddecamps i told him that i should write to mr hancock about them and i wish to be instructed the marquis is now in philadelphia but expected up this day or tomorrow with sincere regard i am c     george washington    august      brigadiergeneral wayne to brigadiergeneral wayne neshamini camp    august      i wish thro you sir to return my thanks to the pennsylvania officers who subscribed the memorial you delivered me a few days since for the obliging sentiments they are pleased to entertain of me—at the same time you will inform them that i am fully sensible of the justice in which their complaint respecting the exorbitant price of goods and necessaries is founded and that i painfully foresee the disagreeable consequences the measure leads to my wishes are that the abuse of which they complain should be restrained but i know not how it is to be effected i have represented the matter to the congress and have the most implicit confidence that they will adopt any means that are practicable to remedy the evil they feel it sensibly—and it is felt by all but a mode of redress i fear will be difficult to find as it has ever been in instances of a like nature i am not sanguine in my expectations that they will remove the grievance totally yet i should hope that it may be done in part thro their deliberations and the interposition of the legislative and executive powers in the several states i can only    assure the gentlemen i shall ever be happy in affording my exertions to suppress any public abuses so far as shall be compatible with my situation more i am persuaded they will never wish or expect of me    in respect to the period from which the augmented pay is to be drawn the line has been already settled by congress they determined that the officers appointed to serve in the present army should receive it from the time of their appointments by their respective states in conformity to this rule they have been paid without deviation that i recollect if there are any who have not it has been owing to their own omissions—or if the augmented pay has been extended in any case to a remoter period for its commencement it escaped my observation i would also add that if this resolution had not been passed i should not have considered myself authorized to grant warrants for the augmented pay of any time preceding the  st of january conceiving that the old would have continued till the last of december that being the day when the service of the late army generally expired—and that the augmented pay was intended for the new i am c george washington  0 august      bucks coty majorgeneral gates to majorgeneral gates headquarters bucks coty  0 august      sir by a letter from genl schuyler of the   th instant it appears that you had not reachd stillwater at that time since which i have not had any accounts from    you but expect you had arrivd there soon after that date from the various representations made to me of the disadvantage the army lay under particularly the militia from an apprehension of the indian mode of fighting i have despatched colo morgan with his corps of riflemen to your assistance  expect they will be with you in eight days from this date this corps i have great dependence on  have no doubt but they will be exceedingly useful as a check given to the savages  keeping them within proper bounds will prevent genl burgoyne from getting intelligence as formerly  animate your other troops from a sense of their being more on an equality with the enemy  coles cortlandts and colonel livingstons regiments are also on their way from peekskill to join you they must of course be with you in a very few days with these reinforcements besides the militia under general lincoln which by this time must be pretty considerable i am in hopes you will find yourself at least equal to stop the progress of mr burgoyne  by cutting of his supplies of provision ca to render his situation very ineligible since the enemys fleet was seen off sinepuxent the  th inst we have no accts from them which can    be depended on i am now of opinion that charles town is the present object of general howes attention though for what sufficient reason unless he expected to drag this army after him by appearing at different places  thereby leave the country open for genl clinton to march out and endeavor to form a junction with genl burgoyne i am at a loss to determine general schuylers sending a reinforcement up to fort schuyler i think was absolutely necessary  i am of opinion that particular attention should be paid to the inroads leading to that quarter as a successful stroke of the enemy there might be a means of encouraging the whole of the six nations to unite against us i am sir c george washington    august      to the president of congress neshaminy camp    august      sir from the time which has elapsed since general howe departed from the capes of delaware there is the strongest reason to conclude that he is gone either far to the eastward or southward and with a design to execute some determind plan the danger of the sea the injury his troops  horses must sustain from being so long confind the loss of time so late in the campaign will scarcely admit a supposition that he is merely making a feint and still intends to return either to the delaware or the north river without performing some enterprise first in another quarter the probability is in favor of a southern    expedition because he has been seen since his departure from the capes off sinepuxent steering a southern course and because had his destination been to the eastward his arrival there from the general state of the winds must have announced it before this or his fleet wold have been discovered by some of the cruisers on that coast if he is gone to the southward he must be gone far that way for had the chesapeake bay been his object he would have been there long since and the fact well established beyond that there is no place short of charlestown of sufficient importance to engage his attention the extensive commerce the vast accumulation of military and other stores in that town and its dependencies with the eclat it would give his arms if he should unfortunately take it afford him stronger inducements to direct his operations there than he could possibly have elsewhere matters being thus circumstanced an important question arises how this army is to be employed if his intentions are such as i have supposed them it appears to me that an attempt to follow him would not only be fruitless but would be attended with the most ruinous consequences the distance is so immense that genl howe might accomplish every purpose he had in view before we could possibly arrive to oppose him and so long a march through an unhealthy climate at this season would debilitate and waste a principal part of our force added to this after we had made a considerable progress he might easily reëmbark his troops and turn his arms against    philadelphia or elsewhere as he should think proper without our being in a condition to give the least aid as these and many other reasons which will readily occur to congress will show the impracticability of our counteracting genl howe with any good effect in that quarter we have no other alternative left than to remain here idle  inactive on the remote probability of his returning this way or to proceed towards hudsons river with a view of opposing genl burgoyne or making an attempt on york island as the situation of affairs shall point out a successful stroke with respect to either wod be attended with the most signal advantages and would be the best compensation we could make for any losses we may sustain to the southward besides these considerations if after all our conjectures and reasoning upon the subject genl howe should be gone to the eastward to coöperate with mr burgoyne the army will be by the movement proposed so far on its way to prevent i hope the success of his enterprise the above reasons led me to call a council of genl officers this morning to take the subject of removing the troops from hence into consideration and i am happy to inform congress they were in sentiments with me upon the occasion as they will perceive by a copy of the proceedings then had which i do myself the honor of laying before them nevertheless as it is a movement which may involve the most important consequences i have thought proper to submit it to congress for their deliberation  decision if it is deemed expedient we have perhaps not a moment to    lose in carrying it into execution and under this persuasion i have sent colol hamilton one of my aids who will have the honor of delivering this to bring me the result of their opinion  as the northern department has been all along considered separate  in some measure distinct and there are special resolves vesting the command in particular persons—in case it should hereafter appear eligible to unite the two armies it may perhaps be necessary that congress should place the matter upon such a footing as to remove all scruples or difficulties about the command that could possibly arise on my arrival there this i request from a disposition to harmony  from my knowing the ill  fatal consequences that have often arisen from such controversies and not from the most distant apprehension that one would take place upon such an event the thing however is possible and to guard against it can do no injury i have the honor to be c    p s that i may not appear inconsistent to advise and to act before i obtain an opinion i beg leave to mention that i shall move the army to the delaware tomorrow morning to change their ground at any rate as their present encampment begins to be disagreeable and would injure their health in a short time our forage also begins to grow scarce here  george washington    august      to the president of congress  camp at cross roads    august      sir i am honored with your favor containing the intelligence of the enemys arrival in chesapeake bay and the resolution of congress thereupon i have in consequence of this account sent orders to general nash immediately to embark his brigade and col procters corps of artillery if vessels can be procured for the purpose and to proceed to chester or if  0 vessels cannot be provided to hasten towards that place by land with all the despatch he can i have also directed general sullivan to join this army with his division as speedily as possible and i have issued orders for all the troops here to be in motion tomorrow morning very early with intention to march them towards philadelphia i am happy to find congress have ordered the removal of the stores from lancaster and york to places of greater safety which is without doubt a very proper and necessary measure with much respect and esteem i have the honor to be sir your most obedient servant george washington    august      to the president of congress    august      sir i beg leave to inform you that the army marched early this morning and i expect will encamp this evening within five or six miles of philadelphia tomorrow morning it will move again and i think to march it thro the city but without halting i am induced to do this from the opinion of several of my officers and many friends in philadelphia that it may have some influence on the minds of the disaffected there and those who are dupes to their artifices and opinions the march will be down front and up chesnut street and i presume about seven oclock  notwithstanding the arrival of the enemys    fleet in the chesapeake bay and the seeming probability that genl howe will debark his troops and attempt something yet i would take the liberty to mention that i think the several works for the defence of the city should be carried on with the usual industry and that no pains should be omitted to complete em i would also advise that the same lookouts for intelligence should be continued at the capes and the earliest information communicated of any thing material for tho the fleet is in chesapeake bay the enemy may push in a number of vessels with troops and make an effort to effect some stroke agst philadelphia by surprise such an event does not seem probable while they have a large show of force in a neighboring state but it will be prudent to guard against it i have the honor to be c p s i think some directions should be given genl armstrong respecting the militia  george washington    august      wilmington to the president of congress wilmington six oclock pm    august      sir the enclosed intelligence has just come to my hands genl greenes and general stephens divisions are within a few miles of this place i shall    order them to march immediately here  the two other divisons halted this day at derby to refresh themselves but they will come on as expeditiously as possible there are about five hundred pennsylvania militia at chester and marcus hook that are armed there are a number more unarmed i have ordered all the armed immediately down  i do not know what number of militia of this state are yet collected but i am told they turn out with great alacrity there are a quantity of public and private stores at the head of elk which i am afraid will fall into the enemys hands if they advance quickly among others there is a considerable parcel of salt every attempt will be made to save that when i get my force collected i shall dispose of it in the most advantageous manner in my power to this end i purpose to view the grounds towards the enemy in the morning i am yet a stranger to them  i have the honor to be c    george washington    august      wilmington to the president of congress wilmington    august      sir i this morning returned from the head of elk which i left last night in respect to the enemy i have nothing new to communicate they remain where they debarked at first i could not find out from inquiry what number is landed nor form an estimate of it from the distant view i had of their encampment but few tents were to be seen from iron hill and grays hill which are the only eminences about elk i am happy to inform you that all the public stores are removed from thence except about seven thousand bushels of corn this i urged the commissary there to get off as soon as possible and hope it will be effected in the course of a few days if the enemy should not prevent it which their situation gives them but too easy an opportunity of doing the scarcity of teams in proportion to the demand will render the removal rather tedious tho i have directed the qr master to send some from hence to expedite the measure a part of the delaware militia are stationed there  and about nine hundred more from pennsylvania are now on the march that way i also intended to move part of the army that way today but am under the necessity of deferg it till their arms are put in order and they are furnished    with ammunition both having been greatly injured by the heavy rain that fell yesterday and last night i have the honor to be c george washington    august      wilmington majorgeneral sullivan to majorgeneral sullivan wilmington    august      sir i have received your two favors both of the   th informing me of the particulars of an expedition you have lately made to staten island it is unfortunate that an affair which had so prosperous a beginning should have terminated so disagreeably as in a great measure to defeat the good consequences that might have attended it i am however glad to hear that the officers and men distinguished themselves by their good behavior and if there are any who behaved more remarkably well than others i should be happy to take all the notice of them consistent with propriety that their conduct may appear to merit i am not sufficiently acquainted with circumstances to form a certain judgment of what might have been expected from this expedition but from the view i have of them and from your own representation of the matter the situation of the enemy seems to have been such as afforded an opportunity of reaping much more decisive advantages than were in fact gained as your division must no doubt have been greatly harassed in this movement their health might be very much injured by pressing them too hard in their march to join me i would therefore wish you to    spare them as much as may be necessary to avoid that inconvenience at the same time there ought to be no delay but what a proper attention to the health and accommodation of the men really demands i am c george washington    august      wilmington general cadwalader to general cadwalader wilmington    august      dear sir genl howe has advanced part of his force about two miles this side of the head of elk and from the information of deserters and prisoners there is reason to believe he is either marching or soon will be towards philadelphia if that is his object and of which there can be but little doubt i think many important advantages would be derived from the militias hanging on his rear or right flank after he leaves elk while he is opposed by this army in front or in such other way as shall seem most adviseable from circumstances but then i am wholly at a loss to whom to address myself respecting the militia on the eastern shore not knowing their officers or where they are assembling the congress thought proper to point out genl smallwood and colo gist to arrange and conduct them who owing i suppose to a miscarriage of the dispatches that were sent em have not yet reached this place nor have i heard any thing of them matters being thus circumstanced and as the aid of the militia is extremely necessary and no time is to be lost in obtaining it i must request your good offices and interest in assisting to    assemble spirit up and forward them in the best manner you can towards the head of the bay that they may be in a situation to annoy the enemy should they make a push against philadelphia giving such advice and direction to the officers as shall appear to you necessary and proper i know well that your situation in this instance will be delicate and not a little embarrassing i feel myself in that predicament yet i trust the exigency of our affairs will not only furnish an apology but will fully justifie your interesting yourself upon this subject for the requisition i have made i shall offer no apology it is the result of necessity and founded in the most implicit confidence that you are and will be ready upon all occasions to afford every aid in your power to advance the true interest and happiness of your country influenced by these considerations i have made it and have only to add that i am c  george washington  0 august      wilmington to the president of congress wilmington  0 august      sir since i had the honor of addressing you yesterday nothing of importance has occurred and the enemy remain as they then were i was reconnoitring the    country and different roads all yesterday  am now setting out on the same business again sensible of the advantages of light troops i have formed a corps under the command of a brigadier by drafting a hundred from each brigade which is to be constantly near the enemy and to give em every possible annoyance i have the honor to be c ten oclock—this minute twentyfour british    prisoners arrived taken yesterday by captain lee of the lighthorse  george washington   september      wilmington to the president of congress wilmington   september      sir the latest and most material intelligence i have obtained respecting the enemy you will find in the enclosed papers which i do myself the honor of transmitting to you how far the enemy have it in view to extend themselves in a line from bay to bay i cannot determine but the idea has taken place with many and it is said to be founded on their hints to some persons who from accidents in some instances  perhaps choice in others have had a more familiar intercourse with them i cannot suppose they have any such design or if they have that it can be more than temporary for procuring supplies of provisions genl howes declaration is agreeable to his constant usage and is what we might reasonably expect the only difference is the present exhibition is stiled a declaration it is another effort to seduce the people to give up their rights and to encourage our soldiery to desert  the facts contained in the deposition of francis alexander which you have also    enclosed seem to be opposed to that regularity and good discipline which are promised by the declaration yesterday there was some skirmishing between one of our advanced parties and one of the enemys in which they were obliged to retreat with the loss of an officer  three men killed according to report we had one private wounded i have received no particular accounts respecting the maryland eastern shore militia from the best information i have a great many are well disposed to turn out but are prevented giving their aid thro the want of arms apprehending that the militia there would stand in need of an officer to arrange them i wrote to genl cadwalader requesting his good offices which i am told have been exerted colol gist is now gone down and i expect will move on as soon as possible with such as are armed towards the enemy genl smallwood is gone to take the command of those on the western shore of which i hear many are collecting but i have no authentic advices on the subject i have the honor to be c p s will it not be advisable to order colo richardsons regiment from their present station to march and join the eastern shore militia  0 george washington   september      wilmington governor livingston to governor livingston headquarters wilmington   september      sir i have been duly honored with your several favors of the   th    and    ulto and observe their contents  from the papers you have sent there can remain no doubt that mr troups  true errand what ever may be his ostensible one was to recruit men for the british army and after being so clearly detected should he escape punishment it cannot fail to have the disagreeable influence you mention on the minds of the people and to be an encouragement to other adventurers as a similar instance however has not before come under my direction i have ordered a special courtmartial on the occasion composed of men of judgment and moderation to sit upon the occasion and i have every reason to expect their decision will be dispassionate and well founded it is doubted whether the military jurisdiction comprehends a case of this kind this will be well considered and if the court can with propriety go into the trial and their sentence should be such as it is naturally to be expected it will be i do not think from my    present view of the matter that it will be in my power to mitigate or remit his punishment though i shall sensibly feel for his friends who cannot but be deeply affected by his fate your reason for not entering upon the business of dividing the state districts till the ensuing meeting of the assembly is entirely satisfactory—i have no doubt you are sufficiently impressed with the importance of carrying the measure into speedy execution and will use all your influence to have it done i am sorry you have no better prospect as to the number of militia you expect collect but considering all the circumstances you mention it is not to be wondered at that a people harrassed and exhausted by having their country so long the seat of the war should be unwilling to quit their homes especially when they have an enemy still at their doors i am fully convinced of the pernicious consequences of that abuse of passports you speak of the liberty that has been taken in granting them was altogether unauthorized by me and contrary to my wish—i am glad to find you are determined to put a stop to the practice with respect to your militia officers who alone will now have it in their power to continue it as the continental troops are all called away and doctor barnet who has been so peculiarly culpable and who had not a shadow of right to grant a single passport will also be immediately removed     you will ere this have heard of the enemys advancing from the place of their first landing and occupying with their van a piece of highground called greigshill they still remain in this position and it is difficult to say how soon they will alter it all accounts agree that they are very much distressed for want of horses numbers of which it is said died on the passage and the best are in exceeding bad order this will probably occasion some delay and give time for the militia who seem to be collecting pretty fast to join us we have light parties constantly hovering about them who frequently make a few prisoners  and will be no inconsiderable check upon them they have as yet experienced little countenance from the inhabitants and as we have accounts of their perpetrating outrages similar to those they have committed    elsewhere i am in hopes their conduct here as in other places will not be of a complexion to concilitate many new partisans to their cause p s since writing the above the judge advocate of the court martial above mentioned has called upon me and reported that the court had proceeded upon the tryal of the prisoner but on account of one point of his defence which requires time to be investigated had postponed their final decision and adjourned to a future day the   th inst mr troup pretends that he came out with design to avail himself of the offer of grace held out in your proclamation but finding the people much exasperated against him and hearing that a man had been hanged who had applied for the benefit of that proclamation he was deterred from applying to you in person till he had made his peace through the mediation of a third person  secured his terms that for this purpose he had communicated his intention to one philip schout  his mother residing near charlottenburgh who were to intercede with a certain mr donoworth that lives with mr erskind at ringwood in order to engage him to solicit you in his mr troups behalf he lays great stress upon this though it is probably a mere pretence but as the court have indulged him with time to have his witnesses produced i shall be much obliged to you to notify the persons above mentioned that their immediate attendance at head qrs is required and to have them sent on without delay—you will also be pleased to inform yourself of their characters particularly in a political light    george washington   september      wilmington to the president of congress wilmington eight oclock p m   september      sir i have this minute returned to headqrs where i found your favor of this date with the resolves respecting genl sullivan and colol richardsons battalion i had conversed with genl sullivan upon the subject and observed to him that it was necessary an inquiry should be had relative to the affair at staten island as his conduct was censured and much dissatisfaction prevailed he was sensible of the propriety of the measure and expressed a desire that it should take place provided he could have the benefit of genl smallwoods testimony who was on the expedition that gentleman happens at this time to be in maryland which must necessarily delay the inquiry unless some mode can be agreed upon for obtaining his sentiments upon the matter  this morning the enemy came out with a considerable force and three pieces of artillery against our light advanced corps and after some pretty smart skirmishing obliged them to retreat being far inferior in number and without cannon the loss on either side is not yet ascertained ours tho not exactly known is not very considerable theirs we have reason to believe was much greater as some of our parties composed of expert marksmen had opportunities of giving them several close welldirected fires    more particularly in one instance when a body of riflemen formed a kind of ambuscade they advanced about two miles this side of iron hill and then withdrew to that place leaving a picket at couchs mill about a mile in front our parties now lie at whiteclay creek except the advanced pickets which are at christiana bridge on monday a large detachment of the enemy landed at cecil courthouse and this morning i had advice of their having advanced on the newcastle road as far as carsons tavern parties of horse were sent out to reconnoiter them which went three miles beyond the red lion but could neither see nor hear of them whence i conjecture they filed off by a road to their left and fell in with their main body the design of their movement this morning seems to have been to disperse our light troops who had been troublesome to em and to gain possession of iron hill to establish a post most probably for covering their retreat in case of accidents i have the honor to be c  george washington   september      wilmington majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath wilmington   september         since general howes debarkation in elk river he has moved on about seven miles his main body now lays at iron hill and ours near a village    called newport  in this position the armies are from eight to ten miles apart it is yet very uncertain what genl howes plan of operations will be some imagine that he will extend himself from the head waters of chesapeake to delaware and by these means not only cut off the counties on the eastern shore of maryland and two of those belonging to the delaware state from affording us any assistance but will secure the horses cattle and forage of which there are considerable quantities in that country this in my opinion considering how far the campaign is already advanced would take up more time than he could spare for supposing him able to form such an extension he would be full as far from philada as he is at present and he would be subject to an attack upon some part of his line which from its length could not be properly supported a few days past he advanced two or three miles forward during which there was pretty sharp skirmishing between our light troops and his van we had about forty killed and wounded and i imagine the enemy had considerably more as ours were thinly posted behind cover and they were in column i am c     george washington   september      wilmington to the president of congress   miles from wilmington   september      sir the enemy advanced yesterday with a seeming intention of attacking us upon our post near newport we waited for em the whole day but in the evening they halted at a place called milltown about two miles from us upon reconnoitring their situation it appeared probable that they only meant to amuse us in front while their real intent was to march by our right and by suddenly passing the brandywine and gaining the heights upon the north side of that river get between us and philadelphia and cut us off from it to prevent this it was judged expedient to change our position immediately the army accordingly marched at two oclock this morning and will take post this evening on the high grounds near chads ford  we have heard nothing circumstantial    of the enemy today when i do i shall immediately transmit to you an account i have the honor to be c    george washington    september      chester to the president of congress  chester twelve oclock at night    september      sir i am sorry to inform you that in this days engagement we have been obliged to leave the enemy masters of the field unfortunately the intelligence recd of the enemys advancing up the brandywine  crossing at a ford about six miles above us was uncertain  contradictory notwithstanding all my pains to get the best this prevented my making a disposition adequate to the force with which the enemy attacked us on our right in consequence of which the troops first engaged were obliged to retire before they could be reinforced in the midst of the attack on our right that body of the enemy which remained on the other side of chads ford crossed it  attacked the division there under the command of general wayne  the light troops under genl maxwell who after a severe conflict also retired the militia under the command of majorgeneral armstrong being posted at a ford about two miles below chads had no opportunity of engaging  0 but altho we fought under many disadvantages and were from the causes above mentioned obliged to retire yet our loss of men is not i am persuaded very considerable i believe much less than the enemys we have also lost seven or eight pieces of cannon according to the best information i can at present obtain the baggage having been previously moved off is all secure saving the mens blankets which being at their backs many of them doubtless were lost i have directed all the troops to assemble behind chester where they are now arranging for this night notwithstanding the misfortune of the day i am happy to find the troops in good spirits and i hope another time we shall compensate for the losses now sustained the marquis de lafayette was wounded in the leg  general woodford in the hand divers other officers were wounded  some slain but the numbers of either cannot now be ascertained i have the honor to be c  p s it has not been in my power to send you earlier intelligence the present being the first leisure moment i have had since the action     george washington    september      germantown to the president of congress headquarters germantown    september      sir i have been honored with your favor of this date i heartily wish the works on the delaware were completed but i think and in this opinion my officers concur that the service will be injured if any part of the continental troops were now to be employed about em if we should be able to oppose general howe with success in the field the works will be unnecessary if not and he should force us from hence he will certainly possess himself of em but to prevent his attempting it now i have directed the meadows on province island to be overflowed immediately and any other grounds that may be thought necessary for that purpose the works have been more peculiarly made under the direction of monsieur ducoudray and i doubt not he will pay every attention to their completion and security that the situation of affairs will admit of a part of the militia under general armstrong will be posted along schuylkill to throw up redoubts at the different fords which will be occasionally occupied while i move to the other side with the main body of the army  this disposition appears to be most eligable from a consideration of all circumstances and better than if any part of our present force was to be employed at the forts if further reinforcements of the    militia should come in perhaps they may be more properly assigned to that business than any we now have your letter respecting general deborre just now came to hand i shall transmit to him a copy of it and of the resolution there can be no court of inquiry into his conduct at this time as soon as the state of the army will admit it will be held  i have the honor to be c george washington    september      buck tavern to the president of congress buck tavern    september        oclock pm sir your favor of yesterday with its several inclosures came to hand last night tho i would willingly pay every attention to the resolutions of congress yet in the late instance respecting the recall of genl sullivan i must beg leave to defer giving any order about it till i hear further from that honble body our situation at this time is critical and delicate and nothing should be done to add to its embarrassments we are now most probably on the point of another action and to derange the army by withdrawing so many genl officers from it may and must be attended with many disagreeable if not ruinous consequences such a proceeding at another time might not produce any bad effects—but how can the army be possibly conducted with a prospect of success if the genl officers are taken off in the moment of battle congress    may rely upon it such a measure will not promote but injure the service it is not my wish to prevent or to delay a proper inquiry into genl sullivans conduct a single instant when the circumstances of the army will admit—but now they prohibit it and i think the suspension in his command also the recall of genl st clair obliged me to part with genl lincoln whom i could but illy spare so that the whole charge of his division is now upon genl wayne there being no other brigadrs in it than himself the maryland troops if genl sullivan is taken away will not have one genl officer genl smallwood being at the head of the militia coming from that state and genl de borre suspended added to this colo gist who commands one regiment of them is now from it by order in a word sir whether the charges alledged against genl sullivan are true or false or whether his conduct has been exceptionable or not i am satisfied the resolution for his recall at this time was unhappily adopted and if carried into execution will not fail to add new difficulties to our present distresses and i am obliged to observe in justice to my own character that i can not be answerable for the consequences which may arise from a want of officers to assist me     it gives me great pleasure to find genl gates is on so respectable a footing and i hope our affairs in that quarter in the course of a little time will be in as prosperous a train as we could reasonably wish the main body of the enemy from the best intelligence i have been able to get lies near dilworth town not far from the field of action where they have been busily employed in burying their dead which from accounts amounted to a very considerable number  we are moving up this road to get between the enemy and the swedes ford and to prevent them from turning our right flank which they seem to have a violent inclination to effect by all their movements i would beg leave to recommend in the most earnest manner that some board or committee be appointed or some mode adopted for obtaining supplies of blankets for the troops many are now without and the season becoming cold they will be injured    in their health and unfitted for service unless they are immediately provided with them our supplies in this instance as well as in every article of cloathing cannot be too great as there are frequent losses not easily to be avoided i would also observe that i think in point of prudence and sound policy every species of provisions should be removed from the city except such as will be necessary to supply the present demands of this army i have been told there are considerable quantities in private hands which should not be suffered to remain a moment longer than they can be conveyed away i have c george washington    september      to the president of congress camp    september      sir i was honored this morning with your favors of the   th    th with their inclosures i am much obliged to congress for the late instance of their confidence expressed in their resolution of the   th and shall be happy if my conduct in discharging the objects they had in view should be such as to meet their approbation  i am now repassing    the schuylkill at parkers ford with the main body of the army which will be over in an hour or two tho it is deep and rapid  genl wayne with the division under his command is on the rear of the enemy and will be joined tomorrow or next day i expect by genl smallwood and colo gist with their corps  as soon as the troops have crossed the river i shall march them as expeditiously as possible towards fatland swedes  the other fords where it is most probable the enemy will attempt to pass when i left germantown with the army i hoped i should have an opportunity of attacking them either in front or on their flank with a prospect of success but unhappily a variety of causes concurred to prevent it our march in the first place was greatly impeded thro want of provisions which delayed us so long that the enemy were apprized of our motions and gained the grounds near the white horse tavern with a part of their army turning our right flank whilst another part composing    the main body were more advanced towards our left we should have disappointed them in their design by getting on their left but the heavy rain which fell on tuesday evening  in the course of that night totally unfitted our guns for service and nearly the whole of the ammunition with which the army had been compleated a day or two before being forty rounds p man at first i expected that the loss was by no means so considerable and intended only to file off with the troops a few miles to replace it  clean the arms  then to proceed on my original plan but on examination i found it as i have mentioned and that we had not a sufficient supply with us to furnish the men with the necessary complement in this situation it was judged necessary that we should proceed as far as reading furnace for the security of the army  on these accounts particularly the latter matters have not been conducted as i intended  wished  the enemy have had an opportunity of making their advances without being attacked i yet hope from the present state of the river that i shall be down in time to give them a meeting and if unfortunately they should gain philadelphia that it will not be without loss i have the honor to be c    george washington    september      alexander hamilton to lieutenantcolonel alexander hamilton camp    september      sir the distressed situation of the army for want of blankets and many necessary articles of cloathing is truly deplorable and must inevitably be destructive to it unless a speedy remedy be applied without a better supply than they at present have it will be impossible for the men to support the fatigues of the campaign in the further progress of the approaching inclement season this you well know to be a melancholy truth it is equally the dictate of common sense and the opinion of the physicians of the army as well as of every officer in it no supply can be drawn from the public magazines we have therefore no resource but from the private stock of individuals i feel and i lament the absolute necessity of requiring the inhabitants to contribute to those wants which we have no other means of satisfying and which if unremoved would involve the ruin of the army and perhaps the ruin of america painful as it is to me to order and as it will be to you to execute the measure i am compelled to desire you immediately to proceed to philadelphia and there procure from the inhabitants contributions of blankets and cloathing and materials to answer the purposes of both in proportion to the ability of each this you will do with as much delicacy and discretion as the nature of the business demands and i trust the necessity will justify the proceeding in the eyes of every person well affected to the american cause and that all good citizens will chearfully afford their    assistance to soldiers whose sufferings they are bound to commiserate and who are eminently exposed to danger and distress in defence of every thing they ought to hold dear as there are also a number of horses in philadelphia both of public and private property which would be a valuable acquisition to the enemy should the city by any accident fall into their hands you are hereby authorized and commanded to remove them thence into the country to some place of greater security and more remote from the operations of the enemy you will stand in need of assistance from others to execute this commission with despatch and propriety and you are therefore empowered to employ such persons as you shall think proper to aid you therein i am sir c   0 george washington    september      pottsgrove to the president of congress camp near pottsgrove    september      sir i have not had the honor of addressing you since your adjournment to lancaster and i sincerely wish that my first letter was upon a more agreeable subject  the enemy by a variety of perplexing manœuvres thro a country from which i could not derive the least intelligence being to a man disaffected contrived to pass the schuylkill last night at the fatland and other fords in the neighborhood of it they marched immediately towards philadelphia and i imagine their advanced parties will be near that city tonight they had so far got the start before i recd certain intelligence that any considerable number had crossed that i found it in vain to think of overtaking their rear with troops harassed as ours had been with constant marching since the battle of brandywine and therefore concluded by the advice of all the genl officers to march from this place tomorrow morning towards philadelphia and on the way endeavor to form a junction with the continental troops under general mcdougall from peekskill and the jersey militia under genl dickinson both of whom are i hope on this side of the delaware     i am also obliged to wait for genl wayne and genl smallwood who were left upon the other side of schuylkill in hopes of falling upon the enemys rear but they have eluded them as well as us when i last recrossed the schuylkill it was with a firm intent of giving the enemy battle wherever i should meet them and accordingly advanced as far as the warren tavern upon the lancaster road near which place the two armies were upon the point of coming to a general engagement but were prevented by a most violent flood of rain which continued all the day and following night  when it held up we had the mortification to find that our ammunition which had been compleated to forty rounds a man was entirely ruined and in that situation we had nothing left for it but to find out a strong piece of ground which we could easily maintain till we could get the arms put in order and a recruit of ammunition before this could be fully effected the enemy marched from their position near the white horse tavern down the road leading to the swedes ford i immediately crossed the schuylkill above them and threw myself full in their front hoping to meet them in their passage or soon after they had passed the river the day before yesterday    they were again in motion and marched rapidly up the road leading towards reading this induced me to believe that they had two objects in view one to get round the right of the army the other perhaps to detach parties to reading where we had considerable quantities of military stores to frustrate those intentions i moved the army up on this side of the river to this place determined to keep pace with them but early this morning i recd intelligence that they had crossed the fords below  why i did not follow immediately i have mentioned in the former part of my letter but the strongest reason against being able to make a forced march is the want of shoes messieurs carroll chase and penn who were some days with the army can inform congress in how deplorable a situation the troops are for want of that necessary article at least one thousand men are barefooted and have performed the marches in that condition i was told of a great number of shoes in the hands of private people in philadelphia and sent down to secure them but i doubt the approach of the enemy will prevent it i have planned a method of throwing a garrison into fort mifflin if it succeeds and they with the assistance of the ships and galleys should keep the obstructions in the river genl howes situation in    philadelphia will not be the most agreeable for if his supplies can be stopped by water it may be easily done by land to do both shall be my utmost endeavor and i am not yet without hope that the acquisition of philadelphia may instead of his good fortune prove his ruin general st clair who has been constantly with the army for some time past can give you many pieces of information which may have escaped me and therefore i refer you to him for many particulars        george washington    september      philadelphia majorgeneral putnam to majorgeneral putnam camp on schuylkill    miles from philadelphia    september      dr sir the situation of our affairs in this quarter calls for every aid and for every effort genl howe by various manœuvres and marching high up the schuylkill as if he meant to turn our right flank found means by countermarching to pass the river several miles below us last night which is fordable almost in every part and is now fast advancing towards philadelphia i therefore desire that without a moments loss of time you will detach as many effective rank and file under proper generals and other officers as will make the whole number including those with genl mcdougall amount to twentyfive hundred privates  noncommissioned fit for duty the corps under genl mcdougall to my great surprise by a letter from him some days ago consisted only of nine hundred  eleven you will direct the officers commanding the detachment now ordered to proceed as expeditiously as they can to reinforce me the rout through morris town and over coryells ferry will be best for them to pursue before they arrive at the ferry they will hear where i am but that they may know their destination when they are in two days march of it they are to advise me by express and i will write on the subject i must urge you by every motive to send on this detachment without the least possible delay no considerations are to prevent it it is our first object to defeat if possible the army now opposed to us    here that the passes in the highlands may be perfectly secure you will immediately call in all your forces now on command at outposts you must not think of covering a whole country by dividing em  when they are ordered in  drawn together they will be fully competent to repel any attempt that can be made by the enemy from below in their present situation besides if you are threatened with an attack you must get what aid you can from the militia the detachment will bring their baggage but i wish em to come with no more than will be absolutely necessary that you may not hesitate about complying with this order you are to consider it as peremptory  not to be dispensed with colonel malcoms regiment will form a part of the detachment i am dear sir c  p s the troops now ordered need not bring any artillery george washington    september      pottsgrove majorgeneral gates to majorgeneral gates camp near pottsgrove    september      sir this army has not been able to oppose genl howes with the success that was wished and needs a reinforcement i therefore request if you have been so fortunate as to oblige genl burgoyne to    retreat to ticonderoga or if you have not and circumstances will admit that you will order colonel morgan to join me again with his corps i sent him up when i thought you materially wanted him and if his services can be dispensed with now you will direct his immediate return you will perceive i do not mention this by way of command but leave you to determine upon it according to your situation if they come they should proceed by water from albany as low down as peekskill in such case you will give colonel morgan the necessary orders to join me with despatch i am c  george washington    september      lord stirling to lord stirling head quarters    september         oclock a m my lord i have your favor of   oclock now before me and am surprised to find the enemy in the same situation after the movement which they appeard to be making according to the information given by genl reed— i am sorry the picquets marchd from hence yesterday and i am still more concernd that genl armstrong with the militia moved to the trap as it was    owing to a mistake they were not halted along with the other troops at this place the countermand of the march being intended for the whole tho i presume it never reached genl armstrong— under these circumstances and the present appearance of the weather which has induced me to pitch our tents and see what the clouds have in charge i mean to halt here at least to day especially as i find genl wayne will not be up till night if then and smallwood not till to morrow i should be glad therefore if your lordship would consult genl armstrong and the other general officers with you and determine whether it will be best for you to march back to the picquets and for maxwells corps to join their respective brigades immediately or wait till tomorrow that you may be the better enabled to determine this point i am to inform you that i have directed genl mcdougall to halt at a place markd on the map markeys on the skippack road between welgers and pennebakers mill at a star in the fork of perkiomy and officers are gone out to view the grounds thereabouts to see if it would be a convenient situation to assemble our troops at and form a camp at the same time i must add that the current sentiment of the genl officers here is that it is too near the enemy till we are in a better condition to meet them on any ground than we seem to be at present—i shall only add that the reason for halting mcdougall there is to save him the fatigue of a counter march if we should move that way as his troops    must be greatly fatigued by the length and of late the rapidity of his march to form the junction with us how far his situation there may be eligible a few hours with the intelligence they may bring will probably determine your lordship will as before desired take the sentiments of the officers with you on these matters  let me know the result i am c  george washington    september      philadephia john parke custis to john parke custis perkiomy creek in philadephia    september      dear sir your letter of the eleventh instant came to my hands yesterday it was always my intention if agreeable to your mother to give you the offer of renting her dowerestate in king william during my interest therein so soon as you came of age to act for yourself on two accounts i resolved to do this—first because i was desirous of contracting my own business into as narrow a compass as possible and secondly because i thought an estate so capable of improvement as that is in the hands of a person who had a permanent interest in it and the means withal ought not to be    neglected till such time as an unfortunate event and perhaps a distant one might put you in possession the little attention i have been able to pay to any part of my own private business for three years last past is the cause why this among other matters has escaped me but since you have mentioned it yourself i have only to add that it will be quite agreeable to me that you should have the land and everything thereon except breeding mares if any there be and fillies to regulate the rent by the rule you have mentioned i could not consent to because if the plantation had been under good management it would have fixed it higher than you ought to give if under bad management which i believe to be the case it would fix it too low and might settle it at nothing the only true criterion is to determine what so much land with so much marsh in such a part of the country would rent for and next the annual value of so many slaves estimating them at their present worth at the same time having respect to the advantages and disadvantages of the old and the young as the one is declining and the other improving as you are desirous of having the matter fixed as speedily as possible—as the distance between us is too great—the season far advanced—and letters too apt to miscarry to negotiate a business of this kind in that way and as i wish for no more than impartial gentlemen unconnected with both of us shall say i ought to have i am content to leave the valuation of the whole to general nelson colonel braxton and george  0 webb esq i mention these gentlemen because they are persons of character and because no time may be lost in the appointment whatever rent they shall fix upon the land and whatever hire for the negroes i contentedly will take the stock of every kind except mares and fillies and plantation utensils and working tools may also be valued at which you may take them by this means the whole business may be finished at once that these gentlemen if you approve the method of ascertaining the rent may know it is with my approbation the request is made to them you will show them this letter and at the same time apologize in my name for the trouble it will give them if they are obliging enough to undertake it my extreme hurry especially at this juncture only allows me time to add my love to nelly and to assure you that i am with sincere regard and affection dear sir yours p s in the present fluctuating state of things there is one thing which justice to myself and your mother requires me to condition for and that is that the rent stipulated shall have some relative value to secure an equivalent for the land and slaves otherwise as the lease will be an absolute conveyance of the estate from your mother and me we may at the end of a few years if paper money continues to depreciate get nothing for it i do not mean by this to insinuate that i am unwilling to receive paper money—on the contrary i shall with cheerfulness receive payment in anything that has a currency at the time of    payment but of equal value then to the intrinsic worth at the time of fixing the rent in a word that i may really and not nominally get what was intended as a rent  george washington   october      philadelphia to the president of congress camp twenty miles from philadelphia   october      sir yesterday afternoon i had the honor to receive your favors of the  0th ultimo with their enclosures i was much obliged by the accounts from the northern army though in general they had reached me before and i flatter myself we shall soon hear that they have been succeeded by other fortunate and interesting events as the two armies by general gatess letter    were encamped near each other  i shall pay due attention to the resolution you refer me to and no exertions on my part shall be wanting to collect what necessaries i can for the army this i am persuaded will be equally attended to by the honorable board of war and i hope by care and industry many supplies may be obtained to relieve our distresses which in the articles of shoes stockings and blankets are extremely great  since my letter of the   th no favorable change has taken place in our affairs on the contrary we have sustained an additional loss in the capture of the delaware she fell into the enemys hands in a day or two after they were in possession of the city and in a manner not yet well understood some have supposed    the crew mutinied while another report is that she was disabled in her rudder by a shot and driven on shore this misfortune takes off the success of captain biddles cruise i will not dwell longer on the subject  congress may rest assured all the means in my power shall be employed to put our affairs in a more agreeable train and to accomplish the end they so earnestly wish i have the honor to be c p s enclosed is a copy of genl howes proclamation issued the   th ult george washington   october      to the president of congress camp near pennibeckers mill   october      sir having received intelligence through two intercepted letters that general howe had detached a part of his force for the purpose of reducing billingsport    and the forts on delaware i communicated the accounts to my general officers who were unanimously of opinion that a favorable opportunity offered to make an attack upon the troops which were at and near germantown it was accordingly agreed that it should take place yesterday morning and the following dispositions were made the divisions of sullivan and wayne flanked by conways brigade were to enter the town by the way of chestnut hill while general armstrong with the pennsylvania militia should fall down the manatawny road  by vandeerings mill and get upon the enemys left and rear the divisions of greene and stephen flanked by mcdougalls brigade were to enter by taking a circuit by way of the limekiln road at the markethouse and to attack their right wing and the militia of maryland and jersey under generals smallwood and forman were to march by the old york road and fall upon the rear of their right lord stirling with nashs and maxwells brigades was to form a corps de reserve we marched about seven oclock the preceding evening and general sullivans advanced party drawn from conways brigade attacked their picket at mount airy or mr allens house about sunrise the next morning which presently gave way and his main body consisting of the right wing following soon engaged the light infantry and other troops encamped near the picket which they forced from their ground leaving their baggage they retreated    a considerable distance having previously thrown a party into mr chews house who were in a situation not to be easily forced and had it in their power from the windows to give us no small annoyance and in a great measure to obstruct our advance the attack from our left column under general greene began about three quarters of an hour after that from the right and was for some time equally successful but i cannot enter upon the particulars of what happened in that quarter as i am not yet informed of them with sufficient certainty and precision  the morning was extremely foggy which prevented our improving the advantages we gained so well as we should otherwise have done this circumstance by concealing from us the true situation of the enemy obliged us to act with more caution and less expedition than we could have wished and gave the enemy time to recover from the effects of our first impression and what was still more unfortunate it served to keep our different parties in ignorance of each others movements and hinder their acting in concert it also occasioned them to mistake one another for the enemy which i believe more than any thing else contributed to the misfortune that ensued in the midst of the most promising appearances when every thing gave the most flattering hopes of victory the troops began suddenly to retreat and entirely left the field in spite of every effort that could be made to rally them upon the whole it may be said the day was rather    unfortunate than injurious we sustained no material loss of men and brought off all our artillery except one piece which was dismounted the enemy are nothing the better by the event and our troops who are not in the least dispirited by it have gained what all young troops gain by being in actions we have had however several valuable officers killed and wounded particularly the latter general nash is among the wounded and his life is despaired of as soon as it is possible to obtain a return of our loss i will transmit it in justice to general sullivan and the whole right wing of the army whose conduct i had an opportunity of observing as they acted immediately under my eye i have the pleasure to inform you that both officers and men behaved with a degree of gallantry that did them the highest honor i have the honor to be c p s as i have observed i have not received a return of our loss but from what i have just now learned from general greene i fear it is more considerable than i at first apprehended in men the cannon mentioned above is said to have been brought off in a wagon george washington   october      sir william howe to sir william howe   headquarters   october      sir i cannot forbear assuring you that i am somewhat at a loss to understand the design of your letter of the  d instant i can hardly believe you to be serious in    remonstrating against a procedure fully authorized by the common practice of armies countenanced by your own troops at trenton and obviously calculated to answer a purpose very different from that of distressing the inhabitants and increasing the common calamities incident to a state of war if this is a consequence of it it is an unavoidable one and had no part in producing the measure i flatter myself the public is sufficiently sensible that it is not my wish nor aim to distress but to protect the inhabitants and know how to interpret any thing that with respect to individuals may seem to deviate from this end nor will they be easily persuaded to consider it as any injustice or cruelty to them that my parties should have rendered useless for a time a few mills in the neighborhood of your army which were so situated as to be capable of affording them no inconsiderable advantages i am happy to find you express so much sensibility to the sufferings of the inhabitants as it gives room to hope that those wanton and unnecessary depredations which have heretofore in too many instances    marked the conduct of your army will be discontinued for the future the instances i allude to need not be enumerated your own memory will suggest them to your imagination from the destruction of charlestown in the massachusetts down to the more recent burning of mills barns and houses at the head of elk and in the vicinity of the schuylkill i am c  george washington   october      to the president of congress camp near pennibeckers mill   october      sir since i had the honor of addressing you on the  th i have obtained a return of our loss in the action on saturday by which it appears to be much more considerable than i first apprehended though i always imagined myself that it was greater than it was generally supposed to be the copy of the return enclosed will show the amount as it now stands but i hope many of those who are missing will yet come in i fear however there are several under that denomination to be added to the number of the slain as the action was warm in every quarter from the information of the officers who commanded the different attacks what loss the enemy sustained i am not    able precisely to ascertain but from a variety of corresponding accounts of persons who left the city since and those of a deserter it was very considerable the deserter who is intelligent says general agnew was killed sir william erskine wounded in the head and leg and that their general loss in killed and wounded amounted to near eight hundred several reputable persons from the city corroborate this particularly with respect to general agnews death some say upwards of two hundred wagons with wounded were carried in after the action and before they came out and that it was the common belief there the enemy had been severely handled it is with much chagrin and mortification i add that every account confirms the opinion i first entertained that our troops retreated at the instant when victory was declaring herself in our favor the tumult disorder and even despair which it seems had taken place in the british army were scarcely to be paralleled and it is said so strongly did the ideas of a retreat prevail that chester was fixed on as their rendezvous i can discover no other cause for not improving this happy opportunity than the extreme haziness of the weather   00 my intention is to encamp the army at some suitable place to rest and refresh the men and recover them from the still remaining effects of that disorder naturally attendant on a retreat we shall here wait for the reinforcements coming on and shall then act according to circumstances general varnum with the detachment from peekskill amounting to about twelve hundred including officers would be last night at coryells ferry about five hundred militia from virginia and two hundred from maryland together with colonel gibsons state regiment consisting of two hundred and twentysix effectives have already joined the army since the action general formans brigade of jersey militia has quitted us the men began to be uneasy at their situation and desirous to return home and as by some intelligence received from general dickinson there was reason to imagine there might be a call for their services in the jerseys it was thought expedient to gratify their desire the state of our water defence on the delaware is far from being as flattering as could be wished after some slight opposition from the jersey militia under general newcomb a detachment of the enemy  0  took possession of billingsport this perhaps is an event of no material consequence but it is to be lamented that many of the officers and seamen on board the galleys have manifested a disposition that does them little honor looking upon their situation as desperate or probably from worse motives they have been guilty of the most alarming desertions two whole crews including the officers have deserted to the enemy i learn however by captain brewer who is this moment arrived here from the fleet that the accounts they have received from the city of our late attack were such as to have produced a favorable change and to have inspired them with more confidence i would here observe that the charge of bad conduct was by no means applicable to the whole far from it he further adds that four of the enemys ships made an attempt yesterday morning to weigh the chevauxdefrise opposite to billingsport but were repulsed by our galleys which has also contributed to raise the spirits of the seamen our garrison on fort island consisting of little more than two hundred continental troops under lieutenantcolonel smith  appear determined to maintain their post to the last extremity  0  i beg leave to mention to congress that there is a great deficiency of general officers in this army when the detachment coming from peekskill joins us we shall have thirteen brigades these require as many brigadiers and six majorgenerals instead of these we shall have only four majorgenerals and eleven brigadiers and the deficiency will be still increased by the death of general nash which from every appearance is momently to be expected geneneral woodfords absence occasioned by his wound adds to our embarrassments though it will be but for a time under these circumstances congress will be sensible that the government of the army cannot go on with that energy which is essential to its wellbeing and success neither officers nor men will transfer the respect and obedience they pay to a general officer to a colonel who happens to be appointed to the temporary command of a brigade nor will he knowing his authority to be only temporary be as solicitous to enforce it as one who is conscious he is to continue in the station he fills want of leisure prevents my being more particular at this time but i shall take the liberty in a day or two to point out the troops that are in want of general officers with my observations on the subject i cannot however omit this opportunity of recommending general mcdougall to their notice this gentleman from the time of his appointment as brigadier from his abilities military knowledge and approved bravery has every claim to promotion if i mistake not he was passed over in the last appointments  0  of majorgenerals and younger officers preferred before him but his disinterested attachment to the service prevented his acting in the manner that is customary in like circumstances this i think gives him a peculiar title to esteem and concurs with the opinion i have of his value as an officer to make me wish it may appear advisable to congress to promote him to one of the vacancies it would be well the intended inquiry into the conduct of general st clair could be brought to a speedy issue and if he is acquitted to the satisfaction of congress that as his general character as an officer is good he may be again restored to the service by a letter this evening received from colonel hawkes hay of haverstraw dated the  th at four oclock in the afternoon four ships of war a considerable number of armed vessels eight transports and forty flatbottomed boats arrived that morning in the bay opposite that place and were landing troops at verplancks point their number and design were not known i have the honor to be c p s enclosed you will find a copy of a letter from colo mifflin containing an account of the action of the  th as mentioned by the british officers in philadelphia i would beg leave to observe that i think miss leonards name should not be mentioned   0  george washington colonel christopher greene to colonel christopher greene instructions sir i have directed general varnum to send your regiment and that of colonel angell to red bank by a rout which has been marked out to him the command of that detachment will of course devolve upon you with which you will proceed with all expedition and throw yourself into that place when you arrive there you will immediately communicate your arrival to col smith commander of the garrison at fort mifflin and commodore hazelwood commander of the fleet in the river  you are to coöperate with them in every measure necessary for the defence of the obstructions in the river and to counteract every attempt the enemy may make for their removal you will find a very good fortification at red bank but if any thing should be requisite to render it stronger or proportion it to the size of your garrison you will have it done the cannon you will stand in need of as much as can be spared will be furnished from the galleys and fort mifflin from whence also you will derive supplies of military stores    i have sent captain duplessis  with some officers and men to take the immediate direction of the artillery for your garrison he is also to superintend any works that may be wanted if there should be any deficiency of men for the artillery the security of the garrison will require you to assist him with a few additionals from your detachment you should lose not a moments time in getting to the place of your destination and making every proper preparation for its defence any delay might give the enemy an  0  opportunity of getting there before you which could not fail being of the most fatal consequence if in the progress of your march you should fall in with any detachment of the enemy bending towards the same object and likely to gain it before you and from intelligence should have reason to think yourself equal to the task you will by all means attack them and endeavor by that mean to disappoint their design i have written to general newcomb of the jersey militia to give you all the aid in his power for which you will accordingly apply when necessary upon the whole sir you will be pleased to remember that the post with which you are now intrusted is of the utmost importance to america and demands every exertion you are capable of for its security and defence the whole defence of the delaware absolutely depends upon it and consequently all the enemys hopes of keeping philadelphia and finally succeeding in the object of the present campaign influenced by these considerations i doubt not your regard to the service and your own reputation will prompt you to every possible effort to accomplish the important end of your trust and frustrate the intentions of the enemy given at headquarters this  th day of october       george washington   october      governor livingston to governor livingston headquarters   october      sir i yesterday received certain intelligence that the enemy had proceeded up hudsons river from new york and landed a body of men at verplancks point a few miles below peekskill this movement fully explains those appearances which lately induced general dickinson to apprehend a second incursion into  0  the jerseys and gives reason to believe that instead of that the enemy meditate a serious blow against our posts in the highlands this circumstance is somewhat alarming as the situation of our affairs this way has obliged us to draw off so large a part of our force from peekskill that what now remains there may perhaps prove inadequate to the defence of it should any disaster happen it is easy to foresee the most unhappy consequences the loss of the highland passes would be likely to involve the reduction of the forts this would open the navigation of the river and enable the enemy with facility to throw their force into albany get into the rear of general gates and either oblige him to retreat or put him between two fires the success of the present attempt upon peekskill may in its consequences entirely change the face of our northern affairs and throw them into a very disagreeable and unfavorable train i am confident that no arguments need be used to dispose you to contribute every effort in your power to obviate an evil of so great magnitude and as i do not conceive there can be now any danger of your militia being wanted at home for the internal security of your state i am persuaded you will readily consent to my request that as large a part of them as can be prevailed upon to go may immediately march with all expedition to the aid of general putnam at this distance unacquainted with what may have taken place i cannot give any particular directions to regulate their march they must govern  0  themselves by circumstances and act according to the intelligence and orders they may receive from general putnam in order to this if you should think it proper to send a body agreeable to my request it would be adviseable that the officer under whose command they go should without delay advise general putnam of his intended approach and desire his instructions how to proceed in the mean time this rout must be directed towards the clove and thence towards the new windsor i shall be happy if your views and mine concur in this matter and that you may be able to afford any material succor to a post the fate of which is of such essential importance to the prosperity of our northern concerns as in a great measure to threaten their ruin if it should be lost and the disappointment of all those flattering prospects which our late successes in that quarter have afforded us george washington   october      brigadiergeneral potter to brigadiergeneral potter    october      dr sir a person of the name of patterson an inhabitant of wilmington can give you a particular acct of the situation strength c of the enemy at that place from whence you may judge of the practicability  0  of attempting something by way of surprize if your numbers are adequate upon the garrison—after having made every necessary enquiry proper for an enterprize of this kind let me know the result by an officer and whether the undertaking is feasable with or without a little aid from hence your enquiries into these matters should be made with much circumspection to avoid giving alarm—and your manœuvers should be towards the enemy and retrograde occasionally to lull them into security unless your own strength is sufficient to effect the work in that case the rapidity of the attempt may perhaps contribute to the success of it— you will readily perceive that nothing herein is positive but altogether discretionary to be undertaken or not as circumstances and information shall warrant—if a successful blow could be aimd at wilmington very happy consequences would result from it besides possessing ourselves of the wounded that now are there for the purpose of exchanging any for such prisoners of ours as are in the enemys hands—but in the midst of this it is not to be forgotten that one great object of your expedition is to deprive the enemy of supplies from chester county and to interrupt their convoys from chester town wilmington c whilst our defence upon the river obliges them to have recourse to a transportation of necessaries by land from their shipping—watch the communication between phild and the enemys shipping well and let me hear from you frequently especially on the subject of the proposed expedition—patterson  0  can point out others to you inhabitants of wilmington who he thinks would give every aid in their power but then danger may attend the comn of the scheme to too many—if an idea was thrown out that the corp you commanded consisted of the eastern shore militia returning it might possibly remove suspicion of the real design if it should be found practicable to make an attempt upon the enemy at wilmington with your troops i have c  george washington    october      samuel smith to lieutenantcolonel samuel smith skippack camp    october      sir i recd yours of the  th informing me of the occasion of the late firing i imagine the enemy still persist in their attempt as the firing has continued by intervals ever since  as the rear of the fort is only defended by a picket work i think you ought to lose no time in throwing up a bank against the   0 picket which would strengthen it and make it defensible against shot if some blinds were thrown up within the area of the fort they woud be a security against shells of which i think you are in more danger than from shot you seem apprehensive if the enemy possess province island that your men must quit their barracks in that case you should think of finding out some more secure place of sheltering them i cannot at present think of any place better than between the east face of the stone fort and the lower battery they will at least be safe there until an attack begins from the water i desired captain brewer who went from hence yesterday to caution the commodore against an unnecessary expenditure of ammunition and beg that you will also be careful in that point for should the enemy cut off your intercourse with us you will find the want of it i am c p s should the enemy get possession of the ground near the pest house what effect woud their fire have upon shipping if this ground would be     advantageous to us do you think part of your garrison part of that intended for red bank and some militia from jersey could possess and defend it it is my wish that colo greene and you in concert with the gentln of the navy would turn your attention to every place which will contribute to the defence of the water obstructions and if it is in my power to afford assistance i will do it    george washington    october      george clinton to governor george clinton headquarters    october      dear sir i was this day honored with yours of the  th containing a full account of the storm of forts montgomery and clinton general putnam had given me information of the loss two days before but not in so full and ample a manner it is to be regretted that so brave a resistance did not meet with a suitable reward you have however the satisfaction of knowing that every thing was done that could possibly be done by a handful against a far superior force this i am convinced was the case this affair might have been attended with fatal consequences had not there been a most providential intervention in favor of general gatess arms on the  th instant but i am fully of opinion that sir henry clinton will not advance much farther up the river upon hearing of burgoynes defeat and retreat nothing but absolute necessity could have induced me to withdraw any further part of the troops allotted     for the defence of the posts up the north river but such was the reduced state of our continental regiments after the battle of brandywine and such the slowth and difficulty of procuring reinforcements of militia from the southward that without the troops from peekskill we should scarcely have been able to keep the field against general howe i had the greatest hopes that general putnam would draw in as many connecticut militia as would replace the continental troops and i make no doubt but he did all in his power to obtain them in time i am sorry that you were under the necessity of destroying the frigates the only consolation is that if we had not done it ourselves the enemy would either have done it for us or have carried them down for their own use since the battle of germantown upon the  th instant the two armies have remained in a manner quiet the enemy have made several attempts to remove the obstructions in the delaware but hitherto without effect they are now making preparations to raise batteries in the rear of fort mifflin which commands the uppermost chevauxdefrise if we can maintain that post and one opposite upon the jersey shore i am in hopes our ships galleys and floating batteries will be able to keep their stations and repel any force that can be brought by water directly in front i most earnestly expect further news from the northward which i hope will bring us accounts of the total ruin of burgoynes army it is not unlikely that one of sir henry clintons objects will be to destroy the boats and small craft in     the north river should this be the case and he succeed i think it will be advisable for you to set a number of workmen to building flatbottomed boats at some secure places within three or four miles of the water from which they may be easily hauled they are so exceedingly useful and so frequently wanted that i think the business cannot in such case be too soon begun or carried on with too much expedition i have written to general putnam upon the same subject i am dear sir c p s by sundry concurring accounts of persons out of philadelphia and from deserters the enemys loss in the action of the  th was very considerable the lowest say it was   00 killed and wounded others  000 and some as high as   00 perhaps the two last are exaggerated but there are many reasons to believe that the first cannot much exceed the mark for they were compleatly surprized and drove in great disorder for a long time and for a considerable distance at every point of attack had it not been for the extreme fogginess of the day which prevented our several columns discovering each others movements and from improving the advantages which they separately gained in all probability the day would have been a most fortunate one—but owing to that circumstance they got confused and retreated at a moment when there was every appearance of victory in our favor the enemy lost some valuable officers among the slain genl agnew and it is said another genl officer was dangerously wounded we are not without  on our     part brigadr nash was wounded by a cannon ball and is since dead we had also several other officers of inferior rank wounded and some killed—this crude undigested account i dont mean for publication i hope all will yet end well george washington    october      to the president of congress headquarters at peter wintzs    october      sir i have been duly honored with your favors of the   th    th inst with their several enclosures in respect to the resolution directing a flag to be sent to general howe i am inclined to think that the information upon which it was framed was without foundation the letters which have come from our officers who have been lately taken generally mention that their treatment has been tolerably good and such privates as have escaped have said nothing in the course of their examination of their having been compelled to work for these reasons i have taken the liberty to decline sending the flag  at the same time congress may be assured if our prisoners suffer any wrongs i shall take every means in my power to have them redressed as soon as i am apprized of them it is with the highest satisfaction i congratulate congress on the success of our arms at the northward     in the action of the  th an event of the most interesting importance at this critical juncture from the happy train in which things then were i hope we shall soon hear of the most decisive advantages  we moved this morning from the encampment at which we had been for six or seven days past and are just arrived at the grounds we occupied before the action of the  th one motive for coming here is to divert the enemys attention and force from the forts these they seem to consider as capital objects and from their operations mean to reduce if possible at present their designs are directed against fort mifflin and the chevauxdefrise i have therefore detached a further reinforcement to the garrison i yesterday through the hands of mrs ferguson of graham park received a letter of a very curious and extraordinary nature from mr duché which i have thought proper to transmit to congress to     this ridiculous illiberal performance i made a short reply by desiring the bearer of it if she should hereafter by any accident meet with mr duché to tell him i should have returned it unopened if i had had any idea of the contents observing at the same time that i highly disapproved the intercourse she seemed to have been carrying on and expected it would be discontinued notwithstanding the authors assertion i cannot but suspect that the measure did not originate with him and that he was induced to it by the hope of establishing his interest and peace more effectually with the enemy  i have the honor to be c     george washington    october      thomas wharton to thomas wharton president of pennsylvania headquarters    october      sir as the term of service of great numbers of the militia of this state who were called out some time ago has expired and their places have been by no means punctually filled up by succeeding classes i am constrained to call upon you in the most pressing manner to exert the powers of government not only to keep up the number of four thousand men demanded by congress but of a much greater number     if they can possibly be armed and accoutred when the capital of your state is in the enemys hands and when they can only be dislodged from thence by a powerful reinforcement of militia in aid of continental troops there should not be a moments hesitation whether one or two classes should be commanded to appear but at least one half of the men capable to bear arms should be called into the field by exertions of this kind new york though sorely oppressed by our avowed enemies and more so by our internal foes has made a noble resistance and new jersey has kept the enemy out of her limits except now and then a hasty descent without a continental regiment besides doing this she has sent and is now sending reinforcements to this and the northern army it will be no great while before the militia from maryland and virginia will have performed their tour of duty and from the distance which most of them have to travel before they reach the army i cannot expect much more assistance from those quarters in the course of the remaining part of this campaign i assure you sir it is matter of astonishment to every part of the continent to hear that pennsylvania the most opulent and populous of all the states has but twelve hundred militia in the field at a time when the enemy are endeavoring to make themselves completely masters of and to fix their winter quarters in her capital without the free navigation of delaware i am confident that general howe will never remain in philadelphia and i am as confident that had i a     sufficient force to afford as much assistance to the forts upon the delaware as their importance deserves he would not be able to possess them i have spared as many of the continental troops as i possibly can without endangering the safety of this army and i shall still continue to afford every further relief in my power from this state of facts i hope that you will not lose a moment in calling upon and endeavoring to rouse the people of this province to a manly and effectual opposition and i know of no means so likely to answer as not to confine the demand to any particular number but to call upon every man to come forth the county lieutenants should be particularly careful to see that all those who have arms and accoutrements of their own bring them out for they have a very mistaken notion that there are full supplies in the continental stores many even come out without blankets expecting to find them there is another matter which i beg leave to recommend to the serious consideration of the legislature of your state that is the falling upon some mode of completing and keeping up the quota of your continental regiments upon an average your battalions have never been above one third full and now many of them are far below even that from the extravagant prices given to substitutes in the militia in the different states it has become impossible to recruit men upon the bounty allowed by congress the new england states and virginia have begun to adopt the mode of drafting and i am informed they have succeeded very well i am convinced   0 that this will be found the only method of raising continental troops and if the measure was to become general throughout the states it would not be deemed a hardship i mention this matter to you at this time in the hope that you will as soon as possible fall upon this or some other mode to recruit your regiments in the course of this fall and winter and as it is more than probable that our opposition will not end with this campaign we ought to endeavor to have a respectable army in the field in the spring before the enemy can receive further reinforcements from europe i have the honor to be c  george washington    october      richard henry lee to richard henry lee matuchen hill    october      dear sir your favor of the  th instant as also that of the   th by baron de kalb are both at hand it is not in my power at present to answer your query respecting     the appointment of this gentleman but sir if there is any truth in a report which has been handed to me vizt that congress hath appointed or as others say are about to appoint brigadier conway a majorgeneral in this army it will be as unfortunate a measure as ever was adopted i may add and i think with truth that it will give a fatal blow to the existence of the army upon so interesting a subject i must speak plain the duty i owe my country the ardent desire i have to promote its true interests and justice to individuals requires this of me general conways merit then as an officer and his importance in this army exists more in his imagination than in reality for it is a maxim with him to leave no service of his own untold nor to want any thing which is to be obtained by importunity but as i do not mean to detract from him any merit he possesses and only wish to have the matter taken up upon its true ground after allowing him every thing that his warmest friends will contend for i would ask why the youngest brigadier in the service for i believe he is so should be put over the heads of all the eldest and thereby take rank and command gentlemen who but yesterday were his seniors gentlemen who i will be bold to say in behalf of some of them at least are of sound judgment and unquestionable bravery if there was a degree of conspicuous merit in general conway unpossessed by any of his seniors the confusion which might be occasioned by it would stand warranted upon the principles of sound policy for i do readily agree that this is no time for trifling but at the same time that i cannot     subscribe to the fact this truth i am very well assured of though i have not directly nor indirectly exchanged a word with any one of the brigadiers on the subject nor am i certain that any one of them has heard of the appointment that they will not serve under him i leave you to guess therefore at the situation this army would be in at so important a crisis if this event should take place these gentlemen have feelings as officers and though they do not dispute the authority of congress to make appointments they will judge of the propriety of acting under them in a word the service is so difficult and every necessary so expensive that almost all our officers are tired out do not therefore afford them good pretexts for retiring no day passes over my head without application for leave to resign within the last six days i am certain twenty commissions at least have been tendered to me i must therefore conjure you to conjure congress to consider this matter well and not by a real act of injustice compel some good officers to leave the service and thereby incur a train of evils unforeseen and irremediable to sum up the whole i have been a slave to the service i have undergone more than most men are aware of to harmonize so many discordant parts but it will be impossible for me to be of any further service if such insuperable difficulties are thrown in my way you may believe me my good sir that i have no earthly views but the public good in what i have said i have no prejudice against general conway nor desire to serve any other brigadier     further than i think the cause will be benefited by it to bring which to a speedy and happy conclusion is the most fervent wish of my soul  with respect to the wants of the militia in the     articles of clothing you must be well convinced that it is not in my power to supply them in the smallest degree when near one half of our own men are rendered unfit for service for want of these things i can add no more at present than that i am dear sir c george washington    october      baron darendt to baron darendt instructions headquarters    october      sir being recovered from the indisposition under which you lately labored you are to proceed immediately to fort mifflin on mud island and to take the command of the troops there and those which may be sent i shall not prescribe any particular line for your conduct because i repose the utmost confidence in your bravery knowledge and judgment and because the mode of defence must depend on a variety of circumstances which will be best known to those who are on the spot i will add that the maintenance of this post is of the last importance to the states of america and that preventing the enemy from obtaining possession of it under the smiles of heaven will be the means of our defeating the army to which we are now opposed or of obliging them disgracefully to abandon the city of philadelphia which is now in their hands i have detached today a further reinforcement to the garrison  and have instructed colonel greene who commands at red     bank to coöperate with you and to render you every assistance in his power you will maintain with him and with commodore hazelwood who commands our fleet a good understanding and the strictest harmony these will be essential and mutually aiding each other i shall look forward for the most happy events you will be particularly attentive to the state of your ammunition and provision advising me of the same from time to time and of such supplies as you may judge necessary to be sent to you you will also report to me the situation of the garrison as often as it shall be requisite and will not fail to transmit me frequent and the most early intelligence of every important occurrence i shall be done after recommending your utmost despatch to arrive at the garrison and you have my warmest wishes that the command may prove honorable to yourself and beneficial to america i am c  george washington    october      philadelphia county john augustine washington to john augustine washington philadelphia county    october      dear brother your kind and affectionate letters of the   st of septr   d inst came safe to hand when my last to you was dated i know not for truly i can say that my whole time is so much engrossed that i have scarcely a moment but sleeping     ones for relaxation or to indulge myself in writing to a friend the anxiety you have been under on acct of this army i can easily conceive would to god there had been less cause for it or that our situation at present was such as to promise much from it the enemy crossed the schuylkill which by the by above the falls  the falls you know is only five miles from the city is as easily crossed in any place as potomac run aquia or any other broad  shallow water rather by stratagem tho i do not know that it was in our power to prevent it as their manœuvres made it necessary for us to attend to our stores which lay at reading towards which they seemed bending their course and the loss of which must have proved our ruin after they had crossed we took the first favorable opportunity of attacking them this was attempted by a nights march of fourteen miles to surprise them which we effectually did so far as to reach their guards before they had notice of our coming and but for a thick fog which rendered so infinitely dark at times as not to distinguish friend from foe at the distance of thirty yards we should i believe have made a decisive and glorious day of it but providence or some unaccountable something designed it otherwise for after we had driven the enemy a mile or two after they were in the utmost confusion and flying before us in most places after we were upon the point as it appeared to every body of grasping a compleat victory our own troops took fright and fled with precipitation and disorder how to acct for this i know not unless as i before     observed the fog represented their own friends to them for a reinforcement of the enemy as we attacked in different quarters at the same time and were about closing the wings of our army when this happened one thing indeed contributed not a little to our misfortune and that was want of ammunition on the right wing which began the engagement and in the course of two hours and forty minutes which time it lasted had many of them expended the forty rounds that they took into the field after the engagement we removed to a place about twenty miles from the enemy to collect our forces together to take care of our wounded get furnished with necessaries again and be in a better posture either for offensive or defensive operations we are now advancing towards the enemy again being at this time within twelve miles of them our loss in the late action was in killed wounded and missing about one thousand men but of the missing many i dare say took advantage of the times and deserted genl nash of no carolina was wounded and died two or three days after many valuable officers of ours was also wounded and some killed the enemys loss is variously reported—none make it less than   00 killed  wounded  many estimate it much larger genl agnew of theirs was certainly killed—many officers wounded among whom some of distinction this we certainly know that the hospital at philadelphia  several large meeting houses are filled with their wounded besides private houses with the horses in a word     it was a bloody day would to heaven i could add that it had been a more fortunate one for us our distress on acct of cloathing is great and in a little time must be very sensibly felt unless some expedient can be hit upon to obtain them we have since the battle got in abt   00 militia from virginia—about the same number have gone off from this state and jersey but others are promised in lieu of them—with truth however it may be said that this state acts most infamously the people of it i mean as we derive little or no assistance from them in short they are in a manner totally disaffected or in a kind of lethargy the enemy are making vigorous efforts to remove the obstructions in the delaware and to possess themselves of the works which have been constructed for the defence of them—i am doing all i can in my present situation to save them god only knows which will succeed i very sincerely congratulate you on the change in your family tell the young couple after wishing them joy of their union that it is my sincere hope that it will be as happy and lasting as their present joys are boundless the enclosed letter of thanks to my sister for her elegant present you will please to deliver and with sincere affection for you all i am c p s i had scarce finished this letter when by express from the state of new york i received the important and glorious news which follows— george washington   th octr      albany majorgeneral putnam albany   th octr      last night at   oclock the capitulation whereby general burgoyne  whole army surrendered themselves prisoners of     war was signed and this morning they have to march out towds the river above fish creek with the honours of war and there ground their arms they are from thence to be marched to massachusetts bay we congratulate you on this happy event  remain c geo clinton i most devoutly congratulate you my country and every well wisher to the cause on this signal stroke of providence yrs as before  george washington    october      phila majorgeneral putnam to majorgeneral putnam camp  0 miles from phila    october      dear sir your favor of the   th i received yesterday morning and was much obliged by the interesting contents  the defeat of general burgoyne is a most   0 important event and such as must afford the highest satisfaction to every wellaffected american breast should providence be pleased to crown our arms in the course of the campaign with one more fortunate stroke i think we shall have no great cause for anxiety respecting the future designs of britain i trust all will be well in his good time the obvious intention of sir henry clinton was to relieve general burgoyne and being disappointed in that by his surrender i presume he will make an expeditious return i am happy to find you at the head of so respectable a force and flatter myself if he should land with a view to action though i do not expect it you will give us a happy account of him i believe from the bravery of the garrison of fort montgomery he purchased victory at no inconsiderable expense general campbell was certainly killed this they mention in their own printed account but call him colo of the fiftysecond regiment he was a general on the american establishment so declared in one of the orderly books which fell into our hands      i have but little to add respecting the situation of affairs here they remain much as they were when i wrote you last to remove the obstructions in the river seems to be a capital object with the enemy their attempts hitherto have not succeeded and i hope they will not i am extremely sorry for the death of mrs putnam and sympathize with you upon the occasion remembering that all must die and that she had lived to an honorable age i hope you will bear the misfortune with that fortitude and complacency of mind that become a man and a christian i am dear sir with great esteem yours c      george washington    october      john hancock to john hancock  headquarters    october      dear sir it gives me real pain to learn that the declining state of your health owing to your unwearied attention     to public business and the situation of your private affairs oblige you to relinquish a station though but for a time which you have so long filled with acknowledged propriety motives as well of a personal as of a general concern make me regret the necessity that compels you to retire and to wish your absence from office may be of as short a duration as possible in the progress of that intercourse which has necessarily subsisted between us the manner in which you have conducted it on your part accompanied with every expression of politeness and regard to me gives you a claim to my warmest acknowledgments     i am not so well informed of the situation of things up the north river as to be able to give you any satisfactory advice about your route i should rather apprehend it might be unsafe for you to travel that way at this time and would recommend if you can do it without any material inconvenience that you should defer your journey till there is some change in affairs there or till they have taken a more settled form if you should however resolve to proceed immediately and will be pleased to signify the time an escort of horse will meet you at bethlehem to accompany you to general putnams camp where you will be furnished with another escort in the further prosecution of your journey i am extremely obliged to you for your polite tender of services during your intended residence at boston and shall always be happy when leisure and opportunity permit if you will give me the pleasure of hearing from you i have the honor to be c  george washington    october      majorgeneral sullivan to majorgeneral sullivan headquarters    october      dear sir it ever has been and i hope ever will be a ruling principle with me to endeavor to do impartial justice to every officer over whom i have the honor to preside i shall therefore in answer to the queries contained     in your letter of this date readily declare that although i ascribed the misfortune which happened to us on the   th of september principally to the information of major spear transmitted to me by you yet i never blamed you for conveying that intelligence on the contrary considering from whom and in what manner it came to you i should have thought you culpable in concealing it the majors rank reputation and knowledge of the country gave him a full claim to credit and attention his intelligence was no doubt a most unfortunate circumstance as it served to derange the disposition that had been determined on in consequence of prior information of the enemys attempt to turn and attack our right flank which ultimately proving true too little time was left us after discovering its certainty to form a new plan and make adequate arrangements to prevent its success hence arose that hurry and consequent confusion which afterwards ensued but it was not your fault that the intelligence was eventually found to be erroneous with respect to your other query whether your being posted on the right was to guard that flank and if you had neglected it i can only observe that the obvious if not declared purpose of your being there implied every necessary precaution for the security of that flank but it is at the same time to be remarked that all the fords above chads which     we were taught to apprehend danger from were guarded by detachments from your division and that we were led to believe by those whom we had reason to think well acquainted with the country that no ford above our pickets could be passed without making a very circuitous march upon the whole then no part of your conduct preceding the action was in my judgment reprehensible what happened on your march to the field of battle your disposition there and behavior during the action i can say nothing about no part till the retreat commenced having come under my immediate observation i can only add therefore that the whole tenor of your conduct so far as i have had opportunities of judging has been spirited and active i am dear sir your most obedient servant george washington    october      to the president of congress headquarters    october      sir i do myself the honor of transmitting to congress the enclosed copies of sundry letters just now received and congratulate them most sincerely on the important intelligence which they contain the damage the enemy have sustained in their ships i hope will prevent their future attempts to gain the passage of the river and the repulse of the troops under count donop and his captivity i flatter myself will also be attended with the most happy consequences      at the time these actions happened a supply of ammunition was on the way to the forts and i have also ordered a further quantity to be immediately sent by colonel blaine one of the issuing commissaries who left red bank the morning before the action i am happily informed that he had thrown considerable supplies of provision into both garrisons he also adds that he came from jersey this morning and that the enemy had recrossed the delaware and     returned to philadelphia i have written to colonel greene that the prisoners must be immediately sent from his post and mr clymer a deputy under mr boudinot will set out tomorrow morning to make a proper disposition of them      it gives me great concern to inform congress that after all my exertions we are still in a distressed situation for want of blankets and shoes at this time no inconsiderable part of our force is incapable of acting through the deficiency of the latter and i fear without we can be relieved it will be the case with twothirds of the army in the course of a few days i am and have been waiting with the most anxious impatience for a confirmation of general burgoynes surrender i have received no further intelligence respecting it except vague report than the first account which came to hand so long ago as saturday morning if congress have had authentic advices about it i wish to be favored with them i have the honor to be c    0 george washington    october      brigadiergeneral forman to brigadiergeneral forman skippack road   th mile stone    october      dear sir my letter of the   st inst which i hope has got safe to your hands would amply convey to you my ideas of the importance of red bank and leaves me little to add on that head saving that the more it is considered the more essential it appears to use every possible means for its preservation the late check which the enemy met with in attempting to storm the fort at that place is a most fortunate event but i am far from conceiving that it will deter them from endeavoring by slower and more effectual means to possess themselves of it—to make themselves perfect masters of the river and the defences of the cheveaux de frieze it is essential to them to occupy that spot it is equally essential to us to disappoint them by every exertion in our power i wish therefore most ardently to hear of your being in the neighborhood with a respectable body of militia as the preservation of these forts will in the judgment of most men rid phild of their present guests and jersey of the disagreeable situation of being between two fires for it is not to be expected that the enemy will remain long quiet after having once established themselves in the city—jersey must then afford them supplies be ravaged with impunity from a force constantly kept for protection of the inhabitants—how burthensome this will be let the people themselves judge     colo green who commands at red bank seems to apprehend nothing from a storm but every thing from an investiture as the work is contracted and unprovided with the smallest defence against shells which would drive them out immediately a siege therefore must be prevented—and this can not be prevented without the assistance of your militia—i am too well acquainted with your activity and zeal to add more on this head and therefore conclude with strong assurances of being dr sir c george washington    october      count de pulaski circular to pulaski and colonels of horse headquarters    october      sir i am sorry to find that the liberty i granted to the light dragoons of impressing horses near the enemys lines has been most horribly abused and perverted into a mere plundering scheme i intended nothing more than that the horses belonging to the disaffected in the neighborhood of the british army should be taken for the use of the dismounted dragoons and expected that they would be regularly reported to the quarter master general that an account might be kept of the number and the persons from whom they were taken in order to a future settlement—instead of this i am informed that under pretence of the authority derived from me they go about the country plundering whomsoever they are pleased to denominate tories and converting what they get to their own private profit and emolument this is an abuse that cannot be tolerated and as i find the     license allowed them has been made a sanction for such mischievous practices i am under the necessity of recalling it altogether you will therefore immediately make it known to your whole corps that they are not under any pretence whatever to meddle with the horses or other property of any inhabitant whatever on pain of the severest punishment for they may be assured as far as it depends upon me that military execution will attend all those who are caught in the like practice hereafter the more effectually to put it out of their power to elude this prohibition all the horses in your corps in the use of the non commissioned officers and privates not already stamped with the continental brand are without loss of time to be brought to the qr master general to receive that brand and henceforth if any of them shall be found with horses that are without it they shall be tried for marauding and disobedience of orders i am fully confident you will be equally disposed with me to reprobate and abolish the practice complained of and will adopt the strictest measures to fulfil the intention of this letter and prevent its continuance in future i am c george washington    october      majorgeneral putnam to majorgeneral putnam headquarters    october      dear sir i have your favor of the  0th enclosing a copy of general burgoynes capitulation which was the first authentic intelligence i received of the affair indeed i began to grow uneasy and almost to suspect that     the first accounts you transmitted to me were premature as i have not received a single line from general gates i do not know what steps he is taking with the army under his command and therefore cannot advise what is most proper to be done in your quarter but i should think if a junction of your forces was formed part to proceed down upon one side of the river and part upon the other that sir henry clinton would be obliged to retreat immediately before you or if he suffered you to get between him and new york you perhaps might in its weak state get into the city i mention this merely as a matter of opinion taking it for granted you will pursue the most proper and efficacious measure whatever may be determined upon i beg it may be constantly communicated to me as the operations of this army may depend much upon the situation of yours    i am dear sir c call for a council of officers headquarters    october      sir you will very shortly be called to a council of war when your sentiments on the following questions will be asked  st whether it will be prudent in our present circumstances and strength to attempt by a general attack to dislodge the enemy and if it is and we unsuccessful where we retreat to  d if such an attack should not be thought eligible what general disposition of the army had best take place till the weather forces us from the field  d where and in what manner supposing the enemy to keep possession of philadelphia had the continental troops best be cantoned after they can no longer keep the field  th what measures can be adopted to cover the country near     the city and prevent the enemy from drawing supplies therefrom during the winter  th will the office of inspector general to our army for the purpose principally of establishing one uniform set of manœuvres and manual be advisable as the time of the adjutant general seems to be totally engaged with other business  th should regimental promotion extend only to captains inclusively or that of the majority  th will it be consistent with propriety and good policy to allow soldiers the reward offered to others for apprehending deserters  th the commissaries complaining of the number and disproportion of the rations which are issued to the troops and at the same time of the advanced price of all kinds of spirits owing to the imposition of the sutlers upon the soldiery what regulation and remedy can be applied to rectify the one and prevent the other i am sir c      george washington    october      francis hopkinson john wharton to francis hopkinson and john wharton of the navy board  skippack road    october      gentlemen the more i reflect upon the evil that may arise from the enemys possessing themselves of our unfinished frigates up the delaware the more convinced i am of the indispensable obligation we are under to prevent it effectually if no other method could be devised i should be for absolutely burning them but scuttling and sinking them with or without ballast as those who are best acquainted with the difficulties of raising them in either state at this season may determine will in my judgment answer the end we all know that the enemy have made one vigorous though unsuccessful effort to dispossess us of our forts and drive off our vessels which defend the chevauxdefrise in the river we know also that besides having the delaware frigate they are busily employed in preparing two other large armed vessels at the city if in addition to these they should by surprise or force obtain the frigates above bordentown and bring the whole in aid of their ships in a general attack upon our little fleet thus surrounded we may but too easily without the spirit of divination foretell the consequences their destruction will be certain and inevitable at present these frigates are of no use to us while the hands are greatly wanted considered therefore     in this point of view simply the measure proposed in my opinion is highly expedient and under the prevailing sentiment that the enemy cannot hold philadelphia unless their shipping get up it appears absolutely necessary the fatal consequences which may result from suffering the frigates to fall into the enemys hands are too obvious to need more arguments to prove them and when it is considered of how little importance they are to us in their present situation prudence requires that they should be so disposed of as to be hereafter useful and put out of the way of being destroyed by the enemy or being rendered serviceable to them upon the whole i take the liberty of delivering it as my clear opinion that the frigates ought to be immediately and with the utmost secrecy sunk either with or without ballast so as to make it next to impossible to raise them without mens diving either to unlade or fix their purchases and that their crews should be sent down to the fleet below where sailors are exceedingly wanted  if i have stepped out of the line of my duty to make this request i am persuaded you will excuse it when i add that the good of the service not only in my judgment but in that of others absolutely requires it to be carried into execution i have the honor to be c     george washington    october      philadelphia county landon carter to landon carter philadelphia county    october      dear sir accept my sincere thanks for your sollicitude on my acct—and for ye good advice contained in your little paper of the   th ulto—at the same time that i assure you that it is not my wish to avoid any danger which duty requires me to encounter i can as confidently add that it is not my intention to run unnecessary risques—in the instance given by you i was acting precisely in the line of my duty but not in the dangerous situation you have been led to believe—i was reconnoitring but i had a strong party of horse with me—i was as i afterwards found in a disaffected house at the head of elk but i was equally guarded agt friend and foe—the information of danger then came not from me so many accts have been published of the battle of brandy wine that nothing more can be said of it—the subsequent ingagement on the  th instt had every appearance after a hot contest of two hours and forty minutes of a glorious decision but after driving the enemy from their incampment—possessing     their ground—and being as we thought upon the point of grasping victory it was snatched from us by means altogether unaccountable excepting that a very heavy atmosphere aided by the smoke from field pieces and small arms rendered it impossible at times to distinguish friend from foe at the distance of  0 yards which caused our men i believe to take fright at each other since that the enemy have retired to phila where they have been strengthening themselves as much as possible whilst we hover round to cut of their supplies the enemy are exerting their utmost skill to reduce the forts constructed for the defence of the cheveaux de friese in delaware and to drive of our little fleet employed in aid of them—on the   d inst count donop a hessian officer of rank  great military abilities with   00 of his countrymen undertook to storm one of these works called fort mercer at red bank on the jersey shore when himself and about  00 others were killed and wounded—between two and three hundred were left slain and badly wounded on the spot—the rest got of with their retreating brethren who made the best of their way to phila—the count is among the wounded—supposed mortally the next day several of the enemys ships having passed the lower cheveaux de friese aided by their land batteries began a most tremendous cannonade upon fort mifflin on an island near the pennsylvania shore and on our armed vessels adjoining which continued six hours without intermission and ended     in the destruction of two of the enemys ships of war—one a sixty four gun ship—the other   —our damage on both these occasions was inconsiderable—in the attack on fort mercer we had abt  0 men killed and wounded—at fort mifflin and the ships less the possession of these defences is of such essential importance to the enemy that they are leaving no stone unturned to succeed—we are doing what we can under many disadvantages to disappoint them the great and important event to the northward—of which no doubt you have heard—must be attended with the most fortunate consequences it has caused sir henry clintons expedition from new york in aid of burgoyne to end in something more than smoke indeed burning of mills gentlemens seats and the villages near the water an evident proof of their despair of carrying their diabolical designs into execution—my inclination leads me to give you a more minute detail of the situation of our army but prudence forbids as letters are subject to too many miscarriages—my best respects attends the good family at sabine hall neighbours at mount airy c  with affecte regard i remain dr sir p s i am persuaded you will excuse this scratchd scrawl when i assure you it is with difficulty i write at all i have this instant received an acct of the prisoners taken by the northern army including tories in arms agt us in the course of the campaign—this singular instance of providence and our good   0 fortune under it exhibits a striking proof of the advantages which result from unanimity  a spirited conduct in the militia—the northern army before the surrender of genl gates was reenforced by upwards of   000 militia who shut the only door by which burgoyne could retreat and cut of all his supplies—how different our case—the disaffection of great part of the inhabitants of this state—the languor of others  internal distraction of the whole have been among the great and insuperable difficulties i have met with and have contributed not a little to my embarrassment this campaign—but enough i do not mean to complain i flatter myself that a superintending providence is ordering every thing for the best—and that in due time all will end well—that it may do so and soon is the most fervent wish of c prisoners british       foreigners       canadians   00       0 genl

 dear sir it having been judged expedient by the members of a council of war held yesterday that one of the gentlemen of my family should be sent to general gates in order to lay before him the state of this army and the situation of the enemy and to point out to him the many happy consequences that will accrue from an immediate reinforcement being sent from the northern army i have thought proper to appoint you to that duty and desire that you will immediately set out for albany at which place or in the neighborhood i imagine you will find general gates you are so fully acquainted with the two principal points on which you are sent namely the state of our army and the situation of the enemy that i shall not enlarge on these heads what you are chiefly to attend to is to point out in the clearest and fullest manner to general gates the absolute necessity that there is for his detaching a very considerable part of the army at present under his command to the reinforcement of this a measure that will in all probability reduce general howe to the same situation in which general burgoyne now is should he attempt to remain in philadelphia without being able to remove the obstructions in the delaware and opening a free communication with his shipping the force which the members of the council of war judged it safe and expedient to draw down at     present are the three new hampshire and fifteen massachusetts regiments with lees and jacksons two of the sixteen additionals but it is more than probable that general gates may have destined part of these troops to the reduction of ticonderoga should the enemy not have evacuated it or to the garrisoning of it if they should in that case the reinforcement will vary according to circumstances but if possible let it be made up to the same number out of other corps if upon your meeting with general gates you should find that he intends in consequence of his success to employ the troops under his command upon some expedition by the prosecution of which the common cause will be more benefitted than by their being sent down to reinforce this army it is not my wish to give any interruption to the plan but if he should have nothing more in contemplation than those particular objects which i have mentioned to you and which it is unnecessary to commit to paper in that case you are to inform him that it is my desire that the reinforcements before mentioned or such part of them as can be safely spared be immediately put in march to join this army i have understood that general gates has already detached nixons and glovers brigades to join general putnam and general dickinson informs me that by intelligence which he thinks may be depended upon sir henry clinton has come down the river with his whole force if this be a fact you are to desire general putnam to send the two brigades forward with the greatest expedition as there can be     no occasion for them there  i expect you will meet colonel morgans corps upon their way down if you do let them know how essential their services are to us and desire the colonel or commanding officer to hasten their march as much as is consistent with the health of the men after their late fatigues let me hear from you when you reach the north river and upon your arrival at albany i wish you a pleasant journey and am dear sir c george washington october  0      phila majorgeneral gates to majorgeneral gates headquarters near whitemarsh    miles from phila october  0      sir by this opportunity i do myself the pleasure to congratulate you on the signal success of the army under your command in compelling general burgoyne and his whole force to surrender themselves prisoners of war an event that does the highest honor to the american arms and which i hope will be attended with the most extensive and happy consequences     at the same time i cannot but regret that a matter of such magnitude and so interesting to our general operations should have reached me by report only or through the channel of letters not bearing that authenticity which the importance of it required and which it would have received by a line under your signature stating the simple fact our affairs having happily terminated at the northward i have by the advice of my general officers sent colonel hamilton one of my aids to lay before you a full state of our situation and that of the enemy in this quarter he is well informed upon the subject and will deliver my sentiments upon the plan of operations that is become necessary to be pursued i think it improper to enter into a particular detail not being well advised how matters are circumstanced on the north river and fearing that by some accident my letter might miscarry from colonel hamilton you will have a clear and comprehensive view of things and i persuade myself you will do all in your power to facilitate the objects i have in contemplation i am sir your most obedient servant      george washington   november      whitemarsh to the president of congress headquarters near whitemarsh   november      sir i was duly honored with mr hancocks letter of the   th with its several inclosures i shall take the case of john more under consideration and will transmit colo mason my determination upon the same at this time i cannot inform the commissary whether any alterations have or have not been made by genl orders in the original ration establishment i have been under the necessity from time to time to send away my orderly books and they are necessary to be examined upon the subject however i think it probable that a departure from the first allowance may have been found expedient and directed by some authority or the commissary would not have adopted it—in respect to the alteration referred to my consideration it is a matter of consequence and i have desired the genl officers to inform themselves whether it will be agreeable to the army at large or what other regulations may be necessary in this instance—as soon as i have their sentiments i will write to congress upon the subject the enemy still consider the possession of our posts upon the river of great importance and from     their preparation of fascines c and the best information i have been able to obtain they will make further efforts to carry them viewing them in this light myself and imagining that they would persevere in their plans to occupy them i wrote some days ago in the most pressing terms to genls dickinson forman and newcomb to afford every aid in their power to the militia of jersey as yet we have received but little and i have no encouragement to expect that it will be much augmented in a short time this does not proceed from a want of activity and exertion on the part of two first mentioned gentlemen whose conduct and zeal upon every occasion give them a claim to the public esteem but in a considerable degree from the peculiar circumstances of their state at this time the apprehensions of an invasion from staten island keep a large proportion of the militia from the eastern and upper part of the state almost constantly employed at and in the neighborhood of eliza town and mr livingstons powers as governor being expired and no provision made it seems for such a contingency there are none of sufficient authority to order them out till a new appointment can be had—at least there is ground to suspect that the orders and exertions of these two gentlemen unassisted by civil authority will not be attended with the advantages we wish and which our affairs require as to genl newcomb who is in the neighborhood of red bank notwithstanding my most urgent and repeated solicitations i have little to expect from him if i may     form an estimate of his future services from those he has already rendered  under these circumstances i have been obliged to detach a further reinforcement of continental troops under genl varnum to maintain the two garrisons if possible—besides sailors drawn from the line to man the gallies this detachment when it arrives added to the force now in the forts will make the whole amount to   00 effective rank and file sent from this army after the action of the  th ultimo at germantown i hoped we should have been in a situation to attack the enemy again on those grounds and with more success than in the former instance but this i was not able to effect the severe rain on the   th of september the action on the  th the removal of our stores and having to form a new elaboratory added to the small number of hands engaged in the business of it laid us under difficulties in the capital and essential article of ammunition that could not be surmounted every exertion was directed to obtain supplies but notwithstanding they were inadequate too scanty and insufficient to attempt any thing on a large and general scale before the enemy withdrew themselves with what we had in case an experiment had been made fortune might have decided in our favor for the present but we should not have been afterwards in a situation to maintain the advantage we might have gained and if a repulse had taken place and the enemy been pursued for want     of a reserve we should have been exposed to the most imminent danger of being ruined the distress of the soldiers for want of shoes was also a powerful obstacle to the measure i could wish that our circumstances were now such as to authorize a general attack for dislodging them from the city but i think that they are not this also is the opinion of my general officers upon a full and comprehensive view of matters as congress will perceive by the enclosed copy of the minutes of council on the   th ultimo which i have taken the liberty to transmit and lay before them the superiority of numbers on the part of the enemy in respect to regular troops their superior discipline and the redoubts and lines which they have thrown up between the two rivers and about the city the happy state of our affairs at the northward and the practicability of drawing succors from thence the consequences of a defeat—these were all motives which led to a decision against an attack at this time i have sent colonel hamilton one of my aids to general gates to give him a just representation of things and to explain to him the expediency of our receiving the reinforcements which have been determined necessary if they will not interfere and frustrate any important plans he may have formed indeed i cannot conceive that there is any object now remaining that demands our attention and most vigorous efforts so much as the destruction of the army in this quarter should we be able to effect this we shall have little to fear in future   0 general howes force according to the statement now made is more considerable than it was generally supposed to be i did not think it quite so great myself but always imagined the common estimate much too low nor can i positively say what it really is however there are strong reasons to believe that it is not overrated after the evacuation of germantown an almost infinite number of scraps and bits of paper were found which being separated and arranged with great industry and care bear the marks of genuine and authentic returns at different periods the manner in which they were destroyed and disposed of gives no room to suspect that it was the effect of design in addition to this i am informed by general putnam that he had heard a reinforcement of four regiments was coming round to delaware from new york the enclosed return will give congress a general view of the strength of this army when it was made and a particular one of the forces of each state which compose it by this they will perceive how greatly deficient the whole are in furnishing their just quotas the militia from maryland and virginia are no longer to be counted on all the former except about two hundred are already gone and a few days i expect will produce the departure of the whole or chief part of the latter from the importunate applications which some of them have made besides this diminution i am apprehensive we shall have several men added to the sick list by reason of the late excessive rain and want of clothes we have not yet come to any     determination respecting the disposition of our troops for the winter supposing it a matter of great importance and that for the present we should be silent upon it the reasons will readily occur by continuing the campaign perhaps many salutary if not decisive advantages may be derived but it appears to me that this must depend upon the supplies of clothing which the men receive if they cannot be accommodated in this instance it will be difficult if not impossible to do it without effecting their destruction i would take the liberty to mention that i feel myself in a delicate situation with respect to the marquis de lafayette he is extremely solicitous of having a command equal to his rank and professes very different ideas as to the purposes of his appointment from those congress have mentioned to me he certainly did not understand them i do not know in what light they will view the matter but it appears to me from a consideration of his illustrious and important connexions the attachment which he has manifested for our cause and the consequences which his return in disgust might produce that it will be advisable to gratify him in his wishes and the more so as several gentlemen from france who came over under some assurances have gone back disappointed in their expectations his conduct with respect to them stands in a favorable point of view having interested himself to remove their uneasiness and urged the impropriety of their making any unfavorable representations upon their arrival at     home and in all his letters has placed our affairs in the best situation he could besides he is sensible discreet in his manners has made great proficiency in our language and from the disposition he discovered at the battle of brandywine possesses a large share of bravery and military ardor there is a french gentleman here monsieur vrigny in whose favor the marquis seems much interested he assures me he is an officer of great merit and from that motive and a regard to the service wishes to see him promoted the rank he holds in france and his present expectations are contained in the enclosed copy of a paper given me by the marquis monsieur vrigny also has honorable certificates of his services nearly corresponding with the marquiss account of them if congress are pleased to honor him with a commission in the army of the states i must try to employ him i took the liberty some short time ago to mention to congress the situation of the first nine raised virginia regiments and the term for which they stand engaged and considering that we should suffer greatly by the loss of so large a part of our force which have been long inured to service i thought it advisable to consult the officers commanding them upon the mode which should appear to them best calculated to reinlist them they accordingly met and reported their sentiments in writing a copy of which i have inclosed i do not know that expedients more promising of success than those they have pointed out can be adopted congress will be pleased to give the matter their earliest attention     and to favor me with their opinion by the first opportunity whether the indulgence and allowance they have proposed may be granted and if any additional bounty may be given what it shall be the high sums paid for substitutes and drafts of late even in the militia service will make this necessary—for the soldiers being well apprised of that fact will not be induced to engage again during the war or for three years for the usual premium  i would also lay before congress a remonstrance by the subaltern officers of the virginia line founded on a reform i thought necessary to take place in the regt from that state—these in their establishment were made to consist of ten companies—two more than were assigned to those of the states in general this and the great disproportion between the officers and men induced me to reduce them to a level with the rest belonging to the continent—in order to prevent a considerable unnecessary expence to effect this no new promotions are to be made in the two extra companies viz the  th and  0th either to vacancies existing at the time of the regulation or to any future ones that may happen therein and the subalterns are to remain in their rank and command till     they can be promoted in the other eight companies and their men incorporated this is what they complain of i have made a short state of facts and wish congress to determine upon them and the remonstrance as they shall think proper at the request of governor clinton i have transmitted a copy of his letter to me giving an account of general vaughans expedition up the north river after the capture of fort montgomery and of the destruction committed by his troops in burning kingston and the houses and mills on the river according to the latest advices they have returned again and it is reported that they have destroyed the barracks and forts and gone to new york but this is not confirmed  a few days ago mr franks of philadelphia agent for the british prisoners sent out six thousand continental     dollars to mr richard graham of virginia for the subsistence of the hessians and other prisoners in that state the policy of suffering the enemy to support their prisoners with money which they refuse themselves and which they attempt to depreciate in every instance they possibly can appears to me very questionable and the more so as it may be counterfeited besides they have laid us under every difficulty they can devise as to our prisoners in their hands nothing will do for their support but hard money if the enemy were obliged to furnish the same the quantity with us would be greater and of course the means of relieving ours easier i do not     know what consequences a prohibition against receiving continental money or the currency of any state from them might involve i think the subject is worthy of the consideration of congress and for that reason i have mentioned it nov  —the report of the enemy having destroyed the forts and barracks on the north river and of their having returned to new york is confirmed i this morning received a letter from genl putnam upon the subject a copy of which is transmitted the information that they mean to reinforce genl howe i doubt not is true it has come through several channels and nothing is more probable as to their having a further expedition in view it seems to be questionable and general burgoynes defeat and the eastern troops being ready to be employed in another way are circumstances against the measure agreeable to my expectation the virginia militia are gone so that we have none now in aid of the continental troops but those of this state mentioned in the return and a few from maryland i do not know what can or will be done to obtain further reinforcements of them—but it appears to me taking matters in any point of light that further aids should come from virginia and maryland for should we be able to accommodate the continental forces with cloaths so as to carry on a winters campaign their assistance will be material either to maintain a blockade or in any decisive stroke we may attempt—and if they cannot be so provided and we should be obliged to retire into quarters     their services will be still more necessary to assist in covering the country against incursions for forage and provisions— the militia of this state themselves supposing they should be tolerably vigorous in their exertions will not be equal to the task—at least it will be difficult if not impracticable for em to do it it is to be wished that such as can be drawn out may be engaged to serve three months or two at least if it can be effected after their arrival in camp and that a mode could be adopted to supply their places with others at the expiration of their term should the exigency of our affairs require it a time for their continuance should be fixed or they will always be uneasy  pushing off and the longer circumstances will admit it to be the better for after the period incurs for which they come it will be impossible to retain em a moment as to the number that should be required it is difficult to determine—however it is likely it will fall short of the requisition as it ever has upon such occasions there is a report prevailing in camp which has come thro several channels that a successful expedition has been made upon rhode island and  00 prisoners taken with several pieces of artillery and a large quantity of salt i heartily wish it may be true—but at present it wants confirmation mr thomsons letter of the   st ulto with its enclosures came to hand yesterday—i join congress most sincerely in congratulations on our important success in the surrender of genl burgoyne at the     head of his forces and am happy they have received a confirmation of the event from genl gates i have c  george washington   november      brigadiergeneral varnum to brigadiergeneral varnum headquarters   november      sir i hope this will find you arrived safe at red bank with your detachment by letters from the baron darendt who has retired for a few days to the jersey side for the benefit of his health i understand that what they principally fear at fort mifflin is a surprise by night or a lodgment upon the upper end of the island by which they may cover themselves before morning and open a battery upon the rear of the fort which is only secured by palisadoes the only method of guarding effectually against this is by keeping boats stationed by night between fort and province island to give an immediate alarm and when the weather is calm if the galleys were to lay near the island to be ready to begin a fire upon the first landing of the enemy it would harass and retard them much in their operations i am afraid that matters do not go on smoothly between the commandant at fort mifflin and the     commodore as there are every now and then complaints of inattention in the commodore but i do not know whether with just grounds i beg you will do all in your power to reconcile any differences that may have arisen not by taking notice of them in a direct manner but by recommending unanimity and demonstrating the manifest advantages of it as the commodore will have a considerable reinforcement after you arrive i hope he will be able to afford more assistance than he has hitherto done  you will have an opportunity of seeing and conversing with the baron darendt and i must beg you will lay such plans as will most effectually contribute to the mutual support and defence of your posts for you are to consider if one falls the other goes of course as soon as you have looked about you and taken a survey of the ground about you i shall be glad to have your opinion of matters i am c george washington   november      governor livingston to governor livingston headquarters   november      sir i think it not only incumbent upon me but a duty which i owe the public to represent to you the unaccountable conduct of brigr genl newcomb at this   0 critical time as soon as the enemy shewed a disposition to possess themselves of billingsport and red bank i wrote to him in the most urgent manner to collect and keep up as many militia as he possibly could to assist in the defence of red bank in particular till i could afford a proper garrison of continental troops and altho i recd no very favorable accounts of his activity or exertions i imagined that he had been doing something towards it—on the   th ulto genl forman arrived at red bank with a few of his own continental regt and some of the mounted militia and wrote me as follows the lower militia and a genl newcomb have not as yet produced a single man as being elder in command than newcomb i take the liberty this day to issue orders for their immediate assembling and will from time to time do every thing in my power to assemble them on the   th he writes me again previous to the rect of yours of the   th i had given orders to several of the militia officers of this part of the country to assemble their men and have used my endeavors with general newcomb to obtain a return of the men it is said he has assembled that they might be put in some duty either in the garrison or on some out guards but the general absolutely refuses to render me any account of himself or his men that i am not able to inform your excelly whether he really has or has not any men assembled in another paragraph of the same letter he says yet i think i could be able to collect a respectable body of militia was i able to overcome     the obstincy of or to displace genl newcomb from the best information i can collect he has at no time given any assistance either to the garrisons or the fleet particularly in the late attack upon red bank he neither harrassed the enemy in their advance during the assault or in their retreat he thinks himself only accountable to the gov or majr genl dickenson i should be glad of your excellc directions respecting my treatment of him i shall make no comments but leave it to the opinions of yourself and the gentlemen of the legislature whether such a man is fit to command in a part of the state immediately the object of the enemys attention and in which the most vigorous measures ought to be pursued if you would only direct him to obey genl forman as a senior officer much good to the service would result from it i had been more than commonly pressing with genl newcomb to assemble men at red bank because i found by letters from genl forman that scarce any part of the  000 men ordered under his command to the reinforcement of this army were from a variety of circumstances to be expected and therefore i should be able to afford less assistance of continental troops to that valuable post col dayton will inform you of the reduction of the regiments of your state in point of numbers and of the distress which they will labor under for want of necessaries unless some measures can be fallen upon for supplying them these are matters which     deserve your most serious consideration and which i recommend to your attention it is in vain to think of filling up your regiments by the common mode of inlistment while the pernicious practice of hiring substitutes for the militia prevails for what man will engage to serve during the war for a bounty of twenty dollars where he can get twice as much for serving one month in the militia some of the eastern states and virginia have adopted the mode of drafting and i am told it succeeds and was the practice universal the people would not think it a hardship i do not mention this by way of dictating to or directing you i only do it to shew what has been found to answer the end in other states i am confident that could we ever be happy enough to fill the continental regt we should never have occasion to trouble the militia again circumscribed as we are in our importations from abroad the cloathier general finds it impossible to comply with the full demands of the whole army it therefore becomes incumbent upon the different states to endeavor to procure the most material articles of blankets shoes and stockings at this inclement season and i am convinced if assessments of these things were laid upon those only who do not perform military service enough might be found to make the troops comfortable i have repeatedly sent out officers to make collections but they either do it partially or neglect it wholly i must therefore entreat you to lay this matter before your legislature as early as     possible and press them to make provision in such way as seems to them most likely to answer the end i have c  george washington   november      sir william howe to sir william howe headquarters   november      sir i have been informed by lieutenantcolonel frazer who is now a prisoner in your possession that major balfour one of your aids had assured him that it was your earnest desire that a general exchange of prisoners should take place on equitable terms or if this could not be effected that the officers on both sides should be released on parole this i have no doubt was done by your authority and with an intention that it should be communicated to me i     assure you sir nothing would afford me more satisfaction than to carry the first proposition into execution but lest we should still unhappily disagree about the privates to be accounted for and that this may not operate to the prejudice of the officers it is my wish for their mutual relief that their exchange may immediately take place so far as circumstances of rank and number will apply and if any should then remain that they may return to their friends on parole i am induced to mention an exchange in preference to the other mode of release supposing that it will be more agreeable to both parties while we are on this subject i would take the liberty to suggest that on the footing of our present agreement the colonels who are your prisoners cannot be exchanged there being no officers of the like rank in your army prisoners with us from this consideration i am led to inquire whether an equivalent cannot be fixed on to effect it as has been practised in similar cases i have the honor to be c george washington   november      whitemarsh jeremiah powell to jeremiah powell president of the council of massachusetts camp at whitemarsh   november      sir i have been duly honored with your favor of the   th ultimo and join your honorable board most heartily in congratulations on our success in the surrender of general burgoyne and his army an event of great importance and which reflects the     highest honor upon our arms in respect to the embarkation of the prisoners i take it for granted that the beneficial consequences the british nation would derive from their arrival in england will be sufficient motives for general howe to use every possible exertion to get them away and that no application for that end will be necessary for as soon as they arrive they will enable the ministry to send an equal number of other troops from their different garrisons to join him here or upon any other service against the american states i shall be sorry if their remaining should subject you to the inconveniences which you seem to apprehend and if they can be accommodated i think in point of policy we should not be anxious for their early departure as to the transports if general howe is in a situation to send them it is to be presumed they will be properly appointed with provisions and wood the terms of convention not obliging us to furnish their prisoners for a longer time than they continue in our hands  i do not apprehend that there will be any thing to fear from the vessels assigned for their transportation the condition on which they are to be allowed an entry imports a truce and no stipulations that can be made will be more obligatory nevertheless prudence and the usage of nations do not only     justify but require that every precaution should be had previous to their being admitted into port to prevent an infraction of treaty and any act incompatible with the design of their coming what these precautions ought to be will naturally occur in fine sir i do not know how far i should advise in this business and suppose it probable that congress will give you their sentiments fully upon it being possessed of all the circumstances by a statement from general gates and also from general heath    i have the honor to be c      george washington   november      philadelphia thomas nelson to general thomas nelson camp at white marsh    miles from philadelphia   november      dear sir your favor of the   th ultimo came to my hands yesterday and merits my warmest acknowledgements the idea you entertained of our force was unhappily but too well founded and i now wish i had given more into your generous proposal but the distance and uncertainty of keeping militia in service any length of time were obstacles under the then appearance of things which seemed too great to be counterbalanced by the advantages of your coming which opened them to our view    but the glorious turn which our affairs to the northward have since taken makes a new plan and winter campaign if we can get our ragged and half naked soldiers clothed indispensably necessary as i think general howe may be forced out of philadelphia or greatly distressed in his quarters there if we could draw a large body of troops round the city     the mode by which men have lately been recruited is hurtful in the extreme and unless a more effectual and less pernicious one can be adopted i do not know where the mischief will end—what may be the consequence as the assembly of virginia is now sitting i hope some vigorous and spirited exertions will be used to compleat the regiments from that state and shall i add my wishes that it may contribute their aid towards clothing of them being well persuaded unless the respective states give their assistance we shall be in a very unhappy situation if our regiments were once compleated and tolerably well armed and clothed the calls upon militia afterwards would be rare and till these measures are accomplished our expenses will be enormous it is in vain to look back to our disappointment on the  th instant at germantown we must endeavor to deserve better of providence and i am persuaded she will smile upon us the rebuff which the enemy met with at red bank in which count donop and about four or  00 hessians were killed and wounded and the loss of the augusta of    and merlin of    guns have i dare say been fully related to you which renders it unnecessary for one to dwell on it they are using every effort for the reduction of fort mifflin and we under our present circumstances to save it the event is left to heaven with compliments to mrs nelson mr secretary c i am c     george washington   november      theodorick bland to col theodorick bland headquarters   november      dear sir i have received your favor mentioning the very strong reasons you have for quitting the service or at least obtaining leave of absence for the settlement of your affairs which you say and i make no doubt are in a situation that demands your presence as the contest in which we all saw the necessity of stepping forth still remains undetermined and the event of war doubtful and uncertain i conceive that the same motives which first called us out now plead in the most pressing terms for our perseverance to that happy period in which our united efforts shall effect that great design for the accomplishment of which we were first induced to sacrifice the happiness of domestic life i believe the private concerns of every officer in the army will suffer in a greater or less degree by his absence which must have been expected as a matter of course at their first acceptance of their commissions as to the strictness of honor and integrity with which you have conducted yourself having never heard the least suggestion to the contrary i think it unnecessary to say anything on that head i have always endeavored to give every indulgence to officers which i thought consistent with my duty and the good of the service in this instance i think matters had best be deferred to the close of the campaign when your request can in either way be answered with greater propriety and precision i am c   0 george washington   november      brigadiergeneral conway to brigadiergeneral conway   november      sir a letter which i received last night contained the following paragraph in a letter from general conway to general gates he says heaven has been determined to save your country or a weak general and bad counsellors would have ruined it  i am sir your humble servant  george washington  0 november      whitemarsh henry laurens to henry laurens president of congress  camp at whitemarsh  0 november      sir i have been duly honored with your favors of the  th and  th instant with their several enclosures among those of the former i found the resolution you are pleased to allude to respecting your appointment as president permit me sir to congratulate you upon this event and to assure you i have the most entire confidence that i shall experience in you during your presidency the same politeness and attention to the interests of the states that marked the conduct of your worthy predecessor with respect to the views of the navy board for securing the frigates the situation of the army would not admit of a compliance with them supposing they would answer the end i have therefore written to the board in the most pressing terms to have the frigates scuttled in such a way that they may be raised     when it shall be necessary and that in the mean time they may not be liable to injury from floating ice i see no measure so likely to secure em to us and against the enemys attempts i have been extremely fearful they would have possessed and employed them with the delaware and their batteries on the rear of the galleys and the fort while the ships below attacked in front i need not point out the probable consequences of such an event they are too obvious the resolves which you request to be communicated to the army shall be published in general orders  the letters for commodore hazelwood c have been put in a proper channel of conveyance as to the disposition of part of the northern army my letter of the  st contains my ideas upon the subject and those of my general officers i shall be sorry if the measures i have taken on this head should interfere with or materially vary from any plans congress might have had in view their proceedings of the  th i presume were founded on a supposition that the enemy were still up the north river and garrisoning the forts they had taken this not being the case and all accounts agreeing that reinforcements to general howe are coming from york i hope the aids i have required will be considered expedient and proper independent of the latter consideration i think our exertions and force should be directed to effect general howes destruction if it is possible      among the various difficulties attending the army the adjustment of rank is not the least this owing to the several modes the several principles that have prevailed in granting commissions is involved in great perplexity the officers of the pennsylvania troops are in much confusion about it in many instances those who were junior in rank from local and other circumstances have obtained commissions older in date than those which were granted afterwards to officers their superiors before this with many other irregularities has been and is the cause of great uneasiness and though precedency of rank so claimed should not be supported in justice or upon any principle we find all having the least pretext for the title strenuous to support it and willing to hold a superiority i was therefore induced to order a board of officers to take the matter under consideration the result respecting the field officers of this state i now enclose and wish congress to adopt the regulation which the board have made and to transmit me by the earliest opportunity commissions dated according to their arrangement at the same time it may be proper that there should be a resolve vacating the commissions they now have and directing     them to be delivered to me their attention to this business i trust will be immediate the disputes and jealousies with the officers require it i have enclosed the memorial of colonel duportail and the other engineers for their promotion referred to me by the board of war for my sentiments as to the terms these gentlemen mentioned to have been proposed and agreed to when they first arrived i know nothing of them further than the memorial states in respect to their abilities and knowledge in their profession i must observe they have had no great opportunity of proving them since they were in our service however i have reason to believe that they have been regularly bred in this important branch of war and that their talents which have been hitherto as it were dormant want only a proper occasion to call them forth in which case i have no doubt they would do themselves honor and the states essential service it is of great importance too to consider the practicability of replacing these gentlemen with persons equally qualified if they should quit the service and how indispensable men of skill in this branch of military science are to every army while i am on this subject i would take the liberty to mention that i have been well informed that the engineer in the northern army kosciuszko i think his name is is a gentleman of science and merit from the character i have had of him he is deserving of notice too      i would beg leave to mention that we are in great distress for want of money this will be more urgent every day and it is probable there will be a good deal of pay due the troops coming to reinforce us general putnam writes pressingly for a supply and says he is in a most disagreeable situation for want of it i must request the attention of congress to this subject your favor of the  th came to hand this morning i shall pay proper attention to the enclosures the rank of the officers of cavalry i will attempt to have settled as soon as circumstances will admit i have nothing very interesting to communicate the enemy have lost one of their new floating batteries it sunk in a little time after it was launched there has been a cannonade today it still continues i do not know the occasion but imagine that it is between the ships and galleys i have c george washington    november      whitemarsh to the president of congress camp near whitemarsh    november      sir the condition of the army for want of cloaths and blankets and the little prospect we have of obtaining relief according to the information i have received from the board of war occasion me to trouble you at this time the mode of seizing and forcing supplies from the inhabitants i fear would     prove very inadequate to the demands while it would certainly imbitter the minds of the people and excite perhaps a hurtful jealousy against the army i have had officers out for the purpose of purchasing and making voluntary collections of necessaries and in a few instances more coercive measures have been exercised but all these have proved of little avail our distresses still continue and are becoming greater i would therefore humbly submit it to the consideration of congress whether it may not be expedient for them to address the several legislative and executive powers of the states on this subject as early as possible and in the most urgent terms it appears to me if they were to appoint under the authority of congress proper active agents that many necessaries might be procured in addition to those employed on public acct besides this i think the exigency of our affairs requires that they should resolve on an immediate assessment to be made on the inhabitants if these modes were adopted considerable aids might be derived and in a way much less exceptionable than that of seizing by the army the assemblies in many states i believe are now sitting and i have no doubt upon a requisition by congress but they will give attention to the measure  inclosed you will receive a copy of a letter from genl putnam which came to hand today you will     find his and governor clintons opinion respecting the fortifications necessary to be made for the security of the north river as soon as i heard that warners militia were coming down to reinforce me i immediately wrote to countermand them and directed that they should be retained to carry on the necessary works during the time they are to serve my letter on this subject was on the  th instant as to the other troops the propriety of bringing them here i believe is not to be questioned—we are told through various channels that sir henry clinton is coming round with all the force that can be possibly spared from new york and it is said that those on staten island are withdrawn it is added also that the inhabitants of the former are greatly alarmed and disgusted and that genl tryon is calling on the militia of long island for the defence of the city genl putnams letter will also evince the necessity there is for a large and immediate supply of money being sent to the paymaster general i have also the honor to transmit you a copy of a report by a board of genl officers on the subject of rations which i submit to the consideration of congress—the establishment and regulations which they propose appear to me to be just and necessary supposing the commissarys estimate to be right which i presume is the case from the exorbitant price     which has been  is now paid for every species of provision the necessity of an alteration in the former value has been long urged by many officers—and for want of it several i believe have left the service i have c p s by advices just received thirtyeight transports have arrived in the delaware with troops they were as high up as reedy island yesterday i suppose they are from new york george washington    november      brigadiergeneral varnum to brigadiergeneral varnum headquarters    november        oclock pm dear sir since i wrote to you at one oclock this day  yours dated twelve last night came to hand this has occasioned an alteration in the sentiments of myself     and the council who find it impossible from your representations to give timely relief to the fort we therefore are now of opinion that the cannon and stores ought immediately to be removed and every thing put into a disposition to remove totally at a moments warning but as every day that we can hold even the island is so much time gained i would recommend a party to be left who might find good shelter behind the ruined works and when they abandon they should set fire to the barracks and all remaining buildings if this was done upon a flood tide the enemy could not come out of schuylkill with boats to put the fire out or to interrupt the passage at the garrison if what works remain could be blown up or other ways effectually destroyed before evacuation it would take the enemy so much more time and labor to make a lodgement upon the island be pleased to communicate this to col smith and let him know i recd his of yesterday i hope his wound is not dangerous  i am c     george washington    november      majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath headquarters    november      dear sir in my letter of the  th in answer to yours of the   d ultimo i mentioned that it was not our interest to expedite the passage of the prisoners to england upon a review of the matter i am more and more convinced of the propriety of the observation the most scrupulous adherence on the part of the enemy to the convention of saratoga will justify their placing the prisoners in garrisons as soon as they arrive in britain and will enable the ministry to send out an equal number of troops to reinforce general howe or upon any other service against these states this being the case policy and a regard to our own interest are strongly opposed to our adopting or pursuing any measures to facilitate their embarkation and passage home which are not required of us by the capitulation if by our exertions these ends are promoted our generosity will be rewarded in the arrival of as large a force by the end of march or early in april for the purposes suggested above these considerations lead me to observe that it is extremely probable general burgoyne will apply to you or perhaps to the council of the state to dispense with the articles of convention so far as they respect the port for their embarkation and to change it from boston to some place in rhode island or in the sound i know he has received a hint upon the subject from general howe should such a requisition be made it ought not to be complied with upon   0 any principles whatever it cannot be asked as a matter of right because by the articles boston is assigned as the port it should not be granted as a matter of favor because the indulgence will be attended with most obvious and capital disadvantages to us besides the delay which will necessarily arise from confining them to boston as the place of departure their transports in a voyage round at this season may probably suffer considerable injury and many of them may be blown as far as the west indies these considerations and others needless to be added have struck me in so important a point of view that i have thought it expedient to write to you by express captn vallancey who came with general burgoynes despatches left this on his return yesterday morning and i make no doubt in a little time after his arrival general burgoyne will request the port of embarkation to be altered independent of the impolicy of granting the requisition it appears to me that none have authority to do it but congress themselves i am dear sir with great respect c      george washington    november      whitemarsh governor henry to governor henry whitemarsh    november      dear sir i shall beg leave to refer you to a letter of mine which accompanies this and of the same date for a general account of our situation and wants the design of this is only to inform you and with great truth i can do it strange as it may seem that the army which i have had under my immediate command has not at any one time since general howes landing at the head of elk been equal in point of numbers to his in ascertaining this i do not confine myself to continental troops but comprehend militia the disaffected and lukewarm in this state in whom unhappily it too much abounds taking advantage of the distraction in the government prevented those vigorous exertions which an invaded state ought to have yielded and the short term for which their militia was drawn out expiring before others could be got in and before the maryland militia which by the by were few in number and did not join till after the battle of brandywine came up our numbers kept nearly at a stand and i was left to fight two battles in order if possible to save philadelphia with less numbers than composed the army of my antagonist whilst the world has given us at least double this impression though mortifying     in some points of view i have been obliged to encourage because next to being strong it is best to be thought so by the enemy and to this cause principally i think is to be attributed the slow movements of general howe how different the case in the northern department there the states of new york and new england resolving to crush burgoyne continued pouring in their troops till the surrender of that army at which time not less than fourteen thousand militia as i have been informed were actually in general gatess camp and those composed for the most part of the best yeomanry in the country well armed and in many instances supplied with provisions of their own carrying had the same spirit pervaded the people of this and the neighboring states we might before this time have had general howe nearly in the situation of general burgoyne with this difference that the former would never have been out of reach of his ships whilst the latter increased his danger every step he took having but one retreat in case of a disaster and that blocked up by a respectable force my own difficulties in the course of the campaign have been not a little increased by the extra aid of continental troops which the gloomy prospect of our affairs in the north immediately after the reduction of ticonderoga induced me to spare from this army but it is to be hoped that all will yet end well if the cause is advanced indifferent is it to me where or in what quarter it happens the winter     season with the aid of our neighbors may possibly bring some important event to pass i am sincerely and respectfully dear sir c george washington    november      sir william howe to sir william howe headquarters    november      sir i am sorry to find by the tenor of your letter of the  th instant that we still unhappily differ in our ideas of those just and reasonable terms upon which a general exchange of prisoners might take place and that an event so desirable is probably yet at a distance this being the case that relief to the unhappy where it is practicable may no longer be delayed i am induced to accede to your proposition made through lieutenantcolonel frazer that the officers who are prisoners of war on both sides should be released and have liberty to return among their friends on parole i shall expect your answer as soon as possible upon this subject after which i shall give immediately the necessary orders for the return of your officers to such places as you appoint at the same time i wish that their exchange may appear to you as it does to me the more eligible mode of release notwithstanding what i have said if the interpretation i have given your letter does not correspond with your own meaning and you are disposed to proceed to an exchange of all the prisoners in your possession for an equal number of those in my hands without regard to the dispute subsisting between us     i shall be happy to adopt the measure i therefore request an explanation of the third paragraph of your letter where you say—those at present prisoners with me are ready to be delivered on the shortest notice and it rests solely with you to justify me in doing it in respect to the charge against mr boudinot the enclosed paper will show he has not failed to represent to mr loring the wants of the prisoners in our hands that these may be supplied i shall upon your application grant passports to such persons not above the rank of regimental quartermasters as you may send out with necessaries for them you call upon me to redress the grievances of several of your officers and men who you are pleased to say you are well informed are most injuriously and unjustifiably loaded with irons if there is a single instance of a prisoner of war being in irons i am ignorant of it nor can i find on the most minute inquiry that there is the least foundation for the charge on the contrary i have every reason to believe that your officers and men who are prisoners with us are experiencing a very different treatment i wish you to particularize the cases you allude to that relief may be had if the complaints are well founded and the character and conduct of the persons shall not forbid it now we are upon the subject of grievances i am constrained to observe that i have a variety of accounts not only from prisoners who have made their escape but from persons who have left philadelphia     that our private soldiers in your hands are treated in a manner shocking to humanity and that many of them must have perished through hunger had it not been for the charitable contributions of the inhabitants it is added in aggravation that this treatment is to oblige them to enlist in the corps you are raising the friends of these unhappy men call daily upon me for their relief and the people at large insist on retaliating upon those in our possession justice demands it however before i could proceed to a measure my feelings recoil at i thought it right to mention the facts to you and i would propose that i may be allowed to send a suitable person into the city under the usual restrictions to examine into the truth of them i must also remonstrate against the maltreatment and confinement of our officers this i am informed is not only the case of those in philadelphia but of many in new york whatever plausible pretences may be urged to authorize the condition of the former it is certain but few circumstances can arise to justify that of the latter i appeal to you to redress these several wrongs and you will remember whatever hardships the prisoners with us may be subjected to will be chargeable on you at the same time it is but justice to observe that many of the cruelties exercised towards prisoners are said to proceed from the inhumanity of mr cunningham provostmartial without your knowledge or approbation i am sir with due respect c p s just as i was about to close my letter two     persons men of reputation came from philadelphia i transmit to you their depositions respecting the treatment they received while they were your prisoners i will not comment upon the subject it is too painful george washington november         philadelphia john parke custis to john parke custis white marsh    miles from philadelphia november         dear sir your letter of the twenty sixth ultimo came to my hands in due course of post i observe what you say respecting the renting of claibornes it is not my wish to let it for any longer term than your mamma inclines to and at no rate for her life unless it is perfectly agreeable to her this i did conceive would have been the case as i think she informed me to you but if it is not i am equally well pleased i am very well convinced that i can when time will permit me to attend to my own business readily rent the place for my own interest in it as there are many that wish for it if there is but tolerable good grounds to suspect that the distemper will get among my cattle at claibornes i shall be glad if you would desire mr hill when you next write to him to dispose of them if he can provided he also coincides with you in opinion it is much to be wished that a remedy could be applied to the depreciation of our currency i know of no person better qualified to do this than colonel     mason and shall be very happy to hear that he has taken it in hand long have i been persuaded of the indispensable necessity of a tax for the purpose of sinking the paper money and why it has been delayed better politicians than i must account for what plan colonel mason may have in contemplation for filling up the virginia regiments i know not but certain i am that this is a measure that can not be dispensed with nor ought not under any pretext whatsoever i hope colonel masons health will admit his attendance on the assembly and no other plea should be offered much less received by his constituents it is perfectly agreeable too that colonel baylor should share part of the privateer i have spoken to him on the subject he still continues in the same mind and will write to you on the subject i shall therefore consider myself as possessing one fourth of your full share and that yourself baylor l washington and i are equally concerned in the share you at first held the only articles of intelligence worth communicating i have written to your mamma and refer you to that letter we have an account indeed which seems to gain credit that weeks with a squadron of ships fitted out of the french ports under continental colors had taken fifty three homeward bound west indiamen chiefly from jamaica in the english channel that lord stormont was recalled from the court of france and war expected every moment between france and britain god send it     give my love to nelly and be assured that with sincere regard i remain dear sir your most affectionate george washington    november      alexander hamilton to alexander hamilton headquarters    november      dear sir i have duly received your several favors from the time you left me to that of the   th inst i approve entirely of all the steps you have taken and have only to wish that the exertions of those you have had to deal with had kept pace with your zeal and good intentions i hope your health will before this have permitted you to push on the rear of the whole reinforcement beyond new windsor some of the enemys ships have arrivd in the delaware but how many have troops on board i cannot exactly ascertain the enemy have lately damaged fort mifflin considerably but our people keep possession and seem determined to do so to the last extremity our loss in men has been but small capt treat is unfortunately among the killed i wish you a safe return george washington    november      brigadiergeneral conway to brigadiergeneral conway headquarters    november      sir in answer to your favor of this date it remains with congress alone to accept your resignation this being the case i cannot permit you to leave the army till you have obtained their consent when     that is done i shall not object to your departure since it is your inclination i thank you much for your wishes for the liberty of america and the success of our arms and have only to add that in case you are permitted to return by congress you will have my hopes for a favorable passage and a happy meeting with your family and friends i am sir c  george washington    november      majorgeneral st clair baron de kalb brigadiergeneral knox to majorgeneral st clair majorgeneral baron de kalb and brigadiergeneral knox instructions gentlemen you are to proceed with all convenient expedition to fort mercer where by conferring with brigadier general varnum commodore hazelwood and such other officers as you may think proper to consult—and from your own view of the ground and river you will investigate the following points   the practicability of hindering the enemy from clearing the main channel of the chevaux de frise which now obstructs it—without having possession of mud island  00   what farther aid would be required from this army to effect the purpose above mentioned supposing it practicable and how should such aid be disposed—   whether our fleet will be able to keep the river in case the enemy make a lodgement and establish batteries on mud island   supposing the fleet necessitated to retire whether the land force could maintain its present position independently of it   whether it be practicable to take or drive away the enemys floating battery and if either can be done whether an obstruction may not be laid in the channel through which she passed so as to prevent the passage of any vessel in future   if the fleet should be obliged to retire and fort mercer be invested by the enemy by what means could the garrison be drawn off or reinforced if either should be judged necessary—you will be particular in making my acknowledgements to those officers and men who have distinguished themselves in the defense of the fort and assuring them that i have a high sense of their gallant conduct this is by no means to be understood gentlemen as restraining you to the examination only of the particular points enumerated which are intended as a memorandum—but you will in conjunction with the commanding officers on the spot make every such arrangement and alteration as shall appear essential—given at headquarters    november       george washington    november      whitemarsh to the president of congress headquarters whitemarsh    november      sir i am sorry to inform you that fort mifflin was evacuated the night before last after a defence which does credit to the american arms and will ever reflect  0  the highest honor upon the officers and men of the garrison the works were entirely beat down every piece of cannon dismounted and one of the enemys ships so near that she threw grenades into the fort and killed men upon the platforms from her tops before they quitted the island this ship had been cut down for the purpose and so constructed that she made but a small draft of water and by these means warped in between fort mifflin and the province island some complaints are made that the captains of the galleys did not sufficiently exert themselves to drive this vessel from her station but i shall not determine any thing upon the matter till a proper inquiry is made nothing in the course of this campaign has taken up so much of the attention and consideration of myself and all the general officers as the possibility of giving a further relief to fort mifflin than what we had already afforded such a garrison was thrown into it as has been found by experience capable of defending it to the last extremity and red bank which was deemed essentially necessary not only for the purpose of keeping open the communication but of annoying the enemys ships and covering our own fleet has been possessed by a considerable detachment from this army the only remaining and practicable  0  mode of giving relief to the fort was by dislodging the enemy from province island from whence they kept up an incessant fire but this from the situation of the ground was not to be attempted with any degree of safety to the attacking party unless the whole or a considerable part of the army should be removed to the west side of schuylkill to support and cover it to account for this you must be made acquainted with the nature of the ground in order to have made the attack upon province island the party destined for that service which would have been at least fifteen hundred must have marched down the chester road as far as the bell inn near derby and thence turning towards delaware must have proceeded about four miles further through a neck of land to the island the enemy have a bridge at the middle ferry upon the schuylkill which is but four miles from the bell inn consequently by throwing a body of men over that bridge upon the first discovery of our design and marching down to the bell they would have effectually cut off our detachment upon their return it is true the covering party might have consisted of a less number than the whole army but then those remaining upon this side of the river would have been too few to have been intrusted with all the artillery and stores of the army within twelve miles of the enemy there were many and very forcible reasons against a total remove to the west side of schuylkill leaving all our stores at easton bethlehem and allentown uncovered and abandoning several of our  0  hospitals within reach of the enemy first presented themselves another and in my opinion a more weighty reason than either of the preceding was the importance of supporting the post at red bank upon which that at fort mifflin in a great measure depended as through it we sent in supplies of men provisions and ammunition the enemy sensible of this endeavored to dislodge us from red bank on the   d last month which as congress have been informed cost them four hundred men now had our army been up on the west side of the schuylkill they might without any danger of an attack upon their lines have thrown over so considerable a force into jersey that they might have overpowered the garrison and by making themselves masters of it have reduced fort mifflin by famine or want of ammunition thus we should in all probability have lost both posts by one stroke they might also by taking possession of the fords upon schuylkill have rendered the junction of our northern reinforcements with us a very difficult if not an impracticable matter and should any accident have happened to them we should have stood a very poor chance of looking general howe in the face through the winter with an inferior army we should finally have thrown the army into such a situation that we must inevitably have drawn on a general engagement before our reinforcements arrived which considering our disparity of numbers would probably have ended with the most disagreeable consequences it was therefore determined a few days ago to  0  wait the arrival of the reinforcement from the northward before any alteration could safely be made in the disposition of the army and i was not without hopes that the fort would have held out till that time that we might then have moved without endangering the stores i had given orders for the removal of them from the places before mentioned to lebanon and other places in lancaster county which is at any rate more safe and convenient than where they were as the keeping possession of red bank and thereby still preventing the enemy from weighing the chevauxdefrise before the frost obliges their ships to quit the river has become a matter of the greatest importance i have determined to send down general st clair general knox and baron kalb to take a view of the ground and to endeavor to form a judgment of the most probable means of securing it they will at the same time see how far it is possible for our fleet to keep their station since the loss of fort mifflin and also make the proper inquiry into the conduct of the captains of the galleys mentioned in the former part of this letter   0  i am informed that it is a matter of amazement and that reflections have been thrown out against this army for not being more active and enterprising than in the opinion of some they ought to have been if the charge is just the best way to account for it will be to refer you to the returns of our strength and those which i can produce of the enemy and to the enclosed abstract of the clothing now actually wanting for the army and then i think the wonder will be how they keep the field at all in  0  tents at this season of the year what stock the clothiergeneral has to supply this demand or what are his prospects he himself will inform you as i have directed him to go to york town to lay these matters before congress there are besides most of those in the hospitals more bare than those in the field many remain there for want of clothes only several general officers unable to procure clothing in the common line have employed agents to purchase up what could be found in different parts of  0  the country general wayne among others has employed mr zantzinger of lancaster who has purchased to the amount of four thousand five hundred pounds for which he desires a draft upon the treasury board enclosed you have a copy of his letter i am not clear whether this application should properly be made to the treasury or the clothiergeneral who should charge the money to the regiments for whom the clothes are as so much advanced to them if the latter should appear the most proper mode i will order it to be done i am anxiously waiting the arrival of the troops from the northward who ought from the time they have had my orders to have been here before this colonel hamilton one of my aids is up the north river doing all he can to push them forward but he writes me word that he finds many unaccountable delays thrown in his way however i am in hopes that many days will not elapse before a brigade or two at least will arrive the want of these troops has embarrassed all my measures exceedingly   th your despatches of the   th    th have this moment come to hand they shall be attended to and answered in my next i have the honor to be c george washington    november      whitemarsh richard henry lee to richard henry lee in congress whitemarsh    november      dear sir your favor of the  th instant should not have remained so long unanswered but for the uncertainty of colonel pickerings acceptance of his new appointment  0  he has now determined to do this which leads me to say that i am really at a loss to recommend a proper person as a successor to the office of adjutantgeneral the gentleman i named to you some time ago will not you say answer i knew but little of him myself but i understood he was well acquainted with the duty having served much to the satisfaction of general montgomery a good judge in canada during his long and severe campaign in      that i might know the sense of the general officers upon this point of so much importance that is whether any of them were acquainted with a person qualified for the discharge of the important duties of this office i asked them collectively but they either were not acquainted with a proper person or did not incline to recommend any one colonel lee who was formerly recommended by congress to fill this office colonel wilkinson major scull and colonel innes were separately spoken of the first is an active spirited man a good disciplinarian and being as he was disappointed before by colonel pickerings unexpected acceptance of the office may possibly look for it now he writes a good hand but how correctly or with what ease i cannot undertake to say having had no opportunity of judging the next gentleman wilkinson i can say less of because he has served for the most part in the northern department general gates i understand speaks highly of him he is i believe a good grammatical scholar but how diligent i know not the next scull is a  0  young man but an old officer and very highly spoken of for his knowledge of service strictness of discipline diligence and correctness he early was brigademajor to general thompson the last innes i know nothing of than his being a man of spirit good sense and education and recommended by general woodford thus sir have i without the least view to serve an individual given you the name of every one that has been mentioned to me and the characters of them respectively as far as they have been delineated it is a matter of no small moment to the wellbeing of an army that the several departments of it should be filled by men of ability integrity and application and much therefore is it to be wished that you may be fortunate in your choice of adjutant and quartermaster generals to this army wadsworth has the reputation of being clever at business in the commissarys department he was found active and understanding but how far he may be qualified for the chief management of so extensive a department as that of quartermastergeneral i know not experience has already evinced in the commissarial line a change which has embarrassed the movements of this army exceedingly i will not charge it to the measure nor the men but to the time it happened this however with truth i can say that we seldom have more than a day or twos provisions beforehand and often as much behind both of meat and bread it can be no difficult matter therefore under these circumstances for you or any other gentleman to conceive how much the movements of an army are   0 clogged and retarded and now whilst i am upon this subject let me add that i am well convinced that the salt provisions necessary for next year and which for want of salt can only be had to the eastward will not be provided as the season is now far advanced and i have heard of no proper measures being taken to lay them in have you any late advices from europe is there any good grounds for the report of russians coming out  and is there any expectation of a war between france and great britain if these are questions which can be answered with propriety i shall be glad of a solution of them and am with sincere regard dear sir c     george washington    november      whitemarsh majorgeneral putnam to majorgeneral putnam headquarters whitemarsh    november      dear sir i am favored with yours of the   th i could have wished that the regiments i had ordered had come on because i do not like brigades to be broke by detachment the urgency of colonel hamiltons letter was owing to his knowledge of our wants in this quarter and to a certainty that there was no danger to be apprehended from new york if you sent away all the continental troops that were then with you and waited to replace them by those expected down the river i cannot but say there has been more delay     in the march of the troops than i think necessary and i could wish that in future my orders may be immediately complied with without arguing upon the propriety of them if any accident ensues from obeying them the fault will lie upon me and not upon you i have yet heard nothing of poors or pattersons brigades—or of colo chas webbs regiment scannells brigade will be at coryells ferry tonight or tomorrow and lees  jacksons regiments arrived here this day be pleased to inform me particularly of the corps that have marched and are to march and by what routes they are directed that i may know how to despatch orders to meet them upon the road if necessary i am c      to the officers and soldiers of the militia in the counties of hunterdon burlington gloucester salem and cumberland  0 november      friends and fellow soldiers the enemy have thrown considerable force into your state with intent to possess themselves of the post at red bank and after clearing the obstructions in the delaware make incursions into your country—to prevent them from effecting either of these purposes i have sent over a number of continental troops as i trust will with the spirited operations of the militia totally defeat their designs and oblige them to return to the city and suburbs of philadelphia which is the only ground they possess on the pennsylvania shore in which they cannot subsist cut off from the supplies of the plentiful state of new jersey i therefore call upon you by all that you hold dear to rise up as one man and rid your country of its unjust invaders to convince you     that is to be done by a general appearance of all its freemen armed and ready to give their opposition i need only to put you in mind of the effect it had upon the british army in june last who laid aside their intention of marching through the upper part of your state upon seeing the hostile manner in which you were prepared to receive them look also at the glorious effects which followed the spirit of the union which appeared among our brethren of new york and new england who by the brave assistance they afforded the continental army obliged a royal one flushed with their former victories to sue for terms and lay down their arms in the most submissive manner reflect upon these things and i am convinced that every man who can bear a musket will take it up and without respect to time or place give his services in the field for a few weeks perhaps only a few days i am your sincere friend and countryman george washington    november      whitemarsh to the president of congress headquarters whitemarsh    november      sir i have been duly honored with your favors of the   th and   th instant with their enclosures i am well assured congress have not been inattentive to the necessities of the army and that the deficiency in our supplies particularly in the article of clothing has arisen from the difficulty of importing on account of the numerous fleets that line our coast however i am persuaded that considerable relief might be drawn from the different states were they to exert themselves properly this i hope will be the case as soon as they receive the pressing recommendations of congress upon the subject it has been the unvaried custom of the enemy from the commencement of the present contest to     try every artifice and device to delude the people the message through john brown was calculated for this end  i am surprised mr willing should suffer himself to be imposed on by such flimsy measures he knows that there is a plain obvious way for general and lord howe to communicate any proposals they wish to make to congress without the intervention of a second and third hand but this would not suit their views i am sorry that mr brown should have been the bearer of the message as from the character i have had of him he is a worthy welldisposed man it has been frequently mentioned that he had interested himself much in behalf of our prisoners and had afforded them every relief and comfort his circumstances would allow him to give i have been endeavoring to effect an exchange of prisoners upon principles of justice and from motives of humanity but at present i have no prospect of it yet general howe has assured our officers it was his wish and if it could not be done that he should readily agree to their release on parole the enclosed copies of my letters and his answer will show congress what has passed between us upon that subject and at the same time that i had remonstrated against the severe and cruel treatment of the prisoners and proposed the plan of sending in a suitable person to     inquire into the facts before the receipt of their resolution their sufferings i am persuaded have been great and shocking to humanity i have called upon general howe for redress and an explicit answer to my letter of the   th if i do not receive one by tomorrow night with the most positive and satisfactory assurances that a proper conduct shall be observed towards them in future we must retaliate however much we wish to avoid severity and measures that bear the smallest appearance of rigor or inhumanity enclosed you will receive a list of sundry officers who have been cashiered since the action of the  th ultimo i flatter myself that these examples will involve many favorable and beneficial consequences besides these there were many more brought to trial who were acquitted among them general maxwell and general wayne the former for charges against him while he commanded the light troops the latter for charges against his conduct in the attack made on his division in the night of the  0th of september the result of the court of inquiry against general wayne not entirely exempting him from censure in his own opinion he requested a courtmartial and upon a full and minute investigation of the charges against him he was honorably acquitted and in terms of high respect i am sorry to inform congress that the enemy are now in possession of all the water defences fort mifflin and that at red bank mutually depended on each other for support and the reduction of the     former made the tenure of the latter extremely precarious if not impracticable after the loss of fort mifflin it was found red bank could derive no advantages from the galleys and armed vessels they could not maintain their station and in case of investiture the garrison could have no supplies no retreat nor any hope of relief but such as might arise from a superior force acting without on the rear of the enemy and dislodging them under these circumstances the garrison was obliged to evacuate it on the night of the  0th instant on the approach of lord cornwallis who had crossed the river from chester with a detachment supposed to be about two thousand men and formed a junction with the troops lately arrived from new york and those that had been landed before at billingsport from general varnums account i have reason to hope that we saved most of the stores except a few heavy cannon however i cannot be particular in this instance i am also to add from the intelligence i have received that most if not all the armed vessels have been burned by our own people except the galleys one brig and two sloops which are said to have run by the city how far this might be founded in necessity i am not able to determine but i suppose it was done under that idea and an apprehension of their falling into the enemys hands if they attempted to pass up the river upon the first information i had of lord cornwalliss movement i detached general huntingtons brigade to join general varnum and as soon as possible     general greene with his division hoping that these with glovers brigade which was on the march through jersey and which i directed to file off to the left for the same purpose and with such militia as could be collected would be able to defeat the enemys design and preserve the fort but they were so rapid in their advances that our troops could not form a junction and arrive in time to succor the garrison which obliged them to withdraw general greene is still in jersey and when glovers brigade joins him if an attack can be made on lord cornwallis with a prospect of success i am persuaded it will be done about a hundred and seventy of morgans corps are also gone to reinforce him  generals     poor and paterson with their brigades and colonel bailey with learneds are now in camp the last arrived on friday evening the other two in the course of yesterday i have not yet obtained returns of their strength but from the accounts of the officers they will amount in the whole to twentythree or   0 twentyfour hundred rank and file but i find many of them are very deficient in the articles of shoes stockings breeches and blankets besides these about three hundred and fifty men detachments from lees jacksons and henleys regiments have joined me yesterday evening the enemy burned several houses in the neighborhood of philadelphia and they have committed the most wanton spoil in many others i have the honor to be c george washington    november      majorgeneral greene to majorgeneral greene    november      my letter of yesternight wrote after i returned from a view of the enemys lines from the other side schuylkill i must refer to our situation as you justly observe is distressing from a variety of irremediable causes but more especially from the impracticability of answering the expectations of the world without running hazards which no military principles can justify and which in case of failure might prove the ruin of our cause patience and a steady perseverance in such measures as appear warranted by sound reason and policy must support us under the censure of the one and dictate a proper line of conduct for the attainment of the other that is the great object in view this as it ever has will i think ever remain the first wish of my heart however i may mistake the means of accomplishment that your views are the same and that your endeavors have pointed to the same end i am perfectly satisfied     of although you seem to have imbibed a suspicion which i never entertained i can foresee inconveniences i can foresee losses and i dare say i may add that i can foresee much dissatisfaction that will arise from the withdrawing the continental troops from the jerseys but how is it to be avoided we cannot be divided when the enemy are collected the evils which i apprehended from throwing troops into the jerseys now stare me more forcibly in the face and a day or two if you cannot join us in that time may realize them for my mind scarce entertains a doubt but that general howe is collecting his whole force with a view to pushing at this army this especially under the information you have received of lord cornwalliss recrossing the delaware induces me to press despatch upon you that our junction may be formed as speedily as possible and the consequences of a division avoided the current sentiment as far as i can collect it is in favor of our taking post the other side schuylkill in this case the jerseys will be left totally uncovered consequently all the craft in the river with their rigging guns c the hospitals on that side of the river the magazines of provisions which the commissaries are establishing in the upper part of jersey c think therefore i beseech you of all these things and prepare yourself by reflection and observation being on the spot to give me your advice on these several matters the boats those belonging to the public and built for the purpose of transporting troops c across the river ought in my judgment     to be removed as soon as they have served your present calls up to coryells ferry at least if not higher i am also inclined to think if we should cross the schuylkill that they ought to be carted over also it has been proposed that some of the galleys should fall down to or near the mouth of frankfort creek in order to prevent troops from coming up by water and falling in the rear of our pickets near the enemys lines will you discuss with the commodore on this subject will you also ask what is become of the hands that were on board the vessels which were burnt  george washington    november      to the president of congress headquarters    november      sir i was yesterday morning honored with your favors of the   d instt i wish the measures congress have adopted may effectually suppress the disturbances in the western department should they prove successful and the savages and wicked deluded inhabitants receive a severe check it is probable they will not be induced again to take part against us or at least for some considerable time colonel crawford set out yesterday evening and will be with congress i expect in the course of two or three days to take their commands i was much obliged by the foreign intelligence you were pleased to transmit to me it is     agreeable and interesting and i heartily wish there may be an early declaration of hostilities between france and britain from these advices things seem to be getting into a proper train for it and it is not easily to be conceived that it can be much longer delayed however our expectations have not been answered in this instance and they may yet be held in suspense the political reasons that lead to delay on the part of france i do not perfectly understand as to britain her honor is lost in the contest with us and the most indignant insults will scarcely be able to draw her attention from her present pursuits the account of mr lee having effected the purpose of his embassy at the court of berlin is of great importance if it be true in such case administration however desirous they may be will probably be disappointed in their schemes of further mercenary aids against us  i must take the liberty to request the decision of congress on the case of the nine first raised virginia regiments as early as circumstances will permit if the plan proposed for reënlisting them is judged expedient one capital inducement to that end suggested by the officers will cease if it is longer delayed it is a matter of considerable importance and of which i wish to be satisfied as soon as possible i should also be happy in their determination respecting the marquis de lafayette he is more and more     solicitious to be in actual service and is pressing in his applications for a command i ventured before to submit my sentiments upon the measure and i still fear a refusal will not only induce him to return in disgust but may involve some unfavorable consequences there are now some vacant divisions in the army to one of which he may be appointed if it should be the pleasure of congress i am convinced he possesses a large share of that military ardor which generally characterizes the nobility of his country he went to jersey with general greene and i find he has not been inactive there this you will perceive by the following extract from a letter just received from general greene— the marquis with about four hundred militia and the rifle corps attacked the enemys picket last evening killed about twenty wounded many more and took about twenty prisoners the marquis is charmed with the spirited behavior of the militia and rifle corps they drove the enemy about half a mile and kept the ground until dark the enemys picket consisted of about three hundred and were reinforced during the skirmish the marquis is determined to be in the way of danger      by a letter from general howe to general burgoyne which passed through my hands he hinted that liberty might probably be granted for the prisoners to embark at rhode island or some part of the sound this indulgence appearing to me inadmissible i immediately wrote to general heath to prevent him giving the least countenance to the measure in case it should be requested and also to the council of massachusetts state and general gates lest he should extend his applications to them the reasons i am persuaded will at once occur to congress for my conduct in this instance as well as for general howes and i have been induced to mention it here on a supposition that general burgoyne may address them on the subject if the embarkation is confined to boston it is likely that it will not take place before some time in the spring or at least till towards the end of february whereas if it were allowed at either of the other places it might be made this month or the beginning of next and the troops arrive in britain by the month of january a circumstance of great importance to us as the moment they get there the most scrupulous and virtuous observance of the convention     will justify the ministry in placing them in garrison and sending others out to reinforce general howe or upon any other expedition that they may think proper to undertake against us besides compelling their transports to perform a long coasting voyage at a tempestuous season may bring on the loss of many and be the means of deferring the embarkation for a long time i must request you to transmit me a number of blank commissions as soon as you have an opportunity to do it there are several vacancies yet to fill and the officers entitled to em are anxious to be appointed the commissions i want should be under your signature and not mr hancocks i mention this lest you should find any of the latter that might remain those signed by you will be competent to all cases those by mr hancock only to such as happened during his presidency and of those i now have some november   th—enclosed you will receive a copy of general howes letter in answer to mine of the   th and   d which only came to hand last night and at an instant when i was giving the commissary of prisoners instructions forthwith to confine a number of the officers in our hands and to put the privates under very different restrictions from those they have been used to i am in hopes the treatment of ours will be much better in future mr boudinot will immediately take measures for releasing the officers on parole that we may relieve an equal number of ours i should have been happy to have     effected a general exchange or a partial one but general howe will not upon any terms but those he has ever insisted on  the enemy have got up several of their ships to the city it is likely they have found a passage through the chevauxdefrise or they may have removed one of them i have the honor c      george washington    november      majorgeneral greene to majorgeneral greene headquarters    november        oclock p m dear sir captain duplessis has just delivered to me yours of this morning from burlington every account from philadelphia confirms the report that the enemy mean to make a speedy move i shall not be disappointed if they come out this night or very early in the morning you will therefore push forward the rear brigades with all possible expedition and the moment that the troops and baggage have all passed let the boats be instantly sent up the river to coryells ferry for one part of my information is that the enemy are preparing to send boats up the delaware and it cannot be for any other purpose than to destroy the remainder of our watercraft i shall be glad that you would come on immediately upon the receipt of this and send word back to the brigadiers to hasten their march i am c  if genl greene should not be found genl varnum or huntingdon will be pleased to do what is directed above and send word to the captains of the gallies to fall lower down the river to meet any boats that may be coming up to annoy the passage of the troops or baggage     george washington   december      white marsh to the president of congress head quarters white marsh   december      sir on saturday i had the honor to receive your favor of the   th ulto with its inclosures the resolve of the   th i have published in orders agreeable to direction and shall be happy if congress can fall upon measures to render the situation of the officers  soldiery more eligible than what it now is at present it is truly distressing and unless some means can be devised to support them more comfortably we shall have to apprehend the most alarming consequences the officers or at least a large proportion of them as well as the men are in a most disagreeable condition as to cloathing and without any certain prospect of relief—and what is still more painful if perchance they have an   0 opportunity of purchasing which is seldom the case they have the mortification to find themselves totally incompetent to it from the depreciation of our money and the exorbitant prices demanded for all articles in this way this is the source of great uneasiness—of indifference to the service—and of repeated i may say daily application to leave it—and these too by as good officers as are in the american line in respect to promotions for merit and intrepidity i would beg leave to observe that tho these are proper considerations to found them upon yet they should be made with the greatest caution  attention and only in cases of the most eminent and distinguished services every promotion or rise out of common course cannot fail to excite uneasiness in a greater or lesser degree and nothing will reconcile them to the army at large and particularly the officers more immediately affected by them but where the causes are known and acknowledged this i mention from my wishes to promote the public interest from my knowing that harmony is essential to this end and from no other motives whatever before the receipt of your favor i do not recollect to have heard of john simpers case his brother has not been with me—as soon as he arrives i shall give directions for him to be released from his present confinement and to be forwarded to cecil county i have nothing material to inform you of lord cornwallis and the detachment under his command mentioned in my last returned from jersey on thursday we had reason to expect an attack     since from our advices from the city but have been disappointed genl greene has also joined me with all the troops that were with him except huntingtons brigade which will be in today i have c george washington   december      majorgeneral putnam to majorgeneral putnam headquarters   december      dear sir the importance of the north river in the present contest and the necessity of defending it are subjects which have been so frequently and so fully discussed and are so well understood that it is unnecessary to enlarge upon them these facts at once appear when it is considered that it runs through a whole state that it is the only passage by which the enemy from new york or any part of our coast can ever hope to coöperate with an army from canada that the possession of it is indispensably essential to preserve the communication between the eastern middle and southern states and further that upon its security in a great measure depend our chief supplies of flour for the subsistence of such forces as we may have occasion for in the course of the war either in the eastern or northern departments or in the country lying high up on the west side of it these facts are familiar to all they are familiar to you i therefore request you in the most urgent terms to turn your most serious and active attention to this infinitely important object seize the present opportunity and employ your whole     force and all the means in your power for erecting and completing as far as it shall be possible such works and obstructions as may be necessary to defend and secure the river against any future attempts of the enemy you will consult governor clinton general parsons and the french engineer colonel radière upon the occasion by gaining the passage you know the enemy have already laid waste and destroyed all the houses mills and towns accessible to them unless proper measures are taken to prevent them they will renew their ravages in the spring or as soon as the season will admit and perhaps albany the only town in the state of any importance remaining in our hands may undergo a like fate and a general havoc and devastation take place to prevent these evils therefore i shall expect that you will exert every nerve and employ your whole force in future while and whenever it is practicable in constructing and forwarding the proper works and means of defence they must not be kept out on command and acting in detachments to cover the country below which is a consideration infinitely less important and interesting i am dear sir c      george washington   december      whitemarsh joseph reed to joseph reed whitemarsh   december      dear sir if you can with any convenience let me see you today i shall be thankful for it i am about fixing the winter cantonments of the army and find so many and such capital objections to each mode proposed that i am exceedingly embarrassed not only by the advice given me but in my own judgment and should be very glad of your sentiments on the matter without loss of time in hopes of seeing you i shall only add that from reading to lancaster inclusively is the general sentiment whilst wilmington and its vicinity has powerful advocates this however is mentioned under the rose for i am convinced in my own opinion that if the enemy believed we had this place in contemplation they would possess themselves of it immediately i am very sincerely dear sir yours affectionately     george washington   december      majorgeneral gates to majorgeneral gates   december      sir i was yesterday favored with yours of the   d of november and am glad to find that you were upon your guard against any attempt of general burgoyne to endeavor to change the place of embarkation no transports have yet sailed from the delaware for the purpose of carrying the troops to europe nor do i hear that any have gone from new york i can only attribute this delay to want of provision for the voyage bread we know is exceedingly scarce among them by a resolve of congress of the  th of november copy of which i perceive by the resolve itself has been transmitted to you you are directed with a certain part of the northern army and the assistance of the militia of new york and the eastern states to attempt the recovery of the posts upon the north river from the enemy and to put them if recovered in the best posture of defence the enemy having themselves vacated forts montgomery and clinton while the resolve was in agitation but of which the congress could not at the time be informed the first part falls of course but the last deserves our most serious attention as upon the possession of the north river depends the security of all the upper part of the government of new york and the communication between the eastern middle and southern states it is also the quarter in which the enemy will probably attempt a diversion in the spring as from the small    force they have remaining in canada there is not a possibility of their doing any thing on that side till very late in the campaign if at all my not having heard from you what steps you have taken towards carrying the resolve for repairing the old works or building new into execution or when you might be expected down into that part of the country has made me hitherto delay recalling general putnam from the command but i beg leave to urge to you the necessity of your presence in that quarter as speedily as possible for i fear few or no measures have yet been taken towards putting matters in a proper train for carrying on these important works general george clinton will necessarily be employed in the affairs of his government but i have wrote to him sir and i am certain he will call for and contribute all the aid that the state of new york can possibly afford you are vested by the resolve of congress with authority to demand a proportionable share of assistance from the eastern states i observe by a paragraph in the fishkill paper of some days later date than your letter that the enemy had evacuated ticonderoga and independance if this should have happened it will not only relieve your attention from that object but it will enable you to draw the force which you might have intended to watch the operations of the enemy in that quarter lower down the river lieut colo willet who was here a few days ago mentioned that gansevoorts regiment was at fort schuyler and van schaiks at schenectady he     seemed of opinion from his knowledge of that country and from the disposition of the indians since your success to the northward that a much less garrison than the whole of gansevoorts regt would be sufficient for fort schuyler and that the remainder of that and van schaicks might be brought down the country your own knowledge and judgment will undoubtedly point out the propriety  safety of such a measure i barely mention colo willets opinion of the matter you must be so well convinced of the importance of the north river that nothing more need be said to induce you to set about the security of it with the greatest vigour i sometime ago sent up lt colo la radiere to fishkill to assist in carrying on the works but if he with the gentleman who was before with you should not be sufficient i can send up another who i believe is a master of his profession general howe has withdrawn himself close within his lines which extend from the upper ferry upon the schuylkill to kensington upon the delaware they consist of a chain of strong redoubts connected by abatis we have reconnoitred them well but find it impossible to attack them while defended by a force fully equal to our own in continental troops the reinforcement from new york unluckily arriving before ours from the northward it was out of my power to afford adequate relief to fort mifflin which fell after a most gallant defence of seven weeks the works upon the jersey shore which were of no great consequence after the reduction of fort mifflin     were evacuated as it would have been impossible to support the garrison there we have not yet determined upon a position for the army during the winter that situation will undoubtedly be most eligible which will afford best cover to the troops and will at the same time cut off the enemy from resources of provision which they may probably stand in need of when the navigation of delaware is obstructed by the ice i am sir c  george washington  0 december      whitemarsh to the president of congress headquarters whitemarsh  0 december      sir i have the honor to inform you that in the course of last week from a variety of intelligence i had reason to expect that general howe was preparing to     give us a general action accordingly on thursday night he moved from the city with all his force except a very inconsiderable part left in his lines and redoubts and appeared the next morning on chesnut hill in front of and about three miles distant from our right wing as soon as their position was discovered the pennsylvania militia were ordered from our right to skirmish with their light advanced parties and i am sorry to mention that brigadiergeneral irvine who led them on had the misfortune to be wounded and to be made prisoner nothing more occurred on that day on friday night the enemy changed their ground and moved to our left within a mile of our line where they remained quiet and advantageously posted the whole of the next day on sunday they inclined still further to our left and from every appearance there was reason to apprehend they were determined on an action in this movement their advanced and flanking parties were warmly attacked by colonel morgan and his corps and also by the maryland militia under colonel gist their loss i cannot ascertain but i am informed it was considerable having regard to the number of the corps who engaged them about sunset after various marches and countermarches they halted and i still supposed from their disposition and preceding manœuvres that they would attack us in the night or early the next morning but in this i was mistaken on monday afternoon they began to move again and instead of advancing filed off from their right and     the first certain account that i could obtain of their intentions was that they were in full march towards philadelphia by two or three routes i immediately detached light parties after them to fall upon their rear but they were not able to come up with them the enemys loss as i have observed i cannot ascertain one account from the city is that five hundred wounded had been sent in another is that eightytwo wagons had gone in with men in this situation these i fear are both exaggerated and not to be depended upon we lost twentyseven men in morgans corps killed and wounded besides major morris a brave and gallant officer who is among the latter of the maryland militia there were also sixteen or seventeen wounded i have not received further returns yet i sincerely wish that they had made an attack as the issue in all probability from the disposition of our troops and the strong situation of our camp would have been fortunate and happy at the same time i must add that reason prudence and every principle of policy forbade us quitting our post to attack them nothing but success would have justified the measure and this could not be expected from their position the constant attention and watching i was obliged to give the enemys movements would not allow me to write before and this i believe was the less material as i have reason to think your committee who were in camp most of the time and who are now here transmitted an account of such occurrences as they deemed important in any degree the first cause   0 too sir and my engagements with the committee previous to the coming out of the enemy will i trust sufficiently apologize for my not acknowledging before the honor of your favors of the   th ultimo and the  st instant which came to hand in due order and time i have the honor to be c  george washington    december      whitemarsh governor livingston to governor livingston headquarters whitemarsh    december      sir i had the honor of receiving yours of the  st inst some time since but the situation which the army has been in must apologise for my not answering it sooner general howe after making great preparations and threatening to drive us beyond the mountains     came out with his whole force last thursday evening and after manœuvring round us till the monday following decamped very hastily and marched back to philadelphia in my opinion trying the officers taken by general dickinson on staten island for high treason may prove a dangerous expedient it is true they left the state after such an offence was declared to be treason but as they had not taken the oaths nor had entered into our service it will be said they had a right to choose their side again by the same rule that we try them may not the enemy try any natural born subject of great britain taken in arms in our service we have a great number of them and i therefore think that we had better submit to the necessity of treating a few individuals who may really deserve a severer fate as prisoners of war than run the risk of giving an opening for retaliation upon the europeans in our service      i am pleased to hear that your assembly are in so good a disposition to regulate the price of necessaries for the army i could wish that they would not forget to regulate the prices of country produce which the commissaries tell me has risen to so exorbitant a rate that there is no purchasing a single article from the farmers i am c george washington    december      to the president of congress headquarters near the gulf    december      sir on thursday evening i had the honor to receive your favor of the  th instant from several letters which have lately passed between general howe and myself i am fully convinced that any propositions by me to release the baron st ouary from captivity either by an exchange or on parole would be unavailing he has explicitly stated his sentiments and has declared himself to be utterly against a partial exchange the situation of the baron through the interest and acquaintance of the marquis de lafayette with an officer in the guards is much more comfortable than that of any of our officers who are prisoners he being on parole in the city whilst they are     all confined in the statehouse i do not know that it is the practice in europe not to consider volunteers as prisoners i am inclined to believe that it is not and that they are generally held as such unless the contrary is particularly stipulated by cartel however this may be they have been held in the present contest on both sides on the footing of other prisoners and exchanged as such besides this i fear that a proposition calculated for the peculiar benefit of the baron would be ill received by our unhappy officers who have been much longer in confinement whose sufferings are far greater than his and who claim a right to exchange in due course  the inquiries directed in the resolutions contained in your letter of the  0th ultimo respecting the loss of the forts in the highlands and of fort mifflin i shall order to be made as soon as circumstances will admit these however it is probable will not be effected in a short time from the situation of our affairs and inevitable necessity on thursday morning we marched from our old encampment and intended to pass the schuylkill at madisons ford where a bridge had been laid across the river when the first division and a part of the second had passed they found a body of the enemy consisting from the     best accounts we have been able to obtain of four thousand men under lord cornwallis possessing themselves of the heights on both sides of the road leading from the river and the defile called the gulf which i presume are well known to some part of your honorable body this unexpected event obliged such of our troops as had crossed to repass and prevented our getting over till the succeeding night this manœuvre on the part of the enemy was not in consequence of any information they had of our movement but was designed to secure the pass whilst they were foraging in the neighboring country they were met in their advance by general potter with part of the pennsylvania militia who behaved with bravery and gave them every possible opposition till he was obliged to retreat from their superior numbers had we been an hour sooner or had the least information of the measure i am persuaded we should have given his lordship a fortunate stroke or obliged him to return without effecting his purpose or drawn out all general howes force to support him our first intelligence was that it was all out lord cornwallis collected a good deal of forage and returned to the city the night we passed the river no discrimination marked his proceedings all property whether of friends or foes that came in their way was seized and carried off      enclosed is a copy of a letter from general burgoyne by which you will perceive he requests leave to embark his troops at rhode island or at some place on the sound and in case this cannot be granted that he may be allowed with his suite to go there and return from thence to england his first proposition as i have observed upon a former occasion     is certainly inadmissible and for reasons obvious to himself as to the second which respects the departure of himself and suite congress will be pleased to determine upon it and favor me with their sentiments by the first opportunity that i may know what answer to give him  i learn from mr griffin who has just come from boston that this gentleman either holds or professes to hold very different ideas of our power from what he formerly entertained that without reserve he has said it would be next to impossible for britain to succeed in her views and that he should with freedom declare his sentiments accordingly on his arrival in england and that he seemed to think the recognition of our independence by the king and parliament an eligible measure under a treaty of commerce upon a large and extensive scale how far these professions are founded in sincerity it is not easy to determine but if they     are what a mighty change while i am on the subject of mr burgoyne and his army i would submit it to congress whether it will not be right and reasonable that all expenses incurred on their account for provisions should be paid and satisfied previously to their embarkation and departure i mean by an actual deposit of the money unless this is done there will be little reason to suppose that it will ever be paid they have failed that is the nation in other instances as i have been told after liquidating their accounts and giving the fullest certificates and we cannot expect they will keep better faith with us than with others the payment too i should apprehend ought to be in coin as it will enable us to administer some relief to our unfortunate officers and men who are in captivity      december   th—congress seem to have taken for granted a fact that is really not so all the forage for the army has been constantly drawn from bucks and philadelphia counties and those parts most contiguous to the city insomuch that it was nearly exhausted and entirely so in the country below our camp from these too were obtained all the supplies of flour that circumstances would admit of the millers in most instances were unwilling to grind either from their disaffection or from motives of fear this made the supplies less than they otherwise might have been and the quantity which was drawn from thence was little besides what the guards placed at the mills compelled them to manufacture  as to stock i do not know that much was had from thence nor do i know that any considerable supply could have been had     i confess i have felt myself greatly embarrassed with respect to a vigorous exercise of military power an illplaced humanity perhaps and a reluctance to give distress may have restrained me too far but these were not all i have been well aware of the prevalent jealousy of military power and that this has been considered as an evil much to be apprehended even by the best and most sensible among us under this idea i have been cautious and wished to avoid as much as possible any act that might increase it however congress may be assured that no exertions of mine as far as circumstances will admit shall be wanting to provide our own troops with supplies on the one hand and to prevent the enemy from getting them on the other at the same time they must be apprized that many obstacles have arisen to render the former more precarious and difficult than they usually were from a change in the commissarys department at a very critical and interesting period i should be happy if the civil authority in the several states through the recommendations of congress or their own mere will seeing the necessity of supporting the army would always adopt the most spirited measures suited to the end the people at large are governed much by custom to acts of legislation or civil authority they have ever been taught to yield a willing obedience without reasoning about their propriety on those of military power whether immediate or derived originally from another source they have ever looked with a jealous and suspicious eye i have the honor to be c   0 george washington    december      governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters gulf mill    december      sir i have the honor of yours of the  d instant i am much obliged for the attention you have paid to my requests through general putnam and i shall ever acknowledge the readiness with which you have always afforded any assistance from your state when demanded immediately by myself i was never consulted in the least upon the rhode island expedition and i cannot therefore pretend to say who were or who were not to blame but it undoubtedly cost the public an enormous sum to little or no purpose i observe by the copy of your letter to congress that your state had fallen upon means to supply your troops with clothing i must earnestly beg that it may be sent on to camp as fast as it is collected to cover the country more effectually we shall be obliged to lay in a manner in the field the whole winter and except the men are warmly clad they must suffer much among the troops of your state there are three hundred and sixtythree drafts whose time of service will expire with this month this deduction with the former deficiency of the regiments will reduce them exceedingly low and as i have represented this matter to congress very fully i hope they have before this time urged to the states the necessity which there is of filling their regiments this winter     but lest they should not have done it i beg leave to urge the matter to your immediate consideration recruits for the war ought by all means to be obtained if possible but if that cannot be done drafts for one year at least should be called out without delay and i hope that as many as are now upon the point of going home will be immediately reinstated we must expect to lose a considerable number of men by sickness and other ways in the course of the winter and if we cannot take the field in the spring with a superior or at least an equal force with the enemy we shall have labored through the preceding campaign to little purpose i have the honor to be c george washington    december      george read to george read president of delaware headquarters gulf mill    december      sir i have received information which i have great reason to believe is true that the enemy mean to establish a post at wilmington for the purpose of countenancing the disaffected in the delaware state drawing supplies from that country and the lower parts of chester county and securing a post upon the delaware river during the winter as the advantages resulting to the enemy from such a position are most obvious i have determined and shall accordingly this day send off general smallwood with a respectable continental force to take post at wilmington before them if general howe thinks     the place of that importance to him which i conceive it is he will probably attempt to dispossess us of it and as the force which i can at present spare is not adequate to making it perfectly secure i expect that you will call out as many militia as you possibly can to rendezvous without loss of time at wilmington and put themselves under the command of general smallwood i shall hope that the people will turn out cheerfully when they consider that they are called upon to remain within and defend their own state in a letter which i had the honor of receiving from you some little time past you express a wish that some mode may be fallen upon to procure the exchange of governor mckinly as this gentleman will be considered in the civil line i have not any prisoner of war proper to be proposed for him the application would go more properly to congress who have a number of state prisoners under their direction for some of whom sir william howe would probably exchange the governor     george washington    december      valley forge to the president of congress headquarters valley forge    december      sir on saturday evening i had the honor to receive your favor of the   th instant with its enclosures the next day i wrote to general burgoyne upon the     subject of his application and transmitted to him a copy of the resolution of congress founded thereon that the matter might not be delayed i despatched my letter by the express who brought yours he having informed me that you expected he would be sent with it it is with infinite pain and concern that i transmit to congress the enclosed copies of sundry letters respecting the state of the commissarys department in these matters are not exaggerated i do not know from what cause this alarming deficiency or rather total failure of supplies arises but unless more vigorous exertions and better regulations take place in that line immediately this army must dissolve i have done all in my power by remonstrating by writing by ordering the commissaries on this head from time to time but without any good effect or obtaining more than a present scanty relief owing to this the march of the army has been delayed upon more than one interesting occasion in the course of the present campaign and had a body of the enemy crossed the schuylkill this morning as i had reason to expect from the intelligence i received at four oclock last night the divisions which i ordered to be in readiness to march and meet them could not have moved it is unnecessary for me to add more upon the subject i refer congress to the copies by one of which they will perceive how very unfavorable also our prospect is of having any considerable supplies of salt provisions for the ensuing year      i would also take the liberty of reminding congress of the necessity of filling as soon as possible the offices of quartermaster and adjutant general these posts are of infinite importance and without appointments to them it will be impossible to conduct the affairs of the army the first office is now suffering much for want of a head to direct the great business of it and the latter will be in the same predicament in the course of a few days by the departure of colonel pickering who since his appointment to the board of war has been waiting only for a successor      three oclock p m—just as i was about to conclude my letter your favor of the  0th came to hand it would give me infinite pleasure to afford protection to every individual and to every spot of ground in the whole of the united states nothing is more my wish but this is not possible with our present force in all wars from the nature of things individuals and particular places must be exposed it has ever been and ever will be the case and we have only to pity and to regret the misfortune of those who from their situation are subject to ravage and depredation these facts are obvious to all and if that system of conduct is pursued by an army which is most likely to give the most extensive security it is all that can be done or expected from it i assure you sir no circumstance in the course of the present contest or in my whole life has employed more of my reflection or consideration than in what manner to effect this and to dispose of the army during the winter viewing the subject in any point of light there was a choice of difficulties if keeping the field was thought of—the naked condition of the troops and the feelings of humanity opposed the measure if returning to the towns in the interior parts of the state which consistently with the preservation     of the troops from their necessitous circumstances might have been justifiable—the measure was found inexpedient because it would have exposed and left uncovered a large extent of country if cantoning the troops in several places divided and distant from each other—then there was a probability of their being cut off and but little prospect of their giving security to any part under these embarrassments i determined to take post near this place as the best calculated in my judgment to secure the army to protect our stores and cover the country and for this purpose we are beginning to hut and shall endeavor to accomplish it as expeditiously as possible i have also from a desire of preventing the enemy from an intercourse with the delaware state and from making incursions there detached general smallwood with the maryland forces to take post at wilmington which i had strong reason to believe the enemy intended this however i cannot but consider as hazardous and shall be happy if it does not turn out so i have it also in contemplation to throw a bridge over the schuylkill near this place as soon as it is practicable by means of which i hope we shall be able in a great measure with the aid of the militia to check the excursions of the enemys parties on the other side as to jersey i am sensible of her sufferings and exertions in the present contest and there is no state to which i would more willingly extend protection but as i have observed it is not in my power to give     it in that degree which seems to be wished and expected i cannot divide the army not superior when collected from sickness and other causes equally painful to the enemys force into detachments contrary to every military principle and to our own experience of the dangers that would attend it if this is done i cannot be answerable for the consequences my feelings lead strongly to universal relief but i have not the power to afford it nevertheless it has been and is still my intention as soon as i have formed and secured this camp to detach a small force to aid and countenance their militia this is all it appears to me that can be done and i hope the apprehensions in that quarter for the greater part will prove rather imaginary than well grounded though i confess there are strong reasons to conclude that the enemy will not be remiss in their acts of violence and injury there or any where else i have the honor to be c george washington    december      valley forge to the president of congress valley forge    december      sir full as i was in my representation of the matters in the commissarys department yesterday fresh and more powerful reasons oblige me to add that i am now convinced beyond a doubt that unless some great and capital change suddenly takes in that line this army must inevitably be reduced to one or other of these three things starve dissolve or disperse in order to obtain subsistence in the best manner they     can rest assured sir this is not an exaggerated picture and that i have abundant reason to suppose what i say yesterday afternoon receiving information that the enemy in force had left the city and were advancing towards derby with the apparent design to forage and draw subsistence from that part of the country i ordered the troops to be in readiness that i might give every opposition in my power when behold to my great mortification i was not only informed but convinced that the men were unable to stir on account of provision and that a dangerous mutiny begun the night before and which with difficulty was suppressed by the spirited exertions of some officers was still much to be apprehended for want of this article this brought forth the only commissary in the purchasing line in this camp and with him this melancholy and alarming truth that he had not a single hoof of any kind to slaughter and not more than twentyfive barrels of flour from hence form an opinion of our situation when i add that he could not tell when to expect any all i could do under these circumstances was to send out a few light parties to watch and harass the enemy whilst other parties were instantly detached different ways to collect if possible as much provision as would satisfy the present pressing wants of the soldiery but will this answer no sir three or four days of bad weather would prove our destruction what then is to become of the army this winter and if we are so often without provisions now what is to become of us in the spring when our force will     be collected with the aid perhaps of militia to take advantage of an early campaign before the enemy can be reinforced these are considerations of great magnitude meriting the closest attention and they will when my own reputation is so intimately connected with the event and to be affected by it justify my saying that the present commissaries are by no means equal to the execution of the office or that the disaffection of the people is past all belief the misfortune however does in my opinion proceed from both causes and though i have been tender heretofore of giving any opinion or lodging complaints as the change in that department took place contrary to my judgment and the consequences thereof were predicted yet finding that the inactivity of the army whether for want of provisions clothes or other essentials is charged to my account not only by the common vulgar but by those in power it is time to speak plain in exculpation of myself with truth then i can declare that no man in my opinion ever had his measures more impeded than i have by every department of the army since the month of july we have had no assistance from the quartermastergeneral and to want of assistance from this department the commissarygeneral charges great part of his deficiency to this i am to add that notwithstanding it is a standing order and often repeated that the troops shall always have two days provisions by them that they might be ready at any sudden call yet an opportunity has scarcely ever offered of taking an advantage of the enemy that   0 has not been either totally obstructed or greatly impeded on this account and this the great and crying evil is not all the soap vinegar and other articles allowed by congress we see none of nor have we seen them i believe since the battle of brandywine the first indeed we have now little occasion for few men having more than one shirt many only the moiety of one and some none at all in addition to which as a proof of the little benefit received from a clothiergeneral and as a further proof of the inability of an army under the circumstances of this to perform the common duties of soldiers besides a number of men confined to hospitals for want of shoes and others in farmers houses on the same account we have by a fieldreturn this day made no less than two thousand eight hundred and ninetyeight men now in camp unfit for duty because they are barefoot and otherwise naked by the same return it appears that our whole strength in continental troops including the eastern brigades which have joined us since the surrender of general burgoyne exclusive of the maryland troops sent to wilmington amounts to no more than eight thousand two hundred in camp fit for duty notwithstanding which and that since the  th instant our numbers fit for duty from the hardships and exposures they have undergone particularly on account of blankets numbers having been obliged and still are to sit up all night by fires instead of taking comfortable rest in a natural and common way have decreased near two thousand men     we find gentlemen without knowing whether the army was really going into winterquarters or not for i am sure no resolution of mine would warrant the remonstrance reprobating the measure as much as if they thought the soldiers were made of stocks or stones and equally insensible of frost and snow and moreover as if they conceived it easily practicable for an inferior army under the disadvantages i have described ours to be which are by no means exaggerated to confine a superior one in all respects wellappointed and provided for a winters campaign within the city of philadelphia and to cover from depredation and waste the states of pennsylvania and jersey but what makes this matter still more extraordinary in my eye is that these very gentlemen—who were well apprized of the nakedness of the troops from ocular demonstration who thought their own soldiers worse clad than others and who advised me near a month ago to postpone the execution of a plan i was about to adopt in consequence of a resolve of congress for seizing clothes under strong assurances that an ample supply would be collected in ten days agreeably to a decree of the state not one article of which by the by is yet come to hand—should think a winters campaign and the covering of these states from the invasion of an enemy so easy and practicable a business i can assure those gentlemen that it is a much easier and less distressing thing to draw remonstrances in a comfortable room by a good fireside than to occupy a cold bleak hill and sleep under frost and snow     without clothes or blankets however although they seem to have little feeling for the naked and distressed soldiers i feel superabundantly for them and from my soul i pity those miseries which it is neither in my power to relieve or prevent  it is for these reasons therefore that i have dwelt upon the subject and it adds not a little to my other difficulties and distress to find that much more is expected of me than is possible to be performed and that upon the ground of safety and policy i am obliged to conceal the true state of the army from public view and thereby expose myself to detraction and calumny the honorable committee of congress went from camp fully possessed of my sentiments respecting the establishment of this army the necessity of auditors of accounts the appointment of officers and new arrangements i have no need therefore to be prolix upon these subjects but i refer to the committee i shall add a word or two to show first the necessity of some better provision for binding the officers by the tie of interest to the service as no day nor scarce an hour passes without the offer of a resigned commission  otherwise i     much doubt the practicability of holding the army together much longer and in this i shall probably be thought the more sincere when i freely declare that i do not myself expect to derive the smallest benefit from any establishment that congress may adopt otherwise than as a member of the community at large in the good which i am persuaded will result from the measure by making better officers and better troops and secondly to point out the necessity of making the appointments and arrangements without loss of time we have not more than three months in which to prepare a great deal of business if we let these slip or waste we shall be laboring under the same difficulties all next campaign as we have been this to rectify mistakes and bring things to order military arrangement and movements in consequence like the mechanism of a clock will be imperfect and disordered by the want of a part in a very sensible degree have i experienced this in the course of the last summer several brigades having no brigadiers appointed to them till late and some not at all by which means it follows that an additional weight     is thrown upon the shoulders of the commanderinchief to withdraw his attention from the great line of his duty the gentlemen of the committee when they were at camp talked of an expedient for adjusting these matters which i highly approved and wish to see adopted namely that two or three members of the board of war or a committee of congress should repair immediately to camp where the best aid can be had and with the commanding officer or a committee of his appointment prepare and digest the most perfect plan that can be devised for correcting all abuses and making new arrangements considering what is to be done with the weak and debilitated regiments if the states to which they belong will not draft men to fill them for as to enlisting soldiers it seems to me to be totally out of the question together with many other things that would occur in the course of such a conference and after digesting matters in the best manner they can to submit the whole to the ultimate determination of congress if this measure is approved i would earnestly advise the immediate execution of it and that the commissarygeneral of purchases whom i rarely see may be directed to form magazines without a moments delay in the neighbourhood of this camp in order to secure provision for us in case of bad weather the quartermastergeneral ought also to be busy in his department in short there is as much to be done in preparing for a campaign as in the active part of it every thing depends upon the     preparation that is made in the several departments and the success or misfortunes of the next campaign will more than probably originate with our activity or supineness during this winter i have the honor to be c george washington    december      valley forge to the executives of the eastern states headquarters valley forge    december      sir i take the liberty of transmitting to you the enclosed return which contains a statement of such of the connecticut  regiments as are in the army immediately under my command by this you will discover how deficient how exceedingly short they are of the complement of men which of right according to the establishment they ought to have this information i have thought it my duty to lay before you that it may have that attention which its importance demands and in full hope that the most early and vigorous measures will be adopted not only to make the regiments more respectable but complete the expediency and necessity of this procedure are too obvious to need arguments should we have a respectable force to commence an early campaign with before the enemy are reinforced i trust we shall have an opportunity of striking a favorable and an happy stroke but if we should be obliged to defer it it will not be easy to describe with any degree of precision what disagreeable consequences     may result from it we may rest assured that britain will strain every nerve to send from home and abroad as early as possible all the troops it shall be in her power to raise or procure her views and schemes for subjugating these states and bringing them under her despotic rule will be unceasing and unremitted nor should we in my opinion turn our expectations to or have the least dependence on the intervention of a foreign war our wishes on this have been disappointed hitherto and perhaps it may long be the case however be this as it may our reliance should be wholly on our own strength and exertions if in addition to these there should be aid derived from a war between the enemy and any of the european powers our situation will be so much the better if not our efforts and exertions will have been the more necessary and indispensable for my own part i should be happy if the idea of a foreign rupture should be thrown entirely out of the scale of politics and that it may have not the least weight in our public measures no bad effects could flow from it but on the contrary many of a salutary nature at the same time i do not mean that such an idea ought to be dicsouraged among the people at large your ready exertions to relieve the distress of your troops for clothing have given me the highest satisfaction at the same time knowing how exceedingly the service has been injured how that every measure will be pursued that circumstances will admit to keep them supplied from time to time no pains no efforts can be too great for this purpose the articles of     shoes stockings and blankets demand the most particular attention as the expenditure of them from the operations and common accidents of war we find to be greater than of any other articles i assure you sir it is not easy to give you a just and accurate idea of the sufferings of the troops at large were they to be minutely detailed the relation—so unexpected so contrary to the common opinion of people distant from the army—would scarcely be thought credible i fear i shall wound your feelings by telling you that by a fieldreturn on the   d instant we had in camp not less than      men unfit for duty by reason of their being barefoot and otherwise naked besides these there are many others detained at the hospitals and in farmers houses for the same causes i will no longer dwell upon the melancholy subject being firmly convinced that your views and most studious care will be employed to render the situation of the troops both officers and privates comfortable in future if the several states direct their attention to this indispensably essential object as i trust they will i have the most sanguine hopes that their supplies with those immediately imported by congress themselves will be equal to every demand the return transmitted comprehends only such troops of your state as are at this camp i imagine all the regiments stand nearly upon the same footing in point of deficiency and from it you will be able to form a pretty just estimate of the men that will be necessary to fill the whole     before i conclude i would also add that it will be essential to inoculate the recruits or levies as fast as they are raised that their earliest services may be had should this be postponed the work will be to do most probably at an interesting and critical period and when their aid may be materially wanted i have the honor to be with great respect sir p s—we have taken post here for the winter as a place best calculated to restrain the ravages of the enemy and busily employed in erecting huts george washington  0 december      majorgeneral conway to majorgeneral conway  headquarters  0 december      sir i am favored with your letter of yesterday in which you propose in order to lose no time to begin with the instruction of the troops you will     observe by the resolution of congress relative to your appointment that the board of war is to furnish a set of instructions according to which the troops are to be manœuvred as you have made no mention of having received them i suppose they are not come to you when they do i shall issue any orders which may be judged necessary to have them carried into immediate execution your appointment of inspectorgeneral to the army i believe has not given the least uneasiness to any officer in it by consulting your own feelings upon the appointment of the baron de kalb you may judge what must be the sensation of those brigadiers who by your promotion are superseded  i am told they are determined to remonstrate against it for my own part i have nothing to do in the appointment of general officers and shall always afford every countenance and due respect to those appointed by congress taking it for granted that prior to any resolve of that nature they take a dispassionate view of the merits of the officer to be promoted and consider every consequence that can result from such a procedure nor have i any other wish on that head but that good attentive officers may be chosen and no extraordinary promotion take place but where the merit of the officer is so generally acknowledged   0 as to obviate every reasonable cause for dissatisfaction thereat  i am sir c george washington    december      valley forge governor livingston to governor livingston valley forge    december      sir it being of great importance to prevent the enemy from supplies of forage and provisions i must take the liberty of requesting the interposition of your interest and authority for this purpose and that the most speedy and suitable measures may be adopted and pursued either by your direction or that of the legislature or council for the removal of all that lies within the vicinity of the jersey shore opposite to     philadelphia or that may be within the reach of the enemys foraging parties excepting such as may be really essential for the inhabitants use they should be removed so far back from the water that they will not be in danger of falling into the enemys hands the expediency and necessity of the procedure i am satisfied will appear at once to you and i have no doubt as far as it may be in your power it will be carried into execution it is not unlikely but that some of the owners especially if there are any tainted with toryism will be somewhat averse to the measure as it has happened in similar cases however i trust means will be found to do away their prejudices and to convince them of the propriety of it indeed if they will reason from their own experience and that of their neighbors on this side delaware they cannot but assent to it but be this as it may it is a matter so important that it ought not to be dispensed with the present opportunity while the weather is severe and a considerable quantity of ice in the river is favorable for the removal as the enemy will not be able to give any interruption i am not without power and directions from congress to act myself in such instances but i would wish the business to be done by civil authority as their acts will create less jealousy and disgust and be viewed in a much more unexceptionable light in a few days all our lighthorse except a few that will remain to do duty will be sent to trenton to winter and recruit it being a place under all circumstances the best adapted to that end besides     recruiting they will serve to protect the country from incursions by small parties of the enemy and will give security to our stores and magazines in addition to these when we have secured and fortified our camp if circumstances will possibly admit i will send a few more troops i cannot promise that they will be many the army being now much reduced by the expiration of the service of several regiments and from other causes equally distressing    i sincerely feel for the unhappy condition of our poor fellows in the hospitals and wish my powers to relieve them were equal to my inclination it is but too melancholy a truth that our hospital stores are exceedingly scanty and deficient in every instance and i fear there is no prospect of their shortly being better our difficulties and distresses are certainly great and such as wound the feelings of humanity our sick naked and well naked our unfortunate men in captivity naked you were certainly right in representing the state of the sick that they may be made more happy if possible i have ordered a fieldofficer to be always in future at the hospitals and hope that he will contribute all in his power to accommodate them and prevent some of the inconveniences which you mention and which are of great moment as to the directors if they do not afford every aid in their power their conduct is highly culpable and deserves the severest reprehension i assure you sir i shall ever consider myself much obliged by your information of any grievances or abuses respecting the army and shall never suppose     that you step out of your proper line in giving it we are all equally engaged in the present important struggle and in the cause of humanity and are equally concerned in promoting them i have the honor to be c      george washington   january      valley forge to the president of congress headquarters valley forge   january      sir i have been duly honored with your several favors of the   d   th and   th ult with the inclosures to which they allude in my letters of the   d and   d of last month i mentioned the difficulties which the service labored under for want of a quarter master general and as i am induced to believe that a new nomination has not been made since gen mifflins resignation because congress could not fix upon any person in their opinions fully qualified to fill that important office i thought it my duty to endeavor to find out a gentleman who i could venture to recommend either from my own particular knowledge or from that of others that my inquiries might be more extensive i occasionally mentioned the matter to the general and field officers and desired them if any person came within their idea as proper that they might mention them to me that i might upon their comparative merits fix upon the most deserving several of the officers from the northward spoke of the activity and uncommon exertions of col hay deputy quarter master general in that department     hearing him so well spoken of i enquired very particularly of most of those who had served there in the last campaign and of generals sullivan and wayne who had served in that country the two preceding ones in times of uncommon difficulty they confirmed the favorable report of the others and went so far as to say that without disparagement to any gentlemen they thought him the best qualified of any man upon the continent for the office in question upon this universal concurrence of all parties i think i may venture to recommend col hay to the consideration of congress and if upon further inquiry they should find him answer the high character which he bears i hope no time will be lost in appointing him provided some other has not already been the object of their choice i will first add that col hays pretensions in right of seniority entitle him to notice you must be fully sensible that very little time is left between this and the opening of the next campaign for the provision of field equipage carriages horses and many other articles essentially necessary towards which i cannot find that any steps have been taken in my last i also took occasion to mention that by col pickerings appointment to the board of war i expected he would soon be called upon to take his seat in a letter from the secretary of   th ult i am desired to permit him to retire and to nominate an adjutant general pro tempore but as there is no person upon the spot that i can with propriety ask to accept of the place pro tem i am obliged to detain him and am under the necessity for that reason of     urging a new appointment as speedily as possible i have taken the same methods of endeavoring to find out a person qualified for an adjutant general that i did for that of quarter master general but i cannot say that i have received any account sufficiently satisfactory to determine me in favor of any particular person i will just recite the names that have been mentioned to me which are cols lee and scammel of massachusetts and new hampshire cols james and davies of virginia and maj scott of pennsylvania the four first are known to many gentlemen of congress and major scott is warmly recommended by general st clair the enemy returned into philadelphia on sunday last having made a considerable hay forage which appeared to be their only intention as they kept themselves in close order and in just such a position that no attack could be made upon them to advantage i could do no more than extend light parties along their front and keep them from plundering the inhabitants and carrying off cattle and horses which had the desired effect i have the pleasure to inform you that a vessel has fallen into gen smallwoods hands near wilmington i hope she will prove a valuable prize you have the particulars in the inclosed extract of his letter      before this reaches you you will have received a letter from gen weedon in which he has stated his objections to gen woodfords taking rank of him gen muhlenberg is gone to virginia and i therefore cannot say what would have been his objections but i imagine they are founded upon the same reasons as those of gen weedon and you may perceive by the inclosed copy of general waynes letter to me that he does not think that the rank of colonel which gen woodford held at the time of his resignation could operate in his favor upon his appointment to the rank of brigadier general i could therefore wish that congress as they now have the matter fully before them would proceed to the final settlement of the relative rank of the brigadiers i have received information that the militia of jersey have taken possession of another of the enemys vessels that ran on ground upon their shore i have reason to believe the fact is so but i have it not from full authority george washington   january      valley forge to the president of congress valley forge   january      sir i take the liberty of transmitting to you the enclosed copies of a letter from me to general conway since his return from new york to camp and of two letters from him to me which you will be pleased to lay before congress i shall not in this letter animadvert upon them but after making a single observation submit the whole to congress     if general conway means by cool receptions mentioned in the last paragraph of his letter of the   st ultimo that i did not receive him in the language of a warm and cordial friend i readily confess the charge i did not nor shall i ever till i am capable of the arts of dissimulation these i despise and my feelings will not permit me to make professions of friendship to the man i deem my enemy and whose system of conduct forbids it at the same time truth authorizes me to say that he was received and treated with proper respect to his official character and that he has had no cause to justify the assertion that he could not expect any support for fulfilling the duties of his appointment i have the honor to be c p s the enclosed extract from the proceedings of a council of general officers will show the office of inspectorgeneral was a matter not of such modern date as general conway mentions it to be and that it was one of the regulations in view for the reform of the army  the foreign officers who had commissions and no commands and who were of ability were intended to be recommended to execute it particularly the baron darendt with whom the idea originated and whose capacity seemed to be well admitted      george washington   january      valley forge major general gates to major general gates valley forge   january      sir your letter of the  th ulto came to my hands a few days ago and to my great surprize informed me that a copy of it had been sent to congress—for what reason i find myself unable to acct but as some end doubtless was intended to be answered by it i am laid under the disagreeable necessity of returning my answer through the same channel lest any member of that honble body should harbor an unfavorable suspicion of my having practiced some indirect means to come at the contents of the confidential letters between you and general conway  i am to inform you then that colo wilkinson in his way to congress in the month of octobr last fell in with lord stirling at reading and not in confidence that i ever understood informed his aid de camp majr mcwilliams that general conway had     written thus to you heaven had been determined to save your country or a weak general and bad counsellors  would have ruined it lord stirling from motives of friendship transmitted the acct with this remark the inclosed was communicated by colonl wilkinson to majr mcwilliams such wicked duplicity of conduct i shall always think it my duty to detect in consequence of this information and without having any thing more in view than merely to shew that gentl that i was not unapprized of his intriguing disposition i wrote him a letter in these words sir—a letter which i received last night contained the following paragraph—in a letter from genl conway to genl gates he says—heaven has been determined to save your country or a weak general and bad counsellors would have ruined it i am sir c neither this letter nor the information which occasioned it was ever directly or indirectly communicated by me to a single officer in this army out of my own family excepting the marquis de la fayette who having been spoken to on the subject by genl conway applied for and saw under injunctions of secresy the letter which contained wilkinsons information—so desirous was i of concealing every matter that could in its consequences give the smallest interruption to the tranquility of this army or afford a gleam of hope to the enemy by dissentions therein thus sir with an openness and candor which i hope will ever characterize and mark my conduct   0 have i complied with your request the only concern i feel upon the occasion—finding how matters stand—is that in doing this i have necessarily been obliged to name a genln whom i am persuaded although i never exchanged a word with him upon the subject thought he was rather doing an act of justice than committing an act of infidelity—and sure i am that till lord stirlings letter came to my hands i never knew that general conway who i viewed in the light of a stranger to you was a correspondant of yours much less did i suspect that i was the subject of your confidential letters— pardon me then for adding that so far from conceiving that the safety of the states can be affected or in the smallest degree injured by a discovery of this kind or that i should be called upon in such solemn terms to point out the author that i considered the information as coming from yourself and given with a friendly view to forewarn and consequently forearm me against a secret enemy or in other words a dangerous incendiary in which character sooner or later this country will know genl conway—but in this as in other matters of late i have found myself mistaken—i am c george washington   january      valley forge to the president of congress valley forge   january      sir i yesterday evening had the honor of your favor of the  st instant with its several enclosures the letter     you allude to from the committee of congress and board of war came to hand on saturday morning but it does not mention the regulations adopted for removing the difficulties and failures in the commissary line i trust they will be vigorous or the army cannot exist it will never answer to procure supplies of clothing or provision by coercive measures the small seizures made of the former a few days ago in consequence of the most pressing and absolute necessity when that or to dissolve was the alternative excited the greatest alarm and uneasiness even among our best and warmest friends such procedures may give a momentary relief but if repeated will prove of the most pernicious consequence besides spreading disaffection jealousy and fear in the people they never fail even in the most veteran troops under the most rigid and exact discipline to raise in the soldiery a disposition to licentiousness to plunder and robbery difficult to suppress afterwards and which has proved not only ruinous to the inhabitants but in many instances to armies themselves i regret the occasion that compelled us to the measure the other day and shall consider it among the greatest of our misfortunes if we should be under the necessity of practising it again i had received from the board of war a copy of the resolutions of the   th ultimo and published such parts in orders as were directed i shall endeavor as far as possible to carry the intention of congress into execution respecting the extra pay and to prevent any from receiving it who do not come under     their description  the three packets with commissions came safe to hand i have the honor to be c p s i am now under the necessity of keeping several parties from the army threshing grain that our supplies may not fail—but this will not do as to meat our stock is trifling not being sufficient for more than two days if so long with the most sparing economy  george washington   january      valley forge to the president of congress valley forge   january      sir i yesterday evening had the honor to receive your favor of the  th inst with its enclosures the power congress have been pleased to vest me with for appointing aidsdecamp i shall use with economy and i will not appoint more at any time than shall be necessary and essential to advance the public interest any future appointments that may be material will be made out of the line of the army if circumstances will allow it in general this has been the case  the proceedings of congress for the     detention of general burgoyne and army or rather suspending their embarkation till the convention of saratoga is explicitly ratified and notified by the court of britain shall remain secret here till they are duly announced by congress this procedure when known to the general will chagrin him much for i learn by a letter from general heath that the refusal to let his troops embark at rhode island or in the sound had given him some uneasiness i have nothing of importance to communicate and have only to add that i have the honor to be with great respect c      p s the great diversity of opinions prevailing as to the operations which the resolves of the  0th ultimo    inst should have which give a months extra pay makes it necessary for me to request congress to describe with certainty and precision the persons whom they intended should be the particular objects of their benevolence without this i am certain i shall not be able to execute the resolves according to their intention and in a manner that will be agreable to the army if such officers and men as were in camp when the resolves were passed and who continue the whole winter are the only objects to be benefitted it is urged that many who have discharged their duty with fidelity—who have experienced a severe campaign to that time or till a few days before—who may be now out of camp and yet be here in the course of the winter will be excluded for example all officers and men on furlough tho they should have been long from their home before perhaps much longer in many instances than many who remain whose private and family necessities oblige them to be absent—those who have fallen sick from their services  who are in hospitals or the country—detachments on command these would be excluded such discriminations i believe will give great disgust and uneasiness it is difficult in cases     of this nature to draw a proper line of distinction and impossible to do it in such a way as to give satisfaction i do not mean to enlarge upon the subject my only wish is to have it precisely ascertained who are to be included  paid and who are not under the resolves that i may not on the one hand act contrary to public intention—and on the other give cause of complaint and perhaps do wrong to individuals knowing the difficulty of drawing a proper line and the disgust and murmurings that ever attend discriminations were i to advise upon the subject only such officers and men should be excluded since extra pay has been determined on as are absent from camp without regular authority or such as may abuse indulgencies regularly obtained it has been observed by some and perhaps with propriety that there are officers  men now in camp who may be shortly in who have no superior claim to merit—whose affairs are not pressing or who have already had indulgencies—or who from their being nearer their friends  connections have had opportunities of seeing them frequently—of ordering their concerns and visiting their homes once twice or perhaps oftener in the campaign whilst they who are more remote were precluded from any of these advantages  were constantly on duty these considerations will have their weight in the scale of disgust with the parties interested for my part tho the resolves were founded in principles of generosity—were intended to reward merit and promote the service from the difficulties     attending the execution i wish they had never been made especially as i believe officers and men would in a little time have become tolerably well reconciled to their quarters i have c      george washington    january      valley forge governor wharton to governor wharton headquarters valley forge    january      sir i have the pleasure of observing by a publication in dunlaps paper that before the adjournment of the general assembly of this state they had among other wholesome laws enacted one for filling the quota of troops to be raised in this state as you may perhaps be ignorant of the reduced condition of your regiments i have thought proper to inclose you a return by which you will see how very deficient they are at present as to the number required by the allotment you will also perceive by a note at the bottom of the return how destitute the men in the field are in point of cloathing i had sent out officers from every regiment to procure cloathing for their men and they were collecting considerable quantities when colo bayard and mr young a committee from assembly waited upon me and desired me to call in the officers informing me that they had appointed commissioners in every county to purchase necessaries for the army which would be a mode more agreeable to the inhabitants than if done in a military way what these commissioners have done i do not know but no cloathing has yet come to the army thro their hands general wayne informed me that he understood it was collected and stored at lancaster and he went up about ten days ago to enquire into the matter it being recommended to every state to procure what cloathing they can for their own troops i trust     yours will not be backward from the quantity of raw materials and the number of workmen among your people who being principled against arms remain at home and manufacture i should suppose you have it more in your power to cover your troops well than any other state the continent will continue to import from abroad and to purchase on the general account what they can i am therefore in hopes that the exertions of the states aided by foreign importations will contribute to cloath our troops more comfortably and plentifully than they have heretofore been but as there are so many impediments in the way of the latter kind of supply i could wish that no great dependance may be put upon it but that we may rely principally upon our internal manufacture  i shall be glad to be favd with a copy of the law for raising your quota of men and have the honor to be with great respect sir c      george washington  0 january      valley forge majorgeneral arnold to majorgeneral arnold  headquarters valley forge  0 january      dear sir enclosed you will receive a commission by which you will find that you are restored to the rank you claim in the line of the army this i transmit by direction of congress and in pursuance of their resolution of the   th of november  the situation of my papers and the want of blank commissions prevented me doing it before may i venture to ask whether you are upon your legs again and if you are not may i flatter myself that you will be soon there is none who wishes more sincerely for this event than i do or who will receive the information with more pleasure i shall expect a favorable account upon the subject and as soon as your situation will permit   0 i request that you will repair to this army it being my earnest wish to have your services the ensuing campaign in hopes of this i have set you down in an arrangement now under consideration and for a command which i trust will be agreeable to yourself and of great advantage to the public i have nothing of importance to inform you of in the military line that is new or interesting the enemy still remain in possession of philadelphia and have secured themselves by a strong chain of redoubts with intrenchments of communication from the schuylkill to the delaware we on our part have taken a post on the west side of the former about twenty miles from the city and with much pains and industry have got the troops tolerably well covered in huts we have to regret that we are not in more comfortable quarters but these could not be found unless we had retired to the towns in the more interior part of the state the consequence of which would have been distress to the virtuous citizens of philadelphia who had fled thither for protection and the exposure of a considerable tract of fertile country to ravage and ruin i am dear sir with great esteem and regard c george washington  0 january      sir william howe to sir william howe headquarters  0 january      sir your letter of the  th instant enclosing lieutenant eyres  representation was duly received i am not at liberty to contradict the facts which he has related     but i am inclined to think from his own state that his conduct has not been so discreet as it should have been and that if he experienced a severer treatment than had been usually imposed upon officers prisoners with us it proceeded in some measure at least from that cause but were not this the case if the insults and incivilities which mr eyre complains of having suffered were ever so unprovoked by him though i wish not to justify them yet i cannot forbear observing that they are not to be wondered at since the accounts generally received of the treatment of our officers in your hands are replete with instances of the most flagrant indignities and even cruelties americans have the feelings of sympathy as well as other men a series of injuries may exhaust their patience and it is natural that the sufferings of their friends in captivity should at length irritate them into resentment and to acts of retaliation if you suppose mr eyres representation to be just and that he escaped from a rigorous confinement under no obligation of parole i cannot conceive upon what principle you still consider him my prisoner but if you are of a different opinion i shall expect some gentleman of ours in your possession who was taken in a similar character in return for him he was reported to me at the time of his capture as a volunteer in which light i still view him the officer you mention did not attend the flag of truce with my knowledge or consent his conduct was reprehensible and i hope an instance of this sort will not happen again mr james bayard was taken prisoner near the swedes ford the day your army crossed the schuylkill     he had just returned from college and had no rank in or connexion with the army he is not to be considered as a prisoner of war but as a citizen and as such his friends will propose an exchange for him i am sir c  george washington    january      valley forge majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath head quarters valley forge    january      dear sir i have your favor of the  th and  th instants i particularly alluded to henleys lees and jacksons regiments when i expressed my surprise that they had not been inoculated as they had been so long in boston i hope that a very strict attention will be paid to that matter against the next campaign we find upon a scrutiny that there are upwards of two thousand men to be inoculated in camp at this time i have given the adjutant general the resolve of your council but he tells me that he does not think it will be in the powers of the colonels to make such a return as is called for few of them have their papers with them and some of these who were at ticonderoga lost them in my next i shall be able to inform you whether it can be done some little time past i sent the president of the council an exact     return of such of their troops as are under my immediate command for their government in compleating their levies you will i suppose before this time have received orders from congress respecting the delaying the embarkation of general burgoyne and his army till the convention is ratified by great britain by this step general burgoyne will more than probable look upon himself as released from all former ties and consequently at liberty to make use of any means to effect an escape i would therefore have you increase the vigilance and if necessary the strength of your guards all magazines of arms should be removed from boston and the neighborhood for if any attempt is made it must be by first seizing upon arms to force their way i cannot think with you that the operations of the next campaign will be against new england except the enemy are much more strongly reinforced than i think they have any chance of being they know the unanimity and spirit of the people too well to attempt it by detachment and should they send a considerable body from philadelphia they must either remain besieged in the town which would be ignominious or risk a defeat should they come into the field with inconsiderable numbers the troops who went back from philadelphia to new york were i believe only intended for the security of that city the garrison was so small after the reinforcements had been sent to general howe that the inhabitants complained much of their being abandoned and the     troops were returned to quiet them this being merely matter of opinion it should not relax your endeavors to perfect the necessary defences of the harbor and to fix upon signals which may at all times alarm the country upon any sudden invasion if any good sealing wax is to be procured in boston be pleased to direct a dozen pound to be purchased for me and sent on at different times as opportunity offer i am c george washington    january      valley forge majorgeneral putnam to majorgeneral putnam valley forge    january      dear sir i begin to be very apprehensive that the season will entirely pass away before any thing material will be done for the defence of hudsons river you are well acquainted with the great necessity there is for having the works there finished as soon as possible and i most earnestly desire that the strictest attention may be paid to every matter which may contribute to finishing and putting them in a respectable state before the spring      i wish you had not waited for returns of the militia to furnish me with a state of the troops in that quarter and if you do not get them in before you receive this you will please to let me have an accurate return of the continental troops alone it being absolutely necessary that i should know the strength of your command as soon as possible i congratulate you on the success of your two little parties against the enemy which i dare say will prevent their making so extensive excursions for some time at least one circumstance however i cannot avoid taking notice of that our officers who have been but a very short     time in the enemys hands reap the advantages of any captures which happen to be made by us this must not be practised in future as it is the height of injustice and will if continued draw upon us the censures of the officers who have been for a long time suffering all the rigors of a severe captivity the proper mode of proceeding is to deliver them into the hands of the commissary of prisoners who must be best acquainted with the propriety of complying with the claims of our officers in their hands i shall represent your situation in the money way to the paymastergeneral and order such measures to be taken as may relieve you i am sir c george washington    january      valley forge majorgeneral gates to majorgeneral gates valley forge    january      sir your two letters of the   th instant came to hand before the receipt of the first i had written to you upon the subject contained in it in consequence of your letter to the commanding officer at lancaster which had been transmitted to me as that will inform you fully respecting the british officers and clothing i will not trouble you with a repetition of the matter  i must observe however that the number     of officers and men who came out does not appear to me so very extraordinary considering the various duties they have to perform and the amount of wagons and necessaries they have in charge the officers are under parole and the party unarmed nor will the state of this army admit large escorts to be detached and if it were much more respectable i should apprehend two officers sufficient to attend the flag i should have been happy if the officers and clothing had not been seized as it destroys that confidence which should ever be had in passports and involves the consequences of a delicate nature in answer to the last clause of your letter respecting the detention of the clothing i refer you to my letter of yesterday by which you will perceive that there is a particular agreement between general howe and myself under the sanction of which they came out i am much obliged by your polite request of my opinion and advice on the expedition to canada and     other occasions in the present instance as i neither know the extent of the objects in view nor the means to be employed to effect them it is not in my power to pass any judgment upon the subject i can only sincerely wish that success may attend it both as it may advance the public good and on account of the personal honor of the marquis de lafayette for whom i have a very particular esteem and regard your letter was delivered to him in a little time after it came to my hands and he proposes to set out for yorktown tomorrow  agreeably to your request i shall order hazens regiment to march from wilmington to this place from whence it will immediately proceed towards albany as some particular purpose seems to be intended by desiring this regiment i am induced to part with it notwithstanding our force will ill bear the smallest diminution i am sir your most obedient servant     george washington    january      valley forge charles lee to majorgeneral charles lee valley forge    january      dear sir i last night received your favor of the  0th ultimo  it gave me great pleasure to hear that you were released from your confined situation and permitted so many indulgences you may rest assured that i feel myself very much interested in your welfare and that every exertion has been used on my part to effect your exchange this i have not been able to accomplish however from the letters which have lately passed between sir william howe and myself upon the subject of prisoners i am authorized to expect that you will return in a few days to your friends on parole as majorgeneral prescott will be sent in on the same terms for that purpose indeed till i saw major williams last night i supposed that he had arrived either at new york or rhode island having directed his releasement as soon as i was at liberty to do it i will take the earliest opportunity to  00 recommend to your friends mr nourse and mr white the care of your farm your request to major morris in favor of mrs battier reached me only last night i wish i had been informed of it sooner i have enclosed a passport for her to major morris and i doubt not but he will do every thing in his power to accommodate a lady from whose husband you have received so many civilities i am dear sir with great esteem and regard c george washington    january      to a committee of congress     january      gentlemen the numerous defects in our present military establishment rendering many reformations and many new arrangements absolutely necessary and congress having been pleased to appoint you a committee in concert with me to make and recommend such as shall appear eligible in pursuance of the various objects expressed in their resolution for that purpose  0  i have in the following sheets briefly delivered my sentiments upon such of them as seemed to me most essential—so far as observation has suggested and leisure permitted these are submitted to consideration and i shall be happy if they are found conducive to remedying the evils and inconveniences we are now subject to and putting the army upon a more respectable footing something must be done—important alterations must be made—necessity requires that our resources should be enlarged and our system improved for without it if the dissolution of the army should not be the consequence at least its operations must infallibly be feeble languid and ineffectual as i consider a proper and satisfactory provision for officers in a manner as the basis of every other regulation and arrangement necessary to be made since without officers no army can exist and unless some measures be devised to place those of ours in a more desirable situation few of them would be able if willing to continue in it i shall begin with a few reflections tending to prove the necessity— of a half pay and pensionary establishment a small knowledge of human nature will convince us that with far the greatest part of mankind interest is the governing principle and that almost every man is more or less under its influence motives of public virtue may for a time or in particular instances actuate men to the observance of a conduct purely disinterested but they are not of themselves sufficient to produce a persevering conformity to the refined  0  dictates and obligations of social duty few men are capable of making a continual sacrifice of all views of private interest or advantage to the common good it is in vain to exclaim against the depravity of human nature on this account—the fact is so the experience of every age and nation has proved it and we must in a great measure change the constitution of man before we can make it otherwise no institution not built on the presumptive truth of these maxims can succeed we find them exemplified in the american officers as well as in all other men at the commencement of the dispute in the first effusions of their zeal and looking upon the service to be only temporary they entered into it without paying any regard to pecuniary or selfish considerations but finding its duration to be much longer than they at first suspected and that instead of deriving any advantage from the hardships and dangers to which they were exposed they on the contrary were losers by their patriotism and fell far short even of a competency to supply their wants they have gradually abated in their ardor and with many an entire disinclination to the service under its present circumstances has taken place to this in an eminent degree must be ascribed the frequent resignations dayly happening and the more frequent importunities for permission to resign and from some officers of the greatest merit to this also may we ascribe the apathy inattention and neglect of duty which pervade all ranks and which will necessarily continue and increase while an officer instead of gaining anything is impoverished by his commission and  0  conceives he is conferring not receiving a favor in holding it there can be no sufficient tie upon men possessing such sentiments nor can any method be adopted to oblige those to a punctual discharge of duty who are indifferent about their continuance in the service and are often seeking a pretext to disengage themselves from it punishment in this case will be unavailing but when an officers commission is made valuable to him and he fears to lose it you may then exact obedience from him it is not indeed consistent with reason or justice to expect that one set of men should make a sacrifice of property domestic ease and happiness—encounter the rigors of the field—the perils and vicissitudes of war to obtain those blessings which every citizen will enjoy in common with them without some adequate compensation it must also be a comfortless reflection to any man that after he may have contributed to securing the rights of his country at the risk of his life and the ruin of his fortune there would be no provision made to prevent himself and family from sinking into indigence and wretchedness besides adopting some methods to make the provision for officers equal to their present exigencies a due regard should be paid to futurity nothing in my opinion would serve more powerfully to reanimate their languishing zeal and interest them thoroughly in the service than a halfpay and pensionary establishment this would not only dispel the apprehension of personal distress at the termination of the war from having thrown themselves out of professions and employments they might not have it in  0  their power to resume but would in a great degree relieve the painful anticipation of leaving their widows and orphans a burthen on the charity of their country should it be their lot to fall in its defence i am earnest in recommending this measure because i know it is the general wish and expectation and that many officers whom upon every principle we should wish to retain in the service are only waiting to see whether something of the kind will or will not take place to be determined in their resolutions either of staying in or quitting it immediately and i urge my sentiments with the greater freedom because i cannot and shall not receive the smallest benefit from the establishment and can have no other inducement for proposing it than a full conviction of its utility and propriety i am sensible the expense will be a capital objection to it but to this i oppose the necessity—the officers are now discontented with their situation—if some generous expedient is not embraced to remove their discontent so extensive a desertion of the service will ensue and so much discouragement be cast upon those who remain as must wound it in a very essential manner every thing that has this effect has a tendency at least to protract the war and though dictated by a wellintended frugality will i fear in the end prove erroneous economy of completing the regiments and altering their establishment the necessity of the first in the most expeditious manner possible is too self evident to need illustration  0  or proof and i shall therefore only beg leave to offer some reflections on the mode voluntary inlistments seem to be totally out of the question all the allurements of the most exorbitant bounties and every other inducement that could be thought of have been tried in vain and seem to have had little other effect than to increase the rapacity and raise the demands of those to whom they were held out we may fairly infer that the country has been already pretty well drained of that class of men whose tempers attachments and circumstances disposed them to enter permanently or for a length of time into the army and that the residue of such men who from different motives have kept out of the army if collected would not augment our general strength in any proportion to what we require if experience has demonstrated that little more can be done by voluntary inlistments some other mode must be concerted and no other presents itself than that of filling the regiments by drafts from the militia this is a disagreeable alternative but it is an unavoidable one as drafting for the war or for a term of years would probably be disgusting and dangerous perhaps impracticable i would propose an annual draft of men without officers to serve till the first day of january in each year that on or before the first day of october preceding these drafted men should be called upon to reinlist for the succeeding year and as an incitement to doing it those being much better and less expensive than raw recruits a bounty of twenty five dollars should be offered that upon ascertaining at this period the number of men willing  0  to reengage exact returns should be made to congress of the deficiency in each regiment and transmitted by them to the respective states in order that they may have their several quotas immediately furnished and sent on to camp for the service of the ensuing year so as to arrive by or before the first day of january this method though not so good as that of obtaining men for the war is perhaps the best our circumstances will allow and as we shall always have an established corps of experienced officers may answer tolerably well it is the only mode i can think of for completing our battalions in time that promises the least prospect of success the accomplishment of which is an object of the last importance and it has this advantage that the minds of the people being once reconciled to the experiment it would prove a source of continual supplies hereafter men drafted in this manner should not in the first instance receive any bounty from the public which being solemnly enjoined upon each state and a stop put to the militia substitution laws would probably be attended with very happy consequences a number of idle mercenary fellows would be thrown out of employment precluded from their excessive wages as substitutes for a few weeks or months and constrained to inlist in the continental army in speaking of abolishing the militia substitution laws it is not meant to hinder a person who might be drafted in the annual allotments from procuring a substitute in his stead himself in consequence being excused  0  this indulgence would be admissible and considering all things necessary as there are many individuals whose dispositions and private affairs would make them irreconcileably averse to giving their personal services for so long a duration and with whom it would be impolitic to use compulsion the allowance of substitution upon a smaller scale—in the occasional coming out of the militia for a few weeks a month or two is the thing meant to be reprobated—it is highly productive of the double disadvantage of preventing the growth of the army and depreciating our currency in the new establishment of a regiment as apparent inconveniences result from the enemys having no full colonels in their army distinctly such to exchange for ours in case of captivity—i would propose that our batalions should be commanded by lieutenantcolonels commandant with the pay of colonel and consist of the following officers and men one lieutenantcolonel commandant—one lieutenant colonel a major nine captains nine lieutenants nine ensigns an adjutant quarter master paymaster sergeant drum and fife major twenty seven sergeants    drums and fifes and five hundred and four rank and file that these should be divided into eight companies that a captain lieutenant ensign three sergeants two drums and fifes and fifty six rank and file should be selected from the whole to compose a company of lightinfantry that the infantry from each brigade be commanded by a field officer belonging to it—if officers by the reduction of corps and  0  otherwise unprovided for are not appointed to these commands a mode preferable to that of drafting from the brigades as a mean of doing those officers justice and because the brigades would miss the field officers drawn from them for this purpose and that the whole be commanded by general officers from the line chosen by the commander in chief this body would compose the flying army and in conjunction with a body of horse would become extremely formidable and useful the benefits arising from a superiority in horse are obvious to those who have experienced them independent of such as you may derive from it in the field of action it enables you very materially to controul the inferior and subordinate motions of an enemy and to impede their knowledge of what you are doing while it gives you every advantage of superior intelligence and consequently both facilitates your enterprises against them and obstructs theirs against you in a defensive war as in our case it is peculiarly desireable because it affords great protection to the country and is a barrier to those inroads and depredations upon the inhabitants which are inevitable when the superiority lies on the side of the invaders the enemy fully sensible of the advantages are taking all the pains in their power to acquire an ascendency in this respect to defeat which i would propose an augmentation of our cavalry by adding a lieutenant sergeant corporal and twentytwo privates to each troop the establishment will then be as follows—  0    colonel  all as usual except   additional lieutenants   lt colonel    major    captains     lieutenants    cornets    adjutant    qr master    sadler    farriers    qr masters sergeants     sergeants   0 corporals    trumpeters      privates  there are and will continue four regiments of cavalry which composing a brigade will require a brigadier—brigade major—quarter master commissary and foragemaster as usual the men for this service can easily be gotten the providing horses and accoutrements will be found to suffer some difficulty yet will not be impracticable the procuring horses should be undertaken by judicious officers from each regiment well skilled in them and conducted in such a manner as to occasion no interference with each other let sheldons purchases be confined to the eastward of the north river moylans between the north river and susquehanna baylors between susquehanna and james river and blands to the southward of that the number of horses to be purchased by each ought to be determined and an average price limited disclosed only to the purchaser with a strict injunction to conceal it as much as possible   0 because if once generally known sellers would take advantage of it and part with none under the limitation the accoutrements to be provided in the same districts and by the same persons but as some of these districts abound more in manufacturers than others all that can be engaged in each in a certain stipulated time ought to be secured in order that the overplus in one part may supply the deficiency in another and as these articles may be imported cheaper and better in quality than they can be made here i would advise that at least fifteen hundred setts should be sent for to france with directions to divide them in small parcels and embark them in different vessels that we may have a probability of getting at least a part and not run the risk of sustaining a total loss and disappointment by adventuring the whole in one bottom of the arrangement of the army the establishment of a battalion being fixed under the last head it remains to ascertain the number of battalions in order to form a proper arrangement the number of battalions now in the field from each state stand thus new hampshire   massachusetts    rhode island   connecticut   new york   new jersey   pennsylvania    col w stewarts of do   delaware   maryland   virginia    state do   carolina   german batalion   hazens   additionals and parts    total        by the foregoing list it appears that in regiments and parts of regiments there are ninetyseven now in the field but the state of them requires explanation out of nine from north carolina by a return of the   st ultimo only     rank and file are fit for duty these with    sick present and     on command make   0 rank and file which i suppose may be produced the total number rank and file in the nine regiments is  0   the difference is accounted for in sick absent and on furlough which is the only way i am apprehensive they ever will be accounted for from this defective state of them i should think it adviseable to throw the rank and file of the nine regiments into two they have been already reduced to three and to send the supernumerary officers back to the state to collect such men as on various pretences were left behind and deserters and aided by the whole efficiency of the state voluntary enlistments being as i said before out of the question to exert all their endeavors towards completing the seven other regiments or such of them as congress shall direct—i am the more induced to recommend this measure from the possibility of the enemys attempting a more southern expedition next campaign they may do it in order to gain possession of the capitol of another state which will give reputation to their arms in europe distress our trade and abridge our supplies at the same time will enable administration to avail themselves in another instance of the illusory idea they endeavor to hold up to the nation—to keep their hopes alive and extract fresh contributions—that every state whose     capital they possess is conquered—these new raised troops may either join this army or aid south carolina or virginia as circumstances shall point out it is needless to enter into a minute detail as to the precise state of the other troops let it suffice to say that they bear too near an analogy to the specimen here given virginia i understand though not from any direct authority has resolved to draft towards the completion of her batalions and as this mode seems to be the only one calculated to answer the end it is to be hoped she will be able to furnish the full complement of fifteen including the state battalion what plan maryland has fallen upon or may adopt to fill her battalions i know not but as the powers of government are with her in full vigor and the abilities of the state intirely adequate to the end i think her original quota ought to be depended upon delaware must undoubtedly contribute one battalion no change having happened since that portion was assigned her sufficient to afford a plea for reducing it in behalf of pennsylvania much may be said the exhausted state of her regiments—her loss of capitol and intestine divisions ever destructive to the energy of government may perhaps incapacitate her for completing her thirteen regiments now on foot suppose the number should be for the present diminished to eight and the state should exert herself to fill them in the first place when this shall be accomplished if her resources appear equal to any further efforts she may proceed to raising the remaining     five—new jersey new york connecticut rhode island massachusetts and new hampshire are fully competent to the quotas respectively required of them and no abatement seems necessary with respect to either we have reason to hope their exertions will keep pace with their abilities and that they will take decisive measures to send their several proportions into the field i am at a loss what to propose concerning the german batalion hazens regiment and the sixteen additionals appertaining to no particular state or states they will have no chance of being filled by drafts and as little by any other means they must either remain weak and imperfect corps be adopted by the states or incorporated into each other and then if possible recruited the first upon every principle ought not to be the case and as the second would not be altogether eligible from the difficulty of apportioning them—without dividing and subdividing the regiments—the third seems to be the expedient to which we must have recourse let maryland take the german battalion wholly as one of her eight for she already claims a part of it and then let the sixteen additionals none of which are strong some extremely weak and others only partially organized—be thrown into nine there is this number of them which comparatively speaking are tolerably respectable and have undergone a good deal of hard service in the course of the last campaign these after having received the men out of the reduced corps ought to be licensed though a     barren experiment to try what can be done by voluntary enlistments throughout the continent at large hazens regiment might be added to them and united in the same privilege if these propositions are approved the whole number of battalions on the establishment will be eighty and the total amount of them if complete  0  0 rank and file upon this number of battalions i shall make my arrangements whether full or not they will require to be thrown into brigades and divisions—these again into wings and lines all of which for the sake of order harmony and discipline should be under distinct commands capable of moving either jointly or separately in the great machine as circumstances shall require—i would accordingly to every four battalions allow a brigadier to every three brigades a major general and to the grand army three lieutenantgenerals one to command the right wing another the left and a third the second line these three will always be necessary with the grand army and unless it should be more divided next campaign than we have reason to judge from present appearances are all that will be requisite yet it may be better to appoint four on account of contingent services if it should be deemed improper to reduce the number of pennsylvania battalions in the manner proposed another brigadier will be wanted otherwise     twentytwo brigadiers two for the flying army eight majorgenerals one for the flying army and three lieutenant generals will be sufficient to each brigade there should be a quarter master forage master waggon master and commissary also armorers a travelling forge and some artificers—in short each brigade should be an epitome of the great whole and move by similar springs upon a smaller scale in a young army like ours the office of inspector general principally for the purpose of instituting and carrying into practice an uniform system of manual and manœuvres must be extremely useful and advantageous a number of assistants to this office will be required as one man would be incapable of superintending the practice of the rules laid down throughout the army and unless this were carefully done it would be of little avail to establish them it would be proper in my opinion to have one to each brigade the benefits resulting from which would greatly overballance the consideration of expence another new institution i should wish to see take place in the army and from which signal advantages would flow is that of a provostmarshalcy it should be composed of—   capt or grand provost with the pay of dollars pr m   lieutenants or provost marshals with the pay of dollars each per month to be stationed on the flanks and rear of the army   clerk to register all official transactions of the corps regulations for suttlers c as his business will be pretty extensive and imply a degree of trust he should have not less than dollars a month   qr mastersergeant to draw provisions c with the same pay as others of the same denomination   trumpeters  to have the same pay as is given in the horse   sergeants    corporals one to be with each officer     provosts or privates    executioners with the pay of  the reason that the pay of this corps is rated so high is that the offices of it are extremely troublesome and require men worthy of trust and of great activity to execute them who would not be tempted by a less recompence to undergo the drudgery and fatigue it is also necessary the officers should have some rank to enable them to maintain a proper degree of respect and command for which purpose that of captain for the principal and lieutenant for his assistants will be sufficient the intention of the corps requires that the whole should be on horseback armed and accoutred in the same manner as light horsemen and as there is a necessity for good men to be employed in this service who cannot well be enlisted they ought to be drafted from the brigades the business of this corps is to watch over the good order and regularity of the army in camp quarters or on a march—to silence all quarrels tumults and riots detect and hinder every species of marauding—prevent straggling and other unsoldierlike     licenses among the troops—to apprehend spies or persons whose not being able to give a good account of themselves may render them suspicious—to establish and inforce good regulations among the suttlers who should therefore be subject to the rules prescribed them by the grand provost and of whom he is to keep a register frequently inspecting their conduct and seeing that the articles they offer for sale are good in quality and at reasonable prices these and many other particulars are comprehended in the duties of the provost marshalcy in the execution of which continual patroles must be kept up day and night throughout the limits of the camp and its environs there are many little crimes and disorders incident to soldiery which require immediate punishment and which from the multiplicity of them if referred to court martials would create endless trouble and often escape proper notice these when soldiers are detected in the fact by the provostmarshals they ought to have a power to punish on the spot subject to proper limitations and to such regulations as the commanderinchief according to the customs and usages of war shall from time to time introduce before i conclude this head i shall recur a moment to the subject of altering the establishment of a battalion in the manner proposed under the preceding notwithstanding a company of light infantry is added to it there will be a considerable reduction of officers by having only two instead of three subalterns to a     company and this reduction will be greatly increased if intire regiments are disbanded and the fighting part of the staff taken from the line not left separate and distinct as heretofore it becomes an object of inquiry what is to be done with these reduced officers to turn them adrift without some provision though they insist on the privilege whenever it suits them to continue no longer in it of relinquishing the service wears at least the appearance of hardship if not of injury and would no doubt be a subject of clamor and complaint with them all with some who may have provided and lain themselves out for a military life it would be perhaps a real grievance i see but one method of obviating the embarrassments on this score and that not altogether unexceptionable it is to be presumed and fervently to be wished that every battalion retained in service will be officered by gentlemen of the most deserving characters and best military qualifications in it and that can be selected from other corps belonging to the same state which may happen to be dissolved if any are—after this should there remain any worthy officers unprovided for and that cannot be disposed of in some useful capacity they may be held on half pay if not too numerous till vacancies should occur in the line of their own states others may be dismissed with an allowance of land proportioned to their several ranks of rank among the complicated causes of complaint in this army none seems to have taken deeper root nor     to have given more general dissatisfaction than the lavish distribution of rank no error can be more pernicious than that of dealing out rank with too prodigal a hand the inconveniences of it are manifest it lessens the value and splendor of it in some measure degrades it into contempt breeds jealousies and animosities and takes away one of the most powerful incitements to emulation to avoid this evil in future it is proposed that such of the staff as are entitled to it and ought to be commissioned should be taken from the line for instance the adjutant quarter master and pay master of each regiment to be chosen from the regiment they are to serve in the two first from the subalterns the other from the subalterns or captains according to the fitness of the person each of these to enjoy double pay but to hold no other rank than he is vested with by his station in the line in which he is regularly to rise the adjutant and quarter master ceasing to be such when they arrive at the rank of captain and the pay master when he attains to that of major the brigademajor and brigade quarter master to be officers from the brigade not exceeding the rank of captain and to resign those offices when they obtain a majority the future appointments of aiddecamps to the major and lieutenant generals to be from the line and they    to hold no other ranks than their commissions there give them a claim to but as many good officers are now acting in this capacity to the former who originally belonged to the line   0 and have at this time no appointments there the rule ought to have no retrospective operation with regard to those already created who ought upon every principle to preserve their present rank the secretaries and aid de camps to the commander in chief ought not to be confined to the line for plain and obvious reasons the number which the nature and extent of his business require in addition to the many drawn from the line to fill the different offices of the staff when it is considered that they ought all to be men of abilities may seem too large a draft upon the line but a consideration still more forcible is that in a service so complex as ours it would be wrong and detrimental to restrict the choice the vast diversity of objects occurrences and correspondencies unknown in one more regular and less diffusive constantly calling for talents and abilities of the first rate men who possess them ought to be taken wherever they can be found with respect to their rank those who are now in the station ought in every point of view to retain that which they now hold some of them have been acting in these capacities a considerable length of time others who quitted the line of the army to come into them would in the common course of promotion have been at least as high as they now are and almost all of them have been in the service from an early period of the war in future those who happen to be from the army ought only to hold their rank in it and rise in course like others in a similar predicament it is submitted whether those taken out     of it ought to have any rank and if any what also what shall be the pay in both cases the quarter master general and adjutant general as they fill places of the highest trust and importance and ought to be gentlemen of the first military characters should if not of the line have rank conferred upon them and not less than that of colonel as it does not require military men to discharge the duties of commissioners forage masters and waggon masters who are also looked upon as the money making part of the army no rank should be allowed to any of them nor indeed to any in the departments merely of a civil nature neither is it in my opinion proper though it may seem a trivial and inconsequential circumstance that they should wear the established uniforms of the army which ought to be considered as a badge of military distinction these regulations will add weight and dignity to the fighting part of the army render commissions valuable and bringing rank into the estimation it ought to bear will make it a stimulus to bravery and enterprize at the same time they will ease the public of a present and in case of half pay of a considerable future expense in speaking of rank as a spur to enterprize i am led by the way to hint an idea which may be improved and turned to no small advantage this is the institution of honorary rewards differing in degree to be conferred on those who signalize themselves     by any meritorious actions in proportion to the magnitude and brilliancy of the atchievement these should be sacred to the purpose of their institution and unattainable by loose recommendations or vague though arrogating pretensions—given only upon authentic vouchers of real desert from some proper board—congress have already adopted the idea in particular instances but it were to be wished it could be extended to something more general and systematic i have not sufficiently employed my thoughts upon the subject to digest them into a proposition as to the nature variety and extent of these rewards but i would in general observe that they may consist in things of very little cost or real value and that the more diversified they are—the better if judiciously and impartially administered they would be well calculated to kindle that emulous love of glory and distinction to which may be imputed far the greater part of the most illustrious exploits performed among mankind and which is peculiarly necessary to be cherished and cultivated in a military life of promotion irregular promotions have also been a pregnant source of uneasiness discord and perplexity in this army they have been the cause of numerous bickerings and resignations among the officers and have occasioned infinite trouble and vexation to the commander in chief to rectify mistakes introduced by accident inadvertency the interference of state appointments or other means employed much of the     time of the general officers in the course of last campaign and to less purpose than could be wished we find that however injuriously to the rights of others an officer obtains irregular promotion he is not the less tenacious of it but it is with the utmost difficulty if at all he can be convinced of the propriety of doing an act of justice by abandoning his claim though he will confess there was no just cause in the first instance for giving him the preference but as it did happen he pretends his honor would be wounded by suffering another who is in fact his inferior to come over him not considering how much that other was injured by the act which gave him the superiority this however shows how indispensably necessary it is to have some settled rule of promotion universally known and understood and not to be deviated from but for obvious and incontestible reasons extraordinary promotions founded upon acknowledged worth on the one hand and acknowledged demerit on the other would rather excite emulation than murmurs the prospect of not being shackled to the tedious gradations of ordinary succession would teach the good officer to aspire to an excellence that should entitle him to more rapid preferment and the fear of being superseded with dishonor would teach indifferent ones to exert more activity diligence and attention than they otherwise would were they left in a listless security certain of enjoying the honor and emoluments of progressive rank let their conduct be ever so undeserving but this is a matter     that ought to be handled with the utmost caution and delicacy nothing is more alarming and prejudicial than an injudicious infraction of rank it discourages merit and foments discontent and disorder no departure from the established maxims of preferment is warrantable which is not founded upon the most apparent and unequivocal reasons with respect to the rule of promotion proper to be observed as i believe it to be consistent with the general sense and sentiment of the army i would propose— that promotion should be regimental to the rank of captain inclusively—and from that in the line of the state of the rank of brigadier inclusively proceeding from that in the line of the army at large the reason that promotions in the line of a state end with the brigadier and are extended from that to the line of the army is that though the principle of having regard to the proportion of troops furnished by each state in the appointments of general officers be in the main equitable and politic yet the end proposed from it will be sufficiently answered by limiting it to the creation of brigadiers if carried further it will be injurious and become an incurable source of inquietude and disgust when once a man is made a general officer his circle of expectation widens and he transfers his views from the line of his state to the line at large he looks for promotion according to his seniority in the scale of general officers and will not brook being overleaped by his juniors and inferiors merely because he had the ill     fortune to enter the service of his country in a smaller or less populous state than they these feelings and sentiments are universal and we have already in some instances experienced their operation as four regiments in the arrangement proposed are required to constitute a brigade and some states send less than that number to the field a mode should be fallen upon to place this matter upon determinate principles so as to prevent disputes hereafter at present no difficulty can arise because all the states delaware excepted have brigadiers but time and accident may remove these and give rise to contention unless some rule is previously fixed and declared it appears to me absolutely essential that congress the board of war or some other body or person should exercise the sole power when once the states have sent their regiments into the field of giving and receiving commissions filling vacancies and the like if this should not be the case i fear the confusion will be endless erroneous promotions will probably be made as heretofore commissions antedated officers dissatisfied time lost in transmitting returns from one end of the continent to the other and waiting the arrangements upon them the wheels of the whole machine in consequence clogged and disordered and infinite trouble incurred in putting them to rights again of cloathing the army in regard to cloathing experience has evinced that the mode of providing hitherto in practice is by     no means adequate to the end and that unless our future efforts are more effectual it will be next to impossible to keep an army in the field i am in hopes that valuable consequences will accrue from a resolution of congress of the   d of november directing that the several states from time to time exert their utmost endeavours to procure in addition to the allowances of cloathing heretofore made by congress supplies of blankets c for the comfortable subsistence of the officers and soldiers of their respective batalions as this puts the business into a greater variety of hands than it has heretofore been in and under the providence of a more diffusive attention besides exciting a laudable rivalship and operating upon the attachments of the different states—it will probably be not a little instrumental in bringing us the needed supplies but it is not an expedient that can be relied on altogether of which i doubt not congress are fully sensible and will only consider it as an auxiliary to their exertions indeed with several states which happen to be more or less the theatres of the war and labor under other local impediments it would be impracticable to furnish but a very small part of their proportion for my own part with all deference i speak it i have little conception that our extensive wants can be completely satisfied in any other way than by national or governmental contracts between congress and the court of france if we are to depend wholly upon the resources of our mercantile credit they must     from the nature of things be too limited and contingent while the seas are crowded with the british navy and no foreign maritime power is employed in the protection of our trade the precariousness of remittances from this continent must be so great as to destroy or at least sicken our commercial credit and make it neither the interest nor within the abilities of private individuals to adventure so largely upon that foundation as our necessities demand it is not in my power to judge with certainty what terms we may be upon with the french court what may have been already attempted or may be now negociating in the matter here suggested perhaps the project of our national contracts is not practicable but if it is it would certainly be our interest to embrace it besides placing our supplies in so essential an article on a sure and unfailing foundation it would cement the connexion between the two countries and if discovered prove a new and powerful topic of hostility between france and britain at the same time i do not think that the fear of a discovery from an unwillingness on the part of france to force on an immediate war supposing it to exist need be any insuperable obstacle things might be conducted in such an indirect and discreet manner as to make them go on in all appearance as they do at present and render a detection of the part the government bore in the affair morally impossible the resolution before cited recommends to the respective states the appointment of one or more persons to dispose of the articles procured to the     officers and soldiers in such proportions as the general officers from the respective states commanding in the army shall direct and at such reasonable prices as shall be assessed by the clothiergeneral or his deputy and be in just proportion to the wages of the officers and soldiers charging the surplus to the cost of the united states adding that all cloathing hereafter to be supplied to the officers and soldiers of the continental army out of the public stores of the united states beyond the bounties already granted shall be charged at the like prices—the regulation contained in this clause is very wholesome generous and equitable it will give great satisfaction to the army and conduce to removing the difficulties stated in the first section of these remarks arising from the insufficiency of the present provision for officers nor do i know whether it admits of any improvement by being made more definite as the criterion of reasonableness in the prices seems to lie with the clothiergeneral or deputy it may perhaps be liable to uncertainty and abuse and may be the subject of dispute between them and the officers if to prevent this a catalogue of rates could be established as the standard it would be desireable but perhaps the great difference and variety in the quality and kinds of goods may not admit of such a measure it will of course be necessary for each state to have agents for importing and purchasing goods towards its quota of supplies and the clothier general should have a deputy in every state for purchasing     all over plus articles wanted in his department provided that effectual measures be taken by each state for preventing any competition between their agents or the clothier general and his agents who are severally directed to observe the instructions of the respective states relative to the prices of cloathing purchased within such state  there should also be a sub clothier or clerk from every state constantly with the army to receive and distribute the cloathing see that the goods brought correspond with the invoices and that the issues are made conformable to some general rule established to do justice to the public to regiments and to individuals the rule i would propose for issuing and distributing cloathing is this that the captains of companies in the first place give certificates containing the names of his men with the particular wants of each—that these be digested into a regimental return signed by the officer commanding the regiment that the pay master draw the cloathing lodging the regimental return so signed with the clothier as a voucher for the delivery who is to keep an account with the regiment for the same that the pay master retaining the certificates for his own government distribute the cloathing to the men agreeable to them taking their receipts and keeping an exact account with every individual which he can easily do as he is supposed to have accounts open for their monthly pay and that all cloathing delivered to the men be given credit for in the pay rolls with accounts signed by the sub   0 clothiers annexed for the information of the pay master general to make soldiers look well and bestow proper attention and care upon their cloaths they ought to receive them at stated periods this gives a taste for decency and uniformity and makes the officers regardful of the appearance of the men a matter of no small moment in an army as tending to promote health and foster a becoming pride of dress which raises soldiers in their own esteem and makes them respectable to their enemy the periods i would fix upon for delivery are on the first days of june and january in june should be given a waistcoat with sleeves flannel if to be had two pair of linnen overalls one shirt a black stock of hair or leather a small round hat bound and a pair of shoes in january a waistcoat to be worn over the former close in the skirts and double breasted resembling a sailors— to have a collar and cuff of a different color in order to distinguish the regiment a pair of breeches woolen overalls yarn stockings shirt woolen cap and a blanket when really necessary watch coats ought if possible to be provided for sentinels whatever might be furnished more than these the soldier ought to have stopped out of his pay upon the terms fixed by congress in their late resolve a list of the cloathing to be kept by the commanding officer of each company an inspection into them made at least once a week and punishment inflicted or restitution made for every article missing unless well accounted for     if it could be done which is much to be doubted it would be well to discriminate the troops of each state—by the color of their cloaths and each regiment by that of the collar and cuff if this plan could be adopted and a quantity of supernumerary articles laid in for occasional demands our men would appear infinitely better be much healthier and the army a great deal stronger than it commonly is the clothiergeneral ought to be authorized and directed to enter into contracts for as large quantities as possible of shoes and stockings to be manufactured in the country these are articles that can least be dispensed with and the deficiency of which we have most severely felt—a mr henry of lancaster i am told would contract for one or two hundred thousand pair of shoes annually to be paid for in raw hides the number of cattle killed for the consumption of the army enable us to make this contract to great advantage of the quarter master generals department in this department are comprehended forage masters waggon masters artificers c with all their appendages it is a department of great trust and magnitude on the due administration of which all the operations of an army essentially depend the person who fills it ought to be a military character—a man of abilities of business and activity well versed in the resources of the country and of sufficient prudence and rectitude to exercise his office     in drawing the necessary supplies in a manner least distressing to the inhabitants his duty requiring him to be almost constantly with the army to see and know its wants superintend the movements of his department in the different branches and to prevent or rectify the abuses that may be creeping into it—he will stand in need of assistants to execute the business abroad under his direction it is not easy to ascertain the number of these assistants that will be requisite circumstances vary and must govern but i cannot forbear observing that some measures ought to be taken to restrain that extravagant rage of deputation now too prevalent among us it has served to create a number of mere sinecures and to render the execution of every office more perplexed more expensive and less satisfactory than formerly both to the army and country i should imagine that a great part of the business of this department might be managed by contracts with people capable of performing them and bound by sufficient securities this would unburthen the public of large sums now paid in stationary wages often for temporary purposes and would perhaps answer the end of supplies better standing wages are very apt to beget indolence and inattention and commonly continue an incumbrance when the cause that gave rise to appointments ceases to exist from the difficulty of throwing off the persons to whom they were given on which account they ought to be avoided whenever any point can be effected without them     i am also unacquainted with the number of persons the quarter master general may find it necessary to employ in camp or elsewhere as store keepers clerks and the like but under the of these remarks i have given my opinion of all the assistant quarter masters required in the subordinate duties of the office in camp more than these should not be allowed division quarter masters forage masmasters and waggon masters should be abolished who may be in contemplation to fill the place of quarter master general is as yet to me unknown and equally indifferent provided he be a fit person but in making the appointment not a moments time should be lost the least procrastination will be extremely prejudicial as the season is already far advanced which we ought to be improving in preparations for the next campaign every thing is to be done—the old waggons to be repaired new ones provided horses and pack saddles procured bell tents for arms and tents for the men haversacks and knapsacks made tools of different kinds prepared and artificers and waggoners engaged and here i shall take occasion to declare that however inconvenient it may be to the quarter masters to provide or expensive to the public to pay for waggoners it ought nevertheless at all events to be done soldiers are drafted for waggoners and many other purposes by which their services in the line are entirely superseded while they actually compose a part of our numbers and appear on the returns to compose part of our strength this may be tolerated in     quarters or in a season of inaction though even then the soldiers would be better employed in learning the duties of their profession but it ought not to be submitted to in the progress of the campaign as has been of late the invariable practice several new regulations will i believe be necessary in the forage department the particulars of which the gentlemen at the head of it will be best able to point out one thing i shall observe that the manner of paying the forage master has been a subject of discussion it has been suggested that the allowing a commission instead of a fixed determinate pay opens a wide door to fraud and peculation in mentioning this not the least insinuation is intended to the prejudice of the gentleman now acting in this capacity it is merely hinted as a matter worth consideration on general principles—i think however it may be safely asserted that the assistant forage masters are not in general so accurate as they ought to be in receiving or delivering forage and that depending too much upon the farmers reports and their own conjectures the public pays for much more than they receive we have to lament that we are suffering exceedingly from a scarcity of forage an article not less essential to the well being of an army than that of provisions should we be able to shift through the winter this want will be no small obstacle and delay to our operations in the spring especially as we are exhausting the small stock now on the spot which will     probably be the immediate scene of them we have numbers of horses dying dayly for the want of provender what then must become of them when it grows scarcer and the distance to fetch it greater how are magazines to be formed under these circumstances and without magazines how are our horses to be supported in the early part of the next campaign when their number shall be greatly augmented these are serious questions not easy of solution and are proposed that every exertion may be made to avert an evil of no small consequence a waggon master general is a necessary officer and there would be a great saving to the public if the duties of the office were discharged by an active careful man who would make a judicious choice of deputies and not be himself above his business as has been the case with most of those heretofore in this line they have been apt to indulge fantastical notions of rank and importance and assume titles very inapplicable to their stations which have served to destroy a great part of their usefulness and make them the objects of general contempt and resentment this inconvenience must be obviated in future by allowing no rank to any of them from the highest to the lowest the number of assistants requisite cannot be precisely ascertained as it must depend upon the number of waggons there must be one to each brigade to superintend the baggage waggons but how many will be wanted to take the charge of forage provisions and for a variety of other purposes i am     at a loss to judge this must be left to the quarter master general of whose department this is a branch and to the waggon master general who is the immediate agent one deputy however to every twenty waggons appears to me fully sufficient the men employed in this capacity should be plain sober diligent men acquainted with the management of horses and waggons and untainted with absurd fancies of gentility who would understand the end and design of their appointment and not consider the means of making themselves useful as a degradation of their imaginary dignity i shall close this head with an observation on the mode hitherto in practice of estimating and paying for damages done by the army in quarters or in the field which appears to me objectionable on several accounts the payments have usually been made on certificates of appraisement by farmers or other persons in the neighborhood of the parties injured—chosen by themselves and whenever the accounts were presented and there was money in hand to pay them this mode is unequal and gives the injured party an evident advantage over the public and has no doubt in many instances been attended with gross impositions besides this defect it would probably promote the service and be productive of more regularity if a fixed time was appointed when these payments should be made there would not be such frequent large drafts upon the quarter master in the most active part of a campaign when he wants money for more pressing exigencies and the entries of his     disbursements might be made with more order and exactness if these were deferred to a time of greater leisure it is submitted in the first place whether the appointment of two or more persons would not be proper to accompany the army constantly for the purpose of ascertaining damages with a like number of persons chosen by the party interested whose certificates should be a sufficient justification to the quarter master for paying them and in the second place what time or times would be proper to satisfy demands of this nature perhaps two different periods would be best both in the interval of tranquility—one a little after the entrance of the army into winter quarters and the other just before the opening of the campaign of the commissarys department this department has been all along in a very defective and for some time in a very deplorable situation one important change has already taken place in it since which it has been with the utmost difficulty we were able to keep the army together whether this proceeded from the revolution being illtimed or too great from the difficulties in the way of executing the office being multiplied or from the present gentleman at the head of it not having yet had leisure to digest his plan and form his connexions—i shall not undertake to determine but unless a very considerable alteration shortly takes place i see no prospect of adequate supplies for the succeeding campaign to attempt supplying the army from hand to mouth     if i may be allowed the phrase scarcely ever having more than two or three days provisions before hand and sometimes being as much in arrears is a dangerous and visionary experiment we shall ever be liable to experience want in the most critical junctures as we have frequently done heretofore and to suspend or forego the most interesting movements on account of it whether the first establishment of this department—the present—or the mode of supplying the army by contract at certain stipulated rates be preferable is a question not for me to decide though well worth a strict and candid examination but i shall not scruple in explicit terms to declare that unless ample magazines are laid up in the course of this winter and the approaching spring nothing favorable is to be looked for from the operations of the next campaign but our arms enfeebled by the embarrassments of irregular and fluctuating supplies of provisions will reap no other fruits than disgrace and disappointment to obviate this no possible exertion should be omitted the ablest and best qualified men in the several states whence provisions are drawn should be called forth to aid in the matter—such as are acquainted with the resources of the country and may have been conversant in business of the kind the choosing of fit places for magazines in defensive war is equally momentous and difficult expence and hazard are naturally incident to them because the possible movements of an enemy must ever be conjectural and it is precarious when where and often how they are to be removed according to     present appearances magazines any where in the rear of the army from lancaster to the north river would not be amiss and the more numerous they are the better as their multiplicity decreasing the importance of each would leave no one a sufficient object of enterprize enhance the trouble of destroying them and lessen the labor and expence of forming them in the first instance whether the commissaries should be dependent upon the quarter masters for teams or be empowered to provide for themselves is a matter they can perhaps best settle between themselves but it is necessary they should come to some agreement or determination upon the subject to remove the inconveniences hitherto incurred on this score the commissaries having frequently imputed the deficiency of supplies to a want of the means of transportation it is a point of prodigious consequence and in which we have been amazingly deficient that vinegar vegetables and soap should be regularly and abundantly furnished to the army nothing contributing more than this to the health comfort and contentment of soldiers certainly there are no insurmountable obstacles to doing it and if not no pains should be spared to accomplish so valuable an end a ration should be more precisely defined than it now is and the quantity of spirituous liquors allowed the soldier fixed it should also be considered whether any and what quantity should be allowed officers at the public expence at all events the commissaries should be obliged to provide for them if at their own charge as they would otherwise have no   0 opportunity of getting it and in the hard and fatiguing service they pass through it is indispensable even to the most temperate men of the hospital department there ever have been and i fear will continue difficulties and imperfections in this department what they are particularly or whence arising it is not in my power minutely to enter into as i have neither had leisure nor opportunity to examine its present constitution with a critical eye one powerful reason no doubt of its not producing so fully the advantages to be hoped for from it is the extreme scarcity of proper supplies for the accommodation of the sick but one thing which has had a very pernicious influence is the continual jealousies and altercation subsisting between the hospital and regimental surgeons they seem always to be at variance and recriminating the sufferings of the sick upon each other the regimental surgeons complain that for want of medicines and other necessaries they are disabled from giving that assistance in slight cases and in the first stages of more dangerous complaints which would serve to check their progress to maturity and save the lives of the soldiery the hospital surgeons reply that their stores are incapable of bearing the excessive drafts which the profusion and carelessness of the regimental surgeons would make upon them if indulged in their demands i shall not attempt to decide the merits of this     dispute nor can i conceive any adequate mode of adjusting the difference but one would imagine it might not be impossible to fix some general rule of allowance by which the supplies to regimental surgeons might be regulated and to make them accountable for the right and œconomical application of what they received at all events as the accommodation of the sick and the preservation of mens lives are the first and great objects to be consulted the regimental surgeons ought not to be destitute of a reasonable quantity of medicines and other conveniences of which the sick stand in need the ill effects of it are many and glaring either men at every slight indication of disease must be sent away to distant hospitals and the army unnecessarily deprived of the services of numbers who if the means were at hand might in a day or two be restored or they must remain without proper assistance till their diseases confirm themselves and with regard to many get beyond the power of cure other ill consequences that have attended the sending so many men away to a distance from the army are desertions and the waste of arms and cloathing for which reasons it ought to be avoided as much as possible to prevent these evils as far as it can be done a field officer is stationed at each hospital to see the arms of the soldiers carefully deposited at their admission into it take care of them in their convalescent state and send them on to join their regiments under proper officers so soon as they are fit for duty     of the pay master generals department this department is well conducted so far as depends upon the gentleman at the head of it but the want of money which too frequently happens is extremely injurious to our affairs it is unnecessary to observe that besides feeding and cloathing a soldier well nothing is of greater importance than paying him with punctuality and it is perhaps more essential in our army than in any other because our men are worse supplied and more necessitous and the notions of implicit subordination not being as yet sufficiently ingrafted among them they are more apt to reason upon their rights and readier to manifest their sensibility of any thing that has the appearance of injustice to them in which light they consider their being kept out of their pay after it is due—nor does the evil end here the inhabitants who through choice accident or necessity have any pecuniary concerns with the army finding themselves frequently disappointed in the payments they have a right to expect grow dissatisfied and clamorous—the credit of the army and which is nearly the same thing the credit of the continent is impaired—our supplies of course are impeded and the price of every article we want raised this circumstance is not among the least causes of the depreciation of our currency of the commissary of musters departt the duties of this officer are i believe discharged with fidelity and care by the gentleman at the head     of it no complaint has ever come to my ear either of him or his deputies of the commissary of prisoners departt the business of this department as far as i am yet capable of judging is in good hands and going on a proper train of auditors of accounts the want of such an institution has been much felt and i am very happy it is at length adopted the sooner the gentlemen appointed enter upon the execution of their office the better as much necessary business waits their regulating hand the public has sustained a loss of many thousands which might have been prevented by the negligence dishonesty and death of numberless officers having run through the different distributions of the army as composed of horse and foot with all the departments depending thereon and offered such remarks as occurred to me on the several subjects—i proceed to the mention of two departments commonly considered as separate and distinct—the artillery and engineering— of the artillery department this department if the arrangements and measures in contemplation meet with proper countenance and support bids fair to be upon a very respectable establishment a plan was agreed upon not long since between general knox and myself for the formation     of four battalions which was intended to be presented to congress that if approved by them it might be recommended to the several states it is now submitted to the consideration of the committee— we have at this time three imperfect battalions of artillery in the field besides some detached companies which have never been regularly incorporated these together make    0 including officers to which harrisons battalion of virginia being added would amount to    0 the deficiency of the four battalions on this state will be   0 which it is proposed should be raised by the different states agreeable to the following arrangement virginia harrison  0 companies   0 each  00  maryland to raise   companies   0 each   0  a

are included all the officers except the brigadier field and staff officers and if completed would prevent the necessity of the pernicious practice of drafting from the battalions general knox communicated to me more than two months ago an estimate of ordnance and ordnance stores which he had prepared to send to the board of war for the supplies of the next campaign agreeable to their request nothing more is necessary than an enquiry what has been done in consequence i shall take the liberty in this place to give it as my opinion that any arsenal or depositary of stores at albany in the present situation of the north river is improper it would be too easily accessible and exceedingly liable to be surprized and destroyed indeed it ought to be a general rule to have every kind of magazines as far advanced into the interior parts of the country and as remote from the seacoast or from the sides of navigable rivers as the nature and design of them will permit we have seen the effects of not attending duly to this precaution of the engineering department the gentleman at the head of this department appears to be a man of science knowledge in his profession and zeal in the cause he complains that he has not assistant engineers enough to execute the various duties of his office and wishes for an augmentation of the number he also proposes that three companies of workmen should be formed to be instructed in the fabrication of all kinds of field works so far as relates to the manual and mechanical     part whose business it should be to teach the fatigue parties to execute the works with celerity an exactness which could not otherwise be expected from men entirely unpracticed in the matter these companies he would have to consist of a captain three lieutenants four serjeants four corporals and sixty privates each—the commissioned officers to be intelligent and skilled in some branches of the mathematics the noncommissioned officers to be sober sensible men and capable of writing a legible hand and the whole corps to consist of men of good characters of diligence and integrity in consideration of these qualifications and the extra duty confinement and hazard they must encounter being always foremost in danger to repair the injuries done any fortification by the enemys fire and to prosecute works in the face of it the corps is to have extraordinary pay this proposition appears reasonable and promises a degree of utility that out weighs the cost these companies if formed are to be solely under the direction of the chief engineer and to have the care of all the intrenching tools of the army conclusion i shall now in the last place beg leave to subjoin a few matters unconnected with the general subject of these remarks or not recollected in their proper places to which the attention of the committee is requested what is to be done with the foreign officers who have been commissioned and never designated to any     particular command and who cannot without displacing others be brought into the line such of them as possess any competency of military knowledge and are otherwise men of character i have sometimes thought if they understood enough of our language might be employed as assistant inspectors at other times i have judged it best if practicable to form them into a corps by themselves but most of them being field officers the difficulty of getting men for such a corps unless deserters and prisoners were enlisted which i have ever looked upon as impolitic appeared to me an insurmountable objection the enemy have set every engine at work against us and have actually called savages and even our own slaves to their assistance —would it not be well     to employ two or three hundred indians against general howes army the ensuing campaign there is a gentleman now in camp who would i imagine be able to bring half that number of cherokees and i should think the reverend mr kirkland might be able to influence a like number of the northern tribes such a body of indians joined by some of our woodmen would probably strike no small terror into the british and foreign troops particularly the new comers the good resulting from the measure if these savages can be kept in the field at so great a distance from their native haunts—would more than compensate for the trouble and expence they might cost us col morgan when he left camp desired to know     whether he might engage any good riflemen to serve during the next campaign in the light corps he thinks he should be able to procure many under assurances that they would serve with him and be dismissed at the end of the campaign the difficulty of getting waggoners and the enormous wages given them would tempt one to try any expedient to answer the end on easier and cheaper terms among others it has occurred to me whether it would not be eligible to hire negroes in carolina virginia and maryland for the purpose they ought however to be freemen for slaves could not be sufficiently depended on it is to be apprehended they would too frequently desert to the enemy to obtain their liberty and for the profit of it or to conciliate a more favorable reception would carry off their waggon horses with them a resolve of congress of the   th instant provides that all continental officers prisoners with the enemy either while in confinement with them or on parole among us so long as they continue officers of the united states should be entitled to their pay and rations liable to a deduction for what they may have received while present with the enemy and that all flying camp or militia officers should be entitled to the same while in confinement with them only this resolve excluded from pay all officers liberated on parole who have not actual appointments in the continental army—will it not be deemed a hardship and injustice to such officers—especially to those who merely from their absence   0 have been neglected in arrangements posterior to their capture as has been too much the case—while they continue prisoners whether in possession of the enemy or out on parole they can have little opportunity of prosecuting any business for a livelihood and must be in a distressful situation unless they have a private fortune sufficient to maintain them— it has in many instances happened that officers in captivity have been omitted in promotions made in their absence upon which a question has arisen whether there should not be a restoration of rank with respect to those who are men of merit it seems but reasonable there should— several new regulations will i imagine be found useful in the articles of war which the judge advocate from his official experience of the deficiency can more accurately indicate one thing we have suffered much from is the want of a proper gradation of punishments the interval between a hundred lashes and death is too great and requires to be filled by some intermediate stages capital crimes in the army are frequent particularly in the instance of desertion actually to inflict capital punishment upon every deserter or other heinous offender would incur the imputation of cruelty and by the familiarity of the example destroy its efficacy on the other hand to give only a hundred lashes to such criminals is a burlesque on their crimes rather than a serious correction and affords encouragement to obstinacy and imitation the courts are often in a manner     compelled by the enormity of the facts to pass sentences of death which i am as often obliged to remit on account of the number in the same circumstances and let the offenders pass wholly unpunished this would be avoided if there were other punishments short of the destruction of life in some degree adequate to the crime and which might be with propriety substituted  crimes too are so various in their complexions and degrees that to preserve the just rule of proportions there ought to be a gradual scale of punishments in order to which whipping should be extended to any number at discretion or by no means limited lower than five hundred lashes upon the whole gentlemen i doubt not you are fully impressed with the defects of our present military system and the necessity of speedy and decisive measures to put it upon a satisfactory footing the disagreeable picture i have given you of the wants and sufferings of the army and the discontents reigning among the officers is a just representation of evils equally melancholy and important and unless effectual remedies be applied without loss of time the most alarming and ruinous consequences are to be apprehended i have the honor to be c     george washington  0 january      sir william howe to sir william howe headquarters  0 january      sir i have duly received your letter of the   th ultimo it is unnecessary to enter minutely into its contents since the enclosed resolutions of congress will show you that the matter is now put upon a footing different from that mentioned by mr boudinot which at the same time you will be pleased to consider as final and decisive and to regulate your measures accordingly i should be glad as soon as possible to be favored with your determination in consequence especially on those parts numbered in the margin of the resolves to which i must request a speedy and explicit answer there is one passage of your letter which i cannot forbear taking particular notice of no expression of personal politeness to me can be acceptable accompanied by reflections on the representatives of a free people under whose authority i have the honor to act the delicacy i have observed in refraining from every thing offensive in this way entitled me to expect a similar treatment from you i have not indulged myself in invective against the present rulers of great britain in the course of our correspondence nor will i even now avail myself of so fruitful a theme the quartermasters permitted to go with the clothing appeared to me sufficient for the purpose for though the prisoners are in different places yet they lie chiefly on a direct communication if upon any future occasion you should conceive a greater number requisite you will inform me of it previously     to their coming and i shall be ready to comply as far as i think myself justified whether your sending out more than one british quartermaster was an encroachment upon the spirit of the agreement between us shall not now be matter of discussion but can it be said there is any thing in it that can reconcile the coming out of captain mccleod i have the honor to be c  george washington    january      valley forge henry laurens to henry laurens valley forge    january      sir i this morning received your favor of the   th instant i cannot sufficiently express the obligation i feel to you for your friendship and politeness upon an occasion in which i am so deeply interested i was not unapprized that a malignant faction had been for some time forming to my prejudice which conscious as i am of having ever done all in my     power to answer the important purposes of the trust reposed in me could not but give me some pain on a personal account but my chief concern arises from an apprehension of the dangerous consequences which intestine dissensions may produce to the common cause as i have no other view than to promote the public good and am unambitious of honors not founded in the approbation of my country i would not desire in the least degree to suppress a free spirit of inquiry into any part of my conduct that even faction itself may deem reprehensible the anonymous paper handed to you exhibits many serious charges and it is my wish that it should be submitted to congress this i am the more inclined to as the suppression or concealment may possibly involve you in embarrassments hereafter since it is uncertain how many or who may be privy to the contents my enemies take an ungenerous advantage of me they know the delicacy of my situation and that motives of policy deprive me of the defence i might otherwise make against their insidious attacks they know i cannot combat their insinuations however injurious without disclosing secrets which it is of the utmost moment to conceal but why should i expect to be exempt from censure the unfailing lot of an elevated station merit and talents with which i can have no pretensions of rivalship have ever been subject to it my heart tells me that it has been my unremitted aim to do the best that circumstances would permit yet i may have been very often mistaken in my judgment of the means and     may in many instances deserve the imputation of error i cannot forbear repeating that i have a grateful sense of the favorable disposition you have manifested to me in this affair and beg you will believe me to be with sentiments of real esteem and regard sir c george washington february        valley forge john parke custis to john parke custis valley forge february        dear sir i will just write you a few lines in acknowledgment of your letter of the fourteenth ultimo which was detained by the posts not being able to cross susquehanna till the evening before last i congratulate you upon the birth of another daughter and nellys good health and heartily wish the last may continue and the other be a blessing to you the money received for your land was i think well applied unless you could have laid it out for other lands more convenient which method i should have preferred as land is the most permanent estate we can hold and most likely to increase in its value your mamma is not yet arrived but if she left mount vernon on the twenty sixth ultimo as intended may i think be expected every hour  meade  set off yesterday as soon as i got notice of her intention     to meet her we are in a dreary kind of place and uncomfortably provided for other matters i shall refer you to the bearer colonel fitzgerald  who can give you the occurrences of the camp c better than can be related in a letter my best wishes attend nelly and the little ones and with sincere regard i am and shall ever remain dear sir your most affectionate c george washington   february      governor livingston to governor livingston headquarters   february      sir i have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the   th ulto the recent detection of the wicked design you mention gives me the most sensible pleasure and i earnestly hope that you may be alike successful in discovering and disappointing every attempt which may be projected against you either by your open or concealed enemies it is a tax however severe which all those must pay who are called to eminent stations of trust not only to be held up as conspicuous marks to the enmity of the public adversaries to their country but to the malice of secret traitors and the envious intrigues of false friends and factions      i am obliged to you for the interest you take in the affair of the two hendricks and meeker and i have no doubt that the measures adopted are considering all things best  you are pleased to intimate that you would take pleasure in recommending at the approaching session of your assembly any hints from me respecting the army by which your state can advance the general interest i should be happy in offering any such in my power but as there is now in camp a committee of congress to confer with me at large on the measures proper to be adopted in every respect for the benefit of the army whatever shall be thought necessary to this end will of course be communicated to you by congress i am c george washington   february      peter colt to peter colt    february      sir the present situation of the army is the most melancholy that can be conceived our supplies of provisions of the flesh kind for some time past have been very deficient and irregular a prospect now     opens of absolute want such as will make it impossible to keep the army much longer from dissolution unless the most vigorous and effectual measures be pursued to prevent it—jersey pensylvania and maryland are now intirely exhausted all the beef and pork already collected in them or that can be collected will not by any means support the army one month longer further to the southward some quantities of salt provisions have been procured but if they were all on the spot they would afford but a very partial and temporary supply—the difficulty of transportation is great the distance will not allow it to be effected by land carriage and the navigation up chesapeak bay is interrupted by the enemys vessels which makes it very precarious when we shall get any material relief from that quarter to the eastward only can we turn our eyes with any reasonable hope of timely and adequate succor if every possible exertion is not made use of there to send us immediate and ample supplies of cattle with pain i speak the alarming truth no human efforts can keep the army from speedily disbanding  i have desired col blaine to give you a just state of our situation and to send an active man in his     department to you to hurry on to camp whatever cattle you may be able to purchase i cannot forbear so urgent is the necessity of the case accompanying his representation by a similar one from myself you are called upon by every motive that ought to influence you in your official capacity and as a well wisher to the army to strain every nerve and exert your utmost activity towards affording us the assistance we indispensably stand in need of and without a moments loss of time i persuade myself you will duly consider the infinite importance of leaving nothing undone that may be in your power and as i know the state of connecticut abounds in the article we want i flatter myself we shall not be left to feel the calamitous consequences with which we are now threatened    i am informed there are considerable quantities of salt provisions laid up in new england as it is inconvenient tedious and extremely expensive to transport them to this army i have directed general putnam to make use of them almost wholly for the troops under his command and to let all the cattle that can be procured come on to us which will be equally conducive to dispatch and economy as   0 far as this may depend upon you i should wish the rule to be strictly observed i am c george washington feby        valley forge thomas nelson jr to thomas nelson jr valley forge feby        my dear sir i have been favored with your letters of the   th of decemr and  0th ulto and thank you for the several articles of intelligence contained in them although it is devoutly to be wished that soldiers could engage for three years or the war yet i am persuaded it would not be consistent with good policy to attempt it at this time consequently that the plan of drafting for twelve months only is a wise measure if the states would exert themselves and congress would bend their whole force to one point the most satisfactory and decisive effects might i think result from it but if they go to frittering their army into detachments for the accomplishment of some local and less important purposes the campaign will be wasted and nothing decisive on our part attempted it is our business to crush if possible the army under genl howes immediate command this once done the branches of it fall of course and without it the body will always afford nourishment to its members my fear is that virginia by attempting to do too much will do too little or in other words by attempting to raise  000 volunteers which more than probable will not succeed the drafts for your regiments will be impeded and after all unless some vigorous exertions can be     used to supply with provisions men will avail little for you can have no conception of our deficiency in this article it is with pain and grief i find by your letter of the  0th ulto that our countrymen are still averse to innoculation especially when consequences so apparently ill must result from it the artillery and other regiments of infantry i was in hopes of seeing here as soon as the roads and weather should be a little settled as they will want a little disciplining before the campaign opens to fit them for the purposes of it you gave me reason my dear sir to believe i shall see you at camp in the spring i should rejoice at it or to hear of your being in congress again as i view with concern the departure of every gentleman of independent spirit from the grand american council nothing of much importance has happened since my last we have lost a good many men and horses by hard fare in our present quarters but hope we have seen the worst especially with respect to the first as most of the men are now in tolerable good huts faction had begun to rear its head but the heads of it unmasked i believe too soon an expedition is also on foot against rather into canada which i am well persuaded is the child of folly and must be productive of capital ills circumstanced as our affairs are at present but as it is the first fruit of our new board of war i did not incline to say any thing against it be so good as to present my     respectful compliments to your lady uncle and friends and believe me to be with perfect esteem and regard c george washington   february      valley forge majorgeneral gates to majorgeneral gates headquarters valley forge   february       sir i was duly favored with your letter of the   d of last month to which i should have replied sooner had i not been delayed by business that required my more immediate attention it is my wish to give implicit credit to the assurances of every gentleman but in the subject of our present correspondence i am sorry to confess there happen to be some unlucky circumstances which involuntarily compell me to consider the discovery you mention not so satisfactory and conclusive as you seem to think it i am so unhappy as to find no small difficulty in reconciling the spirit and import of your different letters and sometimes of the different parts of the same letter with each other it is not unreasonable to presume that your first information of my having notice of general conways letter came from himself there were very few in the secret and it is natural to suppose that he being immediately concerned would be most interested to convey the intelligence to you it is also far from improbable that     he acquainted you with the substance of the passage communicated to me one would expect this if he believed it to be spurious in order to ascertain the imposition and evince his innocence especially as he seemed to be under some uncertainty as to the precise contents of what he had written when i signified my knowledge of the matter to him—if he neglected doing it the omission cannot easily be interpreted into any thing else than a consciousness of the reality of the extract if not literally at least substantially if he did not neglect it it must appear somewhat strange that the forgery remained so long undetected and that your first letter to me from albany of the  th of december should tacitly recognize the genuineness of the paragraph in question while your only concern at that time seemed to be the tracing out the author of the infidelity which put extracts from genl conways letter into my hands throughout the whole of that letter the reality of the extracts is by the fairest implication allowed and your only solicitude is to find out the person that brought them to light after making the most earnest pursuit of the author of the supposed treachery without saying a word about the truth or falsehood of the passage your letter of the   d ulto to my great surprise proclaims it in words as well as in substance a wicked forgery it is not my intention to contradict this assertion but only to intimate some considerations which tend to induce a supposition that though none of general     conways letters to you contained the offensive passage mentioned there might have been something in them too nearly related to it that could give such an extraordinary alarm it may be said if this were not the case how easy in the first instance to have declared there was nothing exceptionable in them and to have produced the letters themselves in support of it this may be thought the most proper and effectual way of refuting misrepresentation and removing all suspicion—the propriety of the objections suggested against submitting them to inspection may very well be questioned the various reports circulated concerning their contents were perhaps so many arguments for making them speak for themselves to place the matter upon the footing of certainty concealment in an affair which had made so much noise tho not by my means will naturally lead men to conjecture the worst and it will be a subject of speculation even to candor itself the anxiety and jealousy you apprehended from revealing the letter will be very apt to be increased by suppressing it it may be asked why not submit to inspection a performance perfectly harmless and of course conceived in terms of proper caution and delicacy why supposed that anxiety and jealousy would have arisen in the breasts of very respectable officers or that they would have been unnecessarily disgusted at being made sensible of their faults when related with judgement and impartiality by a candid observer surely they could not have been unreasonable enough to take offence at a performance so     perfectly inoffensive blaming actions rather then persons which have evidently no connexion with one another and indulgently recording the errors of inexperience you are pleased to consider general conways letters as of a confidential nature observing that time and circumstances must point out the propriety or impropriety of communicating such letters permit me to inquire whether when there is an impropriety in communicating it is only applicable with respect to the parties who are the subjects of them—one might be led to imagine this to be the case from your having admitted others into the secret of your confidential correspondence at the same time that you thought it ineligible it should be trusted to those officers whose actions underwent its scrutiny your not knowing whether the letter under consideration came to me from a member of congress or from an officer plainly indicates that you originally communicated it to at least one of that honorable body and i learn from general conway that before his late arrival at york town it had been committed to the perusal of several of its members and was afterwards shown by himself to three more it is somewhat difficult to conceive a reason founded in generosity for imparting the free and confidential strictures of that ingenious censor on the operations of the army under my command to a member of congress but perhaps time and circumstances pointed it out—it must indeed be acknowledged that the faults of very respectable     officers not less injurious for being the result of inexperience were not improper topics to engage the attention of members of congress it is however greatly to be lamented that this adept in military science did not employ his abilities in the progress of the campaign in pointing out those wise measures which were calculated to give us that degree of success we might reasonably expect the united states have lost much from that unseasonable diffidence which prevented his embracing the numerous opportunities he had in council of displaying those rich treasures of knowledge and experience he has since so freely laid open to you—i will not do him the injustice to impute the penurious reserve which ever appeared in him upon such occasions to any other cause than an excess of modesty neither will i suppose he possesses no other merit than of that after kind of sagacity which qualifies a man better for profound discoveries of errors that have been committed and advantages that have been lost than for the exercise of that foresight and provident discernment which enable him to avoid the one and anticipate the other—but willing as i am to subscribe to all his pretensions and to believe that his remarks on the operations of the campaign were very judicious and that he has sagaciously descanted on many things that might have been done i can not help being a little sceptical as to his ability to have found out the means of accomplishing them or to prove the sufficiency of those in our possession these minutiæ i suspect he did not think worth his     attention particularly as they might not be within the compass of his views— notwithstanding the hopeful presages you are pleased to figure to yourself of general conways firm and constant friendship to america i cannot persuade myself to retract the prediction concerning him which you so emphatically wish had not been inserted in my last a better acquaintance with him than i have reason to think you have had from what you say and a concurrence of circumstances oblige me to give him but little credit for the qualifications of his heart of which at least i beg leave to assume the privilege of being a tolerable judge were it necessary more instances than one might be adduced from his behavior and conversation to manifest that he is capable of all the malignity of detraction and all the meanessess of intrigue to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity or to answer the purposes of personal aggrandizement and promote the interests of faction i am c  george washington   february      valley forge brigadiergeneral wayne to brigadiergeneral wayne instructions headquarters valley forge   february      the good people of the state of pennsylvania living in the vicinity of philadelphia and near the delaware river having suffered    much by the enemys carrying off their property without allowing them any compensation thereby distressing the inhabitants supplying their own army and enabling them to protract the cruel and unjust war that they are now waging against these states and whereas by recent intelligence i have reason to expect that they intend making another grand forage into this country it is of the utmost consequence that the horses cattle sheep and provender within fifteen miles west from the river delaware between the schuylkill and the brandywine be immediately removed to prevent the enemy from receiving any benefit therefrom as well as to supply the present exigencies of the american army i do therefore authorize empower and command you forthwith to take carry off and secure all such horses as are suitable for cavalry or for draft and all cattle and sheep fit for slaughter together with every kind of forage for the use of this army that may be found in the possession of any of the inhabitants within the aforesaid limits causing certificates to be given to each person for the number value and quantity of the horses sheep cattle and provender so taken notice will be given to the holders of such certificates by the commissary and quartermastergeneral when and where they may apply for payment that they may not be disappointed in calling for their money all officers civil and military commissaries and quartermasters are hereby ordered to obey aid and assist you in this necessary business all the provender on the islands between philadelphia and chester which may be difficult of access or too hazardous to attempt carrying off you will immediately cause to be destroyed giving direction to the officer or officers to whom this duty is assigned to take an account of the quantity together with the owners names as far as the nature of the service will admit i am sir c      george washington  0 february      sir william howe to sir william howe headquarters  0 february      sir i received yesterday the favor of your letter of the  th instant  in answer to whatever it contains concerning   0 general burgoynes army and the measures adopted relative to it i have only to inform you that this is a matter in which i have never had the least direction it lies wholly with congress and the proposals you make on this head must be submitted to them i have accordingly transmitted a copy of your letter and shall be ready to forward to you any resolution they may take in consequence i shall omit animadverting on your observations with regard to the allowance and treatment to prisoners in your hands it is a subject which has been     fully discussed in the progress of our correspondence and the necessity of a further investigation is superseded by your now meeting me on the ground i have so long wished the powers under which i act are entirely derived from congress and must of course be subject to such modifications as they may think proper according to circumstances to prescribe but holding myself fully authorized by their instructions and intentions to avail myself of the reasonable terms you are at this time willing to adopt for the mutual relief of prisoners i shall explicitly close with your propositions to the following effect—that an exchange of all prisoners now in our possession officer for officer soldier for soldier and citizen for citizen so far as number and rank will apply be carried into execution as expeditiously as the nature of the case will admit and without regard to any controverted point which might prove an impediment to so desirable an end and here as i may not clearly understand your meaning when you say—in the mean time i shall wait the arrival of the british officers whom you have released upon their paroles and shall without delay send an equal number to you in return—i take occasion to request that you will be pleased to favor me with an explanation whether you intend to consider such officers on both sides as still continuing under the obligation of a parole or as absolutely exchanged in pursuance of the general cartel  i see no reason why an effectual     exchange should not at once operate with respect to them i also agree that two commissioners from me shall meet a like number from you on the  0th day of march in germantown at the king of prussia tavern at eleven in the forenoon to adjust upon equitable terms the difference you mention and such other matters as they may be severally empowered to determine with respect to a general settlement of accounts as it comprehends points with which i have no authority to interfere it is not in my power to concur in the measure you suggest for that purpose i am under the necessity of referring it to the decision of congress considering a general exchange as finally agreed on between us i shall without delay order the prisoners in our hands to places in the vicinity of your different posts as their respective situations may render most convenient and shall give you notice as they arrive that you may return a number equal to those sent in from time to time i am with due respect sir c george washington    february      valley forge majorgeneral mcdougall to majorgeneral mcdougall head quarters valley forge    february      dear sir the congress so long ago as the  0th november last directed me to have an inquiry into the causes     of the losses of fort mifflin upon the delaware and fort montgomery upon hudsons river the peculiar situation of the army has hindered me from attending to this matter before this time as most of the principal officers up the north river were immediately concerned in the defence of fort montgomery or eventually so by being very near it there cannot in my opinion be a sufficient number proper to compose a court found upon the spot it is therefore my intention to send three at least from this army and it is my wish that you should be one and act as president upon the occasion if your health will permit you to attend i shall therefore be glad to hear from you upon the subject that i may either proceed to fill up the commission for you or appoint another if your health should not be sufficiently established to go thro the business it is my wish to have this inquiry carried on not only in obedience to the resolve of congress but for other reasons which i need not explain to you it is besides impatiently expected by the gentlemen in the state of new york who are in hopes that some beneficial consequences will result from it you are particularly well acquainted with many circumstances relating to the situation of matters in that quarter and therefore more capable of conducting the enquiry than any other officer i shall only add one reason more to induce you to strain a point upon this occasion which is that the scarcity of general officers is already so great that supposing one as proper as yourself i could not spare him without injury to the     service i shall expect an answer by return of the express  i am c george washington    february      majorgeneral gates to majorgeneral gates headquarters    february      sir i am favored with yours of the  th instant enclosing the proceedings of a general courtmartial held by your order it is a defect in our martial law from which we often find great inconvenience that the power of appointing general courtsmartial is too limited i do not find it can be legally exercised by any officer except the commanderinchief or the commanding general in any particular state this circumstance would make it improper for me to ratify the sentence against murray did the nature of his crime require it and if it was thought inexpedient to let him pass unpunished i should be under the necessity of ordering another court for his trial but as there are some mitigating considerations which you mention it may perhaps be as well to remit the present sentence without proceeding any further in the affair i leave it to your judgment either with my approbation to do this or to make use of the enclosed order to bring the offender to a second trial     had the constitution of the court been entirely regular i do not conceive i could with propriety alter the capital punishment into a corporal one the right of mitigating only extends in my opinion to lessening the degree of punishment in the same species prescribed and does not imply any authority to change the nature or quality of it altogether i am sir c  george washington    february      valley forge governor livingston to governor livingston valley forge    february      sir i do myself the honor of transmitting you a letter from the committee of congress now here these gentlemen have represented the distress of the army for want of provision so fully and in so just a light that i shall forbear to trouble you with further observations upon the subject—i shall only observe     that if the picture they have drawn is imperfect it is because the colourings are not sufficiently strong it does not exceed our real situation from your real and earnest wishes to promote the service i am firmly convinced we shall have every relief in your power to give i should have troubled you before on this interesting and alarming business—had i not supposed congress the proper body to have been informed and that the means of relief should be under their direction not to mention our distresses the last campaign and that we were supplied from hand to mouth and frequently not at all from the day mr trumbull left commissary department this is the second time in the course of the present year that we have been on the point of a dissolution and i know not whether the melancholy event may not take place the subject of horses too is so fully explained by the committee that it is needless for me to enlarge on that head the advantages derived from a respectable cavalry will strike you at once and i have the most entire confidence that you will with pleasure afford any aid in your power to promote our views in this instance i have c george washington    february      valley forge richard henry lee to richard henry lee valley forge    february      dear sir your letter of the  d ultimo from chantilly enclosing lieutenantcolonel frazers orders for the     management of the grenadiers and lightinfantry in an action and upon a march came to my hands in the course of last month and merits my thanks as it may be of use to such corps one of which consisting of lightinfantry we are now forming the enemy are governed by no principles that ought to actuate honest men no wonder then that forgery should be amongst their other crimes i have seen a letter published in a handbill at new york and extracts from it republished in a philadelphia paper said to be from me to mrs washington not one word of which did i ever write those contained in the pamphlet you speak of are i presume equally genuine and perhaps written by the same author  i     should be glad however to see and examine the texture of them if a favorable opportunity to send them should present lord cornwallis has certainly embarked for england but with what view is not so easy to determine he was eyewitness a few days before his departure to a scene not a little disgraceful to the pride of british valor in their manœuvre to chesnut hill and precipitate return after boasting their intentions of driving us beyond the mountains i am very glad to find that the assembly of virginia have taken matters up so spiritedly but wish instead of attempting to raise so many volunteers they had resolved at all adventures to complete their regiments by drafting if all the states would do this and fall upon ways and means to supply their troops with comfortable clothing upon moderate terms and congress would make the commissions of officers of some value to them every thing would probably go well making at the same time some reform in the different departments of the army nothing standing in greater need of it than the quartermasters and commissaries as no army ever suffered more by their neglect the consequences of this neglect are much to be dreaded i am dear sir your most obedient servant     george washington    february      valley forge george clinton to governor george clinton headquarters valley forge    february      dear sir it is with great reluctance i trouble you on a subject which does not properly fall within your province but it is a subject that occasions me more distress than i have felt since the commencement of the war and which loudly demands the most zealous exertions of every person of weight and authority who is interested in the success of our affairs i mean the present dreadful situation of the army for want of provisions and the miserable prospects before us with respect to futurity it is more alarming than you will probably conceive for to form a just idea it were necessary to be on the spot for some days past there has been little less than a famine in camp a part of the army has been a week without any kind of flesh and the rest three or four days naked and starving as they are we cannot enough admire the incomparable patience and fidelity of the soldiery that they have not been ere this excited by their suffering to a general mutiny and dispersion strong symptoms however of discontent have appeared in particular instances and nothing but the most active efforts everywhere can long avert so shocking a catastrophe our present sufferings are not all there is no foundation laid for any adequate relief hereafter all the magazines provided in the states of new jersey pennsylvania delaware and maryland and   0 all the immediate additional supplies they seem capable of affording will not be sufficient to support the army more than a month longer if so long very little has been done to the eastward and as little to the southward and whatever we have a right to expect from those quarters must necessarily be very remote and is indeed more precarious than could be wished when the forementioned supplies are exhausted what a terrible crisis must ensue unless all the energy of the continent shall be exerted to provide a timely remedy impressed with this idea i am on my part putting every engine at work that i can possibly think of to prevent the fatal consequences we have so great reason to apprehend i am calling upon all those whose stations and influence enable them to contribute their aid upon so important an occasion and from your well known zeal i expect every thing within the compass of your power and that the abilities and resources of the state over which you preside will admit i am sensible of the disadvantages it labors under from having been so long the scene of war and that it must be exceedingly drained by the great demands to which it has been subject but though you may not be able to contribute materially to our relief you can perhaps do something towards it and any assistance however trifling in itself will be of great moment at so critical a juncture and will conduce to the keeping of the army together till the commissarys department can be put upon a better footing and effectual measures     concerted to secure a permanent and competent supply what methods you can take you will be the best judge of but if you can devise any means to procure a quantity of cattle or other kind of flesh for the use of this army to be at camp in the course of a month you will render a most essential service to the common cause i have the honor to be c      george washington    february      valley forge an address to the inhabitants of new jersey pennsylvania delaware maryland and virginia  valley forge    february      friends countrymen and fellow citizens after three campaigns during which the brave subjects of these states have contended not unsuccessfully with one of the most powerful kingdoms upon earth we now find ourselves at least upon a level with our opponents and there is the best reason to believe that efforts adequate to the abilities of this country would enable us speedily to conclude the war and to secure the invaluable blessings of peace liberty and safety with this view it is in contemplation at the opening of the next campaign to assemble a force sufficient not barely to cover the country from a repetition of those depredations which it hath already suffered but also to operate offensively and to strike some decisive blow in the prosecution of this object it is to be feared that so large an army may suffer for the want of provisions the distance between this and the eastern states whence considerable supplies of flesh have been hitherto drawn will necessarily render those supplies extremely precarious and unless the virtuous yeomanry of the states of new jersey pennsylvania maryland and virginia     will exert themselves to prepare cattle for the use of the army during the months of may june and july next great difficulties may arise in the course of the campaign it is therefore recommended to the inhabitants of those states to put up and feed immediately as many of their stock cattle as they can spare so as that they may be driven to this army within that period a bountiful price will be given and the proprietors may assure themselves that they will render a most essential service to the illustrious cause of their country and contribute in a great degree to shorten this bloody contest but should there be any so insensible to the common interest as not to exert themselves upon these generous principles the private interest of those whose situation makes them liable to become immediate subjects to the enemys incursions should prompt them at least to a measure which is calculated to save their property from plunder their families from insult and their own persons from abuse hopeless confinement or perhaps a violent death george washington    feby      valley forge william duer to william duer headquarters valley forge    feby      sir i am favored with yours of the   th instant communicating the intelligence you had received respecting the scheme of investing this camp and cutting off its supplies your being unacquainted with our present position and the circumstance you mention of an intimation from general sinclair of the possibility of such an event very naturally occasioned biddles insinuation to make the impression it did on your mind but it is a project which appears to me totally impracticable with the enemys present force or even with one much greater and i believe the     experiment will hardly be made the extensive line or rather circle they must occupy to keep up the communication from post to post necessary to intercept our intercourse with the country would be very little able to defend themselves at any given point and would expose them to ruin in case of an attack from us i am inclined to believe you must be under some misapprehension with respect to general sinclairs observation and that he alluded to something else than an investiture i am c p s we have one bridge nearly completed defects in the quarter masters department have delayed it hitherto      george washington    february      valley forge to the president of congress headquarters valley forge    february      sir i am now to acknowledge the honor of your several favors of the   th   th and   st instant which with their respective inclosures have been duly received in compliance with the resolution of congress of the  th instant transmitted in your letter of the  th i was about to take measures for appointing a courtmartial and bringing on the trials which they direct but on recurring to the papers you were pleased to send me i do not find that the committee have made any particular charges against the officers who are to be the subjects of trial it was probably the intention of congress that these charges should be laid by me but as i might err in doing it and not fully correspond with their views in the matter especially as it would require considerable time and thought to make myself sufficiently acquainted with it from the papers collected i should think it would be most advisable     for congress to state explictly the charges they wish to have exhibited against the officers respectively and then the business may be proceeded on with propriety besides the above reasons which operate generally against my exhibiting the charges in the particular instance of general schuyler it is impossible for me to do it as i do not know what instructions he had received from congress from time to time as to the objects of his command nor precisely what these were these appear to me necessary to be known and essential to carrying on a prosecution against him when congress shall have arranged these points and are pleased to honor me with them i will pursue the speediest measures to bring on the trials the sooner this can be done the better as some of the parties are extremely anxious and strongly importune it  baron steuben has arrived at camp he appears to be much of a gentleman and as far as i have had an opportunity of judging a man of military knowledge and acquainted with the world      the enclosed extract of a letter from general putnam will show how great the distresses are in that quarter for want of money he has described their necessities so fully that it is unnecessary for me to add upon the subject i shall only observe that his account is more than justified by many other letters and that i am persuaded the earliest possible supply will be forwarded and that the very important and interesting works carrying on there may not be the least retarded  i am under some embarrassments respecting the thirteenth virginia regiment it was raised on the west side of the allegany and towards pittsburg with assurances from the officers it is said that the men would not be drawn from that quarter this circumstance added to the disturbances by the indians and the exposed situation of their families has been the     cause of great desertions and is at present the source of much uneasiness and the more so as part of the regiment was never marched from thence i think the whole should be united either here or there and wish congress to direct me upon the subject at the same time that their case if truly represented seems to be hard and to merit the indulgence they claim i would observe that the twelfth regiment from the western parts of the same state and the eighth and twelfth pennsylvania from the frontier counties of this have similar pretensions and might become uneasy and apply for a like indulgence agreeable to the directions of congress i shall send a majorgeneral to rhode island though the number of officers here of this rank from one cause and another is greatly reduced and more so than it ought to be in point of policy  our loss of matrosses     the last campaign in killed and wounded was considerable and it has not been a little increased this winter by desertions from colonel procters corps from these circumstances we are very weak in this line and i request that congress will be pleased to order colonel harrisons regiment of artillery to march from virginia as early as the roads will admit and join this army i have the honor to be c  george washington   march      valley forge bryan fairfax to bryan fairfax  valley forge   march      dear sir your favor of the  th of december came safe to my hands after a considerable delay on its passage the sentiments you have expressed to me in this   0 letter are highly flattering meriting my warmest acknowledgments as i have too good an opinion of your sincerity and candor to believe that you are capable of unmeaning professions and speaking a language foreign to your heart the friendship which i ever professed and felt for you met with no diminution from the difference in our political sentiments i know the rectitude of my own intentions and believing in the sincerity of yours lamented though i did not condemn your renunciation of the creed i had adopted nor do i think any person or power ought to do it whilst your conduct is not opposed to the general interest of the people and the measures they are pursuing the latter that is our actions depending upon ourselves may be controlled while the powers of thinking originating in higher causes cannot always be moulded to our wishes the determinations of providence are always wise often inscrutable and though its decrees appear to bear hard upon us at times is nevertheless meant for gracious purposes in this light i cannot help viewing your late disappointment for if you had been permitted to have gone to england unrestrained even by the rigid oaths which are administered on those occasions your feelings as a husband parent c must have been considerably wounded in the prospect of a long perhaps lasting separation from your nearest relatives what then must they have been if the obligation of an oath had left you without a will your hope of being instrumental in restoring peace would prove as unsubstantial as mist     before the noondays sun and would as soon dispel for believe me sir great britain understood herself perfectly well in this dispute but did not comprehend america she meant as lord camden in his late speech in parliament clearly and explicitly declared to drive america into rebellion that her own purposes might be more fully answered by it but take this along with it that this plan originated in a firm belief founded on misinformation that no effectual opposition would or could be made they little dreamt of what has happened and are disappointed in their views  does not every act of administration from the tea act to the present session of parliament declare this in plain and selfevident characters had the commissioners any power to treat with america if they meant peace would lord howe have been detained in england five months after passing the     act would the powers of these commissioners have been confined to mere acts of grace upon condition of absolute submission no surely no they meant to drive us into what they termed rebellion that they might be furnished with a pretext to disarm and then strip us of the rights and privileges of englishmen and citizens if they were actuated by the principles of justice why did they refuse indignantly to accede to the terms which were humbly supplicated before hostilities commenced and this country deluged in blood and now make their principal officers and even the commissioners themselves say that these terms are just and reasonable nay that more will be granted than we have yet asked if we will relinquish our claim to independency what name does such conduct as this deserve and what punishment is there in store for the men who have distressed millions involved thousands in ruin and plunged numberless families in inextricable woe could that which is just and reasonable now have been unjust four years ago if not upon what principles i say does administration act they must either be wantonly wicked and cruel or which is only another mode of describing the same thing under false colors are now endeavoring to deceive the great body of the people by industriously propagating a belief that great britain is willing to offer any and that we will accept of no terms thereby hoping to poison and disaffect the minds of those who wish for peace and create feuds and dissensions among ourselves in a word having     less dependence now in their arms than their arts they are practising such low and dirty tricks that men of sentiment and honor must blush at their villainy among other manœuvres in this way they are counterfeiting letters and publishing them as intercepted ones of mine to prove that i am an enemy to the present measures and have been led into them step by step still hoping that congress would recede from their present claims i am dear sir your most obedient and affectionate c      george washington   march      valley forge thomas wharton to thomas wharton president of pennsylvania valley forge   march      sir there is nothing i have more at heart than to discharge the great duties incumbent on me with the strictest attention to the ease and convenience of the people every instance therefore of hardship or oppression exercised by the officers of any department under my immediate control gives me the most sensible concern and should be immediately punished if complaints were properly made and supported that there has been some foundation for such complaints and that they have affected the service i cannot doubt from the great delay and backwardness of the people in forwarding supplies and affording the means of transportation until the late wagon law of this state was passed there being no means of procuring the service of the inhabitants but by military compulsion quartermasters and commissaries from the necessity of the case seem to have been justified in impressing though in many instances perhaps it has been done with circumstances of terror and hardship which they ought to have avoided but when the     legislature had by law made an arrangement and put this important service under the care of their own officers it was my full determination by every means in my power to support the law that had passed and avail myself of the resources of the state in the mode pointed out under a full confidence that the wisdom and forecast which had marked out such a plan would be accompanied with proportionate zeal and efficacy to carry it into execution perhaps sir i am not sufficiently informed to judge properly where the present defect lays and therefore avoid imputing blame to any but i would wish you and the gentlemen in authority with you to be assured that nothing would give me more satisfaction than to see the powers of the government so effectual for the supply and accommodation of the army as to take away not only the necessity but even pretence of using any other than the ordinary civil authority give me leave further to remark that the army seems to have a peculiar claim to the exertions of the gentlemen of this state to make its present situation as convenient as possible as it was greatly owing to their apprehensions and anxieties expressed in a memorial to congress that the present position was had where with unparalleled patience they have gone through a severe and inclement winter unprovided with any of those conveniences and comforts which are usually the soldiers lot after the dutys of the field are over    the necessities of the service sir are great the duty required i acknowledge is burthensome and     difficult at this inclement season but it cannot be dispensed with the army and the country have a mutual dependence upon each other and it is of the last importance that their several duties should be so regulated and enforced as to produce not only the greatest harmony and good understanding but the truest happiness and comfort to each depending therefore upon a due and early attention to this important business and promising myself no small relief from our present difficulties i remain sir with due respect and regard yours c    george washington  th day of march      george baylor to colonel george baylor instructions it being adjudged advisable to augment the cavalry in continental service by an addition of one lieut one sergeant one corporal and twenty two privates to each troop and that the states of virginia and north carolina should furnish six hundred horses for this purpose you will receive from the comee of congress sitting at moor hall direction respecting the means to obtain these with which you will repair to virginia and as soon as possible consult colonel bland who is requested by letter to aid you in this business and to whom you are to participate the means and furnish a copy of these instructions on the most effectual mode of accomplishing this purchase with œconomy and dispatch in purchasing these horses you are not restricted to price on the one hand nor by any means to launch into acts of extravagence on the other—good horses are wanting and for such the customary prices must be given take none less than a quarter blooded nor under fourteen and a half hands high sound and clean made they are not to exceed twelve years old nor be under five this spring any kind of bays would be preferred     but as the time is short in which they must be procured and the service without them will suffer you must not stand upon color pacing horses stone horses and mares must be avoided colo bland and yourself will figure upon proper places of rendezvous for the horses when purchased where provision is to be laid in for their support and where every proper means is to be used for the exercise and training of them you will so concert matters as not to interfere with each other thereby enhancing the prices of horses and rendering the purchase more difficult and expensive you will each of you use your best endeavors to obtain saddles and other accoutrements for the number of horse aforementioned and procure also as many swords and pistols as you can—to enable colonel bland to perform his part of this business you are as before directed to furnish him with the money and certificates to add anything with a view of impressing you with an idea of the great importance of this business and the dispatch necessary in the execution is i am persuaded totally useless your own observation and judgment will point this out in the fullest and clearest manner but i am to desire that both you and colo bland will give me early and regular information of your proceedings and prospects given under my hand at head quarters valley forge this  th day of march      george washington   march      valley forge to the president of congress valley forge   march      sir i take the liberty of transmitting to you copies of three letters from general howe of the   th and   st ultimo and of the  d instant with their enclosures      the unhappy violation of the flag of truce has laid us under no small embarrassments and has afforded the enemy good grounds for complaint and triumph at the same time this however is the natural consequence and must ever be the case where different powers counteract each other in matters of the most delicate importance there are some circumstances attending this affair which it may possibly be in the power of congress to throw light upon if they can i shall be obliged by their assistance march  th—in consequence of the letters which have lately passed between general howe and myself particularly those of the  th and  0th ultimo copies of which i had the honor to transmit to you in mine of the  th continued to the   th i was about to send commissioners to meet those appointed by general howe for adjusting the disputed points between us carrying into execution an exchange of prisoners and improving the old cartel as far as it might be practicable for their better accommodation in future this meeting was to be on the  0th instant but yesterday morning dunlaps paper of the  th being put into my hands i found that a resolution had been made on the   th of february calling for all accounts against prisoners in our hands and declaring that no exchange should take place till the balance due thereon to the united states is discharged some of the states are not required to exhibit their claims till the  st of june the time that would be taken to adjust them and make a delivery of the prisoners would more than exhaust all the ensuing summer     this resolution i cannot consider as an intended infraction of my engagements with general howe yet its operation is diametrically opposite both to the spirit and letter of the propositions made on my part and acceded to on his i supposed myself fully authorized by the instructions and intentions of congress to act as i did and i now conceive that the public as well as my own personal honor and faith are pledged for the performance by the direction of congress i in the first instance stipulated with general howe an exchange of prisoners officer for officer of equal rank soldier for soldier and citizen for citizen this agreement they have ever approved and repeatedly declared their willingness to carry into execution their resolution of the   th of march last empowered me on condition of general lee being declared exchangeable not only to proceed to the exchange of prisoners according to the principles and regulations of the cartel before agreed on but also to enter into such further principles and regulations as should appear to me most proper and advantageous a subsequent resolution of the  th of june holds forth the same language sanctions my conduct and reasonings in the negotiations about that time on the subject and directs an adherence to them no event has occurred since that period by which i could conclude there was any alteration in the views of congress so far from it that all my late letters breathing the same spirit with the former and pointedly signifying my wish to bring about a general exchange if not with  00 an express at least met with a tacit approbation general howe at length by profession if not in reality is willing to perform the agreement on the conditions required by me and confirmed by them it may be said that with whatever powers i was originally vested to negotiate an exchange the resolution of the   th of december last was an abridgment of them so far as to annex a new condition the settlement and payment of accounts previous to its taking place i had no conception of this being the case in the present instance however the letter may warrant the construction besides the common principle of preventing the inconveniences necessarily resulting from allowing the enemy to make their payments in paper currency i had reason to imagine that general burgoynes army was more particularly the object of the concluding clause this interpretation i the more readily adopted for exclusive of the affairs of that army i verily believed that from the confused defective state of our accounts relating to prisoners there would be a considerable balance in favor of mr howe nor was the situation of our accounts the only reason for this belief the prisoners in our hands especially those westward of the delaware as i am informed have been in a great measure supported by their own labor and at the expense of the enemy who have had agents constantly among us if this is the case the reason of the resolve not applying the effect ought not of course but perhaps it may be thought contrary to our interest to go into an exchange as the enemy would  0  derive more immediate advantage from it than we should this i shall not deny but it appeared to me that on principles of genuine extensive policy independent of the considerations of compassion and justice we were under an obligation not to elude it i have the best evidence that an event of this kind is the general wish of the country i know it to be the wish of the army and no one can doubt that it is the ardent wish of the unhappy sufferers themselves we need only consult the tide of humanity and the sympathies natural to those connected by the cement of blood interest and a common dread of evil to be convinced that the prevailing current of sentiment demands an exchange if the country the army and even the prisoners themselves had a precise idea of our circumstances and could be fully sensible of the disadvantages that might attend the giving our enemy a considerable reinforcement without having an equivalent they might perhaps be willing to make a sacrifice of their feelings to the motives of policy but they have not this knowledge and cannot be entrusted with it and their reasonings of necessity will be governed by what they feel were an opinion once to be established and the enemy and their emissaries know very well how to inculcate it if they are furnished with a plausible pretext that we designedly avoided an exchange it would be a cause of dissatisfaction and disgust to the country and to the army of resentment and desperation to our captive officers and soldiers to say nothing of the importance of not hazarding our  0  national character but upon the most solid grounds especially in our embryo state from the influence it may have on our affairs abroad it may not be a little dangerous to beget in the minds of our own countrymen a suspicion that we do not pay the strictest observance to the maxims of honor and good faith it is prudent to use the greatest caution not to shock the notions of general justice and humanity universal among mankind as well in a public as a private view in a business on the side of which the passions are so much concerned as in the present men would be readily disposed to believe the worst and cherish the most unfavorable conclusions were the letters that have passed between general howe and myself from first to last and the procedings of congress on the same subject to be published with proper comments it is much to be feared if the exchange should be deferred till the terms of the last resolve were fulfilled that it would be difficult to prevent our being generally accused of a breach of good faith perhaps it might be said that while the enemy refused us justice we fondly embraced the opportunity to be loud persevering incessant in our claims but the moment they were willing to render it we receded from ourselves and started new difficulties this i say might be the reasoning of speculative minds and they might consider all our professions as mere professions or at best that interest and policy were to be the only arbiters of their validity imputations of this nature would have a tendency  0  to unnerve our operations by diminishing that respect and confidence which are essential to be placed in those who are at the head of affairs either in the civil or military line this added to the prospect of hopeless captivity would be a great discouragement to the service the ill consequences of both would be immense by increasing the causes of discontent in the army which are already too numerous and many of which are in a great measure unavoidable by fortifying that unwillingness which already appears too great towards entering into the service and of course impeding the progress both of drafting and recruiting by dejecting the courage of the soldiery from an apprehension of the horrors of captivity and finally by reducing those whose lot it is to drink the bitter cup to a despair which can only find relief by renouncing their attachments and engaging with their captors these effects have already been experienced in part from the obstacles that have lain in the way of exchanges but if these obstacles were once to seem the result of system they would become tenfold nothing has operated more disagreeably upon the minds of the militia than the fear of captivity on the footing on which it has hitherto stood what would be their reasonings if it should be thought to stand upon a worse if a present temporary interest is to be a ruling principle it is easy to prove that an exchange can never take place the constitution of our army in respect to the term of service for which our men engage and the dependence we are obliged to place on  0  the militia must for ever operate against us in exchanges and forbid an equality of advantages should it be said there are times when it might be peculiarly unequal and injurious and that the present is such on account of the weak condition of our army i answer that the delay necessarily involved in the previous negotiation on the subject in delivering the prisoners from time to time in small numbers and receiving others in their stead and the mode of delivery at different places will nearly bring the matter to the point we could wish and give us leisure to reinforce this army if it is to be done at all so as to obviate in a great measure the ill consequences apprehended but if the argument of interest on a partial scale be pursued as far as it will go not only the general consideration thrown out above but special ones apposite to every situation will present themselves that we ought not to exchange now we ought not because our army is weak when the season is more advanced and it is time for the campaign to open we ought not because our army may be strong and it will be our business to avail ourselves of our own strength and the enemys weakness to strike some decisive blow if they by the protection of their shipping and impregnable works should be able to baffle our attempts till the period of reinforcements from europe arrive it will surely then not be our interest to add numbers and strength to an enemy already sufficiently numerous and strong thus by a parity of reasoning the golden era will never come which is to relieve the  0  miseries of captivity our service must become odious those who are out of it will endeavor to keep so and those who are in it will wish to get out of it every prisoner the enemy makes will be his soldier rather than submit to a rigorous and despairing confinement if we do not seize the present propitious moment when the necessities of the enemy press them to reasonable terms to form and establish a liberal cartel it is not impossible in the vicissitudes and reverses of war that a time may come when we should wish we had embraced it and interest may strongly impel the enemy to decline it except on the most unequal conditions true policy as well as good faith in my opinion binds us to improve the occasion there are however some ambiguities in general howes conduct which require explanation and ought to put us upon our guard i determined to make the affair of citizens namely to procure an exemption from captivity for them if possible or if not since it cannot now be demanded as a matter of right to fix their exchangeability upon the easiest and most unequivocal foundation an indispensable preliminary to any further procedure and at the same time to secure the exchange of general lee and all other officers who have been the particular objects of exception the interview intended between general howes commissioners and those on our part on the  0th instant is now postponed  i cannot doubt that congress  0  in preservation of the public faith and my personal honor will remove all impediments that now oppose themselves to my engagements and that they will authorize me through commissioners appointed for the purpose to negotiate a more extensive and competent cartel upon such principles as may appear advantageous and founded in necessity and resolutions heretofore to the contrary notwithstanding and i must request that they will favor me with their answer by the earliest opportunity the work from its nature will be difficult two parties are concerned whose interests are more than opposite in a common view we shall endeavor to act for the best and to promote the public service as far as possible though we may not be able to answer the expectations of all but it should be remembered that although general howes want of men affords a prospect of favorable terms yet he will not be disposed to sacrifice to it all considerations of general advantage in a contract of such a nature and it is not even to be hoped that it can take place except on principles of mutual benefit i persuade myself that the freedom i have taken in delivering my sentiments so fully upon this occasion will readily be excused as it proceeds from a desire to place the motives of my  0  conduct in a just point of view and from an opinion of duty that led me to a free discussion of a subject which considered in all its lights will appear to comprehend consequences of the first delicacy and magnitude i have the honor to be c  george washington   march      valley forge brigadiergeneral parsons to brigadiergeneral

scheme is  0  practicable at all may add not a little to the success namely to let the officers and soldiers employed in the enterprise be dressed in red and much in the taste of the british soldiery webbs regiment will afford these dresses and it might not be amiss to know certainly the number of some regiment that is quartered in the city under some circumstances this knowledge may avail them especially if the number on their own buttons should correspond thereto i am c p s the official papers would be a vast acquisition and might without much difficulty accompany the person george washington   march      copy of the letter referred to above   march      dear sir i learn from undoubted authority that general clinton quarters in captain kennedys house in the city of new york which you know is near fort george and by the late fire stands in a  0  manner alone what guards may be at or near his quarters i cannot with precision say and therefore shall not add any thing on this score lest it should prove a misinformation but i think it one of the most practicable and surely it will be among the most desirable and honorable things imaginable to take him prisoner this house lying close by the water and a retired way through a back yard or garden leading into it what if you have whaleboats   or  0 but want of secrecy can prevent the execution in the hands of an enterprising party the embarkation might even be and this i should think best at kings ferry on the first of the ebb and early in the evening six or eight hours with change of hands would row the boats under the west shore and very secretly to the city and the floodtide will hoist them back again or a party of horse might meet them at fort lee i had like not to have mentioned that no ship of war is in the north river was not at least ten days ago nor within four hundred yards of the point all being in the east river i shall add no more this is dropped as a hint to be improved upon or rejected as circumstances point out and justify i am c    0 george washington  0 march      marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette headquarters  0 march      my dear marquis i have had the pleasure of receiving your two favors of the   th and   d of february and hasten to dispel those fears respecting your reputation which are excited only by an uncommon degree of sensibility you seem to apprehend that censure proportioned to the disappointed expectations of the world will fall on you in consequence of the failure of the canadian expedition but in the first place it will be no disadvantage to you to have it known in europe that you had received so manifest a proof of the good opinion and confidence of congress as an important detached command and i am persuaded that every one will applaud your prudence in renouncing a project in pursuing which you would vainly have attempted physical impossibilities indeed unless you can be chargeable with the invariable effects of natural causes and be arraigned for not suspending the course of the seasons to accommodate your march over the lake the most prone to slander can have nothing to found blame upon however sensible your ardor for glory may make you feel this disappointment you may be assured that your character stands as fair as ever it did and that no new enterprise is necessary to wipe off this imaginary stain the expedition which you hint at i     think unadvisable in our present circumstances  any thing in the way of a formal attack which would necessarily be announced to the enemy by preparatory measures would not be likely to succeed if a stroke is meditated in that quarter it must be effected by troops stationed at a proper distance for availing themselves of the first favorable opportunity offered by the enemy and success would principally depend upon the suddenness of the attempt this therefore must rather be the effect of time and chance than premeditation you undoubtedly have determined judiciously in waiting the further orders of congress whether they allow me the pleasure of seeing you shortly or destine you to a longer absence you may assure yourself of the sincere good wishes of dear sir c p s your directing payment of such debts as appear to be most pressing is certainly right there is not money enough to answer every demand and i wish your supplies of clothing had been better your ordering a large supply of provisions into fort schuyler was a very judicious measure and i thank you for it george washington    march      lieutenantgeneral burgoyne to lieutenantgeneral burgoyne headquarters    march      sir i was only two days since honored with your very obliging letter of the   th of february your indulgent opinion of my character and the polite terms in which you are pleased to express it are peculiarly     flattering and i take pleasure in the opportunity you have afforded me of assuring you that far from suffering the views of national opposition to be embittered and debased by personal animosity i am ever ready to do justice to the merit of the man and soldier and to esteem where esteem is due however the idea of a public enemy may interpose you will not think it the language of unmeaning ceremony if i add that sentiments of personal respect in the present instance are reciprocal viewing you in the light of an officer contending against what i conceive to be the rights of my country the reverses of fortune you experienced in the field cannot be unacceptable to me but abstracted from considerations of national advantage i can sincerely sympathize with your feelings as a soldier the unavoidable difficulties of whose situation forbid his success and as a man whose lot combines the calamity of ill health the anxieties of captivity and the painful sensibility for a reputation exposed where he most values it to the assaults of malice and detraction as your aiddecamp went directly to congress the business of your letter to me had been decided before it came to hand i am happy that their cheerful acquiescence with your request prevented the necessity of my intervention and wishing you a safe and agreeable passage with a perfect restoration of your health i have the honor to be very respectfully c      george washington    march      george william fairfax to george william fairfax in england headquarters pennsylvania    march      dear sir immediately on my appointment to the command of the american army and arrival at cambridge near boston in the year      i informed you of the impracticability of my longer continuing to perform the duties of a friend by having an eye to the conduct of your collector and steward as my absence from virginia would not only withdraw every little attention i otherwise might have given to your business but involve my own in the same neglected predicament what use you may have made of the information i know not having heard nothing from you these four years nor been in virginia these last three i have heard and fear it is true that your seat belvoir is verging fast to destruction in what condition and under what management your estate in berkeley is i know not and equally ignorant am i respecting the conduct of peyton but earnestly advise you to empower some person to attend to these matters or the consequence is obvious lord fairfax as i have been told after having bowed down to the grave and in a manner shaken hands with death is perfectly restored and enjoys his usual good health and as much vigor as falls to the lot of ninety your sister washington  goes on     teeming but cannot produce a boy miss fairfax was upon the point of marriage in december last with a relation of mine a mr whiting but her ill health delayed it at that time and what has happened since i know not your nieces in alexandria are both married the elder to mr herbert the younger to mr harry whiting son of frank in berkeley mrs cary her son colonel cary mr nicholas mrs ambler  and their respective families were all well about two months ago miss cary is married to tom nelson second son to the secretary mrs washington who is now in quarters with me joins in most affectionate compliments to mrs fairfax and yourself with dear sir c george washington    march      valley forge to the president of congress valley forge    march      sir on sunday night i had the honor to receive your favors of the  st and  th instant with their inclosures i am happy to find that my past conduct respecting citizens in the correspondence between general howe and myself is approved by congress they may rest assured that their rights are strongly impressed on my mind and that in all my transactions every support in my power shall be given them i know their importance and in my expected negotiations with general howe if possible i will exempt citizens from captivity however i cannot hope to     effect it as i cannot demand it as a matter of right since congress themselves in their original resolve directing a proposition to be made for the exchange of prisoners mentioned that of citizens which implied a right of capturing them they may also be assured that general lee will not be forgotten he has all along been a principal object in dispute and so far from doing any thing injurious to him his right to be exchanged and releasement are intended to be placed upon the most explicit unambiguous footing indeed from the spirit of general howes letters collectively taken since his agreement to enlarge the officers on parole in the first instance and his extension of it in the last to an exchange though they are not free from ambiguities it may be inferred that on sending in lieutenantcolonel campbell and the hessian fieldofficers captured at trenton an exchange of officers will immediately commence it seems to be a point with him that it shall begin with them as they have been longest in captivity i have taken the liberty to enclose to you copies of three letters which have just passed between general howe and myself more particularly concerning general lee in which i have pushed matters respecting him as far as i thought it prudent at this time every precaution will certainly be used to prevent the enemy gaining any advantage in the exchange of prisoners      with great deference i would take the liberty to observe that congress seem to have carried the preamble of their resolve of the   th ultimo prohibiting the enlisting c of prisoners and deserters too far and through accident to have recited a fact that has never happened at least to my knowledge and which is injurious to us namely that prisoners had been enlisted by us if any have it is what i never knew however be this as it may if the resolution has not been published i could wish the preamble to be altered and to recite that experience c in deserters only the resolution itself may stand as it does comprehending a prohibition against the enlistment of both     my reason for troubling congress upon this occasion is we have always complained against general howe and still do for obliging or permitting the prisoners in his hands to enlist as an unwarrantable procedure and wholly repugnant to the spirit at least of the cartel this preamble seems to admit the practice on our part which would certainly justify it in him and is such evidence as must silence us in future should it stand and afford him an opportunity for recrimination though as i have suggested i believe no prisoners have ever been enlisted by us i am sure none have through compulsion  i have the pleasure to transmit you an extract of a letter from captn barry which will inform you of his successes the two ships he burnt after stripping them and he was obliged it seems two days after the capture to ground and abandon the schooner after a long and severe engagement with some of the enemys frigates  smaller armed vessels—it is said he saved her guns  most of her tackle i also take the liberty to lay before congress copies of letters from messrs champion wadsworth  reed from the uniformity of sentiment held forth by these gentlemen it is much to be feared the measures lately adopted by the commissioners at     new haven for regulating the prices of provision will have a disagreeable effect upon our supplies of meat—how far it may be practicable to suspend their operation for a time i cannot determine—but if it can be done it appears we should experience many advantages from it—it is a matter of great importance and as such is submitted to congress for their consideration if any thing can be done to procure supplies of provisions particularly of the salt kind i should suppose i am persuaded it will not be omitted i have the honor c george washington    march      valley forge robert r livingston to robert r livingston headquarters valley forge    march      dear sir i should have answered your favr of the   th january before this time had i not have been daily in hopes that i should have been able to have given you a satisfactory account of a change of men and measures in the north river department it has not been an easy matter to find a just pretence for removing an officer from his command where his misconduct rather appears to result from want of capacity than from any real intention of doing wrong and it is therefore as you observe to be lamented that he cannot see his own defects and make an honorable retreat from a station in which he only exposes his own weakness proper measures are taking to carry on the enquiry into the loss of fort montgomery agreeable to the     direction of congress and it is more than probable from what i have heard that the issue of that enquiry will afford just grounds for a removal of genl p—but whether it does or not the prejudices of all ranks in that quarter against him are so great that he must at all events be prevented from returning  i hope to introduce a gentleman in his place if the general course of service will admit of it who will be perfectly agreeable to the state and to the public in the mean time i trust that genl parsons will do every thing in his power to carry on the works which from his last accounts are in more forwardness than i expected i wish all the men on the upper part of the river had been drawn down to the highlands instead of   0 being kept to carry on an expedition in which i never was consulted but which i saw from the beginning could never succeed from a variety of reasons which it would be needless to give you or any man acquainted with the state of the country thro which it was to have passed those who were most sanguine i fancy now see the impracticability of it peekskill and the neighboring posts were by resolves of congress included in the northern department and the care of carrying on the works put under the direction of the officer commanding in that district genl gates being after the resolve called to the board of war he had no opportunity of doing any thing towards it whether there will be any alteration in the extent of the command this campaign i cannot tell but if it falls again into that department more immediately under my particular command you may depend that all the attention due to posts so important shall be paid to them i am george washington    march      valley forge philip schuyler james duane volkert p douw to philip schuyler james duane and volkert p douw commissioners of indian affairs valley forge    march      gentlemen you will perceive by the enclosed copy of a resolve of congress that i am empowered to employ a body of four hundred indians if they can be procured upon proper terms divesting them of the savage customs exercised in their wars against each other i think they may be made of excellent use as scouts and light troops mixed with our own parties i propose to raise about one half the number among the southern     and the remainder among the northern indians i have sent colonel nathaniel gist who is well acquainted with the cherokees and their allies to bring as many as he can from thence and i must depend upon you to employ suitable persons to procure the stipulated number or as near as may be from the northern tribes the terms made with them should be such as you think we can comply with and persons well acquainted with their language manners and customs and who have gained an influence over them should accompany them the oneidas have manifested the strongest attachment to us throughout this dispute and therefore i suppose if any can be procured they will be most numerous their missionary mr kirkland seemed to have an uncommon ascendancy over that tribe and i should therefore be glad to see him accompany them if the indians can be procured i would choose to have them here by the opening of the campaign and therefore they should be engaged as soon as possible as there is not more time between this and the middle of may than will be necessary to settle the business with them and to march from their country to the army i am not without hopes that this will reach you before the treaty which is to be held breaks up if it should you will have an opportunity of knowing their sentiments of which i shall be glad to be informed as soon as possible i have the honor to be gentlemen c      george washington    march      to the president of congress headquarters    march      sir this will be presented to you by count pulaski who from a conviction that his remaining at the head of the cavalry was a constant subject of uneasiness to the principal officers of that corps has been induced to resign his command waving a minute inquiry into the causes of dissatisfaction which may be reduced perhaps to the disadvantages under which he labored as a stranger not well acquainted with the language genius and manners of this country it may be sufficient to observe that the degree of harmony which is inseparable from the wellbeing and consequent utility of a corps has not subsisted in the     cavalry since his appointment and that the most effectual as well as the easiest remedy is that which he has generously applied the count however far from being disgusted with the service is led by his thirst of glory and zeal for the cause of liberty to solicit farther employment and waits upon congress to make his proposals they are briefly that he be allowed to raise an independent corps composed of sixtyeight horse and two hundred foot the horse to be armed with lances and the foot equipped in the manner of lightinfantry the former he thinks he can readily fill with natives of good character and worthy the trust reposed in them with respect to the other he is desirous of more latitude     so as to have liberty of engaging prisoners and deserters from the enemy the original plan for the lancemen was to have drafted them from the regiments of horse but as this method would produce a clashing of interests and perhaps occasion new disturbances the count prefers having a corps totally unconnected with any other my advice to him therefore is to enlist his number of cavalry with the continental bounty and if it should be found consonant to the views of congress to allow his raising the number proposed over and above the establishment for the horse then he would have them on the footing of an independent corps if not he might at all events have them as drafts and in this case there would be no ground for complaint with regard to the infantry which the count esteems essential to the success of the cavalry i have informed him that the enlisting deserters and prisoners is prohibited by a late resolve of congress how far congress might be inclined to make an exception and license the engaging of prisoners in a particular detached corps in which such characters may be admitted with less danger than promiscuously in the line i could not undertake to pronounce i have only to add that the counts valor and active zeal on all occasions have done him great honor and from a persuasion that by being less exposed to the inconveniences which he has hitherto experienced he will render great services with such a command as he asks for i wish him to succeed in his application i have the honor to be c     p s it is to be understood that the count expects to retain his rank as brigadier and i think is entitled to it from his general character and particular disinterestedness on the present occasion  george washington    march      valley forge governor livingston to governor livingston valley forge    march      sir i have the honor of yours of the  d instant and i can assure you i feel myself very sensibly affected by the strenuous manner in which you express the public regard of the state and your personal friendship towards me i only desire to be the object of both while in your good opinion and that of the public i continue to merit them we seem hitherto to have mistaken each other in respect to the troop of lighthorse i did not mean to inlist them in the continental service but only to engage them for a few months while the continental horse were recruiting upon the same terms that i engaged the morris county horse last winter it will be expected that they provide their own horses arms and accoutrements and be paid accordingly if captain arnold will come into the service upon the above terms i will immediately take him into employ     i am exceedingly glad to hear of the response you have already made in the quarter masters and commissarys department at princetown and doubt not but if you pursue the same line of conduct thro the other posts that the public will not only save immense sum of money but be better served for those supernumeraries like useless wheels in a machine only clog and perplex the more essential parts it is impossible to devise any other mode of disposing of deserters than to let them go at large among us provided there is no particular cause of suspicion against them to confine them would effectually put a stop to a drain which weakens the enemy more in the course of a year than you would imagine i am pleased with the favorable account which you give of count pulaskis conduct while at trenton he is a gentleman of great activity and unquestionable bravery and only wants a fuller knowledge of our language and customs to make him a valuable officer i am c george washington    march      valley forge majorgeneral mcdougall to majorgeneral mcdougall head quarters valley forge    march      dear sir i was favored with yours of the   th ultimo in due time and should have proceeded immediately upon the business of the inquiry had not general putnams private affairs required his absence for some little time i have appointed brigadiergeneral huntington     and colonel wigglesworth to assist you in this matter and enclosed you will find instructions empowering you in conjunction with them to carry on the inquiry agreeable to the resolve of congress you will observe by the words of the resolve that the inquiry is to be made into the loss of forts montgomery and clinton in the state of new york and into the conduct of the principal officers commanding those forts hence the officer commanding in chief in that department will be consequentially involved in the inquiry because if he has been deficient in affording the proper support to those posts when called upon to do it the commandant and principal officers will of course make it appear by the evidence produced in their own justification i am not certain whether general putnam has yet returned to fishkill and i have therefore by the enclosed which you will please to forward to him by express given him notice that the inquiry is to be held and have desired him to repair immediately to that post  general huntington and     colonel wigglesworth will set out as soon as they can make preparations for the journey upon your arrival at the highlands you are to take upon you the command of the different posts in that department of which i have advised general putnam your time will at first be principally taken up with the business which you now have in hand but i beg that your attention may be turned as much as possible to the completion of the works or at least to putting them in such a state that they may be able to resist a sudden attack of the enemy governor clinton has wrote his opinion very fully to congress upon the propriety of ordering all the troops except the garrison of fort schuyler down to the highlands as all prospects of carrying on the northern expedition seem to have vanished i have backed his opinion forcibly with my own and hope if congress see matters in the light we do that those troops may be instantly brought down i have c p s there has been a resolve of congress vesting governor clinton with the direction of the works erecting for the defence of the river and requiring the commanding officer at peekskill to aid him in the execution of the same governor clinton i understand from his civil avocations does not incline to take the immediate direction of the business and the late commanding officer in that quarter has doubted     from that resolve whether his command or superintendency extended to the forts to remove difficulties of this kind by which the public service must suffer and as i consider it essential to the nature of the command that one officer should have the general control and direction of all the posts in the highlands and their dependencies and be answerable for them you are to consider yourself as possessed of this general control and direction and to act accordingly if the governor has leisure from his official duties to undertake the more immediate management of the works it will afford you a very desirable assistance i have written to congress to give you every power necessary to promote the objects of your command and in the mean time you are to consider yourself authorized as far as can depend upon me to take every measure conducive to that end i am sensible this command will not be in itself the most agreeable piece of service and that you would prefer a post on the principal theatre of action but the vast importance of it has determined me to confide it in you and i am persuaded your object is to be useful to the public if you get things in a proper train by the opening of the campaign so as that the prosecution may be assigned to other hands i shall be extremely happy to avail myself of your services with the main army    0 george washington    march      valley forge to the president of congress headquarters valley forge    march      sir i have the honor to transmit to you a letter from governor clinton which he enclosed to me for my perusal and consideration the inconvenience he mentions as resulting from the resolve respecting the appointment of a commandant for forts montgomery and clinton requires to be obviated i do not conceive it to have been the design of congress to make the command of those forts altogether distinct and independent on the general command of the posts in that quarter but only to designate the rank of the officer who should have the immediate charge of them there     is such an intimate connexion between the forts and the other posts and passes in the highlands and their vicinity that it is necessary for one officer to have the superintendency and control of the whole and to be answerable for all if this were not to be the case but the command were to be divided there might want that coöperation between the garrisons and the troops without which might be essential to their preservation and to the common purposes of defence the assigning a fixed number of men to the garrisons would not remove this inconvenience for the coöperation would still be necessary but if it were otherwise i should not think the measure advisable because we do not know what number of men we may have in the field next campaign and the number for the defence of the highlands must be proportioned to the general strength and the force of the garrisons to that number on these considerations having ordered general mcdougall to repair to the highlands to assume the chief command there i have comprehended the forts among the other objects of his trust in the discharge of which i am persuaded he will manifest adequate zeal and ability but as the resolve in question affords room for doubt it will be proper to have it explained so as more explicitly to ascertain the intention of congress i am perfectly in sentiment with governor clinton on the propriety of drawing the troops from the northward to reinforce and carry on the works in the highlands from every thing i can learn there seems to be no prospect of prosecuting     the intended expedition into canada if so i apprehend it can answer no valuable end to keep a body of troops in and about albany in the present circumstances of canada little is to be dreaded thence the enemy in all probability will be well satisfied to act on the defensive without risking the consequences of an attempt against us a proper garrison at fort schuyler and a small party by way of guard at albany with the militia of the country that may be occasionally drawn together will be a sufficient security against the inroads of the enemy from canada or the depredations of the neighboring indians supposing there were any of the tribes whose dispositions were still actively hostile notwithstanding our late northern successes which is by no means a natural supposition all the men more than are wanted for these purposes would be of the most important utility in the highlands if the arms and stores at albany should be thought an objection to the plan i would beg leave to observe that albany appears to me a most improper place for stationary arsenals or magazines and that those which are there at present should be removed without delay besides as they would be in most danger from an incursion up the north river the best way to counteract that danger is to strengthen the passes in the highlands and obstruct the navigation in order to which the reinforcing them with the troops from the northward would be no inconsiderable step i have the honor to be c      george washington    march      valley forge james bowdoin to james bowdoin president of the council of massachusetts valley forge    march      sir it gives me inexpressible concern to have repeated information from the best authority that the committees of the different towns and districts of your state hire deserters from general burgoynes army and employ them as substitutes to excuse the personal service of the inhabitants i need not enlarge upon the danger of substituting as soldiers men who have given a glaring proof of a treacherous disposition and who are bound to us by no motives of attachment to citizens in whom the ties of country kindred and sometimes property are so many securities for their fidelity the evils with which this measure is pregnant are obvious and of such a serious nature as makes it necessary not only to stop the farther progress of it but likewise to apply a retrospective remedy and if possible to annul it so far as it has been carried into effect unless this is done although you may be amused for the present with the flattering idea of speedily completing your battalions they will be found at or before the opening of the campaign reduced by the defection of every british soldier to their original weak condition and the accumulated     bounties of the continent and of the state will have been fruitlessly sacrificed indeed mr burgoyne could hardly if he were consulted suggest a more effectual plan for plundering us of so much money reinforcing general howe with so many men and preventing us from recruiting a certain number of regiments to say nothing of the additional losses which may be dreaded in desertions among the native soldiers from the contagion of ill example and the arts of seduction which it is more than probable will be put in practice this matter demands your immediate attention and i flatter myself that on a due consideration of the mischiefs which must inevitably flow from the pernicious practice remonstrated against you will not delay the application of the most extensive and efficacious remedy i have the honor to be with the greatest respect sir c      george washington  0 march      valley forge john cadwalader to brigadiergeneral john cadwalader valley forge  0 march      my dear sir your favor of the   th instant came safe to my hands and gave me sincere pleasure as it encouraged a hope which i had before entertained of seeing you in camp again most sincerely do i wish it was in my power to point out some post or place in the army which would invite you to and fix you in it we want your aid exceedingly and the public perhaps at no time since the commencement of the war would be more benefited by your advice and assistance than at the present and throughout the whole of this campaign which must be important and critical one thing certain is a seat at my board and a square on my floor shall always be reserved for you but this though it would add to my pleasure is not the height of my wishes i want to see you in a more important station by death and desertion we have lost a good many men since we came to this ground and have encountered every species of hardship that cold wet and hunger and want of clothes were capable of producing notwithstanding and contrary to my expectations     we have been able to keep the soldiers from mutiny or dispersion although in the single article of provisions they have encountered enough to have occasioned one or the other of these in most other armies they have been two or three times days together without provisions and once six days without any of the meat kind could the poor horses tell their tale it would be in a strain still more lamentable as numbers have actually died from pure want but as our prospects begin to brighten my complaints shall cease it gives me much pleasure to hear that the recruiting service in the counties near you is in so hopeful a way but i despair of seeing our battalions completed by any other means than drafting the importance of the place you speak of is obvious it has engrossed much of my thoughts but in our present situation and under our present prospects it is one of those things that is more like to become an object of our desire than attainment i have every reason short of absolute proof to believe that general howe is meditating a stroke against this army he has drawn some say two thousand and others twentyfive hundred men from new york who i believe are arrived at philadelphia as a number of transports have just past wilmington in their way up the delaware and reports from newport say that the garrison there had orders to be in readiness to embark by the  0th instant their invalids had gone off for england and the women and children for new york i am c      george washington    march      valley forge to the president of congress headquarters valley forge    march      sir i have the honor of yours of the   th    th instants in consequence of the resolves transmitted to me i have despatched an express to the marquis de lafayette and baron de kalb to recall them from the northward  and instead of ordering down hazens regiment to rejoin this army i have ordered van schaicks immediately to the highlands where the public works are in a manner at a stand for want of hands van schaicks is a full and fresh regiment hazens but weak in point of numbers and must be considerably fatigued from their late long march      enclosed you have the copy of a letter which i received a few days ago from doctor rush as this letter contains charges of a very heinous nature against the directorgeneral doctor shippen for malpractices and neglect in his department i could not but look upon it as meant for a public accusation and have therefore thought it incumbent upon me to lay it before congress i have showed it to doctor shippen that he may be prepared to vindicate his character if called upon he tells me that doctor rush made charges of a similar nature before a committee of congress appointed to hear them which he could not support if so congress will not have further occasion to trouble themselves in the matter i have the honor to be c  george washington    march      sir william howe to sir william howe headquarters    march      sir your several letters of the          st instant have been duly received you are under a mistake as to the rank of mr ethan allen which is only that of lieutenantcolonel and as such he has been returned and considered by your commissary mr loring the fact truly is to the best of my information that at the time of his capture he had an appointment as lieutenantcolonel from the state of new york in a regiment commanded     by colonel warner though he may have been called colonel in some letters of mine it was either through misconception at the time or by a concise and familiar mode of expression which frequently applies that term to a lieutenantcolonel i shall therefore expect him in exchange for mr campbell  i am by no means sensible of the propriety of so rigorous a proceeding as you have adopted in the case of captains robinson and galt—especially as it respects the former your letter gave me the first notice i had of any circumstance of the affair and i can without scruple assure you i am not conscious that they had any sinister view in what they did it is evident no deception nor any thing unfair could have been intended by captain robinson as he was previously announced to you and your passport obtained he was a person too well known in philadelphia to have hoped to escape detection under the mask of a fictitious and disguised character the destruction of the armed brig he formerly commanded threw him out of actual employment and   0 his taking charge of the shallop destined to convey relief to the unfortunate can only be deemed an instance of his condescension i know nothing of captain galt but it is not improbable he was actuated by similar motives if the conduct of both or either of them was influenced in part by other incentives i am persuaded they only related to private and personal concerns and might authorize a charge of indiscretion rather than of ill design you were expressly told that captain isaiah robinson was to have charge of the shallop—your own passport ought to have protected him since it is not pretended that he committed any act in the execution of his commission which could have forfeited its protection i am well aware of the delicacy which ought to be observed in the intercourse of flags and that no species of imposition should be practiced under their sanction—but there are some little deviations which inadvertency or the imprudence of individuals may occasion which are more properly cause for remonstrance than punishment the present event on an impartial consideration will not appear any thing worse and i think myself fully justified in demanding the immediate restoration of captain robinson and desiring the release of capt galt the conduct of lieutenantcolonel brooks in detaining john miller requires neither palliation nor excuse i justify and approve it there is nothing so sacred in the character of the kings trumpeter even when sanctified by a flag as to alter the nature of things or to consecrate infidelity and guilt he     was a deserter from the army under my command and whatever you have been pleased to assert to the contrary it is the practice of war and nations to seize and punish deserters wherever they may be found his appearing in the character he did was an aggravation of his offence inasmuch as it added insolence to perfidy my scrupulous regard to the privileges of flags and a desire to avoid every thing that partiality itself might affect to consider as a violation of them induced me to send orders for the release of the trumpeter before the receipt of your letter the improper and peremptory terms of which had it not been too late would have strongly operated to produce a less compromising conduct i intended at the time to assure you and i wish it to be remembered that my indulgence in this instance is not to be drawn into precedent and that should any deserters from the american army hereafter have the daring folly to approach our lines in a similar manner they will fall victims to their rashness and presumption i shall give orders as you request for acknowledging the receipt of your letters at the posts where they shall be delivered serjeants mcmahon and cameron were taken at a distance from their party whither they had straggled under very exceptionable circumstances and were confined in lancaster jail on suspicion of their being spies i have sent directions to have them conveyed to your lines which nothing but a regard to the promise of my aid de camp would induce me to do the conduct of these men having been so irregular and     criminal as to make them justly amenable to punishment the particulars of this affair shall be the subject of future animadversion before i conclude i think it proper to inform you that colonel grayson lieutenantcolonels harrison and hamilton and elias boudinot commissarygeneral of prisoners are the gentlemen appointed on my part to meet your commissioners  i am sir c     george washington    march      to the president of congress valley forge    march      sir herewith i do myself the honor to inclose copies of a letter from an officer  of militia at elizabeth town to me and an extract of a letter from one of mr boudinots deputies at boston to him both tending to induce a belief that the enemy have some enterprize in contemplation what this is time must discover i have this whole winter been clearly of opinion that genl howes movements would be very early this spring to take advantage of the weak state of our army or late if he expected considerable reinforcements from england and meant to avail himself of his full strength— if the first takes places as appearances indicate it may i think be considered as a proof of one or both of these two things—that he is either well informed he cannot indeed be otherwise of the situation and more than probably the strength of our army or that he expects no considerable reinforcements this year from europe—in either case it is our indispensable duty to reinforce and arrange our army as speedily     as possible that we may in the first instance be prepared for defence—in the second take advantage of any favorable circumstances which may happen to injure the enemy— whatever may be the designs of congress with respect to the establishment of the army i know not but i do most earnestly and devoutly recommend a speedy adoption of them and the appointment of officers as our present situation at this advanced season is truly alarming and to me highly distressing as i am convinced that we shall be plunged into the campaign before our arrangements are made and the army properly organized the numberless disadvantages resulting from the late appointment of general officers last year make me look forward with infinite anxiety this for after all the wisdom that congress or their committee can use in the choice of officers many will be disgusted resignations of some and perhaps nonacceptance of others follow before matters then can be brought to a proper tone much time will be lost and a great deal of trouble and vexation encountered to overcome which is not the work of a day and till they are overcome confusion disorder and loss must prevail in the mean while order regularity and discipline which require the vigilance of every officer to establish and must flow from the general officers in every army is neglected or not entered upon in time to effect  thus it happened last year and brigades     and divisions became vacant to the great injury of the service as it is not improper for congress to have some idea of the present temper of the army it may not be amiss to remark in this place that since the month of august last between two and three hundred officers have resigned their commissions and many others with difficulty dissuaded from it in the virginia line only not less than six colonels as good as any in the service have left it lately and more i am told are in the humor to do so highly advantageous also would it be if the recruits and draughts from no carolina and virginia were not suffered to halt on their way to camp under pretence of getting equippd but sent forward and incorporated into the different regiments of their respective states as soon as it could be done out of the number of men said to be draughted in virginia last fall and others from no carolina very few     have joined the army but owing to desertion and other causes have dwindled to nothing this will always be the case with new recruits especially those who are unwillingly drawn forth if much time is spent in getting them to their regiments under the care of proper officers this shows the necessity if the season and other powerful reasons did not loudly call for it of hastening them to the army my solicitude for the preservation of the communication of the no river gives me very uneasy sensations on account of our posts there and will excuse my again asking if the troops to the northward except such as are necessary for the defence of fort schuyler can be so advantageously employed as at the works on that river a respectable force at those posts would awe new york  divide genl howes force or expose the city to depend too much upon militia is in my opinion putting every thing to hazard if i should appear uncommonly anxious respecting the several matters contained in this letter by repeating them congress will do me the justice i hope to believe that i am actuated by no views but such as are prompted by circumstances  the advanced season i have the honor to be c p s your letter of the   st inst is just come to hand containing sevl resolves of congress      george washington march      john ternant to john ternant  march      knowing it to be the intention of congress to employ no more foreigners except such as come under special engagements or whose recommendations and former services speak so powerfully as scarce to leave a choice i could not undertake to give mr t— any assurance of a permanent appointment much less the promise of rank without authority of congress nor could i stand justified upon any principle for employing a stranger without recommendation on any other account than his profound knowledge in the business intended for him to execute how far this is the case with mr t— he alone can tell if upon trial he should be found deficient the folly of the undertaking would be charged equally to us both he for undertaking what he should be found unequal to and me for employing a gentn of whose capacity i had no proofs mr t— informed me that he had never been in any other service than in the engineering department—if so i think he must be much at a loss in practice let his theoretical knowledge be what it will and if this should be the case would lay us both open to censure and give distrust as it is not a very desirable thing to set aside our own officers unless there are obvious reasons to justify the measure     thus much candor commands me to say and under its influence mr t— should act the duties of the office of subinspector he if fit for the place ought to know the pay will be about  0 dollars  george washington    march      majorgeneral armstrong to majorgeneral armstrong head quarters valley forge    march      dear sir i am obliged of your favors of the  th feb   0th inst i fear your apprehensions as to the augmentation of the army at least in good time will appear to have been but too well founded some of the states have but lately drafted their men others have proceeded but a very little way in recruiting and some     have not yet fixed upon the mode of completing their regiments even those men that are already drafted or enlisted are to be drawn together most of them probably to be inoculated and all of them to be disciplined by accounts from the eastward the troops are about evacuating rhode island and two regiments of hessians and two of british are actually embarked at new york whether with an intent to form some new expedition or to reinforce general howe at philadelphia cannot yet be determined but i think the latter most probable if general howe draws his strength together before we have collected ours nothing can hinder him from moving against us but ignorance of our numbers and i dont think we have any right to count upon that considering the knowledge he appears to have had the last campaign    0 i shall say no more of the canada expedition than that it is at an end i never was made acquainted with a single circumstance relating to it i do not yet know what provision will be made for the officers who will be supernumerary upon the new arrangement of the army i am in hopes that there will not be any great number of them there having been so many resignations of late that the regiments are in general thinly officered i am fully of opinion that the enemy depend as much or more upon our own divisions and the disaffection which they expect to create by sending their emissaries among the people than they do by the force of their arms the situation of matters in this state is melancholy and alarming we have daily proof that a majority of the people in this quarter are only restrained from supplying the enemy with horses and every kind of necessary through fear of punishment and although i have made a number of severe examples i cannot put a stop to the intercourse it is plain from several late instances that they have their emissaries in every part of the country a lieutenant has been detected in lancaster county purchasing horses in conjunction with the inhabitants one of whom and the lieutenant have been executed four fine teams were     taken a few days ago going into philadelphia from the neighborhood of yorktown and i doubt not but there are many more such intentions yet undiscovered i am convinced that more mischief has been done by the british officers who have been prisoners than by any other set of people during their captivity they have made connexions in the country they have confirmed the disaffected converted many ignorant people and frightened the lukewarm and timid by their stories of the power of britain i hope a general exchange is not far off by which means we shall get rid of that set of people and i am convinced that we had better in future send all officers in upon parole than keep them among us if the state of general potters affairs will admit of returning to the army i shall be exceedingly glad to see him as his activity and vigilance have been much wanting in the course of the winter the quota of militia stipulated by the state has never been above half kept up and sometimes i believe there has not been a single man general lacey has not now above seventy the country upon the east side of schuylkill has been by these means exceedingly exposed as it has not been in my power to cover it with the effective continental troops who instead of relaxation have been upon fatigue the whole winter when the weather is such that you think you can take the field without injury to your health i shall be glad to see you with the army as i am with sincere regard dear sir c     george washington    march      valley forge patrick henry to patrick henry valley forge    march      dear sir about eight days ago i was honored with your favor of the  0th ultimo your friendship sir in transmitting to me the anonymous letter you had received lays me under the most grateful obligations and if my acknowledgments can be due for any thing more it is for the polite and delicate terms in which you have been pleased to communicate the matter i have ever been happy in supposing that i had a place in your esteem and the proof you have afforded on this occasion makes me peculiarly so the favorable light in which you hold me is truly flattering but i should feel much regret if i thought the happiness of america so intimately connected with my personal welfare as you so obligingly seem to consider it all i can say is that she has ever had and i trust she ever will have my honest exertions to promote her interest i cannot hope that my services have been the best but my heart tells me they have been the best that i could render that i may have erred in using the means in my power for accomplishing the objects of the arduous exalted station with which i am honored i cannot doubt nor do i wish my conduct to be exempted from reprehension farther than it may deserve error is the portion of humanity and to censure it whether committed by this or that public character is the prerogative of freemen however being intimately acquainted with the man i conceive to be the author     of the letter transmitted and having always received from him the strongest professions of attachment and regard i am constrained to consider him as not possessing at least a great degree of candor and sincerity though his views in addressing you should have been the result of conviction and founded in motives of public good this is not the only secret insidious attempt that has been made to wound my reputation there have been others equally base cruel and ungenerous because conducted with as little frankness and proceeding from views perhaps as personally interested i am dear sir with great esteem and regard your much obliged friend c george washington    march      patrick henry to patrick henry camp    march      dear sir just as i was about to close my letter of yesterday your favor of the  th instant came to hand i can only thank you again in the language of the most undissembled gratitude for your friendship and assure you that the indulgent disposition which virginia in particular and the states in general entertain towards me gives me the most sensible pleasure the approbation of my country is what i wish and as far as my abilities and opportunities will permit i hope i shall endeavor to deserve it it is the highest reward to a feeling mind and happy are they who so conduct themselves as to merit it the anonymous letter with which you were pleased to favor me was written by dr rush so far as i can     judge from a similitude of hands this man has been elaborate and studied in his professions of regard for me and long since the letter to you my caution to avoid any thing which could injure the service prevented me from communicating but to a very few of my friends the intrigues of a faction which i know was formed against me since it might serve to publish our internal dissensions but their own restless zeal to advance their views has too clearly betrayed them and made concealment on my part fruitless i cannot precisely mark the extent of their views but it appeared in general that general gates was to be exalted on the ruin of my reputation and influence this i am authorized to say from undeniable facts in my own possession from publications the evident scope of which could not be mistaken and from private detractions industriously circulated general mifflin it is commonly supposed bore the second part in the cabal and general conway i know was a very active and malignant partisan but i have good reasons to believe that their machinations have recoiled most sensibly upon themselves with sentiments of great esteem and regard i am dear sir your affectionate humble servant george washington    march      valley forge governor trumbull to governor trumbull headquarters valley forge    march      sir— it is some time since i have been honored with a letter from you the sole reason of my taking up your attention at this time is to lay before you a short     state of our present situation the apparent views of the enemy and from thence to show the absolute necessity which there is for drawing our force together as quick as possible and being able to take the field before the enemy are in a condition to begin their operations notwithstanding the orders i had given last year to have all the recruits inoculated i found upon examination that between three and four thousand men had not had the small pox that disorder began to make its appearance in camp and to avoid its spreading in the natural way the whole army was immediately inoculated they have gone through with uncommon success but are not yet sufficiently recovered to do duty all the men of the eastern regiments who were drafted for eight and twelve months were discharged in the winter and their places have not yet been filled up seven of the virginia regiments had been enlisted for two years and their time of service expiring about two months ago they were discharged likewise full two thousand men belonging to the different states are returned unfit for duty for want of clothing and must consequently be deducted from the effective list from which also are to be taken the sick present and in hospital from the above you may form a pretty just estimation of our present force—i mean with which we should be able to look the enemy in the face general howe has already drawn a body of men said to be two thousand five hundred from new york and several accounts from rhode island speak     confidently of the intended evacuation of new port which i suppose if it takes place is also to reinforce philadelphia these things indicate the intention of an early movement on the part of the enemy and indeed if they have the least penetration or have profited by past experience they must know that an early campaign upon their part will be highly advantageous to them had they attacked us last spring in the neighborhood of morris town before our levies joined they would undoubtedly have routed us and perhaps have hindered us from making a junction of any consequence during the remainder of the campaign after the foregoing little need be said to convince you of the absolute necessity of sending forward your levies with the greatest expedition they are wanted now to enable us to act merely on the defensive but would the states exert themselves and send such a body of men into the field before the enemy are fully reinforced as would enable us to act upon the offensive such advantages might be taken of them in their present situation and such posts occupied as would reduce them to the greatest distress we may be assured that notwithstanding the severe blow which great britain met with in the loss of burgoynes army she will exert herself most strenuously to repair her credit this campaign it is plain that france is playing a politic game enjoying all the advantages of our commerce without the expense of war it will probably end in a rupture between the two courts but perhaps not so speedily as some imagine     such of the levies as have not been inoculated need not be detained on that account we have found it more convenient to inoculate them in and near camp they can be of service in case of emergency and are not to be subjected to a long march immediately upon their recovery which has always been much more fatal than the disorder among the troops returned unfit for duty for want of clothing none of your state are included the care of your legislature in providing clothing and necessaries of all kinds for their men is highly laudable and reflects the greatest honor upon their patriotism and humanity i wrote to you the  th ultimo upon our then want of provisions to which having received no answer i am doubtful of the letters getting to hand we have been since better supplied and as i am informed that mr wadsworth has accepted of the commissary department i hope that we shall do better in future i have the honor to be c george washington   april      valley forge thomas mckean to thomas mckean  headquarters valley forge   april      sir i was yesterday favored with your letter of the   th march—i should be ready to afford every probable means of procuring honest testimony to the two persons now under confinement for passing counterfeit continental money but it cannot be supposed     that general howe would permit persons to come out philada to give evidence in a matter which by being traced fairly back would fix the issuing counterfeit money upon some of his own party—a thing which he has affected to treat as not having the least foundation in truth besides i very much doubt whether he would not consider the suffering persons to come out to give evidence in our courts as in some measure acknowledging their authority and jurisdiction which he has ever cautiously avoided upon the whole sir i think it will be to no purpose to send in for the evidence required who if they were permitted to come out would only endeavor to make it appear that the prisoners did not know the money was counterfeit whether they did or did not i should suppose the jury would be able to judge from circumstances i am c george washington   april      josias c hall to colonel josias c hall headquarters   april      sir however painful it is to me to signify my public disapprobation of a sentence solemnly pronounced by a courtmartial it is a disagreeable sensation from which my duty forbids me to exempt myself in particular instances such a one is that which makes the subject of your favor of the   th ultimo a refusal to obey the commands of a superior officer especially where the duty required was evidently calculated for the good of the service cannot be justified without involving consequences subversive of all military     discipline a precedent manifestly too dangerous would be established of dispensing with orders and subordination would be at an end if mens ideas were not rectified in a case of this kind and such notice taken as has been on my part as far as the matter personally regards you i feel additional concern but i can by no means discover that necessity of retiring from the service in support of a mistaken opinion which you remotely hint at on the contrary from the crisis at which our affairs have arrived and the frequent defection of officers seduced by views of private interest and emolument to abandon the cause of their country i think every man who does not merely make profession of patriotism is bound by indissoluble ties to remain in the army my advice in which i flatter myself you will coincide after a dispassionate review of this matter is therefore that differences may be mutually forgot and that the whole may subside to which your love of the service will i hope in no small degree contribute and i am c  george washington   april      valley forge to the president of congress headquarters valley forge   april      sir i have now the honor to acknowledge your several letters of the   st   th and  0th ultimo with their   0 enclosures which have been duly received it gives me pain to observe they appear to contain several implications by which my sensibility is not a little wounded i find myself extremely embarrassed by the steps i had taken towards an exchange of prisoners and the formation of a general cartel making more ample provision for their future accommodation and relief the views of congress seem to be very different from what i supposed them when i entered into my late engagements with general howe their resolution of the  0th ultimo pointedly requiring a strict adherence to all former ones upon the subject will in all probability render them impracticable i considered some of their resolutions as dictated on the principle of retaliation and did not imagine the terms they contained would be insisted upon in negotiating an agreement calculated to remedy the evils which occasioned them in most respects they might be substantially complied with but there are some points to which an exact conformity must of necessity destroy the idea of a cartel one is the obliging of the enemy to pay gold and silver on equal terms for continental currency estimating the articles supplied them at their actual prices with us as seems to be the design of the resolve of the   th of december another is that subjecting the inhabitants of these states taken in arms against them to trial and punishment agreeable to the resolve of the  0th of the same month i am well aware that appearances ought to be upheld and that we should avoid as much as possible     recognising by any public act the depreciation of our currency but i conceive this end would be answered as far as might be necessary by stipulating that all money payments should be made in gold and silver being the common medium of commerce among nations at the rate of four shillings and six pence for a spanish milled dollar by fixing the price of rations on an equitable scale relatively to our respective circumstances and providing for the payment of what we may owe by sending in provision and selling it at their market the rates of money and the prices of provisions and other commodities differ everywhere and in treaties of a similar nature between any two states it is requisite for mutual convenience to ascertain some common ratio for both the value of money in payments and for the rates of those articles on which they may arise it was determined on mature consideration not to conclude any thing expressly that should contradict the resolution of the  0th of december but at the same time if it is designed to be the rule of practice it is easy to perceive it would at once overturn any cartel that could be formed general howe would never consent to observe it on his part if such a practice were to exist on ours though the law ought not to be contravened by an express article admitting the exchangeability of such persons yet if it is not suffered to sleep it is in vain to expect the operation of it will be acquiesced in by the enemy      the measures i have taken must evince that it is my determination to pay the fullest attention to the interests of citizens and to the rights of general lee in the treaty and i think it but justice to the gentlemen appointed to negotiate it to declare that i know them to be so fully impressed with the importance of both those objects as to make them cheerfully observant of the injunctions of congress so far as not to conclude any agreement of which the exchange of general lee and the alternative respecting citizens are not essential parts these points have been early determined on it is with no small concern that i have been obliged to trouble congress upon the subjects of this letter and should they appear to them in the same light they do to me and they should think proper to remove the obstacles which now oppose the business in hand i must request they will be pleased to communicate their determination as expeditiously as possible that the commissioners may govern themselves accordingly and either proceed to forming a cartel or put an end to the negotiation before the resolves of the  0th came to hand they had met and been in treaty two days with a prospect of a favorable accommodation     i am happy to inform congress that general lee will be out on parole tomorrow in place of general prescott and i have every reason to expect if the negotiation can be continued upon admissible terms that his exchange will immediately follow the releasement of colonel campbell and the hessian fieldofficers it is agreed that lieutenantcolonel allen shall be exchanged for lieutenantcolonel campbell the importunate applications of colo lee  and maj swazey  to leave the service oblige me to lay the matter before congress colo lees letter upon the subject was transmitted me the   th of january but hoping he might change his mind i deferred writing to congress upon his request he has renewed it again in urgent terms thro general heath and i have only to observe that it is a painful circumstance to see officers of their merit leaving the service it is the case every day i shall be obliged by congress informing me of the dates of the resignations of the colonels in the virginia line i have only received the date of colo lewiss inclosed is a letter from capt cottineau of the ship ferdinand with an invoice of her cargo the letter only came to hand yesterday and as it is of an old date it is highly probable that the goods are sold if they are not from the captains desire to give the public a preference in the sale congress will have an opportunity of directing them to be purchased most of them would be proper for the army i have the honor to be c     george washington  0 april      valley forge to the president of congress valley forge  0 april      sir i had the honor of receiving your favor of the  th instant enclosing a resolve of congress of the same date empowering me to call forth five thousand militia from the states of maryland pennsylvania and new jersey i thank congress for the power at the same time it is incumbent on me to assure them that granting the practicability of collecting such a number it would prove a work of time difficulty and expense to evince which i need only recur to the experience of last campaign on similar occasions and to remind you that it was not possible to obtain  000 men nor sometimes even one hundred from this state altho the former number was required and promised for the purpose of covering during the winter the country between schuylkill  delaware as this resolve appears to have been made in consequence of my letters of the   th and   th ulto which were founded on conjecture and in some degree misinformation and as the execution of it would exclusive of the inconveniences above mentioned i am persuaded have a tendency to injure the completion of the continental regiments i shall call for a small part only of the number allowed but could wish that hartleys regiment were ordered immediately to camp and the duties of it performed by militia—in like manner i would propose that all remote guards should be composed of militia—and that the several purposes for which men are drawn from     the continental troops should be answered by them this would be a means of drawing together a considerable number of men who are in a manner lost to the army and of employing the militia to the best advantage possible— the great end of my letter to congress of the   th ultimo seems to have been mistaken my views were not turned to reinforcements of militia to know whether the old establishment of the army or the new as agreed upon by the committee is the choice of congress and in what manner the regiments of this state and the additionals are to be reduced officers for the whole appointed c were my objects these are objects of the greatest moment as they may in their consequences involve the fate of america for i will undertake to say that it is next to impossible when the season is so far advanced properly to accomplish those changes appointments and the dependent arrangements for the ensuing campaign should any convulsion happen or movement take place they will be altogether impracticable justice to my own character as well as duty to the public constrain me to repeat these things their consequences are more easily conceived than described it may be said by some sir that my wish to see the officers of this army upon a more respectable establishment is the cause of my solicitude and carrys me too far to such i can declare that my anxiety proceeds from the causes above mentioned if my opinion is asked with respect to the necessity     of making this provision for the officers i am ready to declare that i do most religiously believe the salvation of the cause depends upon it and without it your officers will moulder to nothing or be composed of low and illiterate men void of capacity for this or any other business to prove this i can with truth aver that scarce a day passes without the offer of two or three commissions and my advices from the eastward and southward are that numbers who had gone home on furlough mean not to return but are establishing themselves in more lucrative employments let congress determine what will be the consequence of this spirit personally as an officer i have no interest in their decision because i have declared and i now repeat it that i never will receive the smallest benefit from the halfpay establishment but as a man who fights under the weight of a proscription and as a citizen who wishes to see the liberty of his country established upon a permanent foundation and whose property depends upon the success of our arms i am deeply interested but all this apart and justice out of the question upon the single ground of economy and public saving i will maintain the utility of it for i have not the least doubt that until officers consider their commissions in an honorable and interested point of view and are afraid to endanger them by negligence and inattention that no order regularity or care either of the men or public property will prevail to prove this i need only refer to the general courtsmartial which are constantly sitting for the trial of them     and the number who have been cashiered within the last three months for misconduct of different kinds by officers who are just returned from massachusetts bay i learn that there is not the least prospect of getting men from thence before the month of june—if then—and indeed that there is no reason to expect any number that will deserve the name of reinforcement for the continental regiments this campaign the towns being only called upon to furnish the deficiency of their last years quota so that all subsequent casualties are disregarded and the fifteen regiments of that state which may now perhaps want  000 men to compleat them will receive only  00 if the towns came within that number of their complement last year—what change the requisition of congress of the—feby may effect i shall not undertake to say—if it has not a speedy and powerful operation our prospects in that quarter will be exceedingly unpromising—a gentleman from new hampshire some little time since informed me that matters were nearly in the same train there notwithstanding a resolve for the completion of their battalions—and the inclosed copy of a letter no   from general putnam whom i have desired to remain in connecticut for some time in order to forward the recruits from that state conveys his ideas of what may be expected from thence—what new york new jersey no carolina have done or are about to do i know not pennsylvania and maryland have tried the effect of voluntary inlistments to little purpose and the first in direct contradiction to     the most pointed injunctions laid on the officers have their recruits composed chiefly of deserters who will embrace the first opportunity of escaping with our arms—virginia it is true has proceeded to a draught but the number besides being in itself inadequate has been lessened by desertion and the deficiency of the regiments on the other hand being increased by death and desertion their strength will probably fall very far short of the new establishment this sir is not a flattering picture of our affairs but the representation is just and it is incumbent on me to exhibit it in my own defence as notwithstanding all these unfavorable circumstances and what is to me a certain prospect of being plunged into the campaign before our arrangements are made—officers appointed c great matters i perceive are expected from our activity this spring—in proportion therefore will the disappointment be felt by those who are sanguine—for want of the ratification of congress the horse establishment—companies of sappers provost marshalsey c c as agreed to by the committee and recommended for their consideration are entirely at a stand at a time when we ought to be deriving benefits from their execution at no period since the commencement of the war have i felt more painful sensations on account of delay than at the present and urged by them i have expressed myself without reserve by a letter just received from general weedon i am informed of his intention to resign if general woodford should be restored to his former rank     which he had not then heard general muhlenberg is now balancing on the same point one therefore if not two brigadiers will be wanted for that state the disadvantages resulting from the frequent resignations in the virginia line the change of commanding officers to the regiments and other causes equally distressing have injured that corps beyond conception and have been the means of reducing very respectable regiments in some instances to a mere handful of men and this will ever be the case till officers can be fixed by something equivalent to the sacrifice they make to reason otherwise and suppose that public virtue alone will enable men to forego the ease and comforts of life to encounter the hardships and dangers of war for a bare subsistence when their companions and friends are amassing large fortunes is viewing human nature rather as it should be than as it really is the clothiergenl of the army as well as the heads of every other department should be in camp near the comrinchief otherwise it is impossible that the operations of war can be conducted with energy and precision  i wish most sincerely that this as not the   0 least essential part of the business settled with the committee were decided and a thorough investigation were had into the conduct of this department as it is a matter of universal astonishment that we should be deficient in any article of cloathing when it is commonly asserted that the eastern states alone can furnish materials enough to cloath  00000 men—if this be fact there is a fatal error somewhere to which may be attributed the death  desertion of thousands i shall make no apology for the freedom of this letter to inform congress of such facts as materially affect the service i conceive to be one great and essential part of my duty to them and myself my agreement with the committee entitled me to expect upwards of forty thousand continental troops exclusive of artillery and horse for the service of the ensuing campaign including those to be employed in the defence of the north river instead of these what are my prospects majorgeneral the marquis de lafayette is arrived at camp and will resume the command of his division the baron de kalb is expected in a few days         george washington    april      valley forge mathias ogden to colonel mathias ogden valley forge    april      dr sir i received your favor of the  th inst by colo barber the liberation of our officers from their confinement is certainly a desirable object yet i am not satisfied that we could fully justify our conduct in effecting it in the manner proposed but be this as it may it appears to me that the attempt supposing it to succeed would not be founded in principles of a large and general expediency—it would afford relief to a few men and subject a far greater number perhaps ten times as many to the inconveniences of a stricter and much more limited confinement than they now experience our officers in the hands of the enemy are permitted to be on long island thro favor and for their better accommodation if we by an attempt should release twenty or thirty every indulgence would be withdrawn from those remaining and they and all future prisoners would be so closely and uncomfortably placed that they would not be liable to the same accidents besides a breach of honor would certainly be objected against the officers     released for it would be said right or wrong that they at least had consented to the measure if not planned it these considerations without taking into view how far the proceeding would be justifiable are opposed to the scheme and induced me to decline it were it to be prosecuted i certainly should have no objections to your conducting it i am c george washington    april      valley forge to the president of congress valley forge    april      sir on thursday evening i had the honor to receive your two letters of the   th instant i am much obliged by the fresh assurances which congress are pleased to make me of their confidence and they may be satisfied that i wish nothing more ardently than that a good and perfect agreement should subsist between us the negotiation between the commissioners is ended without effecting a cartel nor do i suppose from the information i have received on the subject that there is any good prospect that one will ever be formed or at least for a great while on a liberal and an extensive plan a report of the proceedings of the commissioners on our part at their several meetings i take the liberty to enclose    the old agreement i presume continues and under it we must carry on exchanges      general muhlenberg has communicated his determination to resign but has promised not to leave his brigade till congress shall appoint another general in his room provided it is done in any reasonable time by postponing my call upon the militia as mentioned in my last of the  0th i did not mean to decline it altogether i did not see the necessity of calling out five thousand for the sole purpose of defence and in the present situation of things i cannot perceive my way sufficiently clear for offensive measures as i do not know when to expect the recruits from the different states nor what prospect the commissary has of provision as we only get it yet from hand to mouth assembling the militia unless for the purpose of defence should be the last thing done as they soon become impatient and are very expensive in the articles of stores camp utensils provisions c the enclosed draft of a bill was brought to headquarters yesterday afternoon by a gentleman who     informed me that a large cargo of them had been just sent out of philadelphia whether this insidious proceeding is genuine and imported in the packet which arrived a few days ago or contrived in philadelphia is a point undetermined and immaterial but it is certainly founded in principles of the most wicked diabolical baseness meant to poison the minds of the people and detach the wavering at least from our cause  i suppose it will obtain a place in the papers     and am not without anxiety that it will have a malignant influence i would submit it whether it will not be highly expedient for congress to investigate it in all its parts and to expose in the most striking manner the injustice delusion and fraud it contains i trust it will be attacked in every shape in every part of the continent  i have the honor to be c      george washington  0 april      to the general officers in camp headquarters  0 april      sir there seem to me but three general plans of operation which may be premeditated for the next campaign one the attempting to recover philadelphia and destroy the enemys army there another the endeavoring to transfer the war to the northward by an enterprise against new york and a third the remaining quiet in a secure fortified camp disciplining and arranging the army till the enemy begin their operations and then to govern ourselves accordingly which of these three plans shall we adopt if the first what mode of execution shall we pursue and what force will be requisite estimating the present numbers of the enemy in philadelphia to be ten thousand men exclusive of marines and seamen whose aid may be called in shall we endeavor to effect the purpose by storm by regular approaches or by blockade and in what particular manner if the second shall we attempt to take new york by a coup de main with a small force or shall we collect a large force and make an attack in form in either case what force will be necessary estimating the number of the enemy in and about new york at four thousand men and what disposition shall we make so as to effect the enterprise and at the same time to protect the country here and secure our stores if the last what post shall we take so as to keep the army in a state of security to afford cover to the country and to our magazines and to be in a situation to counteract the future motions of the enemy the commanderinchief thinks it unnecessary to make any comments on these questions as the general officers will no doubt fully weigh every circumstance proper to be considered and sensible of the importance of the objects to which their attention is called will make their opinions the result of mature deliberation i am c      george washington    april      valley forge john banister to john banister delegate in congress valley forge    april      dear sir on saturday evening i had the pleasure to receive your favor of the   th instant i thank you very much for your obliging tender of a friendly intercourse between us and you may rest assured that i embrace it with cheerfulness and shall write you freely as often as leisure will permit of such points as appear to me material and interesting i am pleased to find that you expect the proposed establishment of the army will succeed though is it a painful consideration that matters of such pressing importance and obvious necessity meet with so much     difficulty and delay be assured the success of the measure is a matter of the most serious moment and that it ought to be brought to a conclusion as speedily as possible the spirit of resigning commissions has been long at an alarming height and increases daily applications from officers on furlough are hourly arriving and genls heath at boston—mcdougall on the north river and mason of virginia are asking what they are to do with the appliants to them the virginia line has sustained a violent shock in this instance not less than ninety have already resigned to me the same conduct has prevailed among the officers from the other states though not yet to so considerable a degree and there are but too just grounds to fear that it will shake the very existence of the army unless a remedy is soon very soon applied there is none in my opinion so effectual as the one pointed out  this i trust will satisfy the officers and at the same time it will produce no present additional emission of money     they will not be persuaded to sacrifice all views of present interest and encounter the numerous vicissitudes of war in the defence of their country unless she will be generous enough on her part to make a decent provision for their future support i do not pronounce absolutely that we shall have no army if the establishment fails but the army we may have will be without discipline without energy incapable of acting with vigor and destitute of those cements necessary to promise success on the one hand or to withstand the shocks of adversity on the other it is indeed hard to say how extensive the evil may be if the measure should be rejected or much longer delayed i find it a very arduous task to keep the officers in tolerable humor and to protract such a combination in quitting the service as might possibly undo us for ever the difference between our service and that of the enemy is very striking with us from the peculiar unhappy situation of things the officer a few instances excepted must break in upon his private fortune for present support without a prospect of future relief with them even companies are esteemed so honorable and so valuable that they have sold of late from fifteen to twentytwo hundred pounds sterling and i am credibly informed that four thousand guineas have been given for a troop of dragoons you will readily determine how this difference will operate what effects it must produce men may speculate as they will they may talk of patriotism they may draw a few examples from   0 ancient story of great achievements performed by its influence but whoever builds upon them as a sufficient basis for conducting a long and bloody war will find themselves deceived in the end we must take the passions of men as nature has given them and those principles as a guide which are generally the rule of action i do not mean to exclude altogether the idea of patriotism i know it exists and i know it has done much in the present contest but i will venture to assert that a great and lasting war can never be supported on this principle alone it must be aided by a prospect of interest or some reward for a time it may of itself push men to action to bear much to encounter difficulties but it will not endure unassisted by interest the necessity of putting the army upon a respectable footing both as to numbers and constitution is now become more essential than ever the enemy are beginning to play a game more dangerous than their efforts by arms though these will not be remitted in the smallest degree and which threatens a fatal blow to the independence of america and to her liberties of course they are endeavoring to ensnare the people by specious allurements of peace it is not improbable they have had such abundant cause to be tired of the war that they may be sincere in the terms they offer which though far short of our pretensions will be extremely flattering to minds that do not penetrate far into political consequences but whether they are sincere or not they may be equally destructive for to discerning men nothing     can be more evident than that a peace on the principles of dependence however limited after what has happened would be to the last degree dishonorable and ruinous  it is however much to be apprehended that the idea of such an event will have a very powerful effect upon the country and if not combated with the greatest address will serve at least to produce supineness and disunion men are naturally fond of peace and there are symptoms which may authorize an opinion that the people of america are pretty generally weary of the present war it is doubtful whether many of our friends might not incline to an accommodation on the grounds held out or which may be rather than persevere in a contest for independence if this is the case it must surely be the truest policy to strengthen the army and place it upon a substantial footing this will conduce to inspire the country with confidence enable those at the head of affairs to consult the public     honor and interest notwithstanding the defection of some and temporary inconsistency and irresolution of others who may desire to compromise the dispute and if a treaty should be deemed expedient will put it in their power to insist upon better terms than they could otherwise expect besides the most vigorous exertions at home to increase and establish our military force upon a good basis it appears to me advisable that we should immediately try the full extent of our interest abroad and bring our european negotiations to an issue i think france must have ratified our independence  and will declare war immediately on finding that serious proposals of accommodation are made but lest from a mistaken policy or too exalted an opinion of our power from the representations she has had she should still remain indecisive it were to be wished proper persons were instantly despatched or our envoys already there instructed to insist pointedly on her coming to a final determination  it cannot     be fairly supposed that she will hesitate a moment to declare war if she is given to understand in a proper manner that a reunion of the two countries may be the consequence of procrastination a european war and a european alliance would effectually answer our purposes if the step i now mention should be eligible despatches ought to be sent at once by different conveyances for fear of accidents i confess it appears to me a measure of this kind could not but be productive of the most salutary consequences if possible i should also suppose it absolutely necessary to obtain good intelligence from england pointing out the true springs of this manœuvre of ministry the preparations of force they are making the prospects there are of raising it the amount and when it may be expected it really seems to me from a comprehensive view     of things that a period is fast approaching big with events of the most interesting importance when the counsels we pursue and the part we act may lead decisively to liberty or to slavery under this idea i cannot but regret that inactivity that inattention that want of something which unhappily i have but too often experienced in our public affairs i wish that our representation in congress was complete and full from every state and that it was formed of the first abilities among us whether we continue to war or proceed to negotiate the wisdom of america in council cannot be too great our situation will be truly delicate to enter into a negotiation too hastily or to reject it altogether may be attended with consequences equally fatal the wishes of the people seldom founded in deep disquisitions or resulting from other reasonings than their present feelings may not entirely accord with our true policy and interest if they do not to observe a proper line of conduct for promoting the one and avoiding offence to the other will be a work of great difficulty nothing short of independence it appears to me can possibly do a peace on other terms would if i may be allowed the expression be a peace of war the injuries we have received from the british nation were so unprovoked and have been so great and so many that they can never be forgotten besides the feuds the jealousies the animosities that would ever attend a union with them besides the importance the advantages we should derive from an unrestricted commerce our fidelity as a people our gratitude     our character as men are opposed to a coalition with them as subjects but in case of the last extremity were we easily to accede to terms of dependence no nation upon future occasions let the oppressions of britain be never so flagrant and unjust would interpose for our relief or at most they would do it with a cautious reluctance and upon conditions most probably that would be hard if not dishonorable to us france by her supplies has saved us from the yoke thus far and a wise and virtuous perseverance would and i trust will free us entirely i have sent congress lord norths speech and the two bills offered by him to parliament they are spreading fast through the country and will soon become a subject of general notoriety i therefore think they had best be published in our papers and persons of leisure and ability set to work to counteract the impressions they may make on the minds of the people before i conclude there are one or two points more upon which i will add an observation or two the first is the indecision of congress and the delay used in coming to determinations on matters referred to them this is productive of a variety of inconveniences and an early decision in many cases though it should be against the measure submitted would be attended with less pernicious effects some new plan might then be tried but while the matter is held in suspense nothing can be attempted the other point is the jealousy which congress unhappily entertain of the army and which if reports are right     some members labor to establish you may be assured there is nothing more injurious or more unjustly founded this jealousy stands upon the commonly received opinion which under proper limitations is certainly true that standing armies are dangerous to a state and from forming the same conclusion of the component parts of all though they are totally dissimilar in their nature the prejudices in other countries have only gone to them in time of peace and these from their not having in general cases any of the ties the concerns or interests of citizens or any other dependence than what flowed from their military employ in short from their being mercenaries hirelings it is our policy to be prejudiced against them in time of war  though they are citizens having all the ties and interests of citizens and in most cases property totally unconnected with the military line if we would pursue a right system of policy in my opinion there should be none of these distinctions we should all be considered congress and army as one people embarked in one cause in one interest acting on the same principle and to the same end the distinction the jealousies set up or perhaps only incautiously let out can answer not a single good purpose they are impolitic in the extreme among individuals the most certain way to make a man your enemy is to tell him you esteem him such so with public bodies and the very jealousy which the narrow politics of some may affect to entertain of the army in order to a due subordination to the     supreme civil authority is a likely mean to produce a contrary effect to incline it to the pursuit of those measures which they may wish it to avoid it is unjust because no order of men in the thirteen states has paid a more sanctimonious regard to their proceedings than the army and indeed it may be questioned whether there has been that scrupulous adherence had to them by any other for without arrogance or the smallest deviation from truth it may be said that no history now extant can furnish an instance of an armys suffering such uncommon hardships as ours has done and bearing them with the same patience and fortitude to see men without clothes to cover their nakedness without blankets to lie on without shoes by which their marches might be traced by the blood from their feet and almost as often without provisions as with them marching through the frost and snow and at christmas taking up their winterquarters within a days march of the enemy without a house or hut to cover them till they could be built and submitting to it without a murmur is a proof of patience and obedience which in my opinion can scarce be paralleled there may have been some remonstrances or applications to congress in the style of complaint from the army and slaves indeed should we be if this privilege were denied on account of their proceedings in particular instances but these will not authorize nor even excuse a jealousy that they are therefore aiming at unreasonable powers or making strides dangerous or subversive of civil authority things     should not be viewed in that light more especially as congress in some cases have relieved the injuries complained of  which had flowed from their own acts i refer you to my letter to yourself and colo lee which accompanies this upon the subject of money for such of the old virginia troops as have or may reinlist in respect to the volunteer plan i scarce know what opinion to give at this time the propriety of a requisition on this head will depend altogether on our operations such kind of troops should not be called for but upon the spur of the occasion and at the moment of executing an enterprise they will not endure a long service and of all men in the military line they are the most impatient of restraint and necessary government as the propositions and the speech of lord north must be founded in the despair of the nation of succeeding against us or from a rupture in europe that has actually happened or certainly will happen  or from some deep political manœuvre or from what     i think still more likely a composition of the whole would it not be good policy in this day of uncertainty and distress to the tories to avail ourselves of the occasion and for the several states to hold out pardon c to all delinquents returning by a certain day  they are frightened and this is the time to operate upon them upon a short consideration of the matter it appears to me that such a measure would detach the tories from the enemy and bring things to a much speedier conclusion and of course be a mean of saving much public treasure i will now be done and i trust that you excuse not only the length of my letter but the freedom with which i have delivered my sentiments in the course of it upon several occasions the subjects struck me as important and interesting and i have only to wish that they may appear to you in the same light i am dear sir with great regard c  george washington    april      valley forge majorgeneral mcdougall to majorgeneral mcdougall headquarters valley forge    april      dear sir i am perfectly satisfied with your delay of the enterprise proposed by you as i am certain it has been   0 founded upon substantial reasons congress having by their resolve of the   th instant directed general gates to resume the command of the northern department and to repair forthwith to fishkill for that purpose i imagine he will proceed immediately thither upon his arrival there i must desire you to return to this army and take the command of your division  as colonel la radière and colonel kosciuszko will never agree i think it will be best to order la radière to return especially as you say kosciuszko is better adapted to the genius and temper of the people it is painful to reflect upon the number of valuable officers who have been obliged to quit the service on account of the disproportion between their pay and every necessary of life i do not yet know what congress will determine as to the new arrangement and provision for the army but if the gentlemen mentioned by you are such as will be an acquisition to the service i would wish you to endeavor to persuade them to remain until they see what congress will do if they cannot be prevailed upon to wait till that time you will see that they are not indebted     to their regiments or to the public and give them discharges i am c george washington    april      valley forge charles lee to majorgeneral charles lee valley forge    april      dear sir mr boudinot at commissary lorings request met him at germantown yesterday from whence he is just returned after having agreed on a final exchange of yourself and other officers with that gentleman that delay may not produce danger i shall send in a flag tomorrow for your parole when obtained i shall most cordially and sincerely congratulate you on your restoration to your country and to the army i could not however refrain till the happy event should take place rejoicing with you on the probability of it nor from expressing my wish of seeing you in camp as soon as you can possibly make it convenient to yourself after you are perfectly at liberty to take an active part with us of which i shall not delay giving you the earliest notice i have received your favor of the   th instant from yorktown the contents shall be the subject of conversation when i have the pleasure of seeing you in circumstances to mount your hobbyhorse which i hope will not on trial be found quite so limping a jade as the one you set out to york on i am c      george washington    april      valley forge to the president of congress valley forge    april      sir i take the liberty to transmit to you a letter which i received yesterday from governor tryon enclosing the drafts of the two bills i forwarded before with his certificate of the manner in which they came to his hands accompanied by his more extraordinary and impertinent request that through my means the contents should be communicated to the officers and men of this army this engine of the ministry from governor livingstons account is very industriously circulating copies of these drafts in obedience to their and his royal masters mandates the letter which i enclose and a triplicate came to hand at one time some future conveyance it is probable will present me the duplicate      i would also take the liberty to enclose to you the evening post no     which governor livingston was so obliging as to send me yesterday were we not fully satisfied from our experience that there are no artifices no measures too black or wicked for the enemy or their adherents to attempt in order to promote their views we might be astonished at the daring confidence in defiance of the opinion of the world manifested in a publication of this paper purporting a resolution of congress of the  0th of february this proceeding is infamous to the last degree and calculated to produce the most baneful consequences by exciting an opposition in the people to our drafting system and embarrassing at least the only probable mode now left us for raising men i think it of great importance that the forgery should     be announced in the most public manner and am the more induced to this opinion from governor livingstons account of the disagreeable operation it has had and is still likely to produce if not contradicted if it is and with a few strictures i should hope that it will excite in the breasts of all our countrymen a just and generous contempt of the enemy for such a dirty wicked proceeding i was last night honored with your favor of the   th instant with the proceedings alluded to a general plan of operations for the compaign is indispensably essential to be settled i have thought much upon the subject and some propositions respecting it were put in the hands of all the general officers here on tuesday evening for their consideration i also intended to send a messenger this day to meet general gates supposing him to be on his way to hudsons river and to request his call at this camp that we might enter into a full and free discussion of the point there is not a moment to be delayed in forming some general system in my opinion and i only wait the arrival of generals gates and mifflin to summon a council for the purpose i have the honor to be c ps—it is confidently reported and i have little doubt of the truth of it that sir william howe is recalled and that general clinton is to succeed him in the command  i have also the pleasure to transmit     a list of sundry officers exchanged on the   st instant  george washington    april      valley forge gouverneur morris to gouverneur morris in congress valley forge    april      dear sir i received your obliging favor of the   th instant yesterday evening i thank you much for the explanatory hints it contains and could have wished it had come to hand a little sooner i have many things to say to you but as the express who will deliver you this is going with despatches that will not admit of delay i shall content myself with taking notice of one matter that appears to me to require immediate remedy  the resolution of congress directs the council to be formed of majorgenerals and the chief engineer who you say is to be a member officially by this the commanding officer of artillery is negatively     excluded who by the practice of armies and from the very nature of his appointment is more officially a member than the other according to my ideas both or neither ought to be there or if an official preference is due to one more than the other it is to the commander in the artillery line i do not know what motives induced the discrimination in this instance but i should suppose it will at least be felt and i will further add though prejudices may be entertained by some against general knox there is no department in the army that has been conducted with greater propriety or to more advantage than the one in which he presides and owing principally if not wholly to his management surely whatever plans may be come into the artillery will have no small share in the execution you say all will yet be well i wish it heartily but am much mistaken if there are not some secret and retrograde springs in motion to disprove it i wish you could announce the provision for officers concluded it seems to me the basis of all our operations resignation after resignation is taking place not here only but of officers acting east of hudsons river i am with great esteem and regard dear sir c      george washington    april      valley forge to the president of congress valley forge    april      sir i beg leave to inform congress that the report of the commissioners coming according to intelligence received yesterday by a person of philadelphia is confidently believed and it is there thought that they will very soon arrive  i think it almost certain that the matter will not be delayed as the conduct of the ministry in not sending them immediately after their former propositions has been much reprobated and as it may be of much importance to improve the first impressions of the people upon the occasion lord amherst admiral keppel and general murray are said to be the persons appointed  and it is likely they are vested with both civil and military powers the information was through the channel of a sensible intelligent man well known and of esteemed credit he is connected with the british army having two or three brothers in it i shall transmit the earliest accounts i receive from time to time on this very interesting subject i have the honor to be c      george washington    april      valley forge governor livingston to governor livingston valley forge    april      sir i received yesterday your favor of the   th instant with the papers alluded to your reasoning upon the subject of deserters attending flags is certainly right and not to be disputed their appearing in that character is an additional crime and it is the practice of war in such instances founded in principles of common reason and the delicacy of truces to execute them immediately this is the custom in general cases how far the circumstances which attended the enlistment of job hetfield require a discrimination in his favor     is a point perhaps of some difficulty i find by inquiry of general maxwell that he was enlisted and sworn but that there was a sort of coercion which might distinguish it from an act perfectly free and voluntary upon the whole i think his detention and confinement justifiable which i would prefer to capital punishment at the same time you will permit me to observe that from the expediency of flags and the necessity of such an intercourse between warring powers it is the constant usage for the party detaining executing c to inform the other side of the reasons i have taken the freedom to commit to your care a letter for majorgeneral tryon which you will be pleased to send by a flag to staten island or to such other post as you may deem most proper i transmit you a copy of our correspondence which on his part is pretty similar it is probable to his addresses to your officers determined that i should get some of his obliging letters he made out a first a second and a third all of the same tenor and date i am persuaded you will be under some difficulty which to admire most his impertinence or his folly i am dear sir c   00 george washington    april      valley forge to the president of congress valley forge    april      sir i had the honor yesterday afternoon to receive your letter of the   th continued to the   th with its important enclosures congress will be pleased to accept my sincere thanks for the fresh instance of confidence manifested in their resolution of the   d and other proceedings and they may rest assured that whatever powers are trusted to me shall be invariably directed to promote the interests of these states if in any case there should be a misapplication or a failure in the execution it will be the effect of mistake and not of design i shall take measures for distributing the report of the committee on lord norths bills and the resolution of the   d inviting delinquents to return to their allegiance and to the protection of these states  this proceeding appears to me founded in great good policy and i should hope that it will be attended with many valuable consequences but this can only be proved by the event  0  though i wish most heartily for the aid of general lee in council and upon every other occasion yet as the time of his return is uncertain or at least it will be several days before it takes place and as it seems to me that there is not a moment to lose in forming some general system for our operations i should think it inexpedient for general gates to delay coming to camp till his arrival  after a plan is digested there will be a great deal of time expended before things will be in a proper train for execution the season is fast advancing and the period which may be most favorable for any designs we may form will presently arrive i take the liberty to transmit an extract of a letter from genl heath which will shew congress that he is pressed on all sides for money governor livingston too is apprehensive he will be under embarrassments on account of the purchase of horses in consequence of the recommendation of the committee their letter to him by some means has been mislaid in the assembly and he does not know exactly the mode prescribed for the payment i cannot inform him myself or do what perhaps is more necessary furnish him with money and therefore  0  hope that congress or the committee will i have written majorgeneral tryon a few lines in answer to his letter a copy of which is enclosed i have the honor to be c  george washington    april      valley forge majorgeneral heath to majorgeneral heath valley forge    april      dear sir your two favors of the  th    th instant have been duly received i am glad to hear that general burgoyne is gone and i wish his departure had been much earlier at the time of his capture he certainly must have entertained very favorable impressions of our force and perhaps in point of good policy he should have been allowed to depart before they were in the smallest degree done away and before he could have obtained any accurate ideas of our affairs he must yet in vindication of his conduct speak largely of our powers    it is astonishing that officers will in direct violation of the resolution of congress my recruiting instructions and the most evident principles of policy founded in experience persevere in enlisting deserters from the british army supposing it might be done in any case yet there is every possible objection to the measure in the instance of deserters from general burgoynes army these troops did not originally come into our hands through choice they were  0  conquered brought to our possession by compulsion those apprehensive of punishment in case of return which may operate on the minds of deserters they feel nothing of so far from the most distant chance of punishment they will be applauded by the commander of the british army for their fidelity and attachment to their prince and their enlisting with us will be considered as a high stroke of policy and the only probable mode they could adopt to effect their escape we are counting on men who cannot be confided in and who will embrace the earliest opportunity to leave us and strengthen the enemy at the expense of arms clothes and bounty on our part  but very few if any of those who deserted from general burgoyne and who came on with the two detachments under lieutenantcolonel smith now remain with him they are gone in like manner a detachment from colonel henley  which marched from boston sixty strong arrived here two or three days ago with thirteen men only and had it not been for a detachment of new hampshire troops it  0  is highly probable one of them would not have been seen thirty of the sixty are now in easton jail having formed a plan at that place to go off in a body the rest except thirteen had escaped before if we would wish to reinforce the enemy with the whole of mr burgoynes army we cannot pursue a mode that will be more effectual or more certain than to enlist it into our service but it may be done with less injury by sending them the men unarmed without paying them an exorbitant bounty if nothing else will restrain officers from pursuing such a pernicious ruinous practice they must be made to pay for all expenses and losses occasioned by it indeed there is nothing that can compensate for the injury    i am c george washington  0 april      to the president of congress headquarters  0 april      sir the extensive ill consequences arising from a want of uniformity in discipline and manœuvres throughout the army have long occasioned me to wish for the establishment of a well organized inspectorship and the concurrence of congress in the same views has induced me to set on foot a temporary institution which from the success that has hitherto attended it gives me the most flattering expectations and will i hope obtain their approbation baron de steubens length of service in the first military school in europe and his former rank  0  pointed him out as a person peculiarly qualified to be at the head of this department this appeared the least exceptionable way of introducing him into the army and one that would give him the most ready opportunity of displaying his talents i therefore proposed to him to undertake the office of inspectorgeneral which he agreed to with the greatest cheerfulness and has performed the duties of it with a zeal and intelligence equal to our wishes he has two ranks of inspectors under him the lowest are officers charged with the inspection of brigades with the title of brigadeinspectors the others superintend several of these they have written instructions relative to their several functions and the manœuvres which they are to practise are illustrated by a company which the baron has taken the pains to train himself   0  the brigadeinspectors were chosen by the brigadier and commanding officers of regiments in each brigade the inspectors are lieutenantcolonels barber  of jersey brooks  of massachusetts davis  of virginia and monsieur ternant a french gentleman the reason for employing him apart from his intrinsic merit and abilities was his possessing the french and english languages equally which made him a necessary assistant to baron de steuben he is content to serve without rank until after an experiment of his abilities congress shall determine what he is entitled to upon the arrival of lieutenantcolonel fleury in  0  camp as he was unemployed and had exercised the office of aidmajor in france the baron proposed to have him employed as an inspector in which i readily acquiesced as congress had given him the rank and pay of lieutenantcolnel there may be other foreign officers in continental pay idle for want of being attached to some corps of whose services we might avail ourselves in this way which is the only method of disposing of them unless they could be formed into a distinct corps from the extraordinary fatigue and close attention required of the officers employed in the inspectorship i did not think it amiss to let them entertain hopes that congress would allow some addition to the pay which they derive from their rank and i take the liberty of recommending the measure i would propose twenty dollars per month for the brigadeinspectors and thirty for the inspectors in addition to their pay in the line i should do injustice if i were to be longer silent with regard to the merits of the baron de steuben his knowledge of his profession added to the zeal which he has discovered since he began upon the functions of his office leads me to consider him as an acquisition to the service and to recommend him to the attention of congress his expectations with regard to rank extend to that of majorgeneral his finances he ingenuously confesses will not admit of his serving without the incident emoluments and congress i presume from his character and their own knowledge of him will without difficulty gratify him in these particulars  0  the baron is sensible that our situation requires a few variations in the duties of his office from the general practice in europe and particularly that they must necessarily be more comprehensive in which as well as in his instructions he has skilfully yielded to circumstances the success which has hitherto attended the plan enables me to request with confidence the ratification of congress and is i think a pledge of the establishment of a well combined general system which insurmountable obstacles have hitherto opposed i have the honor to be c  george washington  0 april      valley forge henry laurens to henry laurens valley forge  0 april      dear sir i thank you much for your obliging favor of the   th i think with you that a most important crisis is now at hand and that there cannot be too much wisdom in all our counsels for conducting our affairs  0  to a safe and happy issue there should in my opinion be a full representation of the states in congress which i have often regretted has not been the case for a long time past i also concur with you in sentiment that gentlemen any where whose abilities might be of essential service in case of treaty with the british commissioners ought to be called forth for the purpose it will be a work of infinite importance and the result may lead to happiness or to misery to freedom or to slavery the enemy are determined to try us by force and by fraud and while they are exerting their utmost powers in the first instance i do not doubt but they will employ men in the second versed in the arts of dissimulation of temporizing negotiating geniuses it appears to me that nothing short of independence can possibly do the injuries we have received from britain can never be forgotten and a peace upon other terms would be the source of perpetual feuds and animosity besides should britain from her love of tyranny and lawless domination attempt again to bend our necks to the yoke of slavery and there is no doubt but she would for her pride and ambition are unconquerable no nation would credit our professions nor grant us aid at any rate their favors would be obtained upon the most disadvantageous and dishonorable terms i sincerely wish the provision for officers so long the subject of discussion was established it is certainly equitable and in my opinion essential day after day and hour after hour produce resignations   0 if they were confined to bad officers or to those of little or no character they would be of no consequence but it is painful to see men who are of a different cast who have rendered great services to their country and who are still and may be most materially wanted leaving the army on account of the distresses of their families and to repair their circumstances which have been much injured by their zeal and the part they have taken in the defence of common rights the provision if adopted would not produce present relief nor a present expense yet it would be a compensation in future for their misfortunes and their toils and be some support to their injured constitutions i will be done after observing if the measure is to be submitted to the legislatures of the several states for their concurrence the delay supposing it should be assented to will i fear be attended with effects that will only be regretted when too late but the chance in such case will be rather against the adoption for there are but few of the legislatures who are impressed with the real state of things or who can without difficulty be fully informed of them and while this matter is held in suspense every thing is at a stand and the most fatal consequences may result from it i do not to this hour know whether putting halfpay out of the question the old or new establishment is to take place how to dispose of the officers in consequence whether the instituting several other corps as agreed to by the committee and referred by them to congress is adopted or not in     a word i have no ground to form a single arrangement upon nor do i know whether the augmentation of the cavalry is to take place or was rejected in order that i may govern myself thereby equally unable am i to answer the incessant applications of the officers of the pennsylvania and additional battalions who knowing the intended reduction of some of these corps are held in suspense uncertain what part to act in short our present situation now the first of may is beyond description irksome and dangerous but i will trouble you no further than to assure you that i am dear sir c end of vol vi   a letter to general greene of this date is written from the city tavern at

account that the enemys fleet left the capes of delaware yesterday and steered eastward again i shall return again with the utmost expedition to the north river but as a sudden stroke is certainly intended by this manœuver i beg you will immediately call in every man of the militia that you possibly can to strengthen the highland posts the importance of fort montgomery is such that i wish you

governor george clinton   august      as washington feared that if any of the troops enter this city philadelphia it will only tend to debauch them they were ordered to halt at germantown and strict orders given that no officer or soldier was to come into philadelphia on any account on the  d word was brought that the fleet was again off the capes which produced such uncertainty as to induce washington to issue the order summarized in the first paragraph of his letter to governor trumbull of august  th with respect to the tory who was tried and executed by your order though his crime was heinous enough to deserve the fate he met with and though i am convinced you acted in the affair with a good intention yet i cannot but wish it had not happened in the first place it was a matter that did not come within the jurisdiction of martial law and therefore the whole proceeding was irregular and illegal and will have a tendency to excite discontent jealousy and murmurs among the people in the second if the trial could properly have been made by a courtmartial as the division you command is only a detachment from the army and you cannot have been considered as in a separate department there is none of our articles of war that will justify your inflicting a capital punishment even on a soldier much less on a citizen i mention these things for your future government as what is past cannot be recalled the temper of the americans and the principles on which the present contest turns will not countenance proceedings of this nature—washington to brigadiergeneral deborre   august      from the representation made to me respecting brown  murphy i then thought it became necessary to execute one of them by way of example but as you are of opinion that the necessity is in some degree removed and from late discoveries that there is a possibility of their not being guilty you have my free consent to pardon them both as it is my most sincere wish that whenever we are guilty of an error in matters of this nature it may be on the side of mercy and forgiveness—washington to general sullivan  0 august        congress had resolved on the  st of august that general schuyler should repair to headquarters and that general washington should be directed to order such general officer as he should think proper to repair to the northern department to relieve majorgeneral schuyler in his command it was in consequence of this resolve that the above letter was written the day after the resolve was passed general washington received a letter from the new england delegates in congress as follows— as congress have authorized your excellency to send a proper officer to take the command in the northern department we take the liberty to signify to your excellency that in our opinion no man will be more likely to restore harmony order and discipline and retrieve our affairs in that quarter than majorgeneral gates he has on experience acquired the confidence and stands high in the esteem of the eastern states and troops with confidence in your wisdom we cheerfully submit it to your excellencys consideration and have taken this method to communicate our sentiments judging it would give you less trouble than a personal application we are with great esteem your excellencys most obedient and most humble servants the original of this paper is in the handwriting of samuel adams and is signed by the following names in the order in which they here stand john adams nathaniel folsom samuel adams henry marchant elbridge gerry eliphalet dyer william williams an unreasonable prejudice existed against general schuyler among the people of the new england states and was so strongly expressed in congress as to lead to his suspension from command history has done full justice to the patriotism and activity of schuyler of whose efforts gates reaped the advantage—sparks   read in congress august  th   the plan recommended by congress was that each state should be divided into districts and a person be appointed to raise recruits in each district the whole to be under the direction of the state authorities security was to be taken of every such agent for a faithful discharge of his duty and as a full compensation for his trouble and expense he was to receive eight dollars for every ablebodied recruit that he should enlist for three years or during the war the same agent was empowered to take up deserters and allowed five dollars for every deserter he should secure the recruits were moreover permitted to join any regiment or company which they should choose at the time they enlisted if such regiment or company was not already full and in that case they might choose any other general washington was directed to call in all the continental officers then absent on the recruiting service except such as were necessary to receive recruits and march them to the army—journals july   st   this letter was likewise sent as a circular to all the states north

reinforcement can immediately be sent but as i would not wish to weaken you as the enemy seem to bend their course again towards you without consulting you i desire that you and the general officers would consider the matter fully and if you think you can spare cortlandts and livingstons regiments that they may be put in readiness to move i have ordered the heavy baggage of the army to be thrown over delaware again and hold the men in constant readiness to march the moment we receive any accounts of the enemy i very much approve of your throwing redoubts and obstructions at the entrance of the passes near your posts as they with the natural strength of the ground must render the approach of an enemy extremely difficult without considerable loss—washington to majorgeneral putnam   august

determination of this court who will i dare say give the world a full and impartial account of the whole proceeding and condemn or acquit as matters upon the fullest examination will appear to

delaware on this day week if they had intended back to the hook we must have heard of their arrival there long before this time as the winds have been constantly fair as the sickly season has commenced to the southward and there is no capital object there i cannot conceive that they are gone that way i can therefore only conclude that they intend to go round long island into the sound or still farther eastward if they do either of these it must be upon a plan of cooperating with genl burgoyne who as matters are going on will find little difficulty of penetrating to albany for by the last accounts our army had fallen down to saratoga—washington to majorgeneral putnam   august        congress decided that general prescott lately captured by colonel barton should be retained as a

upon such terms as he should judge expedient without regard to the previous resolutions of congress respecting colonel campbell and the hessian fieldofficers the question of general arnolds rank was brought before congress on the  th of august and a majority voted against his being restored party considerations seem to have mingled in the affair seven states were in the negative and four in the affirmative the latter being new hampshire rhode island connecticut and georgia this was the first occasion on which the yeas and nays were entered in the journals of the old congress it was often

all events there is great attention paid to this city it is true it is one of the finest upon the continent but in my opinion is an object of far less importance than the north river our position in the jerseys was calculated to cover the north river and philadelphia and afford protection to the state of new jersey but the cry was so great for the salvation of philadelphia that the general was prevailed upon to leave coryells ferry contrary to his judgment and march down to the city and i expect to have our labors for our pains we are now within about twenty miles of the city and waiting to

great satisfaction if your efforts are seasonably and skilfully seconded by your eastern neighbors we may hope that general burgoyne will find it equally difficult to make a further progress or to effect a retreat you are the best judge with respect to the length of service to be required from the militia however as their assistance is a resource which must be sparingly employd i would have them detaind no longer than is absolutely necessary the excuse of want of confidence in general officers which has hitherto been alleged by the eastern states for withholding those reinforcements from the northern army which were expected of them will be obviated by the presence of majorgenl gates—washington to governor clinton    august        richard dorsey william bird george gray john craig and

it consistent with that strict notion of honor which should be the invariable rule of conduct for every officer but am of opinion nevertheless that a resignation in this part of a campaign can only be warranted by treatment which would be disgraceful to bear  therefore that your resolution not to resign at least till the end of the campaign must meet the approbation of all who wish to see you act with propriety—washington to the same lieutanants    august        the people in the northern army seem so intimidated by the indians that i have determined to send up colonel morgans corps of

august        i was just now informed that lieut mcnaire of the artillery has been arrested and stands bound over to the nearest court to be held for hertford county for enlisting two men to serve in one of the continental regiments of artillery this it is said is in consequence of an act of your assembly by which all officers are prohibited from enlisting men within the state unless they are of the regiments belonging to it i have never seen the law and therefore cannot pretend to determine how far the prohibition extends but should suppose it was only designed to prevent the officers of other states enlisting men to fill up the regiments assigned to their quota so far it appears to me the act would be founded on the strictest justice but when there is an absolute necessity for artillery corps—when three such regiments were ordered to be raised by congress without being apportioned on any particular state certainly each should furnish a proportion of men this case is quite otherwise all in this line now with the army have been enlisted in the new england states a few excepted and the greatest part in that of massachusetts over and above their quota of the    battalions first voted and a proportion of the additional    i will not say anything of the policy or impolicy of the act if it has a more extensive operation than i have supposed it to have but i would take the liberty to observe that in my opinion it would be for the advantage of the states if each of em had men employed in this important branch of war not to add that the whole ought to contribute equally to the filling of all corps that are deemed essential and which are not allotted to any individual one—washington to the maryland delegates in congress    august        the appointment of the marquis de lafayette as a majorgeneral in the service of the united states took place on the   st of july and is thus recorded in the journals of congress whereas the marquis de lafayette out of his great zeal to the cause of liberty in which the united states are engaged has left his family and connexions and at his own expense come over to offer his service to the united states without pension or particular allowance and is anxious to risk his life in our cause resolved that his service be accepted and that in consideration of his zeal his illustrious family and connexions he have the rank and commission of majorgeneral in the army of the united states i remember well a conversations passing betwixt you and i on the subject of the marquis de la fyattes commission and that i told you it was merely honorary in this light i lookd on it and so did every other member of congress he had made an agreement with mr deane but this he gave up by letter to congress not wishing as he said to embarrass their affairs mr duer who presented this letter assurd us he did not wish or desire command but gave us to understand his chief motive for going into our service was to be near you to see service and to give him an eclat at home where he expected he would soon return these you may depend on it were the reasons that induced congress to comply with his request and that he could not have obtaind the commission on any other terms the other day he surprised every body by a letter of his requesting commissions for his officers and insinuating at the same time that he should expect a command as soon as you should think him fit for one depend on it congress never meant that he should have one nor will not countenance him in his applications—benjamin harrison to washington  0 august

late success this way i am told the army were quite panic struck by the indians and their tory and canadian assassins in indian dress   in the council of war it was decided as the unanimous opinion of the board of officers first that the enemys fleet had most probably sailed for charleston secondly that it was not expedient for the army to march southward as it could not possibly arrive at charleston in time to afford any succor thirdly that the army should move immediately towards the north river the marquis de lafayette took part for the first time in the council of war convened on this occasion and attended with the rank of majorgeneral congress approved this decision on the same day that the above letter was written but intelligence arrived the next morning that the british fleet had been seen far up the chesapeake bay and was communicated to general washington by president hancock in a letter dated august   d at halfpast one oclock in the afternoon as follows this moment an express arrived from maryland with an account of near two hundred sail of general howes fleet being at anchor in the chesapeake bay in consequence of this advice congress have ordered the immediate removal of the stores and prisoners from lancaster and york in this state to places of greater safety this intelligence of course immediately changed the plan of operations   by the enclosed which has this moment come to hand you will perceive that the enemys fleet have at length fairly entered the chesapeake bay swan point being at least two hundred miles up i desire you will immediately forward this account to govr trumbull to be by him sent on the eastward as there is not now the least danger of general howes going to new england i hope the whole force of that country will turn out and by following the great stroke struck by genl stark near bennington entirely crush genl burgoyne who by his letter to colonel baum seems to be in want of almost every thing i hope you will draw in such a force of militia as will effectually secure your post against any attempt from new york i shall be obliged to draw genl sullivan with his division down to me for by genl howes coming so far up chesapeake he must mean to reach philadelphia by that rout tho to be sure it is a very strange one—washington to majorgeneral putnam    august        on the   st congress approved the determination of

for their destination i desire you will immediately send for general potter and give him directions to come on to me with all possible expedition you must supply his place in the best manner you can the first attempts of the enemy will be to seize horses carriages and cattle with light parties and we must endeavor to check them at their outset whatever militia are at philadelphia and equipped

joined by more force from this state by the militia of the eastern shore of maryland by richardsons battalion i would have you move as near the enemy as you can with safety   having endeavored at the solicitation of the count de pulaski to think of some mode for employing him in our service there is none occurs to me liable to so few inconveniences and exceptions as the giving him the command of the horse this department is still without a head as i have not in the present deficiency of brigadiers with the army thought it advisable to take one from the foot for that command the nature of the horse service with us being such that they commonly act in detachment a general officer with them is less necessary than at the head of the brigades of infantry in the absence of general smallwood who is ordered to put himself at the head of the maryland militia we shall have two brigades without general officers but though the horse will suffer less from the want of a general officer than the foot a man of real capacity experience and knowledge in that service might be extremely useful the count appears by his recommendations to have sustained no inconsiderable military character in his own country and as the principal attention in poland has been for some time past paid to the cavalry it is to be presumed this gentleman is not unacquainted with it i submit it to congress how far it may be eligible to confer the appointment i have mentioned upon him they will be sensible of all the objections attending the measure without my particularizing them and can determine accordingly this gentleman we are told has been like us engaged in defending the liberty and independence of his country and has sacrificed his fortune to his zeal for those objects he derives from hence a title to our respect that ought to operate in his favor as far as the good of the service will permit but it can never be expected we should lose sight of this—washington to the president of congress    august

name general howe assured the inhabitants that the strictest orders had been given for the preservation of regularity and discipline among the soldiers and that the severest punishment would be inflicted on any one who should dare to plunder their property or molest their persons he moreover declared that security and protection would be extended to all persons who should remain peaceably at their usual places of abode and he promised pardon to those who had taken an active part in the rebellion provided they should voluntarily return to their allegiance and surrender themselves to any detachment of the kings forces within a specified time you will scarcely believe it but i can assure you as a fact that he howe never read that curious proclamation issued at the head of elk till

communication and commercial intercourse has been held for a considerable time past with the enemy by many of the inhabitants of the county of essex that these communications have been principally supported by means of flaggs and passports obtained from divers officers of the army under your excellencys command who for some time past have been stationed at elizabeth town newark and other places near the enemys lines under color of these flaggs or permits which from their frequency must be supposed to use the softest term to have been imprudently granted great mischiefs have arisen to these parts of the country—mischiefs i imagine greatly superior to the advantages that may be pretended to be derived from any intelligence that can be gained thereby persons of dubious political characters as i am informed have been sent over provisions for the aid and comfort of the british troops furnished a pernicious and unlawful traffic carried on the little specie left among us collected with the greatest avidity to maintain this execrable trade and the continental currency by that means depreciated opportunities afforded the enemy of circulating their counterfeit bills and the disaffected of

artillery ever since their advanced party was attacked by our light troops under general maxwell who crossed the brandywine for that purpose and had posted his men on some high grounds on each side of the road the fire from our people was not of long duration as the enemy pressed on in force but was very severe what loss the enemy sustained cannot be ascertained with precision but from our situation and briskness of the attack it is the general opinion particularly of those who were engaged that they had at least three hundred men killed and wounded our damage is not exactly known but from the best accounts we have been able to obtain it does not exceed fifty in the whole after this affair the enemy halted upon the heights where they have remained ever since except a detachment of them which filed off about eleven oclock from their left and which has since passed the brandywine at joness ford between five and six miles above chads the amount of it is not known the accounts respecting it being various some making it two or three thousand strong and others more generals sullivan stirling and stephens with their divisions are gone in pursuit and to attack it if they can with any prospect of success there has been a scattering loose fire between our parties on each side of the creek since the action in the morning which just now became warm when general maxwell pushed over with his corps and drove them from their ground with the loss of thirty men left dead on the spot among them a captain of the fortyninth and a number of intrenching tools with which they were throwing up a battery at half after four oclock the enemy attacked general sullivan at the ford next above this and the action has been very violent ever since it still continues a very severe cannonade has begun here too and i suppose we shall have a very hot evening i hope it will be a happy one having more materially considered the situation and circumstances of the enemy since colo hamilton wrote you this morning it appears to me that the forces under your command cannot be employed to so much advantage in any way as by falling on the enemys rear and attacking them as often as possible i am persuaded many advantages will result from this measure it will greatly retard their march and give us time and will also oblige them either to keep a strong guard with their sick and wounded with which they must now be much incumbered or to send em back to their shipping under a large escort which you will have an opportunity of attacking with a good prospect of success add to these considerations that before you could join me by a circuitous march and your troops were rested matters might be brought to a crisis i therefore wish you to pursue the line of conduct i have pointed out and must urge you to every possible degree of diligence and despatch—washington to general smallwood derby    september        it is told of this letter that washington after the fatigues of this day was too wearied to write to congress and directed one of his aides to do it harrison was too distressed and so it fell to pickering the adjutantgeneral i wrote it and gave it to the

obstinate action to quit the field—with the loss of some men and artillery but from every account we have reason to believe the enemy suffered much more than we did in the number of killed and wounded—our troops have not lost their spirits and i am in hopes we shall soon have an opportunity of compensating for the disaster we have just sustained we brought the army to this place to refresh them with convenience and security and are just beginning our march to return towards the enemy—washington to general heath    september        congress had ordered washington to appoint a proper

give place to our necessities we must if possible accommodate the soldiery with such articles as they stand in need of or we shall have just reasons to apprehend the most injurious and alarming consequences from the approaching season    the business you are upon i know is disagreeable and perhaps in the execution you may meet with more obstacles than were at first apprehended and also with opposition to the parties i have mentioned call in such a number of militia as you may think necessary observing however over the conduct of the whole a strict discipline to prevent every species of rapine and disorder—washington to hamilton    september      i am glad you have began the collection of blankets and shoes this business cannot be carried to too great an extent and i think if the

have effected it and if not a general attack would have been made on their front had not my views unfortunately been totally frustrated by a most severe rain which came on the day preceeding that of

advice of a council of officers ordered two frigates the delaware and montgomery each of twentyfour guns the sloop fly and several galleys and gondolas to move up to philadelphia and commence a cannonade on the town should the enemy persist in erecting fortifications the delaware anchored within five hundred yards of the batteries and the other vessels took such stations as were suited to their object at ten oclock on the morning of the   th the cannonade began but on the falling of the tide the delaware grounded in this disabled condition the guns from the batteries soon compelled her colors to be struck and she was taken by the enemy a schooner was likewise driven on shore but the other frigate and small craft returned to their former station near the fort the suspicion that the

peaceable inhabitants residing in their houses i am constrained from a regard to their sufferings and a sense of the duty i owe to the public to forewarn you of the calamities which may ensue and to express my abhorrence of such a proceeding at the same time i am inclined to believe that the outrages already committed have not been in consequence of your orders and that this early notice will engage you to put an effectual stop to them if not i do in the most direct terms disclaim any share in creating the general scene of distress among the inhabitants which such destruction must inevitably cause with due respect i am c w howe   it is interesting to observe that in the midst of solemn and important affairs and the forms of official station there was room for courtesy and civil

break of day we attacked them upon two quarters upon both of which we were successful but the morning was so exceedingly foggy that we could not see the confusion the enemy were in and the advantage we had gained and fearing to push too far through a strong village we retired after an engagement of two hours bringing off all our artillery with us we did not know till after the affair was over how near we were to gaining a complete victory but we have since learnt from deserters and others who have come out that preparations were making to retreat to chester while the action lasted it was pretty severe our loss will amount in killed and wounded to upwards of three hundred this estimate of the loss was founded on loose returns in writing to his brother on the   th of october general washington described the loss as being about one thousand men in killed wounded and missing general howe in his official despatch stated the american loss to be between two and three hundred killed about six hundred wounded and upwards of four hundred taken this is doubtless an exaggeration   on september   d washington appointed baron darendt to the command of fort island it is of the utmost importance he wrote to prevent the enemys land forces and fleet from forming a junction which it is almost morally certain they will attempt by seizing on fort island below philadelphia if it is possible and thereby gain the navigation of the delaware by weighing and removing the chevauxdefrise which have been sunk for that purpose this post fort island if maintained will be of the last consequence and will effectually hinder them from union    the defence is extremely interesting to the united states illness prevented the barons accepting the appointment and the command devolved upon lieutenantcolonel samuel smith   we shall have a large reinforcement from the northward and southward in a day or two and you may assure the officers of the army and navy that no time shall be lost in following our blow effectually and thereby giving relief to all our posts i think this may be so much sooner effected by keeping our whole force together and acting powerfully with them that i shall pursue that course rather than detach a part to operate against their detachments for you must be very sensible that if their main body is defeated their small parties must fall of course i beg

officers who are under the imputation of cowardice or whose characters in other respects are impeachable are to be noted as the general is determined to discriminate between the good and bad this order is to be confined to promotion no new appointments will take place at this time owing to the weak state of the regiments—orderly book  0 october        the enemy erected a battery on the  th of september at the mouth of the schuylkill to secure the passage at webbs ferry commodore hazelwood sent several galleys to attack the battery which was silenced in a short time in the night of the  0th the enemy crossed webbs ferry and erected a redoubt opposite the fort within two musketshots of the blockhouse as soon as the redoubt was discovered in the morning the commodore despatched three galleys and a floating battery to attack it which was so well executed that one lieutenant one ensign and fiftysix privates were compelled to surrender themselves prisoners of war—hazelwoods ms letter

soon destroy my small party i have already sent away six men and one officer sick besides this we have seven more in garrison unfit for duty however if they keep their men in the marshes two or three days they must in this weather become equally sickly from the number of the enemy we saw on the shore i am of the opinion that they have at least seven hundred and fifty men perhaps a thousand i have

army and that of course great things are expected from it t is the army of whose superior prowess some have boasted what shame then and dishonor will attend us if we suffer ourselves in every instance to be outdone we have a force sufficient by the favor of heaven to crush our foe and nothing is wanting but a spirited persevering exertion of it to which besides the motives before mentioned duty and

substance an abjuration of all his former opinions but severe and illiberal animadversions on congress and the leaders in the cause of freedom censuring alike their motives and conduct washington he said was the only person who had power to stop the current which was fast hurrying the country to inevitable ruin and on him he called in the voice of entreaty and almost of admonition to represent to congress the indispensable necessity of rescinding the hasty and illadvised declaration of independency —sparks washington merely enclosed the letter to congress where many copies were taken i never intended to make the letter more public than by laying it before congress i thought this a duty which i owed to myself for had any accident happened to the army entrusted to my command and it had ever afterwards appeared that such a letter had been written to and received by me might it not have been said that i had betrayed my country and would not such a correspondence if kept a secret have given good grounds for the suspicion—washington to francis hopkinson    november      more than five years later duché in seeking to pave a way for his return to america gave an explanation of his conduct—

you the highest personal respect and would be happy to be assured under your own hand that he does not labor under your displeasure but that you freely forgive what a weak judgment but a very affectionate heart once presumed to advise many circumstances at present unknown to you conspired to make me deem it my duty to write to you ignorance and simplicity saw not the necessity of your divulging the letter i am convinced however that you could not in your public position do otherwise i cannot say a word in vindication of my conduct but this that i had been for months before distressed with continual apprehensions for you and all my friends without the british lines i looked upon all as gone or that nothing could save you but rescinding the declaration of independency upon this ground alone i presumed to speak not to advise an act of base treachery my soul would have recoiled from the thought not to surrender your army or betray the righteous cause of your country but at the head of that army supporting and supported by them to negotiate with britain for our constitutional rights can you then join with my country in pardoning this error of judgment will you yet honor me with your great interest and influence by recommending at least expressing your approbation of the repeal of an act that keeps me in a state of banishment from my native country from the arms of a dear aged father and the embraces of a numerous circle of valuable and longloved friends your liberal generous mind i am persuaded will never exclude me wholly from your regard for a mere political error especially as you must have heard that since the date of that letter i have led a life of perfect retirement and since my arrival in england have devoted myself wholly to the duties of my profession and confined my acquaintance to a happy circle of literary and religious friends—duché to washington   april      he returned to america in may      and lodged for a few weeks at my

considerable number can be got together under good officers to join this army as you will remain to march with the last detachment i wish you to use all your influence and interest with your legislative body that they may give you all the assistance they can in the completion of this necessary object you can urge with great justice that as long as genl howes army has an existence the adjacent counties will eternally be subject to depredations nor can any thing prevent it but such a union and cooperation of the people as will effectually reduce him to attain which happy end a better opportunity than the present never presented itself    another reason occurs why it is the true interest of your state to give us every aid upon the present occasion which is that if the enemy can once bring up their shipping and get the city secured and fortified for winter quarters it will be so much in their power to make constant incursions into the jerseys that you will be either obliged to submit to repeated heavy losses by being between two fires or keep your militia on foot thro the severity of the winter—washington to general forman    october        mr lee replied i was a good deal surprised to find you had been told congress had appointed general conway a majorgeneral no such appointment has been made nor do i believe it will whilst it is likely to produce the evil consequences you suggest it is very true that both within and without doors there have been advocates for the measure and it has been affirmed that it would be very agreeable to the army whose favorite mr conway was asserted to be my judgment on this business was not formed until i received your letter i am very sure congress would not take any step that might injure the army or even have a tendency that way and i verily believe they wish to lessen your difficulties by every means in their power from an entire conviction that the purest motives of public good direct your actions the business of a board of war is so extensive so important and demanding such constant attention that congress see clearly the necessity of constituting a new board out of congress whose time shall be entirely devoted to that essential department it is by some warmly proposed that this board shall be filled by the three following gentlemen colonel reed colonel pickering the present adjutantgeneral and colonel harrison your secretary and that general conway be appointed adjutantgeneral in the room of colonel pickering it is my wish and i am sure it is so of many others to know your full and candid sentiments on the subject for my own part i cannot be satisfied with giving my opinion on the point until i am favored with your sentiments which i shall be much obliged to you for sir as soon as your time will permit it has been affirmed that general conway would quit the service if he were not made a majorgeneral but i have been told in confidence that he would leave it at the end of this campaign if he was appointed unless his word of honor were taken to continue for any fixed time and it is a question with me whether the advocates for general conway will not miss their aim if he should be appointed adjutantgeneral unless he has the rank of majorgeneral also my reason for thinking so is that i have been informed general conway desires to retire to his family provided he can carry from this country home with him a rank that will raise him in france it is very certain that the public good demands a speedy erecting and the judicious filling of the new board of war and i sincerely wish it may be done in the most proper manner i do not imagine congress would appoint colonel harrison without first knowing whether you could spare him nor do i think that so important an office as that of adjutantgeneral should be touched without the maturest consideration—ms letter october  0th notwithstanding the strong representations of general washington in the above letter to mr

your letter of the   th instant i received last night wherein i find you express a desire to be recalled from fort mifflin to join your corps i found it absolutely necessary to reinforce your garrison and that it was impracticable to do it consistently without superseding you this determined me to send the baron darendt as the person originally mentioned to you to command there but i would have omitted it after you had remained some time in command had not the additional detachment been judged expedient for the defence of so important a post this i mention that you may be satisfied of the real motives in this transaction and that a desire to supersede you had no influence in it but on the contrary your conduct and exertions since the commencement of your command there have been such as merit my approbation and thanks i now leave it to your own option whether to rejoin your corps or continue where you are and have no doubt but you will determine upon that which in your opinion is most serviceable and consistent with the character of an officer—washington to lieutenantcolonel samuel smith    october        i congratulate you upon the glorious success of our arms to the northward the complete captivity of burgoyne and his army exceeds our most sanguine expectations i have not yet heard of sir henry clintons falling down the north river again but i imagine he will not remain there after he has heard of burgoynes destruction—washington to majorgeneral heath    october        after the british had captured fort montgomery and the other posts on the hudson general putnam retreated from peekskill and established his headquarters at fishkill beyond the highlands he wrote to general washington from fishkill last monday general parsons with about two thousand troops marched down and took possession of peekskill and the passes in the highlands he has taken a number of cattle horses and sheep which were collected by the enemy they had burnt the buildings and barracks at the continental village and several dwellinghouses and other buildings at peekskill they have demolished forts montgomery and constitution and are repairing fort clinton yesterday about forty sail passed up the river crowded with troops and are at anchor above poughkeepsie the wind not favoring we were on our march after them when i met the agreeable intelligence of the surrender of general burgoyne and his army as prisoners of war a copy of which is enclosed i thereupon most sincerely congratulate your excellency i have halted my troops and am now considering what ought to be my movement i have sent to governor clinton for his opinion and ordered general parsons to spare no pains to find out the situation and strength of the garrison at kingsbridge in order to direct my future operations most advantageously i have about six thousand troops who are chiefly militia i understand that general campbell was killed at fort montgomery and several fieldofficers and others of inferior rank the two continental frigates and the rowgalley were burnt to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy for which i am very sorry as one of them i believe might have been saved—ms letter october   th   there is probably an error here in regard to the identity of the persons sir henry clinton in his official return of the killed and wounded gives the name of lieutenantcolonel campbell of the fiftysecond regiment there was a general campbell in the british army at that time but general dickinson in a letter dated november   th states that he was then on staten island whence it would follow that he could not have been the same person that was killed at fort montgomery—sparks   the fogginess of the morning is so very great that i think it probable that the enemy will attempt a surprise upon fort mifflin at such a time or at night if they mean it at all to prevent this i would recommend it to you to keep boats rowing guard as near the shore of province island as they possibly can with safety    the enemy last night evacuated germantown and fell down to philadelphia our army will advance towards them in the morning and as we shall be near them i hope we shall prevent them from detaching any considerable force to reduce fort mifflin i recommended it to col smith to endeavor by all means to keep the breaches in the banks of province island open as i am certain it will incommode them vastly in carrying on their works—washington to commodore hazelwood    october      there was a little friction between colonel smith and commodore hazelwood which washington undertook to smooth over i was extremely sorry to find from the commodores letter which made a part of yours that you and he were not in the strictest harmony this circumstance i confess gives me great uneasiness as i well know that a good agreement between the navy and garrison is of the last importance and that a want of cooperation and every possible mutual aid may involve the most unhappy consequences persuaded of this and recollecting the train of misfortunes that has been brought on in many instances by a difference of the like nature i requested baron darendt in my instructions to him that to maintain a good understanding between him and the commodore should be a great object of his care and attention this i hope he will do and i have written to the commodore to day recommending the same to him in the strongest terms hitherto a happy agreement has done much it has disappointed the enemy from effecting notwithstanding their repeated efforts what they seemed to consider without difficulty and should the same spirit and disposition continue i flatter myself they will produce the same ends—washington to colonel smith    october      i cannot but repeat my ardent desire that harmony and a good understanding between the fleet and the garrisons may be mutually cultivated on this every thing depends nothing but disappointment and disgrace can attend the want of it the best designs and most important pursuits have been and ever will be defeated by foolish differences when they exist between those engaged in them—washington to commodore hazelwood    october      you seem to have mistaken the commodores meaning from his letter i understand that he will always assist you whenever it is in his power he tells you that in rough weather his galleys and armed boats cannot live and therefore guards you against expecting much assistance from them at such times i beg you of all things not to suffer any jealousies between the land and sea service to take place consider that your mutual security depends upon acting perfectly in concert i have wrote to colonel greene to afford you every possible assistance from red bank till the reinforcement gets down—washington to lieutenantcolonel smith    october      i find something of the same kind existing between smith and monsr fleury who i consider as a very valuable officer how strange it is that men engaged in the same important service should be eternally bickering instead of giving mutual aid officers cannot act upon proper principles who suffer trifles to interpose to create distrust and jealousy all our actions should be regulated by one uniform plan and that plan should have one object only in view to wit the good of the service where this is the case although there may be a diversity of opinion there can be no real obstruction i hope all these little rubs will be done away by your prudent management—washington to brigadiergeneral varnum   november      this function of peacemaker made many calls upon washingtons time for the opportunities for differences and jealousies were frequent general woodford complains that he lately wrote you a polite letter requesting necessaries for his brigade which he sent by an officer to which he says you only returned him a rough verbal answer without complying with his demand even in part as general woodford is an exceeding good officer and one who i think would not make extravagant or unnecessary demands i could wish you would clear up this matter to his satisfaction—washington to james mease    november        it is now above two years since i have had the honor of presiding in congress and i should esteem myself happy to have it in my power to render further service to my country in that department but the decline of health occasioned by so long and unremitted an application to the duties of my office both in congress and out of congress joined to the situation of my own private affairs has at length taught me to think of retiring for two or three months and i have determined to take my leave the ensuing week and set out immediately for boston after this express returns as the congress will doubtless proceed to appoint a successor in my stead on him therefore will devolve the business of the chair the politeness and attention i have ever experienced from you in the course of our correspondence will always be a source of the most pleasing satisfaction to me—hancock to washington    october      your favor of the   th i received on monday afternoon you have my warmest wishes for your recovery and i shall be happy if your recess should be attended with benefits superior to your most sanguine expectations your exertions to promote the general interest i am well convinced will be unceasing and that every measure which the situation of your health will permit you to pursue will be employed to that end whether you are in congress or obliged to remain in the state of massachusetts i have ordered cornet buckmer with twelve dragoons to attend you as an escort and to receive your commands for this purpose you will be pleased to retain them as long as you may consider their attendance necessary i would willingly have directed a larger number but the severe duty the horse have been obliged to perform for a long time past has rendered many of them unfit for service to which i must add that we are under a necessity of keeping several considerable patrols of them constantly along the enemys lines these reasons i trust will apologize for the escort being so small—washington to hancock   november        congress have reason to complain of my not making them general returns of the army more frequently but i hope they will excuse me when they consider that i have not been for some time past two days in a place and i assure you it sometimes happens that the officers have not paper to make the necessary returns but i will take the first opportunity of making a full and regular one—washington to richard peters    october        major wards letter was dated october   d—by the desire of colonel greene he wrote i congratulate your excellency on the success of the troops under his command yesterday on the   st instant four battalions of germans amounting to about twelve hundred men commanded by count donop landed at coopers ferry and marched the same evening to haddonfield at three oclock yesterday morning they marched for this place when the guard at timber creek bridge were informed of their approach they took up that bridge and the enemy filed off to the left and crossed a bridge four miles above their advanced parties were discovered within four miles of the fort at twelve oclock at half after four in the afternoon they sent a flag to summon the fort the reply was that it should never be surrendered at three quarters past four they began a brisk cannonade and soon after advanced in two columns to the attack they passed the abatis gained the ditch and some few got over the pickets but the fire was so heavy that they were soon driven out again with considerable loss and they retreated precipitately towards haddonfield the enemys loss amounts to one lieutenantcolonel three captains four lieutenants and near seventy killed and count donop his brigademajor a captain lieutenant and upwards of seventy noncommissioned officers and privates wounded and taken prisoners we are also informed that several wagons are taken the colonel proposes to send the wounded officers to burlington he also enjoins me to tell your excellency that both officers and men behaved with the greatest bravery the action lasted forty minutes the hessians confessed to a loss of four hundred and two killed and wounded of whom twentysix were officers count donop died of his wounds three days after the action at a house near the fort a short time before his death he said to monsieur duplessis a french officer who constantly attended him in his illness it is finishing a noble career early i die the victim of my ambition and of the avarice of my sovereign—chastelluxs travels vol i p     this was told to chastellux and lafayette by duplessis himself when they afterwards visited the spot together count donop was considered a gallant and valuable officer the fortification at red bank was called fort mercer the naval part of the action is thus described by commodore hazelwood while the fort at red bank was attacked the augusta of sixtyfour guns the roebuck of fortyfour two frigates the merlin of eighteen guns and a galley came up through the lower chevauxdefrise and were attacked by our floating batteries and some of the galleys while the rest of the galleys were flanking the enemy that were attacking the fort these galleys did much execution as soon as the enemy were repulsed at the fort the ships october   d finding so hot a fire endeavored to fall down but the augusta and merlin were grounded early the galleys and floating batteries attacked them and an incessant fire was kept up about eleven oclock i believe one of our shot set the augusta on fire and at twelve she blew up being aground the engagement continued with the other ships and at three in the afternoon the merlin we think also took fire and blew up then the firing ceased on both sides the roebuck dropped down to the lower chevauxdefrise and went through yesterday i went down to the wrecks and found that the guns of both ships might be got out if the enemys ships can be kept at a proper distance we brought off two twentyfour pounders and as soon as possible i shall endeavor to get the rest—ms letter october   th commodore hazelwood also complained of his deficiency of men the fleet is now so poorly manned he said and the constant cry from fort mifflin is to guard that post that i know not how to act without more assistance there had been numerous desertions from the fleet particularly from the vessels belonging to pennsylvania colonel smith had written some time before so general a discontent and panic ran through that part of the fleet that neither officers nor men can be confided in they conceive the river is lost if the enemy gets possession of billingsport nothing can convince them of the contrary and i am persuaded that as soon as that fort is taken almost all the fleet will desert indeed from their disposition i am induced to believe they will openly avow themselves and desert officers with their crews and perhaps with their galleys which has been the case with two—october  d   i heartily congratulate you upon this happy event and beg you will accept my most particular thanks and present the same to your whole garrison both officers and men assure them that their gallantry and good behavior meet my warmest approbation all the prisoners should be immediately removed to a distance from your post to some convenient and safe place i am sorry you have thought of sending the officers to burlington as they would be in no kind of security at that place but might be taken and carried off by the enemy with the greatest ease immediately on the receipt of this you will be pleased to have all the prisoners both officers and men conveyed to morristown the wounded can be accommodated in the hospitals there and in its neighborhood count donop in particular is a man of importance and ought by all means to be taken care of—washington to col christopher greene    october        proclamation by his excellency george washington commanderinchief of the forces of the united states of america—whereas sundry soldiers belonging to the armies of the said states have deserted from the same these are to make known to all those who have so offended and who shall return to their respective corps or surrender themselves to the officers appointed to receive recruits and deserters in their several states or to any continental commissioned officer before the first day of january next that they shall obtain a full and free pardon—and i do further declare to all such obstinate offenders as do not avail themselves of the indulgence hereby offered that they may depend when apprehended on being prosecuted with the utmost rigor and suffering the punishment justly due to crimes of such enormity lest the hope of escaping punishment by remaining undiscovered should tempt any to reject the terms now held out to them they may be assured that the most effectual measures will be pursued in every state for apprehending and bringing them to a speedy trial—dated october   th this proclamation was issued in obedience to a resolve by congress   the council of war was held on the   th and washington laid before it a general account of the situation stating the strength of the two armies as follows that the troops under sir william howe present and fit for duty amounted according to the best intelligence he could obtain to ten thousand rank and file stationed at philadelphia and in its immediate vicinity and that the force under his command present and fit for duty was eight thousand three hundred and thirteen continental troops and two thousand seven hundred and seventeen militia there were in addition six hundred and fifty continental troops at red bank and fort mifflin and a detachment of three hundred militia on their way to reinforce those posts a body of five hundred militia under general potter was likewise on the other side of the schuylkill this was his whole force and it was likely soon to suffer a diminution of nineteen hundred and eightysix militia by the expiration of the term of service for which those from maryland and virginia had been engaged the decision of the council on the generals questions was   it was not advisable to make an attack upon philadelphia   the army should take a position to the left of its present station and the garrisons at red bank and fort mifflin should be reinforced   and   deferred it was decided that twenty regiments should be drawn from the northern army   such an officer was advisable the manual or regulations to be first agreed upon by the commanderinchief or a board of officers appointed for that purpose   promotions should be regimental as high as captains inclusively all from that rank in the line of the state   the reward should be allowed   deferred   when the congress retired from philadelphia to york the navy board remained behind and continued chiefly at bordentown in new jersey where their services could be more immediately rendered in managing the concerns of the continental shipping in the delaware   congress interfered and directed that the frigates be lightened as much as possible and either run into some adjacent creek or hauled as high upon shore as may be without ballast and a battery constructed with the guns of the washington on the most convenient ground to cover the frigates from the enemy that the frigates should be charged properly with combustibles and a careful watch employed under a vigilant officer to burn them rather than suffer them to fall into the hands of the enemy and lest this should fail that a sufficient number of small craft should be sunk in the channel below the frigates effectually to obstruct the enemy from moving them down the river if they should happen to gain possession of them and a battery be constructed in the most convenient manner to cover the obstructions and prevent the enemy from removing them that all the vessels of whatever kind should be run up as high above the batteries aforesaid as possible and the most effectual precautions taken immediately on the approach of the enemy—journals of congress   november      a copy of this resolution was sent to washington for his approval and is considered in his letter of november  0th   for a full copy of this letter i am indebted to dr john s h fogg of boston   the british evacuated forts montgomery and clinton on the   th of october and the same day proceeded down the river with their whole force both of troops and shipping in a letter from general putnam to the commanderinchief dated at fishkill october   st he stated that poors warners learneds and patersons brigades colonel van schaicks regiment and morgans riflemen were on their way from the northward to join him amounting in the whole to five thousand seven hundred men which number added to those already with him would make his whole force about nine thousand strong exclusive of morgans corps the artillerymen and the militia from connecticut and new york the militia had been mostly discharged general warners brigade consisted of sixteen hundred massachusetts militia whose time of service was to expire at the end of november on the same day that the above intelligence was communicated general putnam called a council of his principal officers whose unanimous advice it was that four thousand men should move down the west side of the hudson and take post near haverstraw that one thousand should be retained in the highlands to guard the country and repair the works and that the remainder should march down on the east side of the river towards kingsbridge except morgans corps which was ordered immediately to join the commanderinchief the object proposed by this disposition of the forces was to cause a diversion of the enemy in new york and prevent a reinforcement from being sent to general howe and it was doubtless an ulterior purpose to attack the city should a favorable opportunity present itself—minutes of the council october   st   general gates wrote a very short letter to washington on the  d of november and of course before this could have reached him giving notice that morgans corps had been sent to the southward he added apparently as a matter of secondary consequence congress having been requested immediately to transmit copies of all my despatches to them i am confident your excellency has long ago received all the good news from this quarter these words contain the only intelligence which was transmitted to the commanderinchief by general gates respecting the defeat of burgoyne and the convention of saratoga   newcomb had failed to make any return of his men or to undertake any duty   the recruiting of our continental battalions is a thing of so much importance that i wish it were in my power to point out a mode which would fully answer the end to attempt to enlist upon the bounty allowed by congress is fruitless as the amazing sums given for substitutes in the militia induces all those who would otherwise have gone into the continental service to prefer a line in which neither duty or discipline is severe and in which they have a chance of having the bounty repeated three or four times a year to this fatal source is owing the ill success of recruiting from one end of the continent to the other—washington to governor henry    november        after the british had removed the chevauxdefrise at fort montgomery and fort constitution they passed up the river with several armed vessels commanded by sir james wallace and a body of troops under general vaughan they burnt such shipping as they found in the river and also houses and mills on the shore at esopus on the   th of october a party landed led on by general vaughan himself and burnt the village of kingston so complete was the destruction that not more than one house escaped the flames the reason he gave for this act was that the people fired from the houses upon his men he then went on board and passed up as high as livingstons manor where he likewise burnt several private dwellings and mills gordon says that the people of kingston did not fire from their houses upon the british troops—history vol ii p     it had been agreed between general putnam and governor clinton that during these operations of the enemy they should move up the river with their respective forces the former on the east side and the latter on the west to prevent their landing and committing ravages in the country and also to be at hand to fall upon their rear in case they should proceed to albany and attempt to succor burgoyne when the news of the convention of saratoga reached general vaughan he retreated down the river and soon after to new york general putnam had advanced with his army as far as red hook but immediately returned to fishkill he appears to have had a strong tendency towards new york even after the enemy had ascended above the highlands and wrote in that temper to general gates who replied sir henry clinton general burgoyne it is certainly right to collect your whole force and push up the east side of the river after the enemy you may be sure they have nothing they care for in new york then why should you attack an empty town which you know to be untenable the moment they bring their men of war against it yesterday general burgoyne proposed to surrender upon the enclosed terms the capitulation will i believe be settled today when i shall have nothing but general clinton to think of if you keep pace with him on one side the governor on the other and i in his front i cannot see how he is to get home again—ms letter october   th four days after the capture of fort montgomery a spy was brought to governor clinton then at new windsor who was seen to swallow a silver bullet it was recovered by a prescription of tartar emetic and found to be hollow and to contain within its cavity the following brief message from sir henry clinton to burgoyne dated at fort montgomery october  th nous y voici and nothing now between us but gates i sincerely hope this little success of ours may facilitate your operations in answer to your letter of the   th of september by c c i shall only say i cannot presume to order or even advise for reasons obvious i heartily wish you success faithfully yours h clinton fort montgomery was denominated fort vaughan by the british during the twenty days that it was in their possession—sparks   as soon as the schuylkill is fordable i shall send over a large body of militia to you for the purpose of executing some particular matters the principal are to endeavor to break up the road by which the enemy have a communication with their shipping over the islands if it is practicable and to remove the running stones from the mills in the neighborhood of chester and wilmington this last i would have you undertake immediately with your present force as i have information that the enemy are about making a detachment to wilmington probably with an intent to take post there and secure the use of the mills—washington to general potter    october        the enemys boats pass and repass at night carry supplies from the shipping to the town and meet with no interruption the cannon of the fort cannot be brought to bear upon them random firing would be a waste of precious ammunition the galleys alone can be opposed to their passage which has been hitherto effected between province island and fort mifflin under cover of darkness what this inactivity of the galleys is owing to is unknown some attribute it to the jealousy which commonly subsists between the officers of the naval and land service—a vitious spirit which should not be known in republics—john laurens to his father   november        i am favored with yours of the   th ulto and am glad to find that the enemy have fallen entirely down to new york by their doing this and sending away a reinforcement to general howe it is evident that they have done with all thoughts of attempting any thing further to the northward having lost one army it is certainly their interest and intention to make the other as respectable as possible and as their force is now nearly drawn together at one point in philadelphia it is undoubtedly our plan to endeavor by an union of our forces to destroy general howe—washington to putnam   november      to keep as large a body of the british at new york as possible washington directed general dickinson to make a feint in that direction your idea of counteracting the intended reinforcements for mr howes army by a demonstration of designs upon new york i think an exceeding good one and i am very desirous that you should improve and mature it for immediate execution a great show of preparatives on your side boats collected troops assembled your expectation of the approach of generals gates and putnam intrusted as a secret to persons who you are sure will divulge and disseminate it in new york in a word such measures taken for effectually striking an alarm in that city as it is altogether unnecessary for me minutely to describe to you i am in great hopes may effect the valuable purpose which you expect—washington to majorgeneral dickinson   november        now if they sail in december they may arrive time enough to take the places of others who may be out in may which is as early as a campaign can be well entered upon i look upon it that their principal difficulty will arise from the want of a stock of provision for the voyage and therefore although i would supply them with rations agreeable to stipulation i would not furnish an ounce for sea store or suffer it to be purchased in the country—washington to heath   november        this morning a heavy cannonading was heard from below and continued till afternoon from the top of chews house in german town to which place the general took a ride this morning we could discover nothing more than thick clouds of smoak and the masts of two vessels the weather being very hazy—john laurens to his father   november      it was an affair between the somerset roebuck and one other british vessel and the american galleys as it was for washingtons interest to mislead the enemy by distorted intelligence he drafted instructions to major john clark jr which tell their own story in your next letter for the british camp i d have you mention that genl gates now having nothing to do to the northward is sending down a very handsome reinforcement of continental troops to this army whilst he with the remainder of them and all the new england and york militia is to make an immediate descent on new york the reduction of which is confidently spoke of as it is generally supposed that a large part of clintons troops are detachd to the assistance of genl howe and that genl dickinson is at the same time to attack staten island for which purpose he is assembling great numbers of the jersey militia that the received opinion in our camp is that we will immediately attack philadelphia on the arrival of the troops from the northward that i have prevailed upon the legislative body to order out two thirds of the militia of this state for that purpose that you heard great talk of the virginia and maryland militia coming up and in short that the whole continent seems determined to use every exertion to put an end to the war this winter that we mention the forts as being perfectly secure having sent ample reinforcements to their support—  november      the expedition to rhode island is just as much a secret to me as it is to you i never was consulted upon it or knew from whence or when it originated you must therefore apply to congress for direction in regard to the payment of the troops employed for i cannot give the least authority for it—washington to heath   november      since the general left germantown in the middle of september last he has been without his baggage and on that account is unable to receive company in the manner he could wish he nevertheless desires the generals field officers and brigademajor of the day to dine with him in future at three oclock in the afternoon—orderly book   november      i have just seen a very intelligent person from philadelphia he has been conversant with many people who stand high in the confidence of the british officers of the first rank he finds from all their discourse that a formidable attack is to be made upon fort mifflin very soon if that fails they will be obliged to change their quarters as they find they cannot subsist in the city without they have a free communication with their shipping—washington to general varnum   november        see appendix   henry laurens was chosen president of congress on the  st of november as the successor of president hancock   journals of congress   november        since the engagement at germantown no material alteration has happened in the situation of the two armies general howe has withdrawn himself close within his lines round philadelphia and we have fallen down with the main body of the army to this place about    miles from philadelphia our light parties are much nearer and cut off all communication between the country and city i am in daily expectation of a reinforcement from the northern army and general howe has drawn the principal part of his force from new york happy would it be for the liberties of this country could a sufficient head of men be suddenly collected to give a fatal blow to the remainder of her oppressors now drawn together in such a situation that it would be impossible to make a retreat after the delaware is rendered unnavigable by frost—washington to governor henry    november        kosciuszko was appointed an engineer in the continental service october         and had been constantly employed in the northern department first at ticonderoga and mount independence and afterwards in the army of generals schuyler and gates he planned the encampment for the american army at bemus heights and he was afterwards the principal engineer in executing the military works at west point   i would not wish to be partial to any part of the army i only desire that when goods are ordered particularly to one department that they may not be detained in another and i must insist that this rule be invariably observed in future you are to consider that almost the whole of our cloathing comes from the eastward consequently the stopping such parts as are intended for this army after a due proportion is allotted to the other departments is highly injurious to the service with truth it may be added that we have at this time upwards of  000 men rendered unfit for service for want of cloaths—washington to majorgeneral putnam    november        i am sorry to find from yours of yesterday that the fire of the enemy had made so great an impression upon the works of fort mifflin that you thought an evacuation would be necessary as i have not yet heard that the measure was determined upon i hope it is not carried into execution if it is not it is the unanimous opinion of a council of general officers now sitting that the fort be held to the last extremity and to enable the commanding officer to do this that you immediately withdraw all the invalids and fatigued men and fill up their places with the most fresh and robust and that the troops in garrison be often exchanged that they may by that means obtain rest it seems a settled point that the enemy will not storm while the works are kept in tolerable repair and there is an appearance of force upon the island and i therefore would have you endeavor to prevail upon the militia to go over at night when there is cessation of firing and work till day light you may give them the most positive assurances that it is not meant to keep them there against their consent this would greatly relieve the continental troops and by these means a great deal of work might be done we are now thinking if there is any possibility of attacking the enemy in reverse and thereby raising the seige if it can be done with any probability of success—washington to general varnum one oclock    november        i last night received your favor of the  0th instant and am sorry to find the enemys batteries had played with such success against our works nevertheless i hope they will not oblige you to evacuate them they are of the last importance and i trust will be maintained to the latest extremity i have written to general varnum to afford you immediate succor by sending fresh troops to relieve those now in garrison and also such numbers of militia as he may be able to prevail on to go to your assistance with these every exertion should be used for repairing in the night whatever damage the works may sustain in the day the militia are principally designed for this end and they are to be permitted to return every morning to red bank if such shall be their choice general varnum will furnish all the fascines and palisades he can you may rest assured that i will adopt every means our situation will admit of to give you relief—washington to lieutenantcolonel smith    november        it has occurred to me that should sir william howe still obstinately refuse to settle any equitable cartel for the exchange of prisoners that congress would be justified in ordering the fulfilling the convention of saratoga to be delayed until the united states received justice in that particular at any rate there will be very few of genl burgoynes soldiers to embark as most of the germans and a great many of the british have deserted upon their march towards boston and many more will yet desert—gates to the president of congress  0 november      i have never entertained the smallest idea that general burgoyne should be permitted to change the port of embarkation or that the least variation of the spirit and letter of the convention would be indulged to the troops under his command there is no doubt but the british regiments upon their arrival in england will be ordered to do duty there but the germans cannot by the laws serve in great britain or ireland if general burgoyne has any sinister design what i suggested to congress in my letter of the  0th instant a copy of which i conclude your excellency has received will be a good method of delaying if not finally preventing the execution of his project—gates to washington    november        general conway had the day before sent his commission to congress and he gave as a reason to general washington that a longer stay in america would endanger his rank and hopes of promotion in france adding although i leave the continent i shall ever cherish the cause for which i fought and if the plan i sent to congress is accepted i hope i shall serve the cause more effectually in another part of the world what this plan was he does not intimate nor is it apparent from the journals that congress accepted his resignation though it would seem that he retired from the army he wrote at the same time a long complaining boastful and somewhat impudent letter to mr charles carroll which was meant for congress

apprehension in america on this subject of reinforcements sir william howe had already become greatly dissatisfied neither his requisitions nor his anticipations had been in any degree realized and he had even asked his recall in a letter dated october   d in which he wrote to lord george germaine from the little attention my lord given to my recommendations since the commencement of my command i

to send more such an acknowledgment would have been no reflection upon himself and would have relieved my mind from the uneasiness it labored under in conceiving that my opinions of the necessity of reinforcements were deemed nugatory and that of course i had lost the confidence of those who were in the first instance to judge of my conduct—p  0 whoever reads the correspondence as produced in parliament must be convinced that there is too much truth in this remark sir william howe was prompt and full in laying all his plans before the ministry with a statement of the number of men

reinforcements to general washington as were expected general putnam seems to have had a special reluctance to part with these troops probably in consequence of his favorite project against new york colonel hamiltons letter was pointed and authoritative i cannot forbear confessing he observed that i am astonished and alarmed beyond measure to find that all his excellencys views have been hitherto frustrated and that no single step of those i mentioned to you has been taken to afford him the aid he absolutely stands in need of and by delaying which the cause of america is put to the utmost conceivable hazard i so fully explained to you the generals situation that i could not entertain a doubt you would make it the first object of your attention to reinforce him with that speed the exigency of affairs demanded but i am sorry to say he will have too much reason to think other objects in comparison with that insignificant have been uppermost i speak freely and emphatically because i tremble at the consequences of the delay that has happened sir henry clintons reinforcement is probably by this time with general howe this will give him a decisive superiority over our army what may be the issue of such a state of things i leave to the feelings of every friend to his country capable of foreseeing consequences my expressions may perhaps have more warmth than is altogether proper but they proceed from the overflowing of my heart in a matter where i conceive this continent essentially interested i wrote to you from albany and desired you would send a thousand continental troops of those first proposed to be left with you this i understand has not been done how the noncompliance can be answered to general washington you can best determine i now sir in the most explicit terms by his excellencys authority give it as a positive order from him that all the continental troops under your command may be immediately marched to kings ferry there to cross the river and hasten to reinforce the army under him the massachusetts militia are to be detained instead of them until the troops coming from the northward arrive when they do they will replace as far as i am instructed the troops you shall send away in consequence of this requisition the generals idea of keeping troops this way does not extend farther than covering the country from any little irruptions of small

the evening of the   th of november to consider the question of making an immediate attack on the enemy in philadelphia while lord cornwallis was absent in new jersey with so large a body of troops it was supposed by some that a fit opportunity presented itself for making a successful attack general washington had reconnoitred the enemys lines in person with this view the subject was debated with earnestness and as there was a difference of opinion among the members of the council they separated without coming to any decision at the request of the commanderinchief each officer sent in his written opinion the next morning with his reasons during the night a messenger was likewise despatched to general greene in jersey who communicated his views in writing the result was that eleven officers were opposed to the attack and four in favor of it those in the affirmative were stirling wayne scott and woodford in the negative greene sullivan knox baron de kalb smallwood maxwell poor paterson irvine duportail and armstrong the plan suggested for the attack is thus described by lord stirling   that the enemys lines on the north side of philadelphia should be attacked at daylight by three columns properly flanked and supported   that two thousand men should be drawn from general greene and embarked in boats at dunkss ferry proceed to philadelphia land at or near spruce street push through the common and endeavor with a part to secure the bridge over the schuylkill and with the remainder to attack the enemy in the rear of their lines   that five hundred of the continental troops with the militia under general potter should possess such of the hills on the other side of the schuylkill as command and enfilade the enemys lines and while part of them carry on a brisk cannonade at that place the rest proceed to the bridge over the schuylkill and wait an opportunity of attacking the works there in front when the party from spruce street make an attack in the rear such was the outline of the plan of attack but it was by no means satisfactory to the majority of the officers the enemys lines on the north side of the city from river to river were sustained by a chain of fourteen redoubts strengthened by abatis in some parts and by circular works in others each of the enemys flanks was moreover protected by a river and the rear by the union of two rivers to attack an army under such circumstances without the greatest hazard of a failure would require a large superiority of force and the best disciplined troops but in the present case the enemys force was almost equal in numbers to that under washington and in point of discipline and experience far superior these considerations with others of a similar tendency were deemed sufficient to discourage an attack our commander in chief wishing ardently to gratify the public expectation by making an attack upon the enemy—yet preferring at the same time a loss of popularity to engaging in an enterprise

observe one of the most prevalent was a general discontent in the army and especially among the officers these discontents are ascribed to various causes and we doubt not many of them are well founded and deserve particular attention and in the course of the present winter will be taken into consideration by congress and we hope effectually remedied that a reform may take place in the army and proper discipline be introduced we wish to see the military placed on such a footing as may make a commission a desirable object to the officer and his rank preserved from degradation and contempt for these purposes we intend to recommend to congress that an half pay establishment be formed and adopted in the american service that a pensionary establishment take place in favor of officers widows that a new regulation of rank confining it as far as possible to the line of the army be adopted that an equitable mode of paying for back rations be ordered should these several regulations be approved and established by congress and we have reason to suppose they will we trust the prevailing discontents will subside and a spirit of emulation take place among the gentlemen of the army to promote the public service and introduce that order and discipline amongst the troops so essential to the military character as a further inducement the committee have it also in contemplation to propose in congress that the officers be permitted to dispose of their commissions under such regulations as may render the measure eligible the committee formally reported to congress the need of completing the army before an active movement could be made   the officers here mentioned were natives of new jersey who entered into the service of the enemy as this was treason by the law of new jersey they were imprisoned and the governor considered it his duty to try them in the courts of justice he conformed to general washingtons advice however and put them on the footing of prisoners of war the british general campbell then on staten island had claimed these officers from governor livingston and also another person who had been captured with them the officers three in number were given up but in regard to the other person governor livingston wrote he is no officer and had committed a number of robberies in this state before he joined the enemy and i can hardly think that general campbell will be of the opinion that in consideration of law a man can expiate the guilt of a prior robbery by a subsequent treason   in their resolve respecting the baron st ouary congress

in the act of crossing the schuylkill we received intelligence that the enemy were advancing on this side of the river in fact a ravaging party of four thousand under the command of lord cornwallis had passed the river and were driving potters militia before them two regiments of this corps however are said to have conducted themselves extremely well and to have given the enemy no small annoyance as they advanced general sullivan was major general of the day and consequently conducted the march his division and part of waynes had crossed the river being uncertain as to the number of the enemy and dreading their advance in force when part of the army should be on one side of the river and part on the other he ordered those troops to recross and our bridge to be rendered impassable notice of this was sent to the commander in chief and when he arrived parties of the enemy were seen on the commanding heights on this side of the river there was a pause for some time and consultation what was to be done parties of horse in the meantime were detached to gain certain intelligence of the enemys numbers and designs    some pronounced hastily that the enemy had received intelligence of our march although the resolution had been taken in council only the night before and that they were prepared to oppose our passage genl washington who never since i have been in his family has passed a false judgment on such points gave it as his opinion that the party in view were foragers that the meeting was accidental but however the enemy might avail themselves of this unexpected discovery and might draw as much advantage from it as if the rencounter had been premeditated the intelligence was received that the enemy were retiring in great haste but it did not appear satisfactory and the army was ordered to march to swedes ford three or four miles higher up the river and encamp with the right to the schuylkill the next morning the want of provisions—i could weep tears of blood when i say it—the want of provisions rendered it impossible to march we did not march till the evening of that day our ancient bridge an infamous construction which in many parts obliged the men to march by indian file was restored and a bridge of waggons made over the swedes ford but fencerails from necessity being substituted to plank and furnishing a very unstable footing this last served to cross a trifling number of troops as the event turned out genl sullivans retrograde movement was unspeakably unlucky if we had persevered in crossing in the first instance or if we

article of the convention the british troops on their march to boston were to be supplied with provisions by general gates orders at the same rate of rations as the troops of his own army but gates was paying for his supplies in paper money worth at this time only about one third of its nominal or specie value and the justice of washingtons suggestion to exact full payment in coin for what the british consumed may with reason be questioned congress was already considering the question raised by washington in his letter of november  st pp         of this volume and on the   th of december

silver at the rate of  s  d for every dollar of the currency of these states and that all these accounts be liquidated and discharged previous to the release of any prisoners to whom provisions or other necessaries shall have been supplied heath pressed for money had asked burgoyne to settle the accounts for november and had agreed to accept continental money but before a settlement was had he received this resolution of congress which he at once communicated to burgoyne the british general naturally thought it was a little extraordinary that we should refuse our own currency and further added that it was hard since it was notorious that a guinea might be exchanged for twelve or fourteen dollars through the country—heath to the president of congress   january      and two weeks later

determine has been but too prevalent in the army of late i have discountenanced it as much as possible especially where the applications were by men of merit and in some such instances have peremptorily refused to grant em the practice is of pernicious tendency and must have an unhappy influence on the service at the same time it is to be observed where officers wish to resign whose characters are exceptionable or do not stand in a favorable point of view their commissions should be received as their continuance would not promote the public interest and might prevent the promotion of better men i shall pay due regard to the resolve of your honble house of commons and that their views may be the more fully answered i shall deliver a copy of it to the commanding officer

appointments i accepted the office of inspectorgeneral with the view of being instrumental to the welfare of the cause and to the glory of the commanderinchief in making his troops fit to execute his orders the rank of majorgeneral which was given me is absolutely requisite for this office in order to be vested with proper authority to superintend the instruction and the internal administration there is no inspector in the european armies under a majorgeneral however sir if my appointment is productive of any inconvenience or anywise disagreeable to your excellency as i neither applied nor solicited for this place i am very ready to return to france where i have pressing business and this i will do with the more satisfaction as i expect even there to be useful to the cause—ms letter december   th it is remarkable that he should assert as he does here that he never applied for the appointment of majorgeneral when there are letters of an anterior date from him to congress in which he not only applies but insists with a forwardness almost amounting to impudence that the rank ought to be bestowed on him and uses a series of arguments to sustain his application—sparks   when the baron de kalb received an appointment in the army conway sent a remonstrance to congress which begins as follows it is with infinite concern that i find myself slighted and forgot when you have offered rank to persons who cost you a great deal of money and have never rendered you the least service baron de kalb to whom you have offered the rank of majorgeneral is my inferior in france and then he proceeds to utter his complaints and objections and to demand for himself the rank of majorgeneral   conways reply to this last clause of the letter is sufficiently indicative of his duplicity and vanity what you are pleased to call an extraordinary promotion he says is a very plain one there is nothing extraordinary in it only that such a place was not thought of sooner the general and universal merit which you wish every promoted officer might be endowed with is a rare gift we see but few of merit so generally acknoweldged we know but the great frederic in europe and the great washington on this continent i certainly never was so rash as to pretend to such a prodigious height neither do i pretend to any superiority in personal qualities over my brother brigadiers for whom i have much regard but you sir and the great frederic know perfectly well that this trade is not learnt in a few months i have served steadily thirty years that is before some of my comrade brigadiers were born therefore i do not think that it will be found marvellous and incredible if i command here a number of men which falls much short of what i have commanded there many years in an old army however sir by the complexion of your letter and by the two receptions you have honored me with since my arrival i perceive that i have not the happiness of being agreeable to your excellency and that i can expect no support in fulfilling the laborious duty of an inspectorgeneral i do not mean to give you or any officer in the army the least uneasiness therefore i am very ready to return to france

deliberating on the means of correcting abuses in the army particularly in the departments for supplying provision and clothing from the imperfect organization of these departments or from bad management in administerng them great sufferings had been experienced by the soldiers during the preceding campaign on the  0th of january it was decided by congress that a committee should be sent to the camp empowered to consult with general washington and in conjunction with him to mature a new system of arrangements for the administration of the army the committee were invested with ample powers for effecting all the desirable objects of reform or rather for digesting and reporting a plan of the same to congress the persons chosen were dana reed and folsom in congress and gates mifflin and pickering from the board of war when it was found that these latter gentlemen were fully occupied by their official duties they were excused and two members of congress charles carroll and gouverneur morris in addition to the above three were chosen in their place the committee therefore consisted of five members of congress who repaired immediately to valley forge   burgoyne had complained to gates of the treatment accorded the convention troops in boston and charged that the publick faith is broke this letter was called for by congress and that body asserted that burgoynes charge was not warranted by the just construction of any article of the convention and interpreted it as a strong indication of his intention and affords just grounds of fear that he will avail himself of such pretended breach of the convention in order to disengage himself and the army under him of the obligations they are under to these united states and that the security which these states have had in his personal honor is hereby destroyed a resolution was prepared based upon this belief suspending the embarkation of burgoyne and his troops until a distinct and explicit

of congress and three of the board of war are going to the army for that purpose it is said many good officers are weary of the service and wish to resign unless they are put on a permanent establishment that they are weary and wish for ease i do not wonder but who that are either in the civil or military department are not weary and do not wish for retirement the service in every part is severe congress sit night and day taking little rest must we all therefore resign this is no time to talk of ease and retirement let us first establish our liberties—our desires of ease will then be obtained i do not mention this as applicable to your lordship i never heard of your desire to turn your back upon a service the most noble and glorious some however do it we all engaged i hope on

a disagreeable influence on other officers the discontent prevailing in the army from various causes has become but too prevalent and i fear unless some measures can be adopted to render the situation of the officers more comfortable than what it has been for some time past that it will increase the depreciation of our money the difficulty of procuring necessaries and the exorbitant prices they are obliged to pay for em when they can be had are among the causes of dissatisfaction whatever your determination may be i am persuaded you will not remain an idle spectator or be wanting in your exertions to promote the cause—washington to general parsons    january        if the coats should not be cut out before this reaches you instead of the usual regimental coat i would recommend a garment of the pattern of the sailors for jacket this sets close to the body and by buttoning double over the breast adds much to the warmth of the soldier there may be a small cape and cuff of a different color to distinguish the corps i have consulted most of the officers of the army and they all seem to think that this kind of coat will be much the best at least till we can fall upon means of procuring full supplies of complete uniforms we cannot spare tailors to go from hence therefore if you cannot get all the clothes readily made up i think you had better send part of the cloth here with all kinds of necessay trimmings and the regimental tailors will soon make them up under the inspection of their officers as the overall is much preferable to breeches i would recommend as many of them as possible—washington to governor trumbull    january        washington had ample reason to complain of the inactivity of pennsylvania at this juncture when he went into winter quarters it had been arranged with general armstrong that one thousand of the state militia should be maintained in the country between the schuylkill and delaware to check incursions of the enemy and cut off supplies instead of this number there were on february   th only between sixty and one hundred men under general lacey so that there were no guards within  0 miles of the city on the east side of the schuylkill but a few patrols of light horse who being unsupported by foot dare not go near the enemys lines owing to this the intercourse of all the country between schuylkill and delaware is open and

the possession of his rightful claim not to be convinced that you will cheerfully acquiesce in a measure calculated for that end in this instance general arnold is restored to a violated right and the restitution i hope will be considered by every gentleman concerned as i am sure it will by you as an act of necessary justice—washington to majorgeneral lincoln  0 january        thomas eyre   in the draft of a letter to governor trumbull was written a paragraph that was afterwards stricken out to submit to the unjust claims of general howe would relieve those at present in captivity but it would in my opinion afford him too much encouragement if he should ever again get a large number of our men in his possession first to reduce them to deaths door and then turn them out upon parole in such a condition that few would ever reach home and none ever recover   the forts and other works in the highlands were entirely demolished by the british and it now became a question of some importance whether they should be restored in their former positions or new places should be selected for that purpose about the beginning of january the grounds were examined by general putnam governor clinton general james clinton and several other gentlemen among whom was radière the french engineer and they were all except radière united in the opinion that west point was the most eligible place to be fortified radière opposed this decision with considerable vehemence and drew up a memorial designed to show that the site of fort clinton possessed advantages much superior to west point as the engineer was a man of science and had the confidence of congress and the commanderinchief it was deemed expedient by general putnam to consult the council and assembly of new york before he came to a final determination a committee was appointed by those bodies who spent three days reconnoitring the borders of the river in the highlands and they were unanimous in favor of west point agreeing herein with every other person authorized to act in the affair except the engineer it was accordingly decided on the   th of january that the fortifications should be erected at west point—putnams ms

chain and necessary anchors are contracted for to be completed by the first of april and from the intelligence i have received there is reason to believe they will be finished by that time parts of the boom intended to have been used at fort montgomery sufficient for this place are remaining some of the iron is exceedingly bad this i hope to have replaced with good iron soon the chevauxdefrise will be completed by the time the river will admit of sinking them the batteries near the water and the fort to cover them are laid out the latter is within the walls six hundred yards around twentyone feet base fourteen feet high the talus two inches to the foot this i fear is too large to be completed by the time expected governor clinton and the committee have agreed to this plan and nothing on my part shall be wanting to complete it in the best and most expeditious manner barracks and huts for about three hundred men are completed and barracks for about the same number are nearly covered a road to the river has been made with great difficulty   this evening i have received a letter from lieutenantcolonel smith at lancaster advising me of the confinement of the british officers who were going with the clothing and medicine for the prisoners in our hands this measure i consider rather unfortunate as they came out by my permission and in consequence of a stipulation between myself and general howe the officers are a hessian and british regimental quartermaster and a doctor and two mates they had passports signed by one of my aids who met them at our most advanced post and were attended by a captain and lieutenant of our army mr boudinot i am persuaded was mistaken in his representation respecting general howes forbidding any more provisions being sent in by water as the only information he had was derived from a postscript in a letter from him to me namely a sloop with flour has been received yesterday evening for the use of the prisoners here but i am to desire that no more flags of truce may be sent by water either up or down the river without leave being previously obtained as to clothing i have no doubt but general howe has denied us the liberty of purchasing this is now a subject of difference between us and the design of our insisting that he shall victual his troops in our hands by a certain day is to oblige him to consent to that measure but it should not in my opinion prevent him from sending clothes to the prisoners especially as he had obtained my consent for the same so long ago as the last day of november in consideration of his assurances to permit a commissary of ours to go into philadelphia with necessaries for our people in his hands matters being thus circumstanced and the conclusion of your letter to colonel smith

lafayette majorgeneral conway and brigadiergeneral stark were elected to conduct the expedition lafayette accepted the appointment with reluctance and only on the advice of washington he obtained dekalb as second in command and thus supported reached albany to find no preparations made for the expedition and all the persons concerned even conway himself convinced of the impossibility of conducting one with any hope of success the committee in camp at valley forge had disapproved of it the board of war had held out promises which it could not perform and lafayette predicted that this expedition would be as famous as the secret expedition against rhode island   in that letter general lee wrote i have the strongest reason to flatter myself that you will interest yourself in whatever concerns my comfort and welfare i think it my duty to inform you that my condition is much bettered it is now five days that i am on my parole i have the full liberty of the city and its limits have horses at my command furnished by sir henry clinton and general robertson am lodged with two of the oldest and warmest friends i have in the world colonel butler and major disney of the fortythird regiment with the former i was bred up from the age of nine years at school the latter is a commilito from the time i entered the service in the fortyfourth in short my situation is rendered as easy comfortable and pleasant as possible for a man who is in any sort a prisoner i have nothing left to wish for but that some circumstance may arise which may make it convenient for both parties that a general exchange may take place and i among the rest reap the advantage give my love to all my friends particularly to greene mifflin reed and morgan and be persuaded that i am most sincerely and devotedly yours—december  0th   this important paper was drawn up for the use of the committee of congress mentioned on p     it is based upon the suggestions and recommendations of the leading officers of the continental army called out by some inquiries by washington and is exhaustive on the subject affording an almost fully drawn picture of the army at this one of the crucial periods of the war a part of this statement has already been printed from imperfect drafts in the works of alexander hamilton edition    0 ii     and the drafts are among the hamilton mss in the department of state at washington the original from which the paper is now printed is in hamiltons writing as aidedecamp but as the drafts show was prepared by the commanderinchief and for some cause was returned to him by the committee for this reason the paper was not found among the mss of the continental congress but among the drafts of washingtons military correspondence an endorsement proving that it had passed through the committees hands  since writing the above i hear the assembly of this state have passed a law to draft men for their battalions and i have arranged the army accordingly in a schedule hereunto annexed—note by washington   resolve   d nov   the difficulty encountered in completing the continental army suggested to general varnum the propriety of raising a battalion of negroes to make up the proportion of rhode island in the continental army he submitted the suggestion to washington january        who sent it to the rhode island executive without a word of approval or disapproval the legislature of that state at once passed a law not without some opposition being made allowing any ablebodied negro mulatto or indian manslave in the state to enlist in the two battalions raising for continental service and the act of enlisting should liberate a slave from any kind of servitude while entitling him to all the wages bounties and encouragements given by congress to a white soldier enlisting into their service the governor hoped to enlist three hundred slaves and in august the newly raised black regiment under col greene did good service at the battle of rhode island the proposition of varnum is the first suggestion of the kind to be found at that time a few days after the general had sent in his letter col john laurens wrote to his father making a similar proposal to augment the continental force from an untried source i would bring about a twofold good first i would advance those who are unjustly deprived of the rights of mankind to a state which would be a proper gradation between abject slavery and perfect liberty and besides i am persuaded that if i could obtain authority for the purpose i would have a corps of such men trained uniformly clad equipped and ready in every respect to act at the opening of the next campaign the ridicule that may be thrown on the color i despise because i am sure of rendering essential service to my country i am tired of the languor with which so sacred a war as this is carried on—   january      henry laurens seems to have raised obstacles for the son returned to the subject on february  d there was that monstrous popular prejudice open mouthed against me of undertaking to transform beings almost irrational into welldisciplined soldiers of being obliged to combat the arguments and perhaps the intrigues of interested persons    the hope that will spring in each mans mind respecting his own escape will prevent his being miserable those who fall in battle will not lose much those who survive will obtain their reward habits of subordination patience under fatigues sufferings and privations of every kind are soldierly qualifications which these men possess in an eminent degree    you ask what is the generals opinion upon this subject he is convinced that the numerous tribes of blacks in the southern parts of the continent offer a resource to us that should not be neglected with respect to my particular plan he only objects to it with the arguments of pity for a man who would be less rich than he might be laurens had asked his father to give him a number of ablebodied slaves instead of leaving him a fortune the project does not appear to have come to any issue at this time see washington to henry laurens  0 march      and washington to john laurens  0 july        this question of punishment was not acted upon by congress and on    august      there being eleven prisoners under the sentence of death and the same objections as are mentioned in this letter existing against such wholesale examples a council of the general officers recommended that severe hard labor be made the intermediate punishment between one hundred lashes and death and such labor to be expended in repairing roads fortifications and other necessary public works   a letter from congress will accompany this containing two resolutions relative to prisoners you will perceive by them that congress go upon the presumption of our furnishing our prisoners in the enemys hands wholly and entirely with provisions their fixing no rule for liquidating and accounting for the rations heretofore supplied by the enemy is a proof that they do not intend them to continue but expect our prisoners will hereafter be altogether victualled by ourselves this is a matter to which it will be necessary to attend carefully both that a competent supply may be immediately ready for the purpose and that there may be no deficiency in future otherwise the consequences may be dreadful for the past conduct of the enemy gives too much reason to apprehend that they would not be very apt to relieve wants to which we had undertaken wholly to administer—washington to boudinot   february      as

painful sensations whenever i have reason to believe i am the object of persecution to men who are embarked in the same general interest and whose friendship my heart does not reproach me with ever

and explained the matter to govr livingston you must be well convinced he wrote that it is indispensably necessary to make use of these means to procure intelligence the persons employed must bear the suspicion of being thought inimical and it is not in their powers to assert their innocence because that would get abroad and destroy the confidence which the enemy puts in them—washington to governor

within his district more than a month longer at the extremity the expectations he has from other quarters appear to be altogether vague and precarious and from anything i can see we have every reason

purpose into jersey where he was joined by pulaski with a party of horse pulaski was stationed for the winter at trenton the british followed wayne into jersey crossing the river in two divisions one landing at billingsport and the other at gloucester amounting in all to more than three thousand men with eight fieldpieces they attempted to surround wayne in the night at haddonfield being in force vastly superior but he received timely intelligence of their design and retreated in the evening a few hours previously to the arrival of the enemy after making a rapid incursion into the country and collecting forage and cattle the british returned to philadelphia but they were harassed by wayne and pulaski while debarking at the ferry and a smart skirmish ensued pulaski exposed himself with his usual bravery his horse was wounded on the   th of march wayne recrossed the river with his detachment at burlington and proceeded to destroy the forage accessible to the enemy in philadelphia county and a part of bucks and to drive off the horses and cattle he thus made a circuit quite round the city—waynes ms letters march  th   th   by advices received from rhode island transmitting to me a copy of a letter from general heath to lieutgeneral burgoyne a copy of which is inclosed i am informed that it is determined to detain general burgoynes troops in new england until all demands for their provisions and other necessaries are satisfied and that this determination is grounded not only upon a requisition of mine for provisions to be sent in for the subsistence of the prisoners in my possession and for the purchase of other necessaries but upon a forgery by my agents emissaries and abettors of what are called continental bills of credit this last allegation is too illiberal to deserve a serious answer with regard to the other i know not from what expression in any of my letters to you it has been understood that i made the requisition alluded to you know that the allowance of provisions to prisoners from the beginning of my command has been equal in quantity and quality to what is given to our own troops not on service if you had thought this insufficient you might have directed a farther supply from the markets and were likewise at liberty to send in whatever articles you thought proper from the country the allowance of fuel has been also regulated as well as our means would admit and a similar permission of purchase or supply from you has never been refused my letter of the   st of april last explained to you what was afforded to the prisoners clothing and some other necessaries they had a right to expect from those who had been the occasion of their being exposed to the chance of captivity and that idea i have ever understood to be mutual but notwithstanding the remonstrances i made to you upon that point finding that supplies were not sent in my humanity interposed in behalf of the unfortunate men in our possession and on a late representation of their distress i permitted in this city the purchase of blanketing and such other necessaries as the severity of the winter require and without which they must absolutely have perished confident as i am that you will acknowledge this to be a just recital of facts i cannot but think it unnecessary to say any thing farther either upon the cruelty falsely alleged to have been exercised against the prisoners or the unjust reflections you have been so often induced to transmit to me upon that head in consideration however of the real and unavoidable distresses of the prisoners on both sides as well as to put an end to all fruitless altercation on the subject i shall consent to an immediate exchange of all prisoners now in our possession as well officers as private men so far as the number of the latter and parity of the rank of the former will admit in the mean time i shall wait the arrival here of the british officers whom you have released upon their paroles and shall without delay send an equal number to you in return with regard to the account for provisions and other necessaries which i find by general heaths letter is become a pretext for infringing if it is not intended as an absolute breach of the convention of saratoga i do readily agree to the immediate appointment of commissioners on your part and on mine to settle that account together with all other accounts for provisions c furnished the prisoners on either side and to make payment of the balance as i have no objection to the earliest meeting of the commissioners for completing the exchange and liquidating the accounts i trust there will be no new impediment to the release of general burgoynes troops but that you will give immediately such orders for their embarkation upon the arrival of the transports at boston as will remove every difficulty—howe to washington   february        howe replied that the exchange of commissioned officers must be governed by the release of the hessian fieldofficers taken at trenton and lieutenantcolonel campbell who have not only been longest confined but have hitherto been the objects of particular exception the convention troops howe also regarded as subjects of exchange   with respect to fort mifflin the inquiry involves very extensive considerations and more or less affects almost all the general officers in this army whose advice or concurrence in the measures taken make them in some degree parties the mode in my opinion most unexceptionable to be pursued is for congress to authorise a committee of their own body or to delegate any other persons they may chuse to intrust not connected with the operations of this army to go into the business—washington to the president of congress   february        you mention some scruples as to the operation of our articles of war with regard to intentional or attempted desertion cases of mere intuition unexpressed in any act notwithstanding the confession of the criminals i do not conceive to fall within the meaning of that article which particularly relates to desertion or to be susceptible of capital punishment but where intention and any acts expressive of it correspond i think there can be no doubt of the propriety of construing it into desertion and inflicting the sentence of the law when a man is found at an improper distance from the camp or in circumstances that indicate an attempt to desert he is certainly to be considered and treated as a deserter if not the attempt or nothing but the full execution of his design were to be deemed desertion the crime would never or very rarely be ascertained for in order to that it would be necessary the soldier should have been actually with the enemy and afterwards recovered when difficulties occur the spirit rather than the letter of the law is to be consulted and this appears clearly to be intended by that part of the oath prescribed to courts martial which declares that when any doubt shall arise which is not explained by the articles the court is to determine according to conscience the best of their understanding and the custom of war in like cases —washington to general smallwood    february        the arts of the enemies of america are endless but all wicked as they are various among other tricks they have forged a pamphlet of letters entitled letters from general washington to several of his friends in      the design of the forger is evident and no doubt it gained him a good beefsteak from his masters i would send you this pamphlet if it were not too bulky for the post as it might serve to amuse your leisure hours during the inaction of winter—richard henry lee to washington   january      the letters referred to are those printed as spurious in vol iv of this collection since my last to you about the end of january i have been favored with your letter of the   th of that month which did not reach my hands till within these few days the question there put was in some degree solved in my last but to be more explicit i can assure you that no person ever heard me drop an expression that had a tendency to resignation the same principles that led me to embark in the opposition to the arbitrary claims of great britain operate with additional force at this day nor is it my desire to withdraw my services while they are considered of importance in the present contest but to report a design of this kind is among the arts which those who are endeavoring to effect a change are practising to bring it to pass i have said and i still do say that there is not an officer in the service of the united states that would return to the sweets of domestic life with more heartfelt joy than i should but i would have this declaration accompanied by these sentiments that while the public are satisfied with my endeavours i mean not to shrink from the cause but the moment her voice not that of faction calls upon me to resign i shall do it with as much pleasure as ever the weary traveller retired to rest this my dear doctor you are at liberty to assert but in doing it i would have nothing formal all things will come right again and soon recover their proper tone as the design is not only seen through but reprobated—washington to rev dr gordon    february        the following extract from a letter written in camp by general varnum as brigadier of the day to general greene not only presents a vivid picture of the distresses of the army but shows the difficulties with which the commanderinchief had to contend as well in witnessing the scenes of suffering among the soldiers as in controlling the discontent and opposing opinions of his officers the situation of the camp is such says general varnum that in all human probability the army must soon dissolve many of the troops are destitute of meat and are several days in arrear the horses are dying for want of forage the country in the vicinity of the camp is exhausted there cannot be a moral certainty of bettering our circumstances while we continue here what consequences have we rationally to expect our desertions are astonishingly great the love of freedom which once animated the breasts of those born in the country is controlled by hunger the keenest of necessities if we consider the relation in which we stand to the troops we cannot reconcile their sufferings to the sentiments of honest men no political consideration can justify the measure there is no local object of so much moment as to conceal the obligations which bind us to them should a blind attachment to a preconcerted plan fatally disaffect and in the end force the army to mutiny then will the same country which now applauds our hermitage valley forge curse our insensibility i have from the beginning viewed this situation with horror it is unparalleled in the history of mankind to establish winterquarters in a country wasted and without a single magazine we now only feel some of the effects which reason from the beginning taught us to expect as inevitable my freedom upon this occasion may be offensive if so i should be unhappy but duty obliges me to speak without reserve my own conscience will approve the deed when some may perhaps look back with regret to the time when the evil in extreme might have been prevented there is no alternative but immediately to remove the army to places where they can be supplied unless effectual remedies can be applied on the spot which i believe every gentleman of the army thinks impracticable—ms letter february   th i have more than once mentioned to you that we have been obliged to renounce the most important enterprises delay the most critical marches by the delinquency of commissaries here of late it has reduced us almost to the point of disbanding the head of the department is a stationary attendant on congress what he might do if he had views sufficiently extensive by a proper employment of agents i know not but as the case is at present he seems to be almost useless i have heard it asserted by more than one sensible disinterested man that the removal of mr trumbull from that office has been the source of all our misfortunes    certain it is that the want of providence or want of ability in the present managers has brought us to the brink of ruin by extraordinary exertions by scraping from distant scanty magazines and collecting with parties we have obtained a temporary relief and have hopes that the representation of our late distress to several persons of influence and authority in different states will procure us such farther supplies as will save us from the disagreeable necessity of dividing the army into cantonments—john laurens to his father    february        the draft of this address is in the ms of gouverneur morris   i am exceedingly sorry to hear that a difference between the officers and men of the continental troops and those of the militia should damp the exertions of the latter it has been my constant endeavor since i had the honor to command the forces of the united states to prevent all animosities and jealousies between the troops of different states whether regular or militia by exercising the most impartial line of conduct towards all i very well know that except there is a mutual confidence and good understanding between all the component parts of an army that the service must be manifestly injured and therefore you may depend that i will take particular care when the army takes the field in the spring and when we shall more than probable be obliged to call upon the militia to act in conjunction with us to endeavor to remove the causes of complaint i hope the unhappy dispute that arose at the sign of the compass between a few officers of the continental army and the militia will rather be looked upon as an accidental matter than the effect of a general and fixed hatred between those two bodies of men imbarked in the same cause and who ought to afford a mutual support to each other and to turn their arms against the common enemy rather than upon one another i do hope that all prejudice upon the part of the country may be laid aside upon this occasion and the most impartial enquiry made into this matter—washington to governor wharton    february      a ms in washingtons writing contains some remarks on a paper presented by col bland in november      these remarks are of no little interest when viewed in the light of subsequent events to abolish colonial distinctions however desirable it may be is next to impossible great pains in the early part of this war was used in vain to do this but even in the new england states where the sentiments and customs of the people have an exact similarity it was found impracticable the new modelling of the army and reducing supernumerary officers is a very desirable matter and ought if possible to take place but quære would not such a total change in our military system as is proposed occasion too great a convulsion would not the number of rejected officers promote discontent and disorder among the common soldiery nay even mutiny and desertion the allowance of land to the disbanded officers may be proper enough—but will not half pay be attended with enormous expence and would not this and allowing half pay to the officers of reduced regiments at the end of the war add such weight to a debt already and probably will be of such magnitude as to sink the colonies under the load of it and give a great disgust to the people at large   ordered that so much of general washingtons letter of

must do it if neither general putnam nor heath in the judgment of the committee will answer the purposes of the command at rhode island the committee best know the designs of congress in assembling a body of troops in that state consequently what kind of an officer under our present circumstances may be made to answer they also know with more certainty than i do what will be the determination of congress respecting general putnam and of course whether the appointing of him to such a command as that at rhode island would fall in with their views it being incumbent on me to observe that with such materials as i am furnished the work must go on whether well or ill is another matter if therefore he and others are not laid aside they must be placed where they can least injure the service

washington and bryan fairfax which does not appear to have been at any period of their lives interrupted although they differed widely in their political sentiments mr fairfax differing from the majority of his countrymen and from his friends thought it his duty to go to england and remain there during the contest with this aim he repaired to new york having obtained a passport from the commanderinchief but when he arrived there he was diverted from his purpose by having certain oaths prescribed to him which his conscience would not allow him to take being afraid they might prevent him from ever again seeing his wife and children this hesitancy excited a prejudice against him which he thought unreasonable and he obtained permission from the british commander to return to his family on his journey he again visited general washington and was received by him with so much kindness and such marked civilities that he wrote him a letter of acknowledgments and thanks soon after he reached virginia to which the above is a reply in that letter he said there are times when favors conferred make a greater impression than at others for though i have received many i hope i have not been unmindful of them yet that at a time your popularity was at the highest and mine at the lowest and when it is so common for mens resentments to run high against those who differ from them in opinion you should act with your wonted kindness towards me has affected me more than any favor i have received and could not be believed by some in new york it being above the run of common minds—sparks   the allusion here is to lord camdens remarks in the debate respecting the reply to the kings speech at the opening of parliament november         the debate turned on american affairs the causes of the dispute and the mode in which the war had been conducted lord camden referring to some of the preliminary steps in the contest said the people of america showed great dissatisfaction but that did not fully answer the intentions of government it was not dissatisfaction but rebellion that was sought dissatisfaction might furnish a pretence for adding to the intolerable oppressions that those people had for a series of years groaned under but nothing short of something in the shape of rebellion or nearly approaching to it could create a decent apology for slaughter conquest and unconditional submission again in regard to the address declaring massachusetts bay to be in rebellion lord camden continued but all this did not do the new englanders were resolved not to verify the address they were determined not to be rebels but only to prepare should the worst happen to be in a situation to defend themselves something more was still wanting and that was obtained our troops

warmest thanks to the virtuous officers and soldiery of this army for that persevering fidelity and zeal which they have uniformly manifested in all their conduct their fortitude not only under the common hardships incident to a military life but also under the additional sufferings to which the peculiar situation of these states has exposed them clearly proves them worthy of the enviable privilege of contending for the rights of human nature the freedom and independence of their country the recent instance of uncomplaining patience during the scarcity of provisions in camp is a fresh proof that they possess in an eminent degree the spirit of soldiers and the magnanimity of patriots the few refractory individuals who disgrace themselves by murmurs it is to be hoped have repented such unmanly behavior and resolved to emulate the noble example of their associates upon every trial which the customary casualties of war may hereafter throw in their way occasional distress for want of provisions and other necessaries is a spectacle that frequently occurs in every army and perhaps there never was one which has been in general so plentifully supplied in respect to the former as ours surely we who are free citizens in arms engaged in a struggle for everything valuable in society and partaking in the glorious task of laying the foundation of an empire should scorn effeminately to shrink under those accidents and rigors of war which mercenary hirelings fighting in the cause of lawless ambition rapine and devastation encounter with cheerfulness and alacrity we should not merely be equal we should be superior to them in every qualification that dignifies the man or the soldier in proportion as the motives from which we act and the final hopes of our toils are superior

scattered throughout the papers from sir william howe applied to the good people of these united states and to the representatives in congress which were heard by the house with great indignation from expressions of sentiment by members on all sides it appears to be the general opinion that such papers should have been marked with the contempt of an immediate return   i have your letters of the   th and   st of february and the  d of march of all which due notice shall be taken particular circumstances make it inconvenient for my commissioners to meet yours at the time appointed i must

the commissioners being postponed by general washington to the   st of this month without assigning any satisfactory reason leads me to believe that neither he nor those under whose authority he acts are sincere in their professions to carry an exchange into execution at this time   read in congress march   th after taking this letter into consideration congress voted to suspend the operation of their former resolves in the present instance and authorized general washington to proceed to an exchange of the prisoners then in the power of the enemy without waiting for a previous settlement of accounts but in arranging any future cartels of exchange he was required to act in conformity to the resolves which ordered a liquidation of accounts for the support of prisoners before they could be exchanged—journals march   th lately a flag with provisions and clothing for the british prisoners with general washingtons passport was seized at lancaster the affair was attended with circumstances of violence still more lately general washingtons engagement with general howe for an exchange of prisoners has been violated congress have resolved that no exchange shall take place till all accounts are settled and the balance due the united states paid the beauty of it is that on a fair settlement we shall without doubt be in mr howes debt and in the mean time we detain his officers and soldiers as a security for the payment the operation of this resolve though it does not plainly appear upon the face of it is to put off an exchange perhaps for ever at any rate it cannot take place all next summer it is thought to be bad policy to go into an exchange but admitting this to be true it is much worse policy to commit such frequent breaches of faith and ruin our national character whatever refined politicians may think it is of great consequence to preserve a national character and if it should once seem to be a system in any state to violate its faith whenever it is the least inconvenient to keep it it will unquestionably have an ill effect upon foreign negotiations and tend to bring government at home into contempt and of course to destroy its influence the general notions of justice and humanity are implanted in almost every human breast and ought not to be too freely shocked in the present case the passions of the country and army are on the side of an exchange and a studied attempt to avoid it will disgust both and tend to make the service odious it will injure drafting and recruiting discourage the militia and increase the discontents of the army the prospect of hopeless captivity cannot but be very disagreeable to men constantly exposed to the chance of it those whose lot it is to fall into it will have little scruple to get rid of it by joining the enemy it is said not to be our present interest to exchange because we should endeavor by and by to take advantage of the enemys weakness to strike some decisive blow if we should fail in this which i believe we shall when they get reinforced we shall not think it our interest to add to the strength of an enemy already strong enough and so on ad infinitum the truth is considered in the mere view of barter it never can be our interest to exchange the constitution of our army from the short term of enlistment and the dependence we are obliged to place in the militia are strongly opposed to it and if the argument of present interest be adhered to we never can exchange i may venture to assert there never can be a time more proper than the present or rather a month or two hence and go about it as soon as we please the previous negotiations necessary and other circumstances will of course procrastinate it for some time and i would ask whether in a republican state and a republican army such a cruel policy as that of exposing those men who are foremost in defence of their country to the miseries of hopeless captivity can succeed—hamilton to governor clinton    march

in a state of repose his eye certainly wants animation my proficiency in this kind of drawing never went beyond sketching a profile i never attempted to paint a miniature likeness of a full face there

been several weeks in the city in pursuance of our agreement for the liberation of officers on parole general lee is not permitted to come out and that orders had been received from you to send him round to philadelphia by water that you might take his parole in person there can be no reason to prevent his parole being taken where he is and i must consider his being required to expose himself to the inconveniences of a seavoyage at this season as altogether unnecessary i had a right to expect that he would have been released as soon as general prescott went in and must request you will accordingly give immediate orders for it if you will be pleased to transmit your directions through me for that purpose i will carefully forward them this would obviate the uncertainty and possible delay of a conveyance by water—washington to sir william howe   march      i wish sir i was not obliged to say there are some ambiguities still characterizing the measures taken concerning general lee which justify alarming surmises notwithstanding all that has passed to the contrary i have now been as explicit as you can desire on the subject of col campbell and the hessian gentlemen and i hope to find you as explicit on the subject of general lee by giving directions without farther delay to liberate him in place of general prescott general lees request mentioned by you to be permitted to come by land to philadelphia can be no objection to this requisition it was founded upon your order to send him round by water to that place and conceiving it would be insisted on that he should pass to philadelphia he preferred the mode of going by land as the least inconvenient alternative but the measure appears to me wholly improper and a departure from our late stipulation calculated to impose unnecessary hardships on that unfortunate gentleman and to produce needless procrastination at least in allowing him the common benefit of a general agreement—washington to sir william howe    march        the preamble and resolve had probably been published before the above letter was received by congress since they both now stand in the journals as they were originally passed whereas experience has proved that no confidence can be placed in prisoners of war or deserters from the enemy who enlist into the continental army but many losses and great mischiefs have frequently happened by them therefore resolved that no prisoners of war or deserters from the enemy be enlisted drafted or returned to serve in the continental army—february   th   putnam is referred to in these sentences to governor clinton washington wrote on the   th the hints which you were pleased to give of mismanagement in the north river command came also from several other hands and did not a little embarrass me as they contain charges rather resulting from want of judgment than any real intention to do wrong it is much to be lamented that we should have officers of so high a rank as to entitle them to claim separate commands with so moderate a share of abilities to direct them in the execution of those commands for an extreme view of putnams abilities see dawson majorgeneral israel putnam your excellency is not ignorant of the extent of general putnams capacity and diligence and how well soever these may qualify him for this most important command the prejudices to which his imprudent lenity to the disaffected and too great intercourse with the enemy have given rise have greatly injured his influence how far the loss of fort montgomery and the subsequent ravages of the enemy are to be attributed to him i will not venture to say as this will necessarily be determined by a court of inquiry whose determinations i would not anticipate unfortunately for him the current of popular opinion in this and the neighboring states and as far as i can learn in the troops under his command runs strongly against him for my own part i respect his bravery and former services and sincerely lament that his patriotism will not suffer him to take that repose to which his advanced age and past services justly entitle him—robert r livingston to washington    january        a short time before congress passed the resolve conferring the authority described above the subject had been vehemently discussed in the british parliament february  th on a motion of mr burke to call for the papers which had passed between the ministry and the generals commanding in america relative to the military employment of indians the act was denounced as criminal and the ministers were censured with much asperity by the prominent opposition members for abetting and approving it mr burke said no proof whatever had been given of the americans having attempted offensive alliances with any one tribe of savages whereas the imperfect papers now before that house demonstrated that the kings ministers had negotiated and obtained such alliances from one end of the continent of america to the other that the americans had actually made a treaty on the footing of neutrality with the famous five nations which the kings ministers had bribed them to violate and to act offensively against the colonies that no attempt had been made in a single instance on the part of the kings ministers to procure a neutrality that if the fact had been that the americans had actually employed those savages yet the difference of employing them against armed and trained soldiers embodied and encamped and employing them against the unarmed and defenceless men women and children of a country dispersed in their houses was manifest and left those who attempted so inhuman and unequal a retaliation without excuse lord george germaine spoke in reply and justified the conduct of administration he said the matter lay within a very narrow compass the indians would not have remained idle spectators the very arguments used by the honorable gentleman who made the motion were so many proofs that they would not besides the rebels by their emissaries had made frequent applications to the indians to side with them the virginians particularly and he said that some indians were employed at boston in the rebel army now taking the disposition of the indians with the applications made to them by the colonies it amounted to a clear indisputable proposition that either they would have served against us or that we must have employed them lord north said on the same side that in respect to the employment of indians he looked upon it as bad but unavoidable governor pownall who had resided long in america and understood the indian character perfectly was of the same opinion he proposed a scheme of his own i know said he and therefore speak directly that the idea of an indian neutrality is nonsense delusive dangerous nonsense if both we and the americans were agreed to observe a strict neutrality in not employing them they would then plunder and scalp both parties indiscriminately on both sides although this is my opinion founded on the knowledge and experience i have had in these matters yet i am persuaded that if we and the americans would come to some stipulation or convention that we would mutually and in a spirit of good faith not suffer the indians to intermeddle but consider and act against them as enemies whenever they did execute hostilities against any of the british nation whether english or americans all this horrid business might be prevented or at least in a great measure restrained governor pownall enlarged upon his scheme and even offered to proceed himself to

involved in the inquiry and i therefore desire that you would repair immediately to fishkill upon the receipt of this to meet general mcdougall and the other gentlemen general mcdougall is to take the

as a train of obstacles to their progress on the  th of november congress had appointed general gates to command in the highlands or rather had connected that post with the northern department and invested him with ample powers to carry on the works but as he was made president of the board of war he never entered upon these duties again on the   th of february governor clinton was requested to take the superintendence of the works but the multiplicity of his civil employments made it necessary for him to decline the undertaking meantime general putnam went to connecticut and left the post in charge of general parsons unfortunately this officer conceived the notion that he had no control over the works in the highlands that the resolve of congress in regard to gates and clinton were personal and not designed to apply to any one else and that having no direct instructions he could not rightfully assume any authority in the matter by the judicious advice of governor clinton however he was prevailed upon to exercise a proper supervision till general mcdougall arrived when these doubts in regard to the extent of command are considered and also the tardy movements of the engineer in executing a plan which he did not approve the extreme fatigue of the service in the midst of winter the privations and sufferings of the men and the want of teams and other necessary aids it is not surprising that very slow progress had been made general mcdougall took the command on the   th of march two days previously kosciuszko arrived who had been appointed engineer in the place of radière from that time the works were pressed forward with spirit to the scientific skill and sedulous application of kosciuszko the public was mainly indebted for the construction of the military defences at west point—sparks   in consequence of this letter the congress decided that all the troops in the state of new york including the whole northern department should be under one general officer and that he should be authorized to draw together at the highlands such parts of them as he should deem expedient to supply the place of those at albany the governor of new york was requested to furnish such a

encouragement to enlist deserters because i have ever found them of the greatest injury to the service by debauching our own men and had therefore given positive orders to all recruiting officers not

having him as an assistant and says he is persuaded he will be an acquisition to the states the only thing against him is that he comes without recommendatory letters the congress have i think very wisely resolved against employing any more foreigners unless they are forced to it by the special contracts of their embassadors or very pointed recommendations on this account the general has in order that the baron might not lose so good an assistant put the matter upon this footing that mr ternant may exercise the office of subinspector without rank for the present and that when his practical abilities are as well known as his theoretical congress will determine a rank suitable to his merit—john laurens to his father    march      i was favored with your letter yesterday as you

depends upon your interpretation of some part of my conduct towards you i will not however conceal from you that foreseeing some difficulties in the way i declined announcing your appointment precipitately and before the other subinspectors were chosen that the whole might be declared at the same time having now in my own mind fixed upon these gentlemen though all of them are not in camp i

philadelphia i know it is a very favorite scheme with many not acquainted with the situation of our magazines and the deranged state of the two capital departments of commissary and quarter master general which have not yet resumed a proper tone to draw together a great body of militia in addition to our continental force and make an attack upon the enemy in philadelphia however much a measure

concerning the nature of the powers contained in general howes commission it was given on no other authority than his own whereas the commission from general washington expressly specified that it was in virtue of full powers to him delegated this defect was objected to by the american commissioners and the subject was referred to general howe who declined altering the commission declaring at the same time that he meant the treaty to be of a personal nature founded on the mutual confidence and honor of the contracting generals and had no intention either of binding the nation or extending the cartel beyond the limits and duration of his own command as this was putting the matter on a totally different footing from that contemplated in general washingtons commission by which congress and the nation were bound and as general howes commissioners refused to treat on any other terms the meeting was dissolved without any progress having been made in a cartel it was intimated by the british commissioners as a reason why general howe declined to negotiate on a national ground that it might imply an acknowledgment inconsistent with the claims of the english government the papers which

referring to the spurious letters already printed in this collection under their respective dates about the same time a forged article purporting to be two resolves of congress had been published by the british with all the formalities of place date and the signatures of the president and secretary and declaring in substance that whereas the mode adopted by many of the states for filling up their quotas by enlistment and drafts for six and nine months was found to produce constant fluctuation in the numbers of the army and want of discipline it was resolved that all the troops then in the army and such as must afterwards be enlisted or drafted should be deemed troops of the united states during the war and that general washington and other commanding officers were required to apprehend and punish as deserters all who should leave the army under pretence of their terms of service being expired these spurious resolves were dated february  0th they may be found in hugh gaines new york

called in townes paper must be an arrant forgery as i never had the least intimation of it and to suppose such a one could have passed is to suppose almost the existence of an impossibility the forgery is calculated for the most wicked purposes to excite an opposition in the people to the measures for drafting and to render them ineffectual there is nothing the enemy will not attempt to carry their ends the only proceedings of congress for drafting that i have seen were passed on the   th of february and are a recommendation to the several states to fill up their respective regiments by drafts from the militia to serve nine months after they appear at the places appointed for their rendezvous dischargeable before the end of that period in proportion as recruits enlisted for three years or during the war may join the regiments in which they are what a contrast between these proceedings and the forgery i shall transmit the paper to congress immediately that they may pursue

division in congress some of the members were wholly opposed to it particularly a majority of the members from the eastern states as encouraging too far the idea of a standing army others were of opinion that congress had no power to act in the matter without special instructions from the states and others were for limiting the time this variety of opinion caused embarrassment in congress and

one that is open nothing but the perverseness of our own conduct can cross it we know that the americans are and must be independent and yet we will not treat with them as such if government itself retains the least idea of sovereignty it has already gone too far for that if it entertains the least hope of peace it has not gone far enough and every step we shall take to put the americans back

through so many shelves and rocks as will be thrown in our way this more than ever is the time for congress to be filled with the first characters from every state instead of having a thin assembly and many states totally unrepresented as is the case at present i have often regretted the pernicious and what appears to me fatal policy of having our ablest men engaged in the formation of the more local governments and filling offices in their respective states leaving the great national concern on which the superstructure of all and every of them absolutely depends and without which none can exist to be managed by men of more contracted abilities indeed those at a distance from the seat of war live in such perfect tranquillity that they conceive the dispute to be in a manner at an end and those near it are so disaffected that they only serve as embarrassments between the two therefore time slips away without the necessary means for opening the campaign in season or with propriety   this conjecture was well founded there is no room to doubt that when the conciliatory bills were brought before parliament by lord north the ministry were convinced a negotiation was pending between

already been signed and when the question was pressed by mr grenville upon lord north he answered that he could not say from authority that the treaty alluded to was signed that indeed it was possible

to a positive resolve of congress and very express orders in engaging british prisoners for your legionary corps when congress referred you to me on the subject of its composition to facilitate your raising it i gave you leave to enlist one third deserters in the foot and was induced to do even that from your assuring me that your intention was principally to take germans in whom you thought a greater confidence might be placed the british prisoners will cheerfully enlist as a ready means of escaping the continental bounty will be lost and your corps as far as ever from being complete i desire therefore that the prisoners may be returned to their confinement and that you will for the future adhere to the restrictions under which i laid you the horse are to be without exception natives who have ties of property and family connections—washington to brigadiergeneral pulaski   may        david henley   i have had several long conversations with the baron steuben who appears to me a man profound in the science of war and well disposed to render his best services to the united states in an interview between him and the general at which i assisted in quality of interpreter he declared that he had purposely waved making any contract with congress previous to his having made some acquaintance with the commander in chief in order that he might avoid giving offence to the officers of the army and that the general might decide in what post he could be the most useful if i have conceived rightly of his character and abilities he would make us an excellent quarter master general in the military part of the department his office being confined to the choice of positions regulation of marches etc but as the civil and military duties with us are blended he cant be disposed of in this way his being a foreigner unfitting him totally for the latter i think he would be the properest man we could choose for the office of inspector general and there are several good assistants that might be given him i have the highest opinion of the service he would render in this line as he seems to be perfectly aware of the disadvantages under which our army has labored from short enlistments and frequent changes seems to understand what our subjects are capable of and is not so staunch a systematist as to be averse from adapting established forms to stubborn circumstances he will not give us the perfect instructions absolutely speaking but the best which we are in a condition to receive we want some kind of general tutoring in this way so much that as obnoxious as conway is to most of the army rather than take the field without the advantages that might be derived from a judicious exercise of his office i would wish every motive of dissatisfaction respecting him for the present to be suppressed the baron proposes to take the rank of major general with the pay rations c he does not wish for any actual command as he is not acquainted with our language and the genius of our people—john laurens to his father    february      the baron steuben has had the fortune to please uncommonly for a stranger at first sight all the general officers who have seen him are prepossessed in his favor and conceive highly of his abilities    as far as my line can reach i conceive the baron to be profound in the military science the general seems to have a very good opinion of him and thinks he might be usefully employed in the office of inspector general but i fancy is cautious of recommending it to congress as he might appear implacably to pursue another person to whom congress gave that post now it is a doubt with me whether the gentleman in question was not virtually removed from the inspectorship by being ordered on the canadian expedition in that case the difficulty would be obviated the barons own desire is to have for the present the rank and pay of a major general not to have any actual command until he is better known and shall be better qualified by a knowledge of our language and the genius and manners of the people then if any stroke is to be struck his ambition prompts him to solicit a command—john laurens to his father   march        francis barber   john brooks   william davis   i had received the resolution of congress of the   d extending my former powers from your representation of the character of john derrick he seems a proper object to make an example of you will be pleased to transmit me the proceedings of the court martial against him that i may determine upon them this i do not desire from the smallest doubt of the most conscientious rectitude and propriety of conduct on your part being satisfied that this will be the case but from an idea and on reconsideration of the matter that the powers delegated to me by congress are of a personal nature and should according to common usage in similar cases at least in instances where life is concerned be exercised and carried into execution by a personal decree you are not to infer from hence that you are not to order court martials for the trial of offenders in the predicament of john derrick c who have or may violate the resolutions you mention but only that the proceedings in such cases where capital punishments are denounced must be sent to me for approbation or disapprobation—washington to general smallwood  0 april
