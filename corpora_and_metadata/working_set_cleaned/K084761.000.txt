an account of a most efficacious medicine for sore eyes  price sixpence  an account of a most efficacious medicine for soreness weakness and several other distempers of the eyes  by sir hans sloane bart physician to his majesty etc  the second edition  london printed for dan brown at the blackswan without temple bar  to the king sir this account of my most effectual medicine for the cure of sore and weak eyes is now made public for the benefit of mankind and most humbly dedicated to your majesty by  your majestys most dutiful and most obedient subject and servant hans sloane  an account of a most efficacious medicine for sore eyes through an earnest desire to be useful in my profession the practice of physic to which i was led by a strong natural inclination i was always very attentive to matters of fact and the real cures that fell under my observation of these i saw many performed upon sore eyes by doctor luke rugeley whereupon i applied to a very understanding apothecary of his particular acquaintance and mine and endeavored though without effect to procure some knowledge of the medicine he made use of after the doctors death i still pursued my enquiry by searching into his printed books and manuscript papers and particularly into a very curious materia medica left by him but all in vain till at length a person whom i believe he had employed in making his medicine came to me and for a pecuniary reward joined to a promise of not divulging it to his prejudice delivered me up the genuine receipt in the docctors own handwriting which as i reformed improved and used it many years is as follows  the receipt take of prepared tutty one ounce of lapis haematites prepared two scruples of the best aloes prepared twelve grains of prepared pearl four grains put them into a porphyry or marble mortar and rub them with a pestle of the same stone very carefully with a sufficient quantity of vipers grease or fat to make a liniment to be used daily morning or evening or both according to the convenience of the patient as hereafter directed  this medicine i soon tried and though a composition found it so surprizingly beneficial that by the right use of it not one in five hundred missed of a cure unless their disorder proceeded from a venereal taint  several years after i had been in possession of this secret in turning over some manuscripts of sir theodore mayerne i found he had known the same ointment or liniment and had entered it in his pharmacopoea under his own name though i afterward discovered that it was not originally his but had been communicated to him by sir matthew lister a member of the college of physicians who had performed a cure with it on a lady savile which sir theodore thought a very extraordinary one and it is very probable that he afterward communicated it to dr thomas rugeley father of dr luke rugeley as i find they were cotemporaries and friends  the method which has best succeeded with me in facilitating the efficacious use of this liniment is to bleed and blister in the neck and behind the ears in order to draw off the humors from the eyes and afterward according to the degree of the inflammation or acrimony of the juices to make a drain by issues between the shoulders or a perpetual blister and for washing the eyes i generally recommend spring water which i think preferable to any spirituous lotion whether simple or compound and the best inward medicines i have experienced to be conserve of rosemary flowers antiepileptic powders such as pulvis ad guttetam betony sage rosemary eyebright wild valerian root castor etc washed down with a tea made of some of the same ingredients as also drops of spirit lavendulae composit and sal volat oleos  if the inflammation returns drawing about six ounces of blood from the temples by leaches or cupping on the shoulders is very proper  the liniment is to be applied with a small hair pencil the eye winking or a little opened  in prosecuting the cure of sore eyes i have been sometimes surprised by want of success till at length i found that the cause was a lurking intermitting fever every fit of which affected the eyes and rendered their disorder obstinate wherefore upon taking off the fever by a proper use of the bark the cure has been effectually performed  this medicine has cured many whose eyes were covered with opake films and cicatrices left by inflammations and apostems of the cornea which though they happen to persons of all conditions yet are more common among the poorer sort of people many of whom were so totally deprived of sight as to be under a necessity of being led to me and after some time could perfectly well find their way without a guide to my great satisfaction and it is not only very beneficial in such cases but also where there is an excessive pain in the eyes shooting thence up into the head as i particularly remember in a great lady who had such pains in her sore eyes and head that she had when i first saw her taken about fifty drops of laudanum thrice in twenty four hours if i remember right of which complaints she and many others have been relieved by this medicine without the help of any opiate  monsieur anisson who was sent hither with the duke daumont commissioner for settling a treaty of commerce with england brought me recommendatory letters from some friends in france i observed a great soreness and weakness in his eyes of which the application of my medicine very soon cured him whereupon he assured me that he would procure me from the king his master any reward i should think fit to ask for the secret he being accustomed to oblige his subjects that way but i answered him that i was then bound by a promise to conceal it  it is to be observed contrary to the common practice and to the opinion which i myself entertained in my earlier days and communicated to the public in the introduction to my natural history of jamaica that cathartics especially with the addition of mercury are prejudicial in the diseases of the eyes which are cured by this medicine  it is also worthy of remark that people afflicted with weak eyes are overfond of hoodwinking or covering them from the light which sometimes retards the cure by keeping their eyes too warm and therefore i have constantly advised them to throw away these coverings as soon as they could possibly bear the light  i was intimately acquainted with dr william stokeham a very ingenious gentleman physician to king william iii who had formerly spent some years at padua and had been acquainted with the most eminent physicians of that university and also with tachenius of venice one of the greatest chemists of the last age he told me he had learnt the great virtue of vipers grease or fat in the cure of discases of the eyes which is recommended for that purpose by daniel ludovicus in his book de pharmacia moderno seculo applicanda gothae        o and this indeed i judged so very reasonable that i substituted that grease or fat in the place of the hogs lard which was in the original receipt and found that it added so much to the efficacy of the medicine as to make it do what i thought wonders and as i was not bound to secrecy with regard to this improvement i communicated it to the late dr arbuthnot who after repeated trials of that fat alone on sore eyes had so high an opinion of its virtues that he looked on it as equally beneficial with the whole medicine  i have since read in some missionary letters that serpents fat is used by the eastindians for the same purpose  it is an observation made by many naturalists that those serpents cast their skins every year and with them the coverings of their eyes but how far or whether at all their fat is concerned in this phenomenon i leave to others to determine  one of the most eminent and learned chirurgical authors to whom i had a particular regard in my practice cautions his readers against the use of oil in discases of the eyes by which i suppose he meant oliveoil agreeable to this caution i confess i never used any oil either alone or mixed with other medicines for the eyes being unwilling to try remedies whose effects were doubtful and may possibly be pernicious which i afterward observed to be the case with regard to oliveoil when used by some people to whom i had given the liniment in order to make it more liquid upon drying for the liniment in that state has caused very considerable complaints this in my opinion proceeds from some hot sharp particles contained in the oil though it is generally reckoned very soft and mild in outward and inward use for i remember when at montpellier i was informed by monsieur magnol and others of my acquaintance there that the feeding of tame rabbits with olive leaves in want of other food has caused their making bloody urine  i had formerly as already said promised secrecy with regard to this medicine which i have religiously kept till now that i think myself for many reasons abundantly absolved i have had some other medicines of the like nature communicated to me under the same restriction and exclusive of these few cases i cannot charge myself with making the least mystery of my practice for in consultations in a number of cases of importance i have been always very free and open far from following the example of some physicians of good morals and great reputation who have on many occasions thought proper to conceal part of their own acquired knowledge alleging the maxim artis est celare artem and that i have not been inclined to conceal or monopolize medicines of great use the following instance will sufficiently show  sir robert southwell a very worthy president of the royal society who was a patron to many persons of merit and among others to captain dampier told me that the captain in conversation let him know that his family at exmouth in devonshire had a secret medicine whereby they infallibly cured all men and beasts bit by mad dogs and other creatures whereupon i earnestly entreated sir robert to use his interest with the captain to procure if possible a full account of it as a matter of great consequence to the public sir robert readily complied and at his request captain dampier obtained from his relations the account thereof which i published entire in the philosophical transactions no     with all the necessary circumstances to be observed several of which were afterward omitted by the abridgers of that paper but soon after the said account had been put into my hands having assured sir robert that jewsears mentioned therein as a principal ingredient of the medicine must be a mistake inasmuch as that vegetable is pernicious taken inwardly i desired him to procure a sample of the herb so named in the account in order to examine what it was and likewise a dose of the medicine to know the quantity to be taken this occasioned both the one and the other to be sent up from the family by which means i discovered that it really was not jewsears but the lichen cinereus terrestris of mr ray who had first publicly taken notice of it in his catalogue of english plants printed in the year    0 he at the same time wondering that it had escaped the observation of all former botanists and this instance by the by shows the usefulness of observing nondescript simples which may possibly be found as his since was to be of great importance to the welfare of mankind this point being settled i accompanied the publication of the letter or account with a remark without which as manifestly appears it either would have had no effect or have been of bad consequence i at the same time acquainted mr petiver mr doody mr rand and other botanists with the discovery of this matter and recommended to them to provide a quantity of this lichen sufficient to answer all occasions it was accordingly made use of with the same success with which it has ever since been attended  the end
