analysis of bellostes pills and their manner of operating in the human body by the author himself with full directions for using of this remedy it is a thing universally known that england has of old been the nursery of men of learning and that she is still this very day the mother of arts and sciences and amongst those that this flourishing kingdom has cultivated with an inimitable care physic is placed in the first rank it is to the celebrated professors of these famous universities as well as to the knowledge and experience of the excellent practitioners of this country that it owes its finest luster therefore all the world ought to preserve a respectful and grateful memory for those great men who have published so many learned works and have made discoveries upon the human body of a prodigious utility for the preservation of mankind and the cure of the sick  yet one cannot deny that there has been in foreign countries consummated practitioners who having exercised their profession during a great number of years and who having had favorable opportunities of employing the happy talents which providence had bestowed upon them with a sound judgment and particular lights have upon a long experience made discoveries and found out remedies unknown to the preceding ages whereby the glory they have acquired by their art is not less considerable than the infinite service done to the public by their studies and indefatigable assiduity  i think i may be allowed to speak particularly on this subject as being the son of a father so much distinguished in surgery by a successful practice of sixty years which made him worthy of the most eminent employments that a man of his profession could aspire to and whose writings are translated into most of the languages of europe who having found out the salutary effects that mercury produces in the human body spent three quarter parts of his life in discovering the safest manner of taking it successfully and without the danger of any accident be it ever so small  he has been so lucky in his search that he has performed with this mineral a vast number of cures most of them of a different nature which in the beginning have even surpassed his expectation and he has observed that all these good effects could be attained only by crude mercury being first very well cleansed of all its terrestial and arsenical parts whereof it is loaded coming from the mine tied by a curb that hinders it from sublimating and mixed only with gentle and suitable purgatives without any preparation by fire which is always very dangerous as he has judiciously expressed it in his second volume  he has had the most favorable opportunities to try it having been for a long time surgeon major of the hospitals of the french kings army in italy and afterward first surgeon to madam royal at turin during twentysix years till that princess died where he has made with the mercury thus prepared several cures which have been admired by all the court and where his person and what he did will not soon be forgotten  he was sufficiently satisfied that mercury whereof he alone has found the true preparation is a rare gift of providence capable to obviate so many different distempers since in the manner he gives it it has the principal qualifications required for curing all the disorders occasioned by the bad constitution of the blood which are to evacuate superfluous and peccant humors to absorbe the sharpness of the blood and of the humors and to dissolve the thickness thereof it tempers besides the ferments of the stomach when they are in a manner viciated and puts them again in a condition to make a good and perfect digestion which is the spring of life and health and on the contrary when it is adulterated it is the first cause of most distempers that attack the human bodies  in effect when this vital function comes to be disordered by the misusage that is made of food which is the most common how many diseases is it not subject to breed when there can only result from the concoction of bad ailments a sharp or viscous chylus and sometimes both which can only produce a blood of the like or same nature  from the thickness of the blood and of the humors comes a great number of infirmities as the obstructions in the entrails and the kernels a slowness in the circulation from thence the retardment and sometimes the stoppage of the secretions and of the distributions of the nutricious and other necessary juices for the preservation of the animal economy  their sharpness is not less dangerous as being very often the occasion of the disorders abovementioned and the cause of overflowings and the thickenings of the lymph in the different parts of the body the irritations of the nerves and the contractions of the fibers  these two causes well considered it is easy to conceive that from them proceed most of the disorders that afflict human body as the tumors in the liver the overflowing of the choler in the surface of the body or its spilling in the ventricle the obstructions of the kernels in the mesentery or in womens breasts schirrus or cancers oppilations green sickness stopping of the courses hysterical vapors spilling of milk in women after their lyingsin pains in the head swimmings in the same megrim scurvy fevers st anthonys fire surfeits consumption oppressions in the breast and shortness of breath sciatica rheumatism the gout the griping of the guts nephretick cholick the gravel the strangury the hypochondriac disease or melancholy as likewise the kings evil  all this at first sight seems to be a paradox yet every thing rightly considered and weighed with judgment and without prejudice it shall plainly be found that one and the same cause produces many different effects if it be observed that all these distempers are occasioned by the sharpness or the viscosity of the humors which slide into different parts of the body as they find them disposed to receive them  the worms to which children more particularly are very subject by the ill use that one allows them to make of fruit and sweatmeats there perishes a prodigious number of these innocent creatures by causes very often unknown and for want of giving them the proper remedies to destroy those dangerous insects  there are also disorders which the depravation and the licentiousness of the age have rendered too common produced by a ferment which is extraneous sharp and malignant and on which though there be much to be said i choose to be silent  as my father has labored all his life for the public good in the first volume of his book entitled the hospital surgeon he has given a short and easy method of curing in a short time all sorts of wounds in the second volume he has mechanically explained the virtues of mercury and its manner of operating on the mass of blood in the human bodies those that shall think fit to read it they shall find an account of a distemper of each specie of those that he cured with this remedy the learned and the curious may have recourse to it my intention being only to give an idea or a general notion of the effect which this remedy produces to those that are not at hand for to provide themselves with the said book or who will not give themselves the trouble of reading an entire volume  this remedy ought not to be considered separately neither as a single purgative soft and gentle nor singly as a mineral liquid and penetrating but as a specific remedy compounded of both in a manner which renders it almost universal since it perfectly tempers the bad quality of the blood and of the lymph and that it evacuates without trouble or alteration the superfluous and peccant humors by the usual ways of nature  it is certain that the roundness of mercury and its activity are the two main qualities that we are to consider in the effect which it produces on the mass of humors since its weight is only of some consequence when it is united in a certain volume as it is given in the twisting of the guts  when it comes then to dissolve in the stomach the most volatile part of mercury that separates by means of the ferments and the heat of the stomach slips with the chylus into the lacteal veins that are carried together and by the same way into the mass of the blood there by its roundness and its natural motion which is augmented by the vibration of the arteries it circulates into the blood and lymphatick vessels dividing it self as we conceive it into infinite small parts it runs through all the capillary veins if it meets in its way any obstacle in the glands or entrails it strikes and beats against it it loosens part of it until at last by often repeating the same action it makes it self a free passage and thereby procures to the humors a clear way which to them for a long time was become impracticable by its continual and successive rubbings it blunts the points and edges of the acids that it meets with it wastes and divides them it drags and hurries them out of the body partly by transpiration by urine and by stools by assistance of the proper purgatives fit to dissolve and evacuate the slimy and ropy matters and all extraneous bodies out of the stomach and intestines apt to breed various distempers which though slight and insignificant in their beginning are sometimes of a very dangerous consequence  thus it is that i have often seen persons cured which were afflicted with inveterate obstructions in the entrails of the lower belly and in the mesenterick glands which were become schirrous and which permitted the passage only to the part of the chylus the most waterish and less nourishing and the blood not receiving sufficient reparation in proportion to the losses it makes by the transpiration the urine and other evacuations there had ensued a total leanness in the body which evidently tended to a consumption  it is after the same manner of operating that this medicine has often cured old ulcers tetters over all the body hysterical convulsions with seventeen relapses in a day old stoppages of the courses spilling of milk after delivery which had obliged the woman to keep her bed for eight years looseness and disenteries gripings of the guts nephretick cholicks with loss of blood by urine hypochondriack diseases three years old gouts rheumatisms all over the body and venereal distempers so old and obstinate as to have resisted all the other usual remedies these are cures publicly known which have been performed in france by the help of my pills even with the knowledge of the physicians of the court  it is to be observed that when these sorts of distempers are new they are cured with an admirable quickness and facility but when they are of an old date and inveterate one must not flatter ones self they cannot be cured but by a long course of physic more or less according to the age and the constitution of the patient who rather than to discontinue ought to go on with a very moderate dose which purging him only three times or thereabouts may not give him any trouble or discourage him the distemper at last will be conquered for it is ridiculous and absurd to imagine that one dose or two of any physic whatsoever may cure a chronical disease  how can one expect to render in a short time fluid a thick and viscous blood to dissipate old tumors to melt inveterate obstructions to render balsamic sharp humors to restore the animal secretions return to the fibers their natural springiness in short to restore all the parts of the body in a perfect state of health which can only be performed by a good dissolvant and absorbent taken in a suitable dose during a sufficient time for to fulfill these indications  it only belongs to quacks to promise very speedy cures and therefore the success never or seldom answers that is the right name and character of those impostors who by dint of untruths gather riches deceiving the easy credulity of an ignorant public so far as to falsify good remedies and to sell them under the name of the true author so that one cannot take precaution enough in making use of remedies and especially specific ones one ought to get them from the author himself or from persons of probity who are in correspondence with him  those that shall make use of this remedy shall find by experience that insensibly it expels out of the body all that is foul malignant and extraneous and that it averts the infirmities of old age  it is by that means that my father has lived above eighty years without feeling those ailments to which one is subject at that age but at last being dead if he could not leave me his learning and his happy talents he has made me the heir of his secret of his honesty and of his unalterable uprightness as well as an invincible hatred for fraud and falsehood  the whole dose which is one pill is not to serve for a rule to every body for it must be altered and proportioned to the age and to the constitution of the patient as well as to the effect it produces for an instance if it purges four or five times it is enough if eight or ten times it must be lessened one quarter one third part or one half and if it purges only two or three times and but little at a time then the dose must be increased in proportion yet if it should sometimes happen in lusty persons full of gross humors that a common dose should occasion a plentiful evacuation one must not be discouraged for then the more the physic operates the more one feels the illness decreasing and ones strength augmenting but as there are likewise some constitutions the humors whereof are difficult to be evacuated and that even one dose and a half purges them but little the patient then must take a glister the day of a second taking or the day following it softens the viscous and clammy humors it loosens the fibers of the intestines and empties what has been put in motion by the pills and it is very proper to make use now and then of such a remedy  in cases of extraordinary cholick as the twisting of the guts the dose must be doubled and even trebled but in this last case if the intestine should be fallen into the scrotum the taking of the pills must be suspended until it be reduced again into the abdomen  if the gout be newly come or just growing upon one it radically cures it but if it be of a long standing it puts off the fit and lessens the violence of the pains  as this remedy is very safe in its operation it is given with success and without the least danger to childbearing women and to nurses in a moderate dose for it increases and cools their milk  those persons that use to take a purge by precaution will be entirely satisfied with the effect of this remedy for it evacuates the phlegm and the choler to admiration without pains gripes or any alterations it creates an appetite and promotes sleep  a proof that it is no violent medicine is that it has cured children under a twelvemonth old of a fever caused by bad food and convulsions occasioned by the worms observing to give them only a little dose proportioned to their age divided into small parts that they may swallow it in lumps or grains without being dissolved before taking for the dissolution of this physic must absolutely be made in the stomach and to that purpose one may wrap the pills into waferpaper roasted apples sweetmeats or the like  they are taken every other night two or three hours after a very light supper with muttonbroath water gruel or tea as hot as one can drink it the next day one may take again some such hot liquid in order to help the operation of the medicine it also may be taken in the morning fasting which is better than at night  one is not obliged to keep in bed nor the chamber nor to observe a very rigorous diet but only to take care not to catch cold to forbear all acids unripe fruit all things made of milk pork flesh and salt meat
