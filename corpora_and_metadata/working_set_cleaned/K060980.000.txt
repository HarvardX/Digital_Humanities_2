persecution of the protestants in france xiii a letter to mr how by way of reply to his considerations of the preface to an enquiry into the occasional conformity of dissenters   london printed in the year   0   an explanatory preface it is not that i see any reason to alter my opinion in any thing i have writ which occasions this epistle but i find it necessary for the satisfaction of some persons of honor as well as wit to pass a short explication upon it and tell the world what i mean or rather what i do not mean in some things wherein i find i am liable to be misunderstood  i confess my self something surpised to hear that i am taxed with bewraying my own nest and abusing our nation by discovering the meanness of our original in order to make the english contemptible abroad and at home in which i think they are mistaken for why should not our neighbors be as good as we to derive from and i must add that had we been an unmixed nation i am of opinion it had been to our disadvantage for to go on farther we have three nations about us as clear from mixtures of blood as any in the world and i know not which of them i could wish our selves to be like i mean the scots the welsh and irish and if i were to write a reverse to the satyr i would examine all the nations of europe and prove that those nations which are most mixed are the best and have least of barbarism and brutality among them and abundance of reasons might be given for it too long to bring into a preface  but i give this hint to let the world know that i am far from thinking it is a satyr upon the english nation to tell them they are derived from all the nations under heaven that is from several nations nor is it meant to undervalue the original of the english for we see no reason to like them the worse being the relics of romans danes saxons and normans than we should have done if they had remained britains that is than if they had been all welshmen  but the intent of the satyr is pointed at the vanity of those who talk of their antiquity and value themselves upon their pedigree their ancient families and being true born whereas it is impossible we should be true born and if we could should have lost by the bargain  these sort of people who call themselves true born and tell long stories of their families and like a nobleman of venice think a foreigner ought not to walk on the same side of the street with them are owned to be meant in this satyr what they would infer from their own original i know not nor is it easy to make out whether they are the better or the worse for their ancestors our english nation may value themselves for their wit wealth and courage and i believe few will dispute it with them but for long originals and ancient true born families of english i would advise them to wave the discourse a true english man is one that deserves a character and i have no where lessened him that i know of but as for a true born english man i confess i do not understand him  from hence i only infer that an english man of all men ought not to despise foreigners as such and i think the inference is just since what they are to day we were yesterday and to morrow they will be like us if foreigners misbehave in their several stations and employments i have nothing to do with that the laws are open to punish them equally with natives and let them have no favor  but when i see the town full of lampoons and invectives against dutchmen only because they are foreigners and the king reproached and insulted by insolent pedants and balladmaking poets for employing foreigners and for being a foreigner himself i confess my self moved by it to remind our nation of their own original thereby to let them see what a banter is put upon our selves in it since speaking of englishmen ab origin we are really foreigners our selves  i could go on to prove it is also impolitick in us to discourage foreigners since it is easy to make it appear that the multitudes of foreign nations who have took sanctuary here have been the greatest additions to the wealth and strength of the nation the great essential whereof is the number of its inhabitants nor would this nation have ever arrived to the degree of wealth and glory it now boasts of if the addition of foreign nations both as to manufactures and arms had not been helpful to it this is so plain that he who is ignorant of it is too dull to be talked with  the satyr therefore i must allow to be just till i am otherwise convinced because nothing can be more ridiculous than to hear our people boast of that antiquity which if it had been true would have left us in so much worse a condition than we are in now whereas we ought rather to boast among our neighbors that we are a part of themselves or the same original as they but bettered by our climate and like our language and manufactures derived from them and improved by us to a perfection greater than they can pretend to  this we might have valued our selves upon without vanity but to disown our descent from them talking big of our ancient families and long originals and stand at a distance from foreigners like the enthusiast in religion with a stand off i am more holy than thou this is a thing so ridiculous in a nation derived from foreigners as we are that i could not but attack them as i have done  and whereas i am threatened to be called to a public account for this freedom and the publisher of this has been newpaperd in goal already for it though i see nothing in it for which the government can be displeased yet if at the same time those people who with an unlimited arrogance in print every day affront the king prescribe the parliament and lampoon the government may be either punished or restrained i am content to stand and fall by the public justice of my native country which i am not sensible i have any where injured  nor would i be misunderstood concerning the clergy with whom if i have taken any license more than becomes a satyr i question not but those gentlemen who are men of letters are also men of so much candor as to allow me a loose at the crimes of the guilty without thinking the whole profession lashed who are innocent i profess to have very mean thoughts of those gentlemen who have deserted their own principles and exposed even their morals as well as loyalty but not at all to think it affects any but such as are concerned in the fact  nor would i be misrepresented as to the ingratitude of the english to the king and his friends as if i meant the english as a nation are so the contrary is so apparent that i would hope it should not be suggested of me and therefore when i have brought in britannia speaking of the king i suppose her to be the representative or mouth of the nation as a body but if i say we are full of such who daily affront the king and abuse his friends who print scurrilous pamphlets virulent lampoons and reproachful public banters against both the kings person and government i say nothing but what is too true and that the satyr is directed at such i freely own and cannot say but i should think it very hard to be censured for this satyr while such remain vnquestiond and tacitly approved that i can mean none but such is plain ftom these few lines ye heavens regard almighty jove look down and view thy injured monarch on the throne on their ungrateful heads due vengeance take who sought his aid and then his part forsake   if i have fallen upon our vices i hope none but the vicious will be angery as for writing for interest i disown it i have neither place nor pension nor prospect nor seek none nor will have none if matter of fact justifies the truth of the crimes the satyr is just as to the poetic liberties i hope the crime is pardonable i am content to be stoned provided none will attack me but the innocent  if my countrymen would take the hint and grow betternaturd from my illnatured poem as some call it i would say this of it that though it is far from the best satyr that ever was wrote twould do the most good that ever satyr did  and yet i am ready to ask pardon of some gentlemen too who though they are englishmen have good nature enough to see themselves reproved and can bear it these are gentlemen in a true sense that can bear to be told of their faux pas and not abuse the reprover to such i must say this is no satyr they are exceptions to the general rule and i value my performance from their generous approbation more than i can from any opinion i have of its worth  the hasty errors of my verse i made my excuse for before and since the time i have been upon it has been but little and my leisure less i have all along strove rather to make the thoughts explicit than the poem correct however i have mended some faults in this edition and the rest must be placed to my account  as to answers banters true english billinsgate i expect them till no body will buy and then the shop will be shut had i wrote it for the gain of the press i should have been concerned at its being printed again and again by pirates as they call them and paragraphmen but would they but do it justice and print it true according to the copy they are welcome to sell it for a penny if they please  the pence indeed is the end of their works i will engage if no body will buy no body will write and not a patriotpoet of them all now will in defense of his native country which i have abused they say print an answer to it and give it about for godssake  the preface the end of satyr is reformation and the author though he doubts the work of conversion is at a general stop has put his hand to the plow  i expect a storm of illlanguage from the fury of the town and especially from those whose english talent it is to rail and without being taken for a conjurer i may venture to foretell that i shall be cavild at about my mean style rough verse and incorrect language things i might indeed have taken more care in but the book is printed and though i see some faults it is too late to mend them and this is all i think needful to say to them  possibly some body may take me for a dutchman in which they are mistaken but i am one that would be glad to see englishmen behave themselves better to strangers and to governors also that one might not be reproached in foreign countries for belonging to a nation that wants manners  i assure you gentlemen strangers use us better abroad and we can give no reason but our ill nature for the contrary here  methinks an englishman who is so proud of being called a goodfellow should be civil and it cannot be denied but we are in many cases and particularly to strangers the churlishest people alive  as to vices who can dispute our intemperance while an honest drunken fellow is a character in a mans praise all our reformations are banters and will be so till our magistrates and gentry reform themselves by way of example then and not till then they may be expected to punish others without blushing  as to our ingratitude i desire to be understood of that particular people who pretending to be protestants have all along endeavored to reduce the liberties and religion of this nation into the hands of king james and his popish powers together with such who enjoy the peace and protection of the present government and yet abuse and affront the king who procured it and openly profess their uneasiness under him these by whatsoever names or titles they are dignified or distinguished are the people aimed at nor do i disown but that it is so much the temper of an englishman to abuse his benefactor that i could be glad to see it rectified  they who think i have been guilty of any error in exposing the crimes of my own countrymen to themselves may among many honest instances of the like nature find the same thing in mr cowely in his imitation of the second olympic ode of pindar his words are these but in this thankless world the givers are envied even by the receivers it is now the cheap and frugal fashion rather to hide than pay an obligation nay it is much worse than so it now an artifice does grow wrongs and outrages to do lest men should think we owe   the introduction speak satyr for there is none can tell like thee whether it is folly pride or knavery that makes this discontented land appear less happy now in times of peace than war why civil feuds disturb the nation more than all our bloody wars have done before fools out of favor grudge at knaves in place and men are always honest in disgrace the court preferments make men knaves in course but they which would be in them would be worse it is not at foreigners that we repine would foreigners their perquisites resign the grand contentions plainly to be seen to get some men put out and some put in for this our s  rs make long harangues and florid m  rs whet their polished tongues statesmen are always sick of one disease and a good pension gives them present ease that is the specific makes them all content with any king and any government good patriots at courtabuses rail and all the nations grievances bewail but when the sovereign balsams once applied the zealot never fails to change his side and when he must the golden key resign the railing spirit comes about again who shall this bubbld nation disabuse while they their own felicities refuse who at the wars have made such mighty pother and now are falling out with one another with needless fears the jealous nation fill and always have been saved against their will who fifty millions sterling have disbursd to be with peace and too much plenty cursed who their old monarch eagerly undo and yet uneasily obey the new search satyr search a deep incision make the poysons strong the antidotes too weak it is pointed truth must manage this dispute and downright english englishmen confute whet thy just anger at the nations pride and with keen phrase repel the vicious tide to englishmen their own beginnings show and ask them why they slight their neighbors so go back to elder times and ages past and nations into long oblivion cast to old britannias youthful days retire and there for trueborn englishmen enquire britannia freely will disown the name and hardly knows her self from whence they came wonders that they of all men should pretend to birth and blood and for a name contend go back to causes where our follies dwell and fetch the dark original from hell speak satyr for there is none like thee can tell the trueborn englishman part i wherever god erects a house of prayer the devil always builds a chapel there and twill

englands vices to conceal or if that tasks impossible to do at least be just and show her virtues too too great the first alas the last too few england unknown as yet unpeopled lay happy had she remained so to this day and not to every nation been a prey her open harbors and her fertile plains the merchants glory those and these the swains to every barbarous nation have betrayed her who conquer her as often as they invade her so beautys guarded but by innocence that ruins her which should be her defense ingratituds a devil of black renown possessed her very early for his own an ugly surly sullen selfish spirit who satans worst perfections does inherit second to him in malice and in force all devil without and all within him worse he made her firstborn race to be so rude and suffered her so often to be subdued by several crowds of wandering thieves oerrun often unpeopld and as often undone while every nation that her powers reduced their languages and manners introduced from whose mixed relics our compounded breed by spurious generation does succeed making a race uncertain and unevn derived from all the nations under heaven the romans first with julius caesar came including all the nations of that name gauls greeks and lombards and by computation auxiliaries or slaves of every nation with hengist saxons danes with sueno came in search of plunder not in search of fame scots picts and irish from the hibernian shore and conquering william brought the normans over all these their barbarous offspring left behind the dregs of armies they of all mankind blended with britains who before were here of whom the welsh have blessed the character from this amphibious illborn mob began that vain illnatured thing an englishman the customs sirnames languages and manners of all these nations are their own explainers whose reliks are so lasting and so strong they have left a shiboleth upon our tongue by which with easy search you may distinguish your romansaxondanish norman english the great invading w the conq norman let us know what conquerours in aftertimes might do to every or archer musqueteer he brought to town he gave the lands which never

army could disband he raised no money for he paid in land he gave his legions their eternal station and made them all freeholders of the nation he cantoned out the country to his men and every soldier was a denizen the rascals thus enriched he called them lords to please their upstart pride with new made words and doomsday book his tyranny records and here begins our ancient pedigree that so exalts our poor nobility it is that from some french trooper they derive who with the norman bastard did arrive the trophies of the families appear some show the sword the bow and some the spear which their great ancestor forsooth did wear these in the heralds register remain their noble mean extraction to explain yet who the hero was no man can tell whether a drummer or a colonel the silent record blushes to reveal their undescended dark original but grant the best how came the change to pass a true born englishman of norman race a turkish horse can show more history to prove his welldescended family conquest as by the dr sherl de facto moderns it is expressed may give a title to the lands possessed but that the longest sword should be so civil to make a frenchman english that is the devil these are the heroes that despise the dutch and rail at newcome foreigners so much forgetting that themselves are all derived from the most scoundrel race that ever lived a horrid crowd of rambling thieves and drones who ransacked kingdoms and dispeopld towns the pict and painted britain treacherous scot by hunger theft and rapine hither brought norwegian pirates buccaneering danes whose redhaird offspring every where remains who joined with normanfrench compound the breed from whence your trueborn englishmen proceed and left by length of time it be pretended the climates may this modern breed have mended wise providence to keep us where we are mixes us daily with exceeding care we have been europes sink the jakes where she voids all her offal outcast progeny from henrys time the strolling bands of banished fugitives from neighboring lands have here a certain sanctuary found the eternal refuge of the vagabond where in but half a common age of time borrwing new blood and manners from the clime proudly they learn all mankind to contemn and all their race are trueborn englishmen dutch walloons flemmings irishmen and scots vaudois and voltolins and hugonots in good queen besss charitable reign supplied us with three hundred thousand men religion god we thank thee sent them hither priests protestants the devil and all together of all professions and of every trade all that were perfecuted or afraid whether for debt or other crimes they fled david at hackelah was still their head the offspring of this miscellaneous crowd had not their new plantations long enjoyed but they grew englishmen and raised their votes at foreign shoals for interloping scots the k j i royal branch from pictland did succeed with troops of scots and scabs from northbytweed the seven first years of his pacifick reign made him and half his nation englishmen scots from the northern frozen banks of tay with packs and plods came whigging all away thick as the locusts which in egypt swarmed with pride and hungry hopes completely armed with native truth diseases and no money plundered our canaan of the milk and honey here they grew quickly lords and gentlemen and all their race are truebornenglishmen the civil wars the common purgative which always use to make the nation thrive made way for all that strolling congregation which thronged in pious ch  ss restoration k c ii the royal refugee our breed restores with foreign courtiers and with foreign whores and carefully repeopled us again throughout his lazy long lascivious reign with such a blessed and trueborn english fry

some for bread two hundred thousand pair of wooden shoes who god be thanked had nothing left to lose to heavens great praise did for religion fly to make us starve our poor in charity in every port they plant their fruitful train to get a race of trueborn englishmen whose children will when riper years they see be as illnatured and as proud as we call themselves english foreigners despise be surly like us all and just as wise thus from a mixture of all kinds began that hetrogeneous thing an englishman in eager rapes and furious lust begot betwixt a painted britain and a scot whose gendring offspring quickly learned to bow and yoke their heifers to the roman plow from whence a mongrel halfbred race there came with neither name nor nation speech nor fame in whose hot veins new mixtures quickly ran infused betwixt a saxon and a dane while their rank daughters to their parents just received all nations with promiscuous lust this nauseous brood directly did contain the well extracted brood of englishmen which medly cantoned in a heptarchy a rhapsody of nations to supply among themselves maintained eternal wars and still the ladies loved the conquerors the western angles all the rest subdued a bloody nation barbarous and rude who by the tenure of the sword possessed one part of britain and subdued the rest and as great things denominate the small the conquering part gave title to the whole the scot pict britain roman dane submit and with the englishsaxon all unite and these the mixtures have so close pursued the very name and memorys subdued no roman now no britain does remain wales strove to separate but strove in vain the silent nations undistinguished fall and englishmans the common name of all fate jumbld them together god knows how what ever they were they are trueborn english now the wonder which remains is at our pride to value that which all men else deride for englishmen to boast of generation cancels their knowledge and lampoons the nation a trueborn englishmans a contradiction in speech an irony in fact a fiction a banter made to be a test to fools which those that use it justly ridicules a metaphor invented to express a man akin to all the universe for as the scots as learned men have said throughout the world their wandering seed have spread so openhanded england it is believed has all the gleanings of the world received some think of england twas our savior meant the gospel should to all the world be sent since when the blessed sound did hither reach they to all nations might be said to preach it is well that virtue gives noblity how shall we else the want of birth and blood supply since scarce one family is left alive which does not from some foreigner derive of sixty thousand english gentlemen whose name and arms in registers remain we challenge all our heralds to declare ten families which englishsaxons are france justly owns the ancient noble line of bourbon mommorency and lorrain the germans too their house of austria show and holland their invincible nassau lines which in heraldry were ancient grown before the name of englishman was known even scotland too her elder glory shows her gourdons hamiltons and her monroes douglas mackays and grahams names well known long before ancient england knew her own but england modern to the last degree borrows or makes her own nobility and yet she boldly boasts of pedigree repines that foreigners are put upon her and talks of her antiquity and honor her s  lls s  ls c  ls de  m  rs m  ns and m  ues d  s and v  rs not one have english names yet all are english peers your h  ns p  llons and l  liers pass now for trueborn english knights and squires and make good senatemembers or lordmayors wealth howsoever got in england makes lords of

their own great families of yesterday we show and lords whose parents were the lord knows who the trueborn englishman part ii the breeds described now satyr if you can their temper show for manner make the man fierce as the britain as the roman brave and less inclined to conquer than to save eager to fight and lavish of their blood and equally of fear and forecast void the pict has made em sour the dane morose false from the scot and from the norman worse what honesty they have the saxons gave them and that now they grow old begins to leave them the climate makes them terrible and bold and english beef their courage does uphold no danger can their daring spirit pall always provided that their bellys full in close intrigues their facultys but weak for genrally whatever they know they speak and often their own councils undermine by their infirmity and not design from whence the learned say it does proceed that english treasons never can succeed for they are so openhearted you may know their own most secret thoughts and others too the laboring poor in spite of double pay are saucy mutinous and beggarly so lavish of their money and their time that want of forecast is the nations crime good drunken company is their delight and what they get by day they spend by night dull thinking seldom does their heads engage but drink their youth away and hurry on old age empty of all good husbandry and sense and void of manners most when void of pence their strong aversion to behaviours such they always talk too little or too much so dull they never take the pains to think and seldom are goodnatured but in drink in english ale their dear enjoyment lies for which they will starve themselves and families an englishman will fairly drink as much as will maintain two families of dutch subjecting all their labor to their pots the greatest artists are the greatest sots the country poor do by example live the gentry lead them and the clergy drive what may we not from such examples hope the landlord is their god the priest their pope a drunken clergy and a swearing bench has given the reformation such a drench as wise men think there is some cause to doubt will purge good manners and religion out nor do the poor alone their liquor prize the sages join in this great sacrifice the learned men who study aristotle correct him with an explanation bottle praise epicurus rather than lysander and the drunkards name for canary aristippus more than alexander the doctors too their galen here resign and genrally prescribe specific wine the graduates studys grown an easier task while for the vrinal they toss the flask the surgeons art grows plainer every hour and wines the balm which into wounds they pour poets long since parnassus have forsaken and say the ancient bards were all mistaken apollos lately abdicate and fled and good king bacchus governs in his stead he does the chaos of the head refine and atomthoughts jump into words by wine the inspirations of a finer nature as wine must needs excel parnassus water statesmen their weighty politics refine and soldiers raise their courages by wine caecilia gives her choristers their choice and lets them all drink wine to clear their voice some think the clergy first found out the way and wines the only spirit by which they pray but others less profane than so agree it clears the lungs and helps the memory and therefore all of them divinely think instead of study it is as well to drink and here i would be very glad to know whether our asgilites may drink or no the enlightening fumes of wine would certainly assist them much when they begin to fly or if a fiery chariot should appear inflamed by wine they would have the less to fear even the gods themselves as mortals say were they on earth would be as drunk as they nectar would be no more celestial drink they would all take wine to teach them how to think but english drunkards gods and men out do drink their estates away and money too colons in debt and if his friends should fail to help him out must die at last in goal his wealthy uncle sent a hundred nobles to pay his trifles off and rid him of his troubles but colon like a trueborn englishman drank all the money out in bright champaign and colon does in custody remain drunkness has been the darling of this realm ever since a drunken pilot had the helm in their religion they are so uneven that each man goes his own byway to heaven tenacious of mistakes to that degree that every man pursues it seprately and fancies none can find the way but he so shy of one another they are grown as if they strove to get to heaven alone rigid and zealous positive and grave and every grace but charity they have this makes them so illnatured and uncivil that all men think an englishman the devil surly to strangers froward to their friend submit to love with a reluctant mind resolved to be ungrateful and unkind if by necessity reduced to ask the giver has the difficultest task for what is bestowed they awkwardly receive and always take less freely than they give the obligation is their highest grief and never love where they accept relief so sullen in their sorrow that it is known they will rather die than their afflictions own and if relieved it is too often true that they will abuse their benefactors too for in distress their haughty stomachs such they hate to see themselves obliged too much seldom contented often in the wrong hard to be pleased at all and never long if your mistakes their illopinion gain no merit can their favor reobtain and if they are not vindictive in their fury it is their unconstant temper does secureye their brains so cool their passion seldom burns for all is condensed before the flame returns the fermentations of so weak a matter the humid damps the fume and runs it all to water so though the inclination may be strong they are pleased by fits and never angry long then if good nature shows some slender proof they never think they have reward enough but like our modern quakers of the town expect your manners and return you none friendship the abstracted union of the mind which all men seek but very few can find of all the nations in the universe none talk on it more or understand it less for if it does their property annoy their property their friendship will destroy as you discourse them you shall hear them tell all things in which they think they do excel no panegyric needs their praise record an englishman never wants his own good word his long discourses genrally appear prologud with his own wondrous character but first to illustrate his own good name he never fails his neighbor to defame and yet he really designs no wrong his malice goes no further than his tongue but pleased to tattle he delights to rail to satisfy the letchry of a tale his own dear praises close the ample speech tells you how wise he is that is how rich for wealth is wisdom he that is rich is wise and all men learned poverty despise his generosity comes next and then concludes that he is a truebornenglishman and they it is known are generous and free forgetting and forgiving injury which may be true thus rightly understood forgiving ill turns and forgetting good cheerful in labor when they have undertook it but out of humor when they are out of pocket but if their belly and their pockets full they may be phlegmatic but never dull and if a bottle does their brains refine it makes their wits as sparkling as their wine as for the general vices which we find they are guilty of in common with mankind satyr forbear and silently endure we must conceal the crimes we cannot cure nor shall my verse the brighter sex defame for english beauty will preserve her name beyond dispute agreeable and fair and modester than other nations are for where the vice prevails the great temptation is want of money more than inclination in general this only is allowed they are something noisy and a little proud an englishman is gentlest in command obedience is a stranger in the land hardly subjected to the magistrate for englishmen do all subjection hate humblest when rich but peevish when they are poor and think whateer they have they merit more the meanest english plowman studies law and keeps thereby the magistrates in awe will boldly tell them what they have to do and sometimes punish their omissions too their liberty and properties so dear they scorn their laws or governors to fear so bugbeard with the name of slavery they cannot submit to their own liberty restraint from ill is freedom to the wise but englishmen do all restraint despise slaves to their liquor drudges to the pots the mob are statesmen and their statesmen sots their governors they count such dangerous things that it is their custom to affront their kings so jealous of the power their kings possessed they suffer neither power nor king to rest the bad with force they easily subdue the good with constant clamours they pursue and did king jesus reign they would murmur too a discontented nation and by far harder to rule in times of peace than war easily set together by the ears and full of causeless jealousies and fears apt to revolt and willing to rebel and never are contented when they are well no government could ever please them long could tie their hands or rectify their tongue in this to ancient israel well compared eternal murmurs are among them heard it was but lately that they were oppressed their rights invaded and their laws suppressed when nicely tender of their liberty lord what a noise they made of slavery in daily tumult showed their discontent lampoond the king and mocked his government and if in arms they did not first appear twas want of force and not for want of fear in humbler tone than english used to do at foreign hands for foreign aid they sue william the great successor of nassau their prayers heard and their oppressions saw he saw and saved them god and him they praised to this their thanks to that their trophies raised but glutted with their own felicities they soon their new deliverer despise say all their prayersback their joy disown unsing their thanks and pull their trophies down their harps of praise are on the willows hung for englishmen are never contented long the reverend clergy too and who would have thought that they who had such nonresistance taught should ever to arms against their prince be brought who up to heaven did regal power advance subjecting english laws to modes of france twisting religion so with loyalty as one could never live and the other die and yet no sooner did their prince design their glebes and perquisites to undermine but all their passive doctrines laid aside the clergy their own principles denied unpreachd their nonresisting cant and prayed to heaven for help and to the dutch for aid the church chimd all her doctrines back again and pulpit champions did the cause maintain flew in the face of all their former zeal and nonresistance did at once repeal the rabbis say it would be too prolix to tie religion up to politics the churches safety is suprema lex and so by a new figure of their own their former doctrines all at once disown as laws post facto in the parliament in urgent cases have obtained assent but are as dangerous presidents laid by made lawful only by necessity the reverend fathers then in arms appear and men of god become the men of war the nation fired by them to arms apply assault their antichristian monarchy to their due channel all our laws restore and made things what they should have been before but when they came to fill the vacant throne and the pale priests looked back on what they would done how english liberty began to thrive and church of england loyalty outlive how all their persecuting days were done and their delivrer placed upon the throne the priests as priests are wont to do turned tail they are englishmen and nature will prevail now they deplore the ruins they have made and murmur for the master they betrayed excuse those crimes they could not make him mend and suffer for the cause they cannot defend pretend they would not have carried things so high and protomartyrs make for popery had the prince done as they designed the thing have set the clergy up to rule the king taken a donative for coming hither and so have left their king and them together we had say they been now a happy nation no doubt we had seen a blessed reformation for wise men say it is as dangerous a thing a ruling priesthood as a priestrid king and of all plagues with which mankind are cursed ecclesiastic tyrannys the worst if all our former grievances were feigned king james has been abused and we trapannd bugbeard with popery and power despotick tyrannick government and leagues exotic the revolutions a phanatick plot w  a tyrant s  a sot a factious army and a poisoned nation unjustly forced king jamess abdication but if he did the subjects rights invade then he was punished only not betrayed and punishing of kings is no such crime but englishmen have done it many a time when kings the sword of justice first lay down they are no kings though they posses the crown titles are shadows crowns are empty things the good of subjects is the end of kings to guide in war and to protect in peace where tyrants once commence the kings do cease for arbitrary powers so strange a thing it makes the tyrant and unmakes the king if kings by foreign priests and armies regin and lawless power against their oaths maintain then subjects must have reason to complain if oaths must bind us when our kings do ill to call in foreign aid is to rebel by force to circumscribe our lawful prince is willful treason in the largest sense and they who once rebel most certainly their god and king and former oaths defy if we allow no maladministration could cancel the allegiance of the nation let all our learned sons of levi try this ecclesastick riddle to unty how they could make a step to call the prince and yet pretend to oaths and innocence by the first address they made beyond the seas they are perjured in the most intense degrees and without scruple for the time to come may swear to all the kings in christendom and truly did our kings consider all they would never let the clergy swear at all their politic allegiance they would refuse for whores and priests do never want excuse but if the mutual contract was dissolved the doubts explained the difficultys solvd that kings when they descend to tyranny dissolve the bond and leave the subject free the governments ungirt when justice dies and constitutions are nonentities the nations all a mob there is no such thing as lords or commons parliament or king a great promiscuous crowd the hydra lies till laws revive and mutual contract ties a chaos free to choose for their own share what case of government they please to wear if to a king they do the reins commit all men are bound in conscience to submit but then that king must by his oath assent to postulatas of the government which if he breaks he cuts off the entail and power retreats to its original this doctrine has the sanction of assent from natures universal parliament the voice of nature and the course of things allow that laws superior are to kings none but delinquents would have justice cease knaves rail at laws as soldiers rail at peace for justice is the end of government as reason is the test of argument no man was ever yet so void of sense as to debate the right of selfdefence a principle so grafted in the mind with nature born and does like nature bind twisted with reason and with nature too as neither one or the other can undo nor can this right be less when national reason which governs one should govern all whatever the dialects of courts may tell he that his right demands can never rebel which right if it is by governors denied may be procured by force or foreign aid for tyrannys a nations term of grief as folks cry fire to hasten in relief and when the hated word is heard about all men should come to help the people out thus england groaned britannias voice was heard and great nassau to rescue her appeared called by the universal voice of fate god and the peoples legal magistrate ye heavens regard almighty jove look down and view thy injured monarch on the throne on their ungrateful heads due vengeance take who sought his aid and then his part forsake witness ye powers it was our call alone which now our pride makes us ashamed to own britannias troubles fetched him from afar to court the dreadful casualties of war but where requital never can be made acknowledgements a tribute seldom paid he dwelt in bright marias circling arms defended by the magic of her charms from foreign fears and from domestic harms ambition found no fuel to her fire he had what god could give or man desire till pity rowzd him from his soft repose his life to unseen hazards to expose till pity moved him in our cause to appear pity that word which now we hate to hear but english gratitude is always such to hate the hand which does oblige to much britannias cries gave birth to his intent and hardly gained his unforeseen assent his boding thoughts foretold him he should find the people fickle selfish and unkind which thought did to his royal heart appear more dreadful than the dangers of the war for nothing grates a generous mind so soon as base returns for hearty service done satyr be silent awsully prepare britannias song and williams praise to hear stand by and let her cheerfully rehearse her grateful vows in her immortal verse loud fames eternal trumpet let her sound listen ye distant poles and endiess round may the strong blast the welcome news convey as for as sound can reach or spirit can fly to neighboring worlds if such there be relate our heroes fame for theirs to imitate to distant worlds of spirits let her rehearse for spirits without the help of voice converse may angels hear the gladsome news on high mixed with their everlasting symphony and hell it self stand in suspense to know whether it be the fatal blast or no britannia the fame of virtue it is for which i sound and heroes with immortal triumphs crowned fame built on solid virtue swifter flies than morninglight can spread my eastern skies the gathering air returns the doubling sound and loud repeating thunders force it round eccboes return from caverns of the deep old chaos dreamed on it in eternal sleep time hands it forward to its latest vrn from whence it never never shall return nothing is heard so far or lasts so long it is heard by every ear and spoke by every tongue my hero with the sails of honor furled rises like the great genius of the world by fate and fame wisely prepared to be the soul of war and life of victory he spreads the wings of virtue on the throne and every wind of glory fans them on immortal trophies dwell upon his brow fresh as the garlands he has won but now by different steps the high ascent he gains and differently that high ascent maintains princes for pride and lust of rule make war and struggle for the name of conqueror some fight for fame and some for victory he fights to save and conquers to set free then seek phrase his titles to conceal and hide with words what actions must reveal no parallel from hebrew stories take of godlike kings my similies to make no borrowed names conceal my living theme but names and things directly i proclaim it is honest merit does his glory raise whom that exalts let no man fear to praise of such a subject no man need be shy virtues above the reach of flattery he needs no character but his own fame nor any flattering titles but his name willam s the name that is spoke by every tongue william s the darling subject of my song listen ye virgins to the charming sound and in eternal dances hand it round your early offerings to this altar bring make him at once a lover and a king may he submit to none but to your arms nor never be subdued but by your charms may your soft thoughts for him be all sublime and every tender vow he made for him may he be first in every morningthought and heaven never hear a prayer when he is left out may every omen every boding dream be fortunate by mentioning his name may this one charm infernal power affright and guard you from the terrors of the night may every cheerful glass as it goes down to williams health be cordials to your own let every song be chorust with his name and music pay a tribute to his fame let every poet tune his artful verse and in immortal strains his deeds rehearse and may apollo never more inspire the disobedient bard with his seraphick fire may all my sons their grateful homage pay his praises sing and for his safety pray satyr return to our unthankful isle secured by heavens regard and williamss toil to both ungrateful and to both untrue rebels to god and to good nature too if ever this nation be distressed again to whomsoeer they cry they will cry in vain to heaven they cannot have the face to look or if they should it would but heaven provoke to hope for help from man would be too much mankind would always tell them of the dutch how they came here our freedoms to obtain were paid and cursed and hurried home again how by their aid we first dissolved our fears and then our helpers damned for foreigners it is not our english temper to do better for englishmen think every man their debtor it is worth observing that we never complained of foreigners nor of the wealth they gained till all their services were at an end wise men affirm it is the english way never to grumble till they come to pay and then they always think their tempers such the work too little and the pay too much as frighted patients when they want a cure bid any price and any pain endure but when the doctors remedies appear the cures too easy and the price too dear great portland never was banterd when he strove for us his masters kindest thoughts to move we never lampoond his conduct when employed king jamess secret councils to divide then we caressed him as the only man which could the doubtful oracle explain the only hushai able to repel the dark designs of our achitopel compared his masters courage to his sense the ablest statesman and the bravest prince on his wise conduct we depended much and liked him never the worse for being dutch nor was he valued more than he deserved freely he ventured faithfully he served in all king williams dangers he has shared in englands quarrels always he appeared the revolution first and then the boyne in both his counsels and his conduct shine his martial valor flanders will confess and france regrets his managing the peace faithful to englands interest and her king the greatest reason of our murmuring ten years in english service he appeared and gained his masters and the worlds regard but it is not englands custom to reward the wars are over england needs him not now he is a dutchman and the lord knows what schombergh the ablest soldier of his age with great nassau did in our cause engage both joined for englands rescue and defense the greatest captain and the greatest prince with what applause his stories did we tell stories which europes volumes largely swell we counted him an army in our aid where he commanded no man was afraid his actions with a constant conquest shine from villavitiosa to the rhine france flanders germany his fame confess and all the world was fond of him but us our turn first served we grudged him the command witness the grateful temper of the land we blame the k  that he relies too much on strangers germans hugonots and dutch and seldom does his great affairs of state to english counselors communicate the fact might very well be answered thus he has so often been betrayed by us he must have been a madman to rely on english g  ns fidelity for laying other arguments aside this thought might mortify our english pride that foreigners have faithfully obeyed him and none but englishmen have ever betrayed him they have our ships and merchants bought and sold and bartered english blood for foreign gold first to the french they sold our turkyfleer and injured talmarsh next at camaret the king himself is sheltered from their snares not by his merit but the crown he wears experience tells us it is the english way their benefactors always to betray and least examples should be too remote a modern magistrate of famous note shall give you his own character by rote i will make it out deny it he that can his worship is a trueborn englishman in all the latitude of that empty word by modern acceptations understood the parishbooks his great descent record and now he hopes ere long to be a lord and truly as things go it would be pity but such as he should represent the city while robbry for burntoffering he brings and gives to god what he has stole from kings great monuments of charity he raises and good st magnus whistles out his praises to citygoals he grants a jubilee and hires huzzas from his own mobilee lately he wore the golden chain and gown with which equipt he thus harangud the town his fine speech etc  with clouted iron shoes and sheepskin breeches more rags than manners and more dirt than riches from driving cows and calves to laytonmarket while of my greatness there appeared no spark yer behold i come to let you see the pride with which exalted beggars always ride born to the needful labors of the plow the cartwhip graced me as the chain does now nature and fate in doubt what course to take whether i should a lord or floughboy make kindly at last resolved they would promote me and first a knave and then a knight they vote me what fate appointed nature did prepare and furnished me with an exceeding care to fit me for what they designed to have me and every gift but honesty they gave me and thus equipped to this proud town i came in quest of bread and not in quest of fame blind to my future fate a humble boy free from the guilt and glory i enjoy the hopes which my ambition entertained were in the name of footboy all contained the greatest heights from small beginnings rise the gods were great on earth before they reached the skies b  well the generous temper of whose mind was ever to be bountiful inclined whether by his ill fate or fancy led first took me up and furnished me with bread the little services he put me to seemed labors rather than were truly so but always my advancement he designed for twas his very nature to be kind large was his soul his temper ever free the best of masters and of men to me and i who was before decreed by fate to be made infamous as well as great with an obsequious diligence obeyed him till trusted with his all and then betrayed him all his past kindnesses i trampled on ruined his fortunes to erect my own so vipers in the bosom bred begin to hiss at that hand first which took them in with eager treachry i his fall pursued and my first trophies were ingratitude ingratitude the worst of humane guilt the basest action mankind can commit which like the sin against the holy ghost has least of honor and of guilt the most distinguished from all other crimes by this that it is a crime which no man will confess that sin alone which should not be forgiven on earth although perhaps it may in heaven thus my first benefactor i orethrew and how should i be to a second true the public trusts came next into my care and i to use them scurvily prepare my needy sovereign lord i played upon and lent him many a thousand of his own for which great interests i took care to charge and so my illgot wealth became so large my predecessor judas was a fool fitter to have been whipped and sent to school than sell a savior had i been at hand his master had not been so cheap trapannd i would have made the eager jews have found for thirty pieces thirty thousand pound my cousin ziba of immortal fame ziba and i shall never want a name firstborn of treason nobly did advance his masters fall for his inheritance by whose keen arts old david first began to break his sacred oath with jonathan the good old king it is thought was very loath to break his word and therefore broke his oath zibas a traitor of some quality yet ziba might have been informed by me had i been there he never had been content with half the estate nor half the government in our late revolution twas thought strange that i of all mankind should like the change but they who wondered at it never knew that in it i did my old game pursue nor had they heard of twenty thousand pound which never yet was lost nor never was found thus all things in their turn to sale i bring god and my master first and then the king till by successful villainies made bold i thought to turn the nation into gold and so to forg  y my hand i bent not doubting i could gull the government but there was ruffld by the parliament and if i escaped the unhappy tree to climb twas want of law and not for want of crime but my the devil old friend who printed in my face a needful competence of english brass having more business yet for me to do and loath to lose his trusty servant so managed the matter with such art and skill as saved his hero and threw down the b  ll and now i am graced with unexpected honors for which i will certainly abuse the donors knighted and made a tribune of the people whose laws and properties i am like to keep well the custos rotulorum of the city and captain of the guards of their banditie surrounded by my catchpoles i declare against the needy debtor open war i hang poor thieves for stealing of your pelf and suffer none to rob you but my self the king commanded me to help reform ye and how i will do it miss shall inform ye i keep the best seraglio in the nation and hope in time to bring it into fashion no brimstone whore need fear the lash for me that part i will leave to brother jeffery our gallants need not go abroad to rome i will keep a whoring jubilee at home whorings the darling of my inclination ant i a magistrate for reformation for this my praise is sung by every bard for which bridewell would be a just reward in print my panegyricks fill the streets and hired goalbirds their huzzas repeat some charities contrived to make a show have taught the needy rabble to do so whose empty noise is a mechanic fame since for sir beelzebub they would do the the same the conclusion then let us boast of ancestors no more or deeds of heroes done in days of yore in latent records of the ages past behind the rear of time in long oblivion placed for if our virtues must in lines descend the merit with the families would end and intermixtures would most fatal grow for vice would be hereditary too the tainted blood would of necessity in voluntary wickedness convey vice like ill nature for an age or two may seem a generation to pursue but virtue seldom does regard the breed fools do the wise and wise men fools succeed what is it to us what ancestors we had if good what better or what worse if bad examples are for imitation set yet all men follow virtue with regret could but our ancestors retrieve the fate and see their offspring thus degenerate how we contend for birth and names unknown and build on their past actions not our own they would cancel records and their tombs deface and openly disown the vile degenerate race for fame of families is all a cheat it is personal virtue only makes us great the mock mourners a satyr by way of elegy on king william to the queen madam your majesty has so often declared your just concern for the nations loss and your value for the memory of the late king you have so publicly approved his conduct so visibly moved in the same steps and pursued the wise measures of this your glorious ancestor that it cannot be thought displeasing to your majesty to reprehend those who make a mock at the sorrow of your majesty and three nations  your majesty was the first who told us he could not be sufficiently lamented may those who are not of the same mind find no favor with your majesty nor there maker till they repent that sin against his merit and the voice of their native country  here are no reflections upon your majestys household or council or courts of justice or either house of parliament and consequently no offense against your royal proclamation twoud be an affront to your majesty to imagine there were any under all those heads of your government could deserve the reproof of the following satyr  your majesty has an entire possession of the hearts of your people but their affection is still the deeper rooted by that generous sorrow you have expressed for the loss of him to whom they owe the full possession of their liberty under your government  how they can be faithful subjects to your majesty that were not true friends to such a king is a mystery out of bumane understanding since the happiness we enjoy by your government proceeds from his defending us against those who would not have had your majesty to reign over us  twoud be a crime against your majesty which deserved no pardon to suggest you should be offended at that part of the satyr which points at our immoralities your majestys example as well as command has encouraged us all to declare war against vice and there we are sure of your royal protection  for the rest if an extraordinary concern for the glorious memory of the late king has led the author into any excesses he begs your majesty would place it to the account of that just passion every honest man retains for his extraordinary merit believing that no man can have an indifferency for the memory of king william and at the same time have any desire for the welfare of his native country  while your majesty pursues the true interest of england the protestant religion and the welfare of europe as he did you will have the same enemies that he had the same to oppose you abroad and reproach you at home but you will thereby engage all your honest subjects to adhere the firmer to their duty all your protestant neighbors to depend upon your protection and god shall crown your majesty and these nations with his special favor and benediction  amen a satyr etc such has been this illnatured nations fate always to see their friends and foes too late by native pride and want of temper led never to value merit till it is dead and then immortal monuments they raise and damn their former follies by their praise with just reproaches rail at their own vice and mourn for those they did before despise so they who moses government defied sincerely sorrowd for him when he died and so when britains genius fainting lay summoned by death which monarchs must obey trembling and soulless half the nation stood upbraided by their own ingratitude they who with true born honesty before grudged him the trophies he so justly wore were with his fate more than himself dismayed not for their king but for themselves afraid he had their rights and liberties restored in battle purchased and by peace secured and they with english gratitude began to feel the favor and despise the man but when they saw that his protection ceased and death had their deliverer possessed how thunderstruck they stood what cries they raised they looked like men distracted and amazed their terror did their conscious guilt explain and wished their injured prince alive again they dreamed of halters gibbets and of goals french armies popery and prince of wales descents invasions uproars in the state mobs irish massacrees and god knows what imaginary enemies appeared and all they knew they merited they feared it is strange that pride and envy should prevail to make mens sense as well as virtue fail that where they must depend they should abuse and slight the man they were afraid to lose but william had not governed fourteen year to be an unconcerned spectator here his works like providence were all complete and made a harmony we wondered at the legislative power he set free and led them step by step to liberty twas not his fault if they could not agree impartial justice he protected so the laws did in their native channels flow from whence our sure establishment begun and william laid the first foundation stone on which the stately fabric soon appeared how could they sink when such a pilot steered he taught them due defenses to prepare and make their future peace their present care by him directed wisely they decreed what lines should be expelled and what succeed that now he is dead there is nothing to be done but to take up the scepter he laid down the circle of this order is so round so regular as nothing can confound in truth and justice all the lines commence and reason is the vast circumference williams the moving center of the whole t had else a body been without a soul fenced with just laws impregnable it stands and will for ever last in honest hands for truth and justice are the immortal springs give life to constitutions and to kings in either case if one of them decay these can no more command than those obey right is the only fountain of command the rock on which authority must stand and if executive power steps awry on either hand it splits on tyranny oppression is a plague on mankind sent infects the vitals of a government convulsions follow and such vapors rise the constitution suffocates and dies law is the grand specific to restore and unobstructed never fails to cure all other rules compared unto that are tampering and quacking with the state the conscitutions like a vast machine that is full of curious workmanship within where though the parts unweildy may appear it will be put in motion with a hair the wheels are officers and magistrates by which the whole contrivance operates laws are the weights and springs which make it move wound up by kings as managers above which if they are screwed too high or down too low the movement goes too fast or else too slow then legislators are the engineers who when it is out of order make repairs the people are the owners twas for them the first inventor drew the ancient scheme it is for their benefit it works and they the charges of maintaining it defray and if their governors unfaithful prove they engineers or managers remove unkind contention sometimes their appears between the managers and engineers such strife is always to the owners wrong and once it made the work stand still too long till william came and loosed the fatal chain and set the engineers to work again and having made the wondrous thing complete to annes unerring hand he left the helm of state anne like elisha when just william went received the mantle of this government and by divine concession does inherit a double portion of his ruling spirit the dying hero loaded with renown gave her the nations blessing with a crown from god the people and the laws her own told her that he had orders from on high to lay aside the government and die what he had fought for gave her up in peace and cheered her royal heart with prospect of success while he who death in all its shapes had seen with full composure quiet and serene passive and undisorderd at his fate quitted the english throne without regret no conscious guilt disturbed his royal breast calm as the regions of eternal rest before his life went out his heaven came in for all was bright without and clear within the blessed rewards did to his sight appear the passage easy and the prospect near his parting eye the gladsome regions spied just so before his dear maria died his high concern for england he expressed england the darling of his royal breast the transports of his parting soul he spent her disunited parties to lament his wishes then supplied his want of power and prayed for them for whom he fought before speak envy if thou can inform us what could this unthankful nation murmur at but discontent was always our disease for englishmen what government can please we always had our sons of belial here who knew no god nor government to fear no wonder these disliked his gentle sway unwilling homage to his scepter pay and only did for want of power obey some soft excuse for them we might contrive had he not been the gentlest prince alive had he not born with an exalted mind all that was disobling and unkind peaceful and tender thoughts his mind possessed and high superior love concealed the rest our discontents would often his pity move but all his anger was suppressed by love that heavenborn passion had subdued his soul possessed the greatest part and ruled the whole this made him strive his people to possess which he had done had he obliged em less he knew that titles are but empty things and hearts of subjects are the strength of kings justice and kindness were his constant care he scorned to govern mankind by their fear their universal love he strove to gain twas hard that we should make him strive in vain that he should here our english humors find and we that he had saved should be unkind by all endearing stratagems he strove to draw us by the secret springs of love and when he could not cure our discontent it always was below him to resent nature was never seen in such excess all fury when abroad at home all peace in war all fire and blood in peace inclined to all that is sweet and gentle soft and kind ingratitude for this must needs commence in want of honesty or want of sense when kings to luxury and ease resigned their native countries just defense declined this high pretending nation used to plead what they would perform had they a king to lead what wondrous actions had by them been done when they had martial monarchs to lead on and if their prince would but with france make war what troops of english heroes would appear william the bottom of their courage found false like themselves mere emptiness and sound for called by fate to fight for christendom they sent their king abroad and stayed at home wisely declined the hazards of the war to nourish faction and disorders here wrapped in luxurious plenty they debauch and load their active monarch with reproach they stay at home and teach him to command and judge those actions which they dare not mend backward in deeds but of their censures free and blame that conduct they are afraid to see against the hand that saves them they exclaim and curse the strangers though they fight for them though some who would excuse the matter say they did not grudge their service but their pay where are the royal bands that now advance to spread his dreadful banners into france britannias noble sons her interest fly and foreign heroes must their place supply much for the fame of our nobility posterity will be ashamed to hear great britains monarch did in arms appear and scarce an english nobleman was there our ancestors had never conquered france for kingdoms seldom are subdued by chance hd talbott vere and montacutte with held the glory for the danger of the field had english honesty been kept alive the ancient english glory would survive but gallantry and courage will decline where pride and all confederate vices join had we kept up the fame of former years landen had been as famous as poictiers ormond and essex had not fought alone the only english lords our verse can own the only peers of whom the world can say that they for honor fought and not for pay a regimented few we had indeed who served for neither pride nor fame but bread some bully l  s protection p  s and some went out because they durst not stay at home loaded with noxious vices they appear a scandal to the nation and the war heroes in midnight scuffles with the watch and lewd enough an army to debauch flesht with cold murders and from justice fled pursued by blood in drink and darkness shed in vain they strive with bravery to appear for where there is guilt there always will be fear these are the pillars of the english fame such peers as history must blush to name when future records to the world relate marsaglias field and gallant schombergs fate w  was captive made it was severe fate took the honest man and left the peer the world owes fame for ages long before to the great style of w  which he bore but when we come the branches to compare it is a hero ancestor a bully heir the virtues the posterity forsake and all their gallant blood is dwindld to a rake more might be said but satyr stay thy rhimes and mix not his misfortunes with his crimes we need not rake the ashes of the dead there is living characters enough to read how could this nation ever think of peace or how look up to heaven for success while lawless vice in fleets and camps appeared and oaths were louder than their cannon heard no wonder english israel has been said before the french philistines fleet to have fled while t  embraced with whores appeared and vice it self the royal navy steered william opposed their crimes with steady hand by his example first and then command prompted the laws their vices to suppress for which no doubt the guilty loved him less ye sons of envy railers at the times be bold like englishmen and own your crimes for shame put on no black but let us see your habits always and your tongues agree envy never blushes let it not be said you hate him living and you mourn him dead no sorrow show where you no love protess there are no hypocrites in wickedness great bonfires make and tell the world you are glad y have lost the greatest blessing ever you had so madmen sing in nakedness and chains for when the sense is gone the song remains so thankless israel when they were set free reproached the author of their liberty and wished themselves in egypt back again what pity twas they wished or wished in vain stop satyr let britannia now relate her williams character and her own fate let her to him a grateful trophy raise she best can sigh his loss that sung his praise britania  of all my sons by tyranny bereft a widow desolate and childless left by violence and injury oppressed to heaven i cast my eyes and sighed the rest i need but sigh for i was always heard and william on my welcome shores appeared with wings of speed to rescue me he came and all my sorrows vanished into flame new joys sprung up new triumphs now abound and all my virgin daughters hear the sound eternal dances move upon my plains and youthful blood springs in my ancient veins with open arms i yielded my embrace and william saw the beauties of my face he had before the knowledge of my charms for he had my maria in his arms while he remained i gave eternal spring made him my son my darling and my king while all the wondering world my choice approve congratulate his fate and justify my love of british blood in belgian plains he lived my only foreign offspring that survived batavian climates nourished him a while too great a genius for so damp a soil and freely then surrendered him to me for wise men freely will the fates obey yet in my william they had equal share and he defended them with equal care they were the early trophies of his sword his infant hand their liberty restored his nurse the belgic lion roared for aid and planted early laurels on his head his easy victories amazed mankind we wondered what the dreadful youth designed fearless he fought his country to set free and with his sword cut out their liberty the journals of his actions always seemed so wonderful as if the world had dreamed so swift so full of terror he went on he was a conqueror before a man the bourbon sword though it was brighter far yet drawn for conquest and oppressive war had all the triumphs of the world engrost but quickly all those triumphs to him lost justice to william early trophies brought william for truth and justice always fought he was the very mystery of war he gained by it when he was not conqueror and if his enemies a battle won he might be beaten they would be undone antaeus like from every fall he rose strengthened with double vigor to oppose those actions mankind judged unfortunate served but as secret steps to make him great then let them boast their glory at landen in vain the embattelld squadrons crowded in theirs was the victory the conquest mine of all the heroes ages past adore back to the first great man and long before though virtue has sometimes with valor joined the barren world no parallel can find if back to israels tents i should retire and of the hebrew heroes there enquire i find no hand did judahs scepter wear come up to williams modern character namures gygantick powers he oerthrew david did less when he goliath slew here is no vriahs for adultry slain no oaths forgot to faithful jonathan and if to jesses grandson we have recourse william his wisdom had without his whores joshua might still have staid on jordans shore must he as william did the boyne pass over almighty power was forced to interpose and frighted both the water and his foes but had my william been to pass that stream god needed not to part the waves for him not forty thousand canaanites could stand in spite of waves or canaanites he would land such streams never stemmed his tide of victory no not the stream no nor the enemy his bombs and cannon would have made the wall without the help of jewish ramshorns fall when his dear israel from their foes had fled because of stolln spoils by achan hid he never like joshua on the ground have laid he would certainly have fought as well as prayed the sun would rather have been thought to stay amazed to see how soon he had won the day than to give time the canaanites to slay the greatest captains of the ages past debauched their fame with cruelty at last william did only tyrants subdue these conquered kings and then the people too the subjects reaped no profit for their pains and only changed their masters not their chains their victories did for themselves appear and made their peace as dreadful as the war but william fought oppression to destroy that mankind might in peace the world enjoy the pompeys caesars scipios alexanders who crowd the world with fame were great commanders these too brought blood and ruin with their arms but william always fought on other terms terror indeed might in his front appear but peace and plenty followed in the rear and if oppression forced him to contend calmness was all his temper peace his end he was the only man which heaven saw fit to regulate the world or conquer it who can his skill in government gainsay he that could englands brittle scepter sway where parties too much rule and kings obey he always reigned by gentleness and love an emblem of the government above vote me not childless then in christendom i yet have sons in my suspended womb and till just fate such due provision makes a daughter my protection undertakes crowns know no sexes and my government to either kind admits a just descent queens have to me been always fortunate ever since my english phaenix ruled the state who made my people rich my country great satyr be just and when we lash their crimes mingle some tears for william with our rhimes though baseness and ingratitude appear thank heaven that we have weeping millons here then speak our hearty sorrows if you can superior grief in feeling words explain accents that wound and all the senses numb and while they speak may strike the hearer dumb such grief as never was for king before and such as never never shall be more see how authority comes weeping on and view the queen lamenting on his throne with just regret she takes the sword of state not by her choice directed but his fate accepts the sad necessity with tears and mournfully for government prepares the peoples acclamation she receives with saddend joy and a content that grieves view next the sad assemblies that appear to tell their grief for him and joy for her the first confounds the last with such excess they hardly can their noble thoughts express the illustrious troops address here to condole and speak such grief as wounds her to the soul they lodge their sorrows in the royal breast the harbor where the nation looks for rest next these the representatives arise with all the nations sorrow in their eyes the epithets they righteously apply to the restorer of their liberty are tokens of their sense and honesty for as a body we were always true but it is our parties that our peace undo who can like them the peoples grief express they show her all the tokens of excess overwhelmed with sorrow and suppressed with care they place the nations refuge now in her nothing but her succession could abate the nations sorrow for their monarchs fate and nothing but his fate could their true joy for her succession lessen or destroy the civil sword to her as heaven saw fit with general satisfaction they commit how can it in a hand like hers miscarry but who shall for us weild the military who shall the jarring generals unite first teach them to agree and then to fight who shall renewed alliances contrive and keep the vast confederacies alive who shall the growing gallick force subdue twas more than all the world but him could do sighs for departed friends are senseless things but it is not so when nations mourn for kings when wounded kingdoms such a loss complain as nature never can repair again the tyrant grief like love obeys no laws but blindly views the effect and not the cause dark are the works of sovereign providence and often clash with our contracted sense but if we might with heavens decrees debate and of our makers works expostulate why should he form a mind supreamly great and to his charge commit the reins of fate and at one hasty blow the world defeat a blow so sudden so severe and swift we had no time for supplication left as if almighty power had been afraid such prayers would by such multitudes be made such mosess would to his altars go to whom he never did or would say no he hardly could know how to strike the blow for prayer so much the sovereign power commands even god himself sometimes as conquered stands and calls for quarter at the wrestlers hands how strenuous then had been the sacred strife while all the kneeling world had begged his life with all that earnestness of zeal and more than ever nation begged for king before see how the neighboring lands his fame improve and by their sorrows testify their love sprinkle his memory with grateful tears and hand his glory to succeeding years with what contempt will english men appear when future ages read his character they will never bear to hear in time to come how he was loved abroad and scorned at home the world will scarce believe it could be true and vengeance must such insolence pursue our nation will by all men be abhorred and williams juster fame be so restored posterity when histories relate his glorious deeds will ask what giants that for common virtues may mens fame advance but an immoderate glory turns romance its real merit does it self undo men talk is up so high it cannot be true so williams life increased by doubling fame will drown his actions to preserve his name the annals of his conduct they will revise as legends of impossibilities twill all a life of miracles appear too great for him to do and them to hear and if some faithful writer should set down with what uneasiness he wore the crown what thankless devil had the land possessed this will be more prodigious than the rest with indignation twill their minds inspire and raise the glory of his actions higher they will be ashamed their ancestors to own and strive their fathers follies to atone new monuments of gratitude they will raise and crown his memory with thanks and praise thou satyr shall the grateful few rehearse and solve the nations credit in thy verse embalm his name with characters of praise his fames beyond the power of time to raze from him let future monarchs learn to rule and make his lasting character their school for he who would in time to come be great has nothing now to do but imitate let dying parents when they come to bless wish to their children only his success here their instructions very well may end williams examqle only recommend and leave the youth his history to attend but we have here an ignominious crowd that boast their native birth and english blood whose breasts with envy and contention burn and now rejoice when all the nations mourn their awkward triumphs openly they sing insult the ashes of their injured king rejoice at the disasters of his crown and drink the horses health that threw him down blush satyr when such crimes we must reveal and draw a silent curtain to conceal actions so vile shall never debauch our song let heaven alone though justice suffers long her leaden wings and iron hands may show that she is certain though she may be slow his foreign birth was made the famed pretense which gave our homeborn englishmen offense but discontents the ancient english fashion the universal blemish of the nation and it is a question whether god could make that king whom every englishman would like nor is it any paradox to say william had more of english blood than they the royal life flowed in his sprightly veins the same that in the noble stock remains the same which now his glorious scepter wields to whom three nations just obedience yields anne the remaining glory of our isle well she becomes the royal english style in williams steps sedately she proceeds william s a pattern to immortal deeds preserves his memory with generous care forgetting him is disobliging her where shall the murmuring party then appear where would the nation but for her have found so safe a cure for such a sudden wound and could she but as well the camp supply the world the sooner would their grief lay by but there the fatal breach is made so wide that loss can never never be  supplied ye men of arms and english sons of war now learn from him how you may fight for her your grief for him express upon her foes for william loved such funeral tears as those it is williams glorious scepter which she bears like william she for liberty appears she mounts to honor by the steps of truth and his example imitates in both it is you must make her blooming fame increase it is you must bring her honor wealth and peace and let it once more to the world be seen nothing can make us greater than a queen reformation of manners the preface no man is qualified to reprove other mens faults but he that has none of his own say some people who are loath to be told of their errors and it is on this account only that the world has the trouble of a preface  if that be true the author freely acknowledges he is the most unqualified man in the world to reprove  that no man is qualified to reprove other mens crimes who allows himself in the practice of the same is very readily granted and is the very substance and foundation of the following satyr and on that score the author has as good a title to animadversion as another since no man can charge him with the vices he has reproved  but instead of selfdefence he is rather willing to look back on the best actions of his life with the temper of a penitent and he wishes all men would do the like it is the only way to make the satyr impertinent for penitence would all his verse disarm the satyrs answered if the men reform   but the fact is not true neither it is a very pretty way for men to get rid of the impertinence of admonition if none but faultless men must reprove others the lord have mercy upon all our magistrates and all our clergy are undignified and suspended at a blow  nor does the satyr assault private infirmity or pursue personal vices but is bent at those who pretending to suppress vice or being vested with authority for that purpose yet make themselves the shame of their country encouraging wickedness by that very authority they have to suppress it  he professes himself sorry either that freedom of speech is so dangerous in this age or that he is too much a coward otherwise some had heard of their crimes who think themselves above the power of punishment  it is hard that vice should have so much shelter from civil power that reproof should lead the party to suppress the poet rather than the crime  and yet his friends give him over for lost an account of what he has ventured to say to whose importunity he thinks himself obliged to answer with juvenal difficile est satyram non scribere nam quis iniquae tam patiens urbis tam ferreus ut teneat se   if any man is injured by the characters he is content they should carry their resentment to what extremity they please but if truth may be on his side the only way to make him do them justice is to reform and he promises to give testimony to their repentance as an amand honorable in a manner as public as possible  a satyr etc how long may heaven be banterd by a nation with broken vows and shams of reformation and yet forbear to show its indignation tell me ye sages who the conscience guide and ecclesiastic oracles divide where do the bounds of sovereign patience end how long may people undestroyd offend what limits has almighty power prepared when mercy shall be deaf and justice heard if there is a being immortal and immense who does rewards and punishments dispense why is he passive when his powers defied and his eternal governments denied tell us why he that sits above the sky unreins no vengeance lets no thunders fly when villains prosper and successful vice shall humane power control and heavenly power despise if it is because the sins of such a nation are yet too small to conquer his compassion then tell us to what height mankind may sin before celestial fury must begin how their extended crimes may reach so high vengeance must follow and of course destroy and by the common chain of providence destruction come like cause and consequence then search the dark arcana of the skies an if ye can unfold these mysteries his clashing providence reconcile the partial frown and the unequal smile tell us why some have been destroyed betimes while albions glittering shores grow black with crimes why some for early errors are undone some longer still and longer still sin on england with all her blackening guilt is spared and sodoms lesser crimes received a swift reward and yet all this be reconciled to both impartial justice and unnerring truth why ostia stands and no revenging hand has yet dismissed her from the burdened land no plague no sulphurous shower her exit makes and turns her silver thames to stygian lakes whose so uninhabitable banks might flow with streams as black as her that made em so and as a monument to future times should send forth vapors nauseous as her crimes tell us why carthage fell a prey to rome and mourn the fate of bright byzantium why ancient troys embraced by destiny and rome immortal rome to fate gives way yet ostia stands more impious far than they where are the golden gates of palestine where high superior glory used to shine the mighty city millions dwelt within where heavens epitome was to be seen gods habitation sacred to his name magnificent beyond the voice of fame those lofty pinnacles which once were seen bright like the majesty which dwelt within in which seraphick glory could reside too great for humane vision to abide whose glittering fabric god the architect the suns less glorious light did once reject these all have felt the iron hands of fate and heavens dear darling citys desolate no more the sacred place commands our awe but all become a curse a golgotha the reverend pile can scarce its ruins show forsook by him whose glory made it so yet ostia stands her impious towers defy the threatening comets of the blazing sky foreboding signs of ruin she despises and all her teaching saviors sacrifices the jews are fools jerusalems outdone we crucify the father they the son within her reprobate gates they are allowed worse jews than those which crucified the god they killed a man for they supposed him so these boldly sacrifice the god they know his incarnation miracles deny and vilely banter his divinity their old impostor socinus prefer and the long voyage of heaven without a pilot steer yet ostia boasts of her regeneration and tells us wondrous tales of reformation how against vice she has been so severe that none but men of quality may swear how public lewdness is expelled the nation that private whoring may be more in fashion how parish magistrates like pious elves let none be drunk a sundays but themselves and hatkney coachmen durst not ply the street in sermontime till they had paid the state these ostia are the shams of reformation with which thou mockst thy maker and the nation while in thy streets unpunished there remain crimes which have yet insulted heaven in vain crimes which our satyr blushes to review and sins thy sister sodom never knew superior lewdness crowns thy magistrates and vice grown gray usurps the reverend seats eternal blasphemies and oaths abound and bribes among thy senators are found old venerable jeph with trembling air ancient in sin and father of the chair forsook by vices he had loved so long can now be vicious only with his tongue yet talks of ancient lewdness with delight and loves to be the justice of the night on bawdy tales with pleasure he reflects and lewdly smiles at vices he corrects the feeble tottering magistrate appears willing to wickedness in spite of years struggles his age and weakness to resist and fain would sin but nature will not assist l  l the pandor of thy judgment seat has neither manners honesty nor wit instead of which he is plentiously supplied with nonsense noise impertinence and pride polite his language and his flowing style scorns to suppose good manners worth his while with principles from education stored the drudgery of decency abhorred the citymouth with eloqvence endud to mountebank the listening multitude sometimes he tunes his tongue to soft harangues to banter common halls and flatter kings and all with but an odd indifferent grace with jingle on his tongue and coxcomb in his face definitive in law without appeal but always serves the hand who pays him well he trades in justice and the souls of men and prostitutes them equally to gain he has his public book of rates to show where every rogue the price of life may know and this one maxim always goes before he never hangs the rich nor saves the poor godlike he nods upon the bench of state his smiles are life and if he frown it is fate boldly invading heavens prerogative for with his breath he kills or saves alive fraternities of villains he maintains protects their robberies and shares the gains who thieve with toleration as a trade and then restore according as they are paid with awkward scornful phiz and vile grimace the genuine talents of an ugly face with haughty tone insults the wretch that dies and sports with his approaching miseries f  e for so sometimes unrighteous fate erects a madman for a magistrate equipt with lewdness oaths and impudence supplies with vices his defect of sense abandoned to ill manners he retains his want of grace as well as want of brains before the boy wore off the rake began the bully then commenced and then the man yet nature seems in this to do him wrong to give no courage with a saucy tongue from whence this constant disadvantage flows he always gives the words and takes the blows tho ofren cand he is instructed by it but still he shows the scoundrel with the knight still scurilous and still afraid to sight his dialects a modern billingsgate which suits the hosier not the magistrate the same he from behind the counter brought and yet he practiced worse than he was taught early debauched in satans steps he moved and all mechanic vices he improved at first he did his sovereigns rights invade and raised his fortune by clandestine trade stealing the customs did his profits bring and twas his calling to defraud his king this is the man that helps to rule the state the citys newreforming magistrate to execute the justice of the law and keep less villains than himself in awe take money of the rich and hang the poor and lash the strumpet he debauched before so for small crimes poor thieves destruction find and leave the rogues of quality behind search all the christian climes from pole to pole and match for sheriffs s  ple and c  le equal in character and dignity this famed for justice that for modesty by merit chosen for the chair of state this fit for bridewel that for billingsgates that richly clad to grace the gaudy day for which his fathers creditors must pay this from the fluxing bagnio just dismissed rides out to make himself the city jest from some lascivious dishclout to the chair to punish lewdness and disorders there the brute he rides on would his crimes detest for that is the animal and this the beast and yet some reformation he began for magistrates never bear the sword in vain expensiue sinning always he declined to frugal whoring totally resigned his avarice his appetites oppressed base like the man and brutish like the lust concise in sinning natures call supplied and in one act two vices gratified never was oyster beggar cinder whore so much caressed by magistrates before they that are nice and squeamish in their lust ts a sign the vice is low and wants a gust but he that is perfect in the extreme of vice scorns to excite his appetite by price twas in his reign we to reform began and set the devil up to mend the man more might be said but satyr stay thy rhimes and mix not his misfortunes with his crimes c  n superbly wise and grave of life could every one reform except his wife passive in vice he pimps to his own fate to show himself a loyal magistrate it is doubtful who debauched the city more the maker of the masque or of the whore nor his religion less a masquerade he always drove a strange mysterious trade with doubtful zeal to church he will gravely come to praise that god which he denies at home socinian t  ds his dear ghostly priest and taught him all religion to digest took prudent care he should not much profess and he was never addicted to excess and yet he covets without rule or end will sell his wife his master or his friend to houndless avarice a constant slave unsatisfied as death and greedy as the grave now satyr let us view the the numerous fry that must succeeding magistrates supply and search if future years are like to be much better taught or better ruled than we the senators of hospital descent the upper house of ostias parliament who from destruction should their city save but are as wicked as they should be grave with citizens in petto who at need as these do those so those must these succeed d  b the modern judas of the age has often tried in vain to mount the stage profuse in gifts and bribes to god and man to ride the cityhorse and wear the chain his vices ostia thou have made thy own in choosing him thou writst thy own lampoon fancy the haughty wretch in chair of state at once the citys shame and magistrate at table set at his right hand a whore ugly as those which he had kept before he to do justice and reform our lives and she receive the homage of our wives now satyr give another wretch his due who is chosen to reform the city too hate him ye friends to honesty and sense hate him in injured beautys just defense a knighted booby insolent and base  whom man no manners gave nor god no grace the scorn of women and the shame of men matched at threescore to innocent fifteen hagrid with jealous whimsies lets us know he thinks he is cuckold cause he should be so his virtuous wife exposes to the town and fears her crimes because he knows his own here satyr let them just reproach abide who sell their daughters to oblige their pride the ch  er  n begins the doleful jest as a memento mori to the rest who fond to raise his generation by it and see his daughter buckld to a knight the innocent unwarily betrayed and to the rascal joined the hapless maid the purchase is too much below the cost for while the ladys gained the womans lost what shall we say to common vices now when magistrates the worst of crimes allow ostia if ever thou will reform thy gates t must be another set of magistrates in practice just and in profession sound but god knows where the men are to be found in all thy numerous streets it is hard to tell where the few men of faith and honor dwell poor and despised so seldom they appear the cynicks lanthorn would be useful here no city in the spacious universe boasts of religion more or minds it less of reformation talks and government backed with an hundred acts of parliament those useless scarecrows of neglected laws that miss the effect because they miss the cause thy magistrates who should reform the town punish the poor mens faults but hide their own suppress the players booths in smithfieldfair but leave the cloisters for their wives are there where all the scenes of lewdness do appear satyr the arts and mysteries forbear too black for thee to write or us to hear no man but he that is as vile as they can all the tricks and cheats of trade survey some in clandestine companies combine erect new stocks to trade beyond the line with air and empty names beguile the town and raise new credits first then cry em down divide the empty nothing into shares to set the town together by the ears the sham projectors and the brokers join and both they cully merchant undermine first he must be drawn in and then betrayed and they demolish the machine they made so conjuring chemists who with a charm and spell some wondrous liquid wondrously exhale but when the gaping mob their money pay the charms dissolved the vapor flies away the wondering bubbles stand amazed to see their money mountebankd to mercury some fit out ships and double fraights ensure and burn the ships to make the voyage secure promiscuous plunders through the world commit and with the money buy their safe retreat others seek out to africks torrid zone and search the burning shores of serralone there in unsufferable heats they fry and run vast risques to see the gold and die the harmless natives basely they trepan and barter baubles for the souls of men the wretches they to christian climes bring over to serve worse heathens than they did before the cruelties they suffer there are such amboynas nothing they have outdone the dutch cortez pizarro guzman penaloe who drank the blood and gold of mexico who thirteen millions of souls destroyed and left one third of gods creation void by birth for natures butchery designed compared to these are merciful and kind death could their cruellest designs fulfill blood quenched their thirst and it sufficed to kill but these the tender coup de grace deny and make men beg in vain for leave to die to more than spanish cruelty inclind torment the body and debauched the mind the lingering life of slavery preserve and vilely teach them both to sin and serve in vain they talk to them of shades below they fear no hell but where such christians go of jesus christ they very often hear often as his blaspheming servants swear they hear and wonder what strange gods they be can bear with patience such indignity they look for famines plagues disease and death blasts from above and earthquakes from beneath but when they see regardless heaven looks on they curse our gods or think that we have none thus thousands to religion are brought over and made worse devils than they were before satyr the men of drugs and simples spare it is hard to search the latent vices there their theologicks too they may defend they cannot deceive who never do pretend as to religion generally they show as much as their profession will allow but count them all confederates of hell till b  they with one consent expel b  our satyr startles at his name the college scandal and the citys shame not satisfied his maker to deny provokes him with lampoon and blasphemy and with unpresidented insolence banters a god and scoffs at providence no nation in the world but ours would bear to hear a wretch blaspheme the gods they fear his flesh long since their altars had adorned and with his blood appeased the powers he scorned but see the badge of our reforming town some cry religion up some cry it down some worship god and some a god defy with equal boldness equal liberty the silent laws decline the just debate made dumb by the more silent magistrate and both together small distinction put twixt him that owns a god and him that owns him not the modern crime it is thought no being had they knew no atheist when our laws were made it is hard the laws more freedom should allow with god above than magistrates below b  unpunished may heaven and earth defy dethrone almighty power almighty truth deny burlesque the sacred high vnutterd name and impious war with jove himself proclaim while justice unconcerned looks calmly on and b  boasts the conquests he has won insults the christian name and laughs to see religion bullyd by philosophy b  with far less hazard may blaspheme than thou may satyr trace thy noble theme the search of vice more hazard represents from laws from councils and from p  thou may be wicked and less danger know than by informing others they are so thou can  p  r no counselor expose or dress a vicious m  r in his proper clothes but all the bombs and canon of the law are soon drawn out to keep thy pen in awe by laws post facto thou may soon be slain and innuendos shall thy guilt explain thou may lampoon and no man will resent lampoon but heaven and not the p  our trusties and our welbelovds forbear you are free to banter heaven and all that is there the boldest flights you are welcome to bestow of the gods above but not the gods below b  may banter heaven and a  l death and t  d poison souls with his infected breath no civil government resents the wrong but all are touched and angry at thy song thy friends without the help of prophecy read goals and gibbets in thy destiny but courage springs from truth let it appear nothing but guilt can be the cause of fear satyr go on thy keenest shafts let fly truth can be no offense to honesty the guilty only are concerned and they lampoon themselves when ever they censure thee part ii the citys viewed now satyr turn thine eye the countrys vices and the courts survey and from impartial scrutiny set down how much they are both more vicious than the town how does our ten years war with vice advance about as much as it has done with france ride with the judge and view the wrangling bar and see how lewd our justicemerchants are how clito comes from instigating whore pleads for the man he cuckold just hefore see how he cants and acts the ghostly father and brings the gospel and the law together to make his pious frauds be well received he quotes the scripture which he never believed fluent in language indigent in sense supplies his want of law with impudence see how he rides the circuit with the judge to law and lewdness a devoted drudge a brace of femalclients meet him there to help debauch the sizes and the fair by day he plies the bar with all his might and revels in st ed  s streets at night the scandal of the law his own lampoon is lawyer merchant bully and buoon in drunken quarrels eager to engage till brother justice lodged him in the cage a thing the learned thought could never be had not the justice been as drunk as he he pleads of late at hymens nuptial bar and bright aurelia is defendant there he courts the nymph to wed and make a wife and swears by god he reform will his life the solemn part he might have well forbore for she alas has been has been a whore the pious dame the sober saint puts on and clitos in the way to be undone cascos debauched it is his paternal vice for wickedness descends to families the tainted blood the seeds of vice convey and plants new crimes before the old decay through all degrees of vice the father run but sees himself outsind by either son whoring and incest he has understood and they subjoyn adultery and blood this does the orphans cause devoutly plead secures her money and her maidenhead and then persuades her to defend the crime evade the guilt and banter off the shame taught by the subtle counselor she shows more nice distictions than ignatius knows in matrimony finds a learned flaw a wife in honor and a wife in law  choice is the substance of the contract made  and mutual love the only knot that is tied  to these the laws of nations must submit  and where they fail the contracts incomplete  so that if love and choice were not before  the last may be the wife the first the whore thus she securely sins with eager gust and satisfies her conscience and her lust nor does her zeal and piety omit but to the whore she joins the jesuit with constant zeal frequents the house of prayer to heal her prostituted conscience there without remorse adjourns with full content from his lascivious arms to the sacrament the brother less afraid of sin than shame doubles his guilt to save his tottering fame twas too much risque for any man to run to save that credit which before was gone the innocent lies unrevenged in death he stopped the growing scandal in her breath till rhyme shall lay the horrid murder bear no bribes can crush the writs of error there nor is the bench less tainted than the bar how hards that plague to cure that is spread so far twill all prescribed authorities reject while they are most guilty who should first correct contagious vice infects the judgmentseats and virtue from authority retreats how should she such society endure where she is contemned she cannot be secure milos a justice they that made him so should answer for the oppressive wrongs he will do his lands almost to ostias walls extend and of his heaped up thousands there is no end if magistrates as in the text it is clear ought to be such as avarice abhor this may be known of the almightys mind that milos not the man the text designed satyr be bold and and fear not to expose the vilest magistrate the nation knows let furius read his naked character blush not to write what he should blush to hear but let them blush who in a christian state made such a devil be a magistrate in britains eastern provinces he reigns and serves the devil with excessive pains the nations shame and honest mens surprise with drunkard in his face and madman in his eyes the sacred bench of justice he prophanes with a polluted tongue and bloody hands his intellects are always in a storm he frights the people which he should reform antipathys may some diseases cure but virtue can no contraries endure all reformation stopped where vice commands corrupted heads can never have upright hands shameless his class of justices he will swear and plants the vices he should punish there his mouths a sink of oaths and blasphemies and cursings are his kind civilities his servent prayer to heaven he hourly sends but it is damn himself and all his friends he raves in vice and storms that he is confined and studies to be worse than all mankind extremes of wickedness are his delight ands as pleased to hear that he is distinguished by it exotic ways of sinning he improves we curse and hate he censures where he loves so strangely retrograde to all mankind if crossed he damns himself if pleased his friend this is the man that helps to bless the nation and bully mankind into reformation the true coercive power of the law which drives the people which it cannot draw the nations scandal englands true lampoon a drunken whoring justicing buffoon with what stupendous impudence can he punish a poor mans immorality how should a vicious magistrate assent to mend our manners or our government how shall new laws for reformation pass when vice the legislation does possess to see old s  y blasphemy descry and old s  ne punish bribery lying exploded by a perjured knight and whoring punished by a sodomite that he the peoples freedom shond defend who had the king and people too trepand soldiers seek peace drunkards prohibit wine and fops and beaus our politics refine these are the absurdities too gross to hide which wise men wonder at and fools deride when from the helm socinian h  t flies and all the rest his tenants stigmatize and none remain that jesus christ denies judas expelled lewd lying c  sent home and men of honesty put in their room blaspheming b  s to his fenditches sent to bully justice with a parliament then we shall have a christian government then shall the wished for reformation rise and vice to virtue fall a sacrifice and with the nauseous rabble that retire turn out that bawdy saucy poet p  a vintners boy the wretch was first preferred to wait at vices gates and pimp for bread to hold the candle and sometimes the door let in the drunkard and let out the whore but as to villains it has often chanced was for his wit and wickedness advanced let no man think his new behavior strange no metamorposis can nature change effects are chained to causes generally the rascal born will like a rascal die his princes favors followed him in vain they changed the circumstance but not the man while out of pocket and his spirits low he would beg write panegyricks cringe and bow but when good pensions had his labor crowned his panegyricks into satyrs turned and with a true mechanic spirit cursed abused his royal benefactor first o what assiduous pains does p  take to let great d  see he could mistake dissembling nature false description gave showed him the poet and concealed the knave to  d if such a wretch is worth our scorn shall vices blackest catalogue adorn his hated character let this supply too vile even for our university now satyr to one character be just m  ns the only pattern and the first a title which has more of honor in it then all his ancient glories of descent most men their neighbors vices will disown but he is the man that does reform his own let those alone reproach his want of sense who with his crimes have had his penitence it is want of sense makes men when they do wrong adjourn the promised penitence too long nor let them call him coward because he fears to pull both god and man about his ears amongst the worst of cowards let him be named who having sinnds afraid to be ashamed and to mistaken courage he is betrayed who having sinnds ashamed to be afraid thy valor m  does our praise prevent for thou have had the courage to repent nor shall his first mistake our censure find what heaven forgets let no man call to mind satyr make search through all the sober age to bring one seasoned drunkard on the stage sir stephew nor sir thomas will not suffice nor six and twenty kentish justices your e  x priesthood hardly can supply though they are enough to drink the nation dry though parson b  d has been steept in wine and sunk the royal tankard on the

mankind outdo some high excess that is wonderful and new nor will mechanic sots our satyr suit it is quality must grace the attribute these like the lofty cedars to the shrub drink maudlincolledge down and royston club such petty drinkings a mechanic evil but he is a drunkard that outdrinks the devil if such can not in court or church appear let us view the camp you will quickly find em there brave t  n who revelld day and night and always kept himself too drunk to fight and o  d in a sea of sulphur strove to let the spaniards see the vice we love yet these are puny sinners if you will look the dreadful roll in fates anthentick book the monument of bacchus still remains where english bones lie heaped in irish plains triumphant death upon our army trod and revelld at dundalk in english blood let no man wonder at the dreadful blow for heaven has seldom been insulted so in vain brave scomberg mourned the troops that fell while he made vows to heaven and they to hell our satyr trembles to review those times and hardly finds out words to name their crimes in every tent the horrid junctos sat to brave their maker and despise their fate the work was done drunkenness was gone before life was suspended death could do no more five regimented heroes there appear captains of thousands mighty men of war glutted with wine and drunk with hellish rage for want of other foes they heaven engage sulphur and ill extracted fumes agree to make each drop push on their destiny the infernal draughts in blasphemies rebound and openly the devils health went round nor can our verse their latent crime conceal how they shook hands to meet next day in hell death pledged them fate the dreadful compact read concurring justice spoke and four of five lay dead when men their makers vengeance once defy it is a certain sign that their destructions nigh it is vain to single out examples here drunkenness will soon be the nations character the grand contagions spreading over all it is epidemick now and national since then the sages all reproofs despise let us quit the people and lampoon the vice drunkenness is so the error of the time the youth begin to ask if it is a crime wonder to see the grave patricians come from city courts of conscience reeling home and think it is hard they should no license make to give the fredom which their fathers take the seat of judgments so debauched with wine justice seems rather to be drunk than blind let us fall the sword and her unequal scale makes right go down and injury prevail a vice it is thought the devil at first designed not to allure but to affront mankind a pleasure nature hardly can explain suits none of god almightys brutes but man an act so nautious that had heaven enjoined the practice as a duty on mankind they would shun the bliss which came so foul a way and forfeit heaven rather than once obey a double crime by which one act we undo at once the gentleman and christian too for which no better antidote is known than to have one drunkard to another shown the mother conduit of expatiate sin where all the seeds of wickedness begin the in roduction to eternal strife and prologue to the tragedy of life a foolish vice does needless crimes reveal and only tells the truth it should conceal it is strange how men of sense should be subdued by vices so unnatural and rude which gorge the stomach to divert the head and to make mankind merry make them mad destroys the vitals and distracts the brain and rudely moves the tongue to talk in vain dismisses reason stupifies the sense and wondering natures left in strange suspense the souls benumbed and ceases to inform and all the sea of natures in a storm the dead unactive organ feels the shock and willing death attends the fatal stroke and is this all for which mankind endure distempers past the power of art to cure for which our youth old age anticipate and with luxurious drafts suppress their vital heat tell us ye learned doctors of the vice wherein the high mysterious pleasure lies the great sublime enjoyments laid so deep it is known in dream and understood in sleep the graduates of the science first commence and gain perfection when they lose their sense titles they give which call their vice to mind but sots the common name for all the kind natures fanatics who their sense employ the principles of nature to destroy a drunkard is a creature god never made the species man the nature retrograde from all the sons of paradise they seem to differ in the most acute extreme those covet knowledge labor to be wise these stupifie the sense and put out reasons eyes for health and youth those all their arts employ these strive their youth and vigor to destroy those damn themselves to heap an illgot store these liquidate their wealth and covet to be poor satyr examine now with heedful care what the rich trophies of the bottle are the mighty conquests which her champions boast the prizes which they gain and price they cost the ensigns of her order soon displace natures most early beauties from the face paleness at first succeeds and languid air and bloated yellows supersede the fair the flaming eyes betray the nitrous flood which quench the spirits and inflame the blood disperse the rofie beauties of the face and fiery botches triumph in the place the tottering head and trembling hand appears and all the marks of age without the years distorted limbs gross and unweildy move and hardly can pursue the vice they love a bacchanalian scarlet dies the skin a sign what sulphurons streams arise within the flesh embossed with ulcers and the brain oppressed with fumes and vapor shows in vain what once before the fire it did contain strange power of wine whose vehicle the same at once can both extinguish and inflame keen as the lightning does the sword consume and leaves the untouched scabbard in its room nature burnt up with fiery vapor dies and wine a little while mocklife supplies gouts and old aches lifes short hours divide at once the drunkards punishment and pride who having all his youthful powers subdued enjoys old age and pain before he should till nature quite exhausted quits the wretch and leaves more will than power to debauch with hellish pleasure past excess he views and fain would drink but nature must refuse thus drenched in artificial flame he lies drunk in desire forgets himself and dies in the next regions he expects the same and hells no change for here he lived in flame satyr to church visit the house of prayer and see the wretched reformation there unveil the mask and search the sacred sham for rogues of all religion are the same the several tribes their numerous titles view and fear no censure where the fact is true they all shall have thee for their constant friend who more than common sanctity pretend provided they will take care the world may see their practices and their pretense agree but count them with the worst of hypocrites whom zeal divides and wickedness unites who in profession only are precise dissent in doctrine and conform in vice they who from the established church divide must do it out of piety or pride and their sincerity is quickly tried for always they that stand before the first will be the best of christians or the worst but shun their secret councils o my soul whose interest can their consciences control those ambodexters in religion who can any thing dispute yet any thing can do those christianmountebanks that in disguise can reconcile impossibilities alternately conform and yet dissent and sin with both hands but with one repent the man of conscience all mankind will love the knaves themselves his honesty approve he only to religion can pretend the rest do for the name alone contend the verity of true religions known by no description better than its own of truth and wisdom it informs the mind and nobly strives to civilize mankind with potent vice maintains eternal strife corrects the manners and reforms the life tell us ye learned magi of the schools who pose mankind with ecclesiastic rules what strange amphibious things are they that can religion without honesty maintain who own a god pretended homage pay but neither his nor human laws obey blush england hide thy hypocritick face who has no honesty can have no grace in vain we argue from absurdities religions buried just when virtue dies virtues the light by which religions known if this be wanting heaven will that disown we grant it merits no divine regard and heaven is all from bounty not reward but god must his own nature contradict reverse the world its government neglect cease to be just eternal law repeal be weak in power and mutable in will if vice and virtue equal fate should know and that unblessed or this unpunished go in vain we strive religion to disguise and smother it with ambiguities interest and priest  may perhaps invent strange mysteries by way of supplement schoolmen may deep perplexing doubts disclose and subtle notions on the world impose till by their ignorance they are betrayed and lost in deserts which themselves have made zealots may cant and dreamers may divine and formal fops to pageantry incline and all with specious gravity pretend their spurious metaphysics to defend religions no divided mystic name for true religion always is the same naked and plain her sacred truths appear from pious frauds and dark aenigmas clear the meanest sense may all the parts discern what nature teaches all mankind may learn even what is revealed is no untrodden path it is known by rule and understood by faith the negatives and positives agree illustrated by truth and honesty and yet if all religion was in vain did no rewards or punishments contain virtues so suited to our happiness that none but fools could be in love with vice virtues a native rectitude of mind vice the degeneracy of humankind virtue is wisdom solid and divine vice is all fool without and knave within virtue is honor circumscribed by grace vice is made up of every thing that is base virtue has secret charms which all men love and those that do not choose her yet approve vice like ill pictures which offend the eye make those that made them their own works deny virtues the health and vigor of the soul vice is the foul disease infects the whole virtues the friend of life the soul of health the poor mans comfort and the rich mans wealth vice is a thief a traitor in the mind assassinates the vitals of mankind the poison of his high prosperity and only misery of poverty to states and governments they both extend virtues their life and being vice their end virtue establishes and vice destroys and all the end of government unties virtues an english king and parliament vice is a czar of muscow government virtue sets bounds to kings and limits crowns vice knows no law and all restraint disowns virtue prescribes all government by rules vice makes kings tyrants and their subjects fools virtue seeks peace and property maintains vice binds the captive world in hostile chains virtues a beauteous building formed on high vice is confusion and deformity in vain we strive these two to reconcile vain and impossible the unequal toil antipathies in nature may agree darkness and light discord and harmony they distant poles in spite of space may kiss water capitulate and fire make peace but good and evil

cultivate mankind when pride has once possession of his mind not all his graces favors could prevail to calm that tongue that was so used to rail promiscuous gall his learned mouth defiled and hypocondraick spleen his preaching spoiled his undistinguished censure he bestows not by desert but as ill nature flows the learned say the causes are from hence an ebb of manners and a flux of sense

damned their sober rhimes the tribes good natured and desire to please and when you snarl at those present you these the world has lost its ancient taste of wit and vice comes in to raise the appetite

qualities must do to make the poem and the poet too dear satyr if thou will reform the town thou wilt certainly be beggared and undone it is at thy peril if thou will proceed to cry down vice mankind will never read concluvsion what strange mechanic thoughts of god and man must this unsteady nation entertain to think almighty science can be blind wisdom it self be banterd by mankind eternal providence be mocked with lies with outsides and improbabilities with laws those rhodomontas of the state long proclamation and the lord knows what societies ill manners to suppress and new sham wares with immoralities while they themselves to common crimes betrayed can break the very laws themselves have made with jehus zeal they furiously reform and raise false clouds which end without a storm but with a loose to vice securely see the subject punished and themselves go free for shame your reformationclubs give over and jest with men and jest with heaven no more but if you would avenging powers appease avert the indignation of the skies impending ruin avoid and calm the fates ye hypocrites reform your magistrates your quest of vice at church and court been there lie the seed of high expatiate sin it is they can cheek the vices of the town when ever they please but to suppress their own our modes of vices from their examples came and their examples only must reclaim in vain you strive ill manners to suppress by the superlatives of wickedness ask but how well the drunken plowman looks set by the swearing justice in the stocks and poor street whores in bridewel feel their fate while harlot m  n rides in a coach of state the mercenary scouts in every street bring all that have no money to your feet and if you lash a strumpet of the town she only smarts for want of half a crown your annual lists of criminals appear but no sir harry or sir charles is there your proclamations rank and file appear to bugbear vice and put mankind in fear these are the squibs and crackers of the law which hiss and make a bounce and then withdraw law like the thunder of immortal jove rings peals of terror from the powers above but when the pointed lightnings disappear the cloud dissolves and all is serene and clear law only aids men to conceal their crimes but it is example must reform the times force and authorities are all in vain unless you can persuade you will never constrain and all persuasive power expires of course till backed with good examples to enforce the magistrates must blasphemy forbear be faultless first themselves and then severe impartial justice equally dispense and fear no man nor fear no mans offense then may our justices and not before when they reprove the rich correct the poor the men of honor must from vice dissent before the rakes and bullies will repent virtue must be the fashion of the town before the beaus and ladies put it on wit must no more be bawdy and profane or wit to virtues reconciled in vain the clergy must be sober grave and wise or else in vain they cant of paradise our reformation never can prevail while precepts govern and examples fail were but the ladies virtuous as they are fair the beaus would blush as often as they swear vice would grow antiquated in the town would all our men of mode but cry it down for sins a slave to custom and willed to die whenever habits suffer a decay and therefore all our reformation here must work upon our shame and not our fear if once the mode of virtue would begin the poor will quickly be ashamed to sin fashion is such a strange bewitching charm for fear of being laughed at they will reform and yet posterity will blush to hear royal examples have been useless here the only just exception to our rule virtues not learnt in this imperial school in vain marias character we read so few will in her path of virtue tread in vain her royal sister recommends virtue to be the test of all her friends backed with her own example and commands our church established and our trade restored our friends protected and our peace secured france humbld and our fleets insulting spain these are the triumphs of a female reign at home her milder influence she imparts queen of our vows and monarch of our hearts if change of sexes thus will change our scenes grant heaven we always may be ruled by queens the spanish descent a poem long had this nation been amused in vain with posts from portugal and news from spain with ormonds conquests and the fleets success and favors from the moors at maccaness the learned mob bought compasses and scales and every barber knew the bay of cales showed us the army here and there the fleet here the troops land and there the foes retreat there at st marys how the spaniard runs and listen close as if they heard the guns and some pretend they see them  the nuns others describe the castle and puntalls and tell how easy it is to conquer cales wisely propose to let the silver come and help to pay the nations debts at home but still they count the spoils without the cost and still the news came faster than the post the graver heads like mountebanks of state of abdications and revolts debate expect a revolution should appear as cheap and easy as it had done here bring the revolting grandees to the cast and give the duke d anjou up for lost doom him to france to seek relief in vain and send the duke of austria to spain canvas the council at madrid and find how all the spanish courtiers stand inclined describe the strange convulsions of the state and old carreroes sacrificed to fate then all the stage of action they survey and wish our generals knew as much as they some have their fancies so exceeding bold they saw the queens fall out and heard em scold nor is the thing so strange for if they did twas talking from toledo to madrid and now the farce is acting over again the meaning of our mischiefs to explain the learned mob oerread in arms and law the cause of their miscarriages foresaw tell us the loytering minutes were misspent too long a going and too few that went exalt the catalonian garrison the new made works the platform and the town tell us it was impossible to land and all their batteries sunk into the sand some are all banter and the voyage despise for fruitless actions seldom pass for wise tell us twas like our english politics to think to wheedle spain with heretics the disproportioned force they banter too the ships too many and the men too few then they find fault with conduct and condemn sometimes the officers sometimes the men nor escapes his grace the satyr of the town whoever fails success shall fail renown sir george comes in amongst the indiscreet sometimes the armys censured then the fleet how the abandoned country they destroyed and made their early declarations void too hasty proofs of their protection gave plundring the people they came there to save as if the spaniards were so plagued with france to fly to thieves for their deliverance but amongst all the wisdom of the town the vast designs of fate remain unknown unguest at unexpected hid from thoughts for no man looked for blessings in our faults mischances sometimes are a nations good rightly improved and nicely understood ten years we felt the dying pangs of war and fetched our grief and miseries from far our english millions foreign war maintains and english blood has drencht the neighboring plains nor shall we blush to boast what all men own uncommon english valor has bin shown the forward courage of our ill paid men deserves more praise than nature spares my pen what could they not perform or what endure witness the mighty bastions of namur we fasted much and we attempted more but never could come to giving thanks before unless twas when the fatal strife was over some secret achan cursed our enterprise and israel fled before her enemies whether the poisonous particles were hid in us that followed or in them that led what fatal charm benumnd the nations sense to struggle with eternal providence whether some curse or else some perjured vow or some strange guilt that is expiated now was it the pilots who ill steered the state or was it the decisive will of fate it is hard to tell but this too well we know all things went backward or went on too slow small was the glory of our high success a tedious war and an imperfect peace peace dearly purchased and which cost us more great kingdoms than we conquered towns before actions may miss of their deserved applause when heaven approves the men and not the cause and well contrived designs miscarry when heaven may approve the cause but not the men here then is the ground of our expense of blood the sword of gideons not the sword of god the mighty and the wise are laid aside and victory the sex has dignified we have been used to female conquests here and queens have been the glory of the war the scene revives with smiles of providence all things declined before and prosper since and as if illsuccess had been entailed the posthume projects are the last that failed as heaven whose works were hid from human view would blast our old designs and bless our new and now the baffled enterprise grows stale their hopes decrease and juster doubts prevail the unattempted town sings victory and scared with walls and not with men we fly great conduct in our safe retreat we show and bravely reembark when none pursue the guns the ammunitions put on board and what we could not plunder we restored and thus we quit the andalusian shores drencht with the spanish wine and spanish w  s with songs of scorn the arragonians sing and loud te deums make the valleys ring uncommon joys now raise the hopes of spain and vigo does their platefleet entertain the vast galleons deepballased with ore safely reach home to the galitian shore the double joy spreads from madrid to rome the english fled the silver fleet comes home from thence it reaches to the banks of po and the loud cannons let the germans know the rattling volleys tell their shortlived joys and roar te deum out in smoke and noise to milan next it flies on wings of fame there the young monarch and his heroes came from sad luzara and the mantuan walls to seek new dangers and to rescue cales his joy for welcome treasure he expressed but grieves at his good fortune in the rest the flying english he had wished to stay to crown with conquests one victorious day the priests in high procession show their joy and all the arts of eloquence employ to feed his pride of fancied victories and raise his untryd valor to the skies the flattering courtiers his vain mind possess with airy hopes of conquest and success prompt his young thoughts to run on new extremes and sycophantick pride his heart inflames his native crime springs up his pulse beats high with thoughts of universal monarchy fancies his foreign enemies suppressed and boasts too soon how he will subdue the rest princes like other men are blind to fate he only sees the event who does the cause create from hence through france the welcome tidings fly to mock his ancient sire with mushroom joy raptures possess the ambitious heads of france and golden hopes their new designs advance now they consult to crush the world again and talk of riffling christendom for men new fleets new armies and new leagues contrive and swallow men and nations up alive prescribe no bounds to their ambitious pride but first the wealth and then the world divide excess of pride to airy madness grows and makes men strange romantic things propose the head turns round and all the fancys vain and makes the world as giddy as the brain men that consult such weighty things as those all possible disasters should suppose in vain great princes mighty things invent while heaven retains the power to prevent he that to general mischief makes pretense should first know how to conquer providence such strive in vain and only show mankind how tyrants clothed with power are all inclined mean while our melancholy fleet steers home some grieved for past for future mischiefs some disaster swells the blood and spleen the face and ripens them for glorious things apace with deep regret they turn their eyes to spain and wish they once might visit them again little they dreamt that good which heaven prepared no merit from below no signs from heaven appeared no hints unless from their high ripened spleen and strange ungrounded sympathy within the silent duke from all misconduct free alone enjoys the calm of honesty fears not his journal should be fairly shown and sighs for englands errors not his own his constant tempers all serene and clear first free from guilt and therefore free from fear not so the rest for conscious thoughts become more restless now the nearer they come home the partymaking feuds on board begin for people always quarrel when they sin reflect with shame upon the things misdone and shift their faults about from one to one prepare excuses and compute their friends and dread the fate which their desert attends some wish for storms and curse the wind and sails and dream no doubt of gibbets and of jayls imaginary punishments appear and suited to their secret guilts their fear their hastening fate in their own fancies read and few it is feared their innocence can plead then their sweet spoils to trusty hands convey and throw the rifld gods of spain away disgorge that wealth they dare not entertain and wish the nuns their maidenheads again dismiss their wealth for fear of witnesses and purge their coffers and their consciences cursing their ill got trifles but in vain for still the guilt and still the fears remain tell us ye rabbis of abstruser sense who jumble fate and fools with providence is this the chosen army this the fleet for which heavens praises sound in every street could heaven provide them one occasion more who had so illdischargd themselves before that fleet so many former millions lost so little had performed so much had cost that fleet so often manned with knaves before that served us all the war to make us poor that twice had made their fruitless voyage to spain and saw the streights and so came home again our wooden walls that should defend our trade and many a witless wooden voyage have made how often have they been fitted out in vain wasted our money and destroyed our men betrayed our merchants and exposed their fleets and caused eternal murmurs in our streets the nations genius sure prevails above and heaven conceals his anger shows his love the nations guardian angel has prevailed and on her guardian queen new favors has entailed now let glad europe in her turn rejoice and sing new triumphs with exalted voice see the glad post of tidings winged with news with suited speed the wondering fleet pursues his haste discerned increases their surprise the more they wonder and the more he flies nor wind nor seas proportioned speed can bear for joy and hope have swifter wings than fear with what surprise of joy they meet the news joys that to every vein new spirits infuse the wild excess in shouts and cries appear for joys and griefs are all irregular councils of war for sake of forms they call but shame admits of no disputes at all how should they differ where no doubt can be but if they should accept of victory whether they should the great occasion take or baffle heaven and double their mistake whether the naked and defenseless prize they should accept or heaven and that despise whether they should revive their reputation or sink it twice and twice betray the nation who dare the horrid negative design who dare the last suggest the first decline envy her self for satans always there and keeps his councils with the god of war though with her swelling spleen she seemed to burst willed the design while the event she cursed the words gone out and now they spread the main with swelling sails and swelling hopes for sapin to double vengeance pressed where ever they come resolved to pay the haughty spaniard home resolved by future conduct to atone for all our past mistakes and all their own new life springs up in every english face and fits them all for glorious things apace the booty some excites and some the cause but more the hope to gain their lost applause eager their sullied honor to restore some anger whets some pride and vengeance more the lazy minutes now pass on too slow fancy flies faster than the winds can blow impatient wishes lengthen out the day they chide the loytering winds for their delay but time is natures faithful messenger and brings up all we wish as well as all we fear the mists clear up and now the scout discryes the subject of their hopes and victories the wished for fleets embayd in harbor lie unfit to fight and more unfit to fly triumphant joy throughout the navy flies echoed from shore with terror and surprise strange power of noise which at one simple sound at once shall some encourage some confound in vain the lion tangld in the snare with anguish roars and rends the trembling air it is vain to struggle with almighty fate vain and impossible the weak debate the mighty booms the forts resist in vain the guns with fruitless force in noise complain see how the troops intrepidly fall on wish for more foes and think they fly too soon with eager fury to their forts pursue and think the odds of four to one too

hearty blessings pour saint paul never saw but one such day before the poor mans plea in relation to all the proclamations declarations acts of parliament etc which have been or shall be made or published for a reformation of manners and suppressing immorality in the nation the preface reformation of manners is a work so honorable and at this time so absolutely necessary that like the reform of our money it can be no longer delayed  the ways by which the present torrent of vice has been let in upon the nation and by which it maintains the tyranny it has usurped on the lives of the inhabitants are too plain to be hid the following sheets aim at the work by leading to the most direct means viz reformation by example laws are in terrorem punishments and magistrates compel and put a force upon mens minds but example is persuasive and gentle and draws by a secret invisible and almost involuntary power  if there can be any remedies proposed more proper to bring it to pass they that know them would do well to bring them forth in the mean time the author thinks conscience in the minds of men impartially consulted will give a probatum est to the following proposal and to that judgment be refers all those who object against it  the the poor mans plea in searching for a proper cure of an epidemick distemper physicians do tell us it is first necessary to know the cause of that distemper from what part of the body and from what ill habit it proceeds and when the cause is discovered it is to be removed that the effect may cease of its self but if removing the cause will not work the cure then indeed they proceed to apply proper remedies to the disease it self and the particular part afflicted  immorality is without doubt the present reigning distemper of the nation and the king and parliament who are indeed the proper physicians seem nobly inclined to undertake the cure it is a great work well worthy their utmost pains the honor of it were it once perfected would add more trophies to the crown than all the victories of this bloody war or the glories of this honorable peace  but as a person under the violence of a disease sends in vain for a physician unless he resolves to make use of his prescription so in vain does the king attempt to reform a nation unless they are willing to reform themselves and to submit to his prescriptions  wickedness is an ancient inhabitant in this country and it is very hard to give its original  but however difficult that may be it is easy to look back to a time when we were not so generally infected with vice as we are now and twill seem sufficient to enquire into the causes of our present defection  the protestant religion seems to have an unquestioned title to the first introducing a strict morality mong us and it is but just to give the honor of it where it is so eminently due reformation of manners has something of a natural consequence in it from reformation in religion for since the principles of the protestant religion disown the indulgencies of the roman pontiff by which a thousand sins are as venial crimes bought off and the priest to save god almighty the trouble can blot them out of the account before it comes to his hand common vices lost their charter and men could not sin at so cheap a rate as before the protestant religion has in it self a natural tendency to virtue as a standing testimony of its own divine original and accordingly it has suppressed vice and immorality in all the countries where it has had a footing it has civilized nations and reformed the very tempers of its professors christianity and humanity has gone hand in hand in the world and there is so visible a difference between the other civilized governments in the world and those who now are under the protestant powers that it carries its evidence in it self  the reformation begun in england in the days of king edward the sixth and afterward gloriously finished by queen elizabeth brought the english nation to such a degree of humanity and sobriety of conversation as we have reason to doubt will hardly be seen again in our age  in king james the firsts time the court affecting something more of gallantry and gaiety luxury got footing and twenty years peace together with no extraordinary examples from the court gave too great encouragement to licentiousness  if it took footing in king james the firsts time it took a deep root in the reign of his son and the liberty given the soldiery in the civil war dispersed all manner of prophanness throughout the kingdom that prince though very pious in his own person and practice and had the misfortune to be the first king of england and perhaps in the world that ever established wickedness by a law by what unhappy council or secret ill fate he was guided to it is hard to determine but the book of sports as it was called that book to tolerate the exercise of all sports and pastimes on the lords day tended more to the vitiating the practice of this kingdom as to keeping that day than all the acts of parliament proclamations and endeavors of future princes has done or ever will do to reform it  and yet the people of england expressed a general sort of an aversion to that liberty and some as if glutted with too much freedom when the reins of law were taken off refused that practice they allowed themselves in before  in the time of king charles the second lewdness and all manner of debauchcry arrived to its meridian the encouragement it had from the practice and allowance of the court is an invincible demonstration how far the influence of our government extends in the practice of the people  the present king and his late queen whose glorious memory will be dear to the nation as long as the world stands have had all this wicked knot to unravel this was the first thing the queen set upon while the king was engaged in his wars abroad she first gave all sorts of vice a general discouragement and on the contrary raised the value of virtue and sobriety by her royal example the king having brought the war to a glorious conclusion and settled an honorable peace in his very first speech to his parliament proclaims a new war against profaneness and immorality and goes on also to discourage the practice of it by his royal example  thus the work is begun nobly and regularly and the parliament the general representative of the nation follows this royal example in enacting laws to suppress all manner of profaneness etc  these are great things and wellimprovd would give an undoubted overthrow to to the tyranny of vice and the dominion profaneness has usurped in the hearts of men  but we of the plebeii find our selves justly aggrieved in all this work of reformation and this reforming rigor makes the real work impossible wherefore we find our selves forced to seek redress of our grievances in the old honest way of petitioning heaven to relieve us and in the mean time we solemnly enter our protestation against the vicious part of the nobility and gentry of the nation as follows  first we protest that we do not find impartially enquiring into the matter speaking of moral goodness that you are not one jot better than we are your dignities estates and quality excepted it is true we are all bad enough and we are willing in good manners to agree that we are as wicked as you but we cannot find on the exactest scrutiny but that in the commonwealth of vice the devil has taken care to level poor and rich into one class and is fairly going on to make us all graduates in the last degree of immorality  secondly we do not find that all the proclamations declarations and acts of parliament yet made have any effective power to punish you for your immoralities as it does us now while you make laws to punish us and let your selves go free though guilty of the same vices and immoralities those laws are unjust and unequal in themselves  it is true the laws do not express a liberty to you and a punishment to us and therefore the king and parliament are free as king and parliament from this our appeal but the gentry and magistrates of the kingdom while they execute those laws upon us the poor commons and themselves practicing the same crimes in defiance of the laws both of god and man go unpunished this is the grievance we protest against as unjust and unequal  wherefore till the nobility gentry justices of the peace and clergy will be pleased either to reform their own manners and suppress their own immoralities or find out some method and power impartially to punish themselves when guilty we humbly crave leave to object against setting any poor man in the stocks or sending them to the house of correction for immoralities as the most unequal and unjust way of proceeding in the world  and now gentlemen  that this protestation may not seem a little too rude and a breach of good manners to our superiors ws crave leave to subjoin our humble appeal to your selves and will for once knowing you as english gentlemen to be men of honor make you judges in your own case  first gentlemen we appeal to your selves whether ever it be likely to perfect the reformation of manners in this kingdom without you whether laws to punish us without your example also to influence us will ever bring the work to pass  the first step from a loose vicious practice in this nation was begun by king edward the sixth backed by a reformed clergy and a sober nobility queen elizabeth carried it on twas the kings and the gentry which first again degenerated from that strict observation of moral virtues and from thence carried vice on to that degree it now appears in from the court vice took its progress into the country and in the families of the gentry and nobility it harbored till it took heart under their protection and made a general salley into the nation and we the poor commons who have been always easy to be guided by the example of our landlords and gentlemen have really been debauched into vice by their examples and it must be the example of you the nobility and gentry of the kingdom that must put a stop to the flood of vice and profaneness which is broken in upon the country or it will never be done  our laws against all manner of vicious practices are already very severe but laws are useless insignificant things if the executive power which lies in the magistrate be not exerted the justices of the peace have the power to punish but if they do not put forth that power it is all one as if they had none at all some have possibly exerted this power but wherever it has been so put forth it has fallen upon us the poor commons these are all cobweb laws in which the small flies are caught and great ones break through my lord mayor has whipped about the poor beggars and a few scandalous whores have been sent to the house of correction some alehousekeepers and vintners have been fined for drawing drink on the sabbath day but all this falls upon us of the mob the poor plebeii as if all the vice lay among us for we do not find the rich drunkard carried before my lord mayor nor a swearing lewd merchant the man with a gold ring and gay clothes may swear before the justice or at the justice may reel home through the open streets and no man take any notice of it but if a poor man get drunk or swears an oath he must to the stocks without remedy  in the second place we appeal to your selves whether laws or proclamations are capable of having any effect toward a reformation of manners while the benches of our justices are infected with the scandalous vices of swearing and drunkenness while our justices themselves shall punish a man for drunkenness with a god damn him set him in the stocks and if laws and proclamations are useless in the case then they are good for nothing and had as good be let alone as published  it is hard gentlemen to be punished for a crime by a man as guilty as our selves and that the figure a man makes in the world must be the reason why he shall not be liable to the law this is really punishing men for being poor which is no crime at all as a thief may be said to said to be hanged not for the fact but for being taken  we further appeal to your selves gentlemen to inform us whether there be any particular reason why you should be allowed the full career of your corrupt appetites without the restraint of laws while you your selves agree that such offenses shall be punished in us and do really execute the law upon the poor people when brought before you for the same things  wherefore that the work of reformation of manners may go on and be brought to perfection to the glory of god and the great honor of the king and parliament that debauchery and profaneness drunkenness whoring and all sorts of immoralities may be suppressed we humbly propose the method which may effectually accomplish so great a work    that the gentry and clergy who are the leaders of us poor ignorant people and our lights erected on high places to guide and govern us would in the first place put a voluntary force upon themselves and effectually reform their own lives their way of conversing and their common behavior among their servants and neighbors    the gentry they are the original of the modes and customs and manners of their neighbors and their examples in the countries especially are very moving there are three several vices which have the principal mannagement of the greatest part of mankind viz drunkenness swearing and whoring all of them very ill becoming a gentleman however custom may have made them modish where none of these three are in a house there is certainly something of a plantation of god in the family for they are such epidemic distempers that hardly humane nature is entirely free from them    drunkenness that brutish vice a sin so sordid and so much a force upon nature that had god almighty enjoined it as a duty i believe many a man would have ventured the loss of heaven rather than have have performed it the pleasure of it seems to be so secretly hid that wild heathen nations know nothing of the matter it is only discovered by the wise people of these northern countries who are proficients in vice philosophers in wickedness who can extract a pleasure to themselves in losing their understanding and make themselves sick at heart for their diversion  if the history of this well bred vice was to be written twould plainly appear that it begun among the gentry and from them was handed down to the poorer sort who still love to be like their betters after the restitution of king charles the second when drinking the kings health became the distinction between a cavalier and a roundhead drunkenness began its reign and it has reigned almost forty years the gentry caressed this beastly vice at such a rate that no companion no servant was thought proper unless he could bear a quantity of wine and to this day it is added to the character of a man as an additional title when you would speak well of him he is an honest drunken fellow as if his drunkenness was a recommendation of his honesty from the practice of this nasty faculty our gentlemen have arrived to the teaching of it and that it might be effectually preserved to the next age have very early instructed the youth in it nay so far has custom prevailed that the top of a gentlemans entertainment has been to make his friend drunk and the friend is so much reconciled to it that he takes that for the effect of his kindness which he ought as much to be affronted at as if he had kicked him down stairs thus it is become a science and but that the instruction proves so easy and the youth too apt to learn possibly we might have had a college erected for it before now the further perfection of this vice among the gentry will appear in two things that it is become the subject of their glory and the way of expressing their joy for any public blessing jack said a gentleman of very high quality when after the debate in the house of lords k william was voted into the vacant throne jack says he god damn ye jack go home to your lady and tell her we have got a protestant king and queen and go make a bonfire as big as a house and bid the butler make ye all drunk ye dog here was sacrificing to the devil for a thanksgiving to god other vices are committed as vices and men act them in private and are willing to hide them but drunkenness they are so fond of that they will glory in it boast of it and endeavor to promote it as much as possible in others it is a triumph to a champion of the bottle to repeat how many quarts of wine he has drank at a sitting and how he made such and such honest fellows drunk men lie and forswear and hide it and are ashamed of it as indeed they have reason to do but drunkenness and whoring are accomplishments men begin to value themselves upon repeat them with pleasure and affect a sort of vanity in the history are content all the world should be witnesses of their intemperance and have made the crime a badge of honor to their breeding and introduce the practice as a fashion and whoever gives himself the trouble to reflect on the custom of our gentlemen in their families encourageing and promoting this vice of drunkenness among the poor commons will not think it a scandal upon the geutry of england if we say that the mode of drinking as it is now practiced had its original from the practice of the countrygentlemen and they again from the court  it may be objected and god forbid it should not that there are a great many of our nobility and gentlemen who are men of honor and men of morals and therefore this charge is not universal to which we answer it is universal for all that because those very gentlemen though they are negatively clear as to the commission of the crimes we speak of yet are positively guilty in not executing that power the law has put into their hands with an impartial vigor for where was that gentleman or justice of the peace ever yet found who executed the terms of the law upon a drunken swearing lewd gentleman his neighbor but the quality of the person has been a license to the open exercise of the worst crimes as if there were any baronets knights or squires in the next world who because of those little steps custom had raised them on higher than their neighbors should be exempted from the divine judicature or that as captain vratz said who was hanged for murdering esquire thynn god would show them some respect as they were gentlemen  if there were any reason why a rich man should be permitted in the public exercise of open immoralities and not the poor man something might be said but if there be any difference it lies the other way for the vices of a poor man affect only himself but the rich mans wickedness affects all the neighborhood gives offense to the sober and encourages and hardens the lewd and quite overthrows the weak resolutions of such as are but indifferently fixed in their virtue and morality if my own watch goes false it deceives me and none else but if the town clock goes false it deceives the whole parish the gentry are the leaders of the mob if they are lewd and drunken the others strive to imitate em if they discourage vice and intemperance the other will not be so forward in it nor so fond of it  to think then to effect a reformation by punishing the poor while the rich seem to enjoy a charter for wickedness is like taking away the effect that the cause may cease  we find some people very fond of monopolizing a vice they would have all of it to themselves they must as my lord rochester said of himself sin like a lord little sneaking sins will not serve turn but they must be lewd at a rate above the common size to let the world see they are capable of it  our laws seem to take no cognizance of such perhaps for the same reason that lycurgus made no law against parricide because he would not have the sin named among his citizens  now the poor man sees no such dignity in vice as to study degrees we are downright in wickedness as we are in our dealings if we are drunk it is plain drunkenness swearing and whoring is all blunderbus with us we dont affect such niceties in our conversation and the justices use us accordingly nothing but the stocks or the house of correction is the case when we are brought before them but when our masters the gentlemen come to their refined practice and sin by the rules of quality we do not find any thing come of it but false heraldry the vice is punished by the vice and the punishment renews the crime  the case in short is this the lewdness profaneness and immorality of the gentry which is the main cause of the general debauchery of the kingdom is not at all touched by our laws as they are now executed and while it remains so the reformation of manners can never be brought to pass nor profaneness and immorality suppressed and therefore the punishing the poor distinctly is a mock upon the good designs of the king and parliament an act of injustice upon them to punish them and let others as guilty go free and a sort of cruelty too in taking the advantage of their poverty to make them suffer because they want estates to purchase their exemption  we have some weak excuses for this matters which must be considered as    the justice of the peace is a passive magistrate till an information be brought before him and is not to take notice of any thing but as it is laid in fact and brought to an affidavit now if an affidavit be made before a justice that such or such a man swore or was drunk he must or cannot avoid finding him the law obliges him to it let his quality be what it will so that the defect is not in the law nor in the justice but in the want of information    the name of an evidence or informer is so scandalous that to attempt to inform against a man for the most open breach of the laws of morality is enough to denominate a man unfit for society a rogue and an informer are synonimous in the vulgar acceptance so much is the real detection of the openest crimes against god and civil government discouraged and avoided    the impossibility of the cure is such and the habit has so obtained upon all mankind that it seems twisted with human nature as an appendix to natural frailty which it is impossible to separate from it  for answer    it is true the justice of the peace is in some respect a passive magistrate and does not act but by information but such information would be brought if it were encouraged if justices of of the peace did acquaint themselves with their neighborhood they would soon hear of the immoralities of the parish and if they did impartially execute the law on such as offended without respect of persons they would soon have an account of the persons and circumstances besides it is not want of information but want of punishing what they have information of a poor man informs against a great man the witness is discouraged the man goes unpunished and the poor man gets the scandal of an informer and then it is but too often that our justices are not men of extraordinary morals themselves and who shall inform a justice of the peace that such a man swore when he may be heard to swear himself as fast as another or who shall bring a man before a justice for being drunk when the justice is so drunk himself he cannot order him to be set in the stocks    besides the justice has a power to punish any fact he himself sees committed and to enquire into any he hears of casually and if he will stand still and see those acts of immorality committed before his face who shall bring a poor man before him to be punished thus i have heard a thousand horrid oaths sworn on a bowlinggreen in the presence of a justice of the peace and he take no notice of it and go home the next hour and set a man in the stocks for being drunk  as to the scandal of informing it is an error in custom and a great sin against justice it is necessary indeed that all judgment should be according to evidence and to discourage evidence is to discourage justice but that a man in trial of the morality of his neighbor should be shamed to appear must have some particular cause    it proceeds from the modishness of the vice it has so obtained upon some men mens practices that to appear against what almost all men approve seems malicious and has a certain prospect either of revenge or of a mercenary wretch that informs merely to get a reward it is true if no reward be placed upon an information no man will take the trouble and again if too great a reward men of honor shun the thing because they scorn the fee and to inform merely for the fee has something of a rascal in it too and from these reasons arises the backwardness of the people  the very same rich men we speak of are the persons who discourage the discovery of vice by scandalizing the informer a man that is any thing of a gentleman scorns it and the poor still mimick the humor of the rich and hate an informer as they do the devil it is strange the gentlemen should be ashamed to detect the breach of those laws which they were not ashamed to make but the very name of an informer has gained so black an idea in the minds people because some have made a trade of informing against people for religion have misbehaved themselves that truly twill be hard to bring any man either of credit or quality to attempt it  but the main thing which makes our gentlemen backward in the prosecution of vice is their practicing the same crimes themselves and they have so much wicked modesty and generosity in them being really no enemies to the thing it self that they cannot with any sort of freedom punish in others what they practice themselves  in the times of executing the laws against dissenters we found a great many gentlemen very vigorous in prosecuting their neighbors they did not stick to appear in person to disturb meetings and demolish the meeting houses and rather than fail would be informers themselves the reason was because they had also a dislike to the thing but we never found a dissenting gentleman or justice of the peace forward to do thus because they approved of it now were our gentlemen and magistrates real enemies to the immoralities of this age did they really hate drunkenness as a vice they would be forward and zealous to root the practice of it out of the neighborhood they would not be backward or ashamed to detect vice to disturb drunken assemblies to disperse those plantations of leachery the public bawdy houses which are almost as openly allowed as the burdelloes in italy they would be willing to have all sorts of vices suppressed and glory in putting their hands to the work they would not be ashamed to appear in the detecting debauchery or afraid to embroil themselves with their rich neighbors it is guilt of the same fact which makes connivance and till that guilt be removed the gentlemen of england neither will or can indeed with any kind of honor put their hands to the reforming it in their neighbors  but i think it is easy to make it appear that this difficulty of informing may be removed and there need not be much occasion for that scandalous employment  it is in the power of the gentry of england to reform the whole kingdom without either laws proclamations or informers and without their concurrence all the laws proclamations and declarations in the world will have no effect the vigor of the laws consists in their executive power ten thousand acts of parliament signify no more than one single proclamation unless the gentlemen in whose hands the execution of those laws is placed take care to see them duly made use of and how can laws be duly executedbut by an impartial distribution of equal rewards and punishments without regard to the quality and degree of the persons the laws push on the justices now and they take care to go no faster than they are driven but would the justices push on the laws vice would fly before them as dust in the wind and immoralities would be soon suppressed but it can never be expected that the magistrates should push on the laws to a free suppression of immoralities till they reform themselves and their great neighbors reform themselves that there may be none to punish who are too big for the magistrate to venture upon  would the gentry of england decry the modishness of vice by their own practice would they but dash it ouf of countenance by disowning it that drunkenness and oaths might once come into difesteem and be out of fashion and a man be valued the less for them that he that will swear and be drunk shall be counted a rake and not fit for a gentlemans company this would do more to reforming the rest of mankind than all the punishments the law can inflict the evil increased by example and must be suppressed the the same way if the gentry were thus reformed their families would be so too no servant would be entertained no workman employed no shopkeeper would be traded with by a gentleman but such as like themselves were sober and honest a lewd vicious drunken footman must reform or starve he would get no service a servant once turned away for his intemperance would be entertained by no body else a swearing debauched labourer or workman must reform or no body would employ him the drunken whoring shopkeeper must grow sober or lose all his customers and be undone interest and good manners will reform us of the poorer sort there would be no need of the stocks or houses of correction we should be sober of course because we should be all beggars else and he that loved the vice so dearly as to purchase it with the loss of his trade and employment would soon grow too poor for his vice and be forced to leave it by his own necessities there would be no need of informers a vicious fellow would be presently notorious he would be the talk of the town every one would slight and shun him for fear of being thought like him by being seen in his company he would expose himself and would be punished as unpitied as a thief  so that in short the whole weight of this blessed work of reformation lies on the shoulders of the gentry they are the cause of our defection which being taken away the effect would cease of course vice would grow scandalous and all mankind would be ashamed of it    the clergy also ought not to count themselves exempted in this matter whose lives have been and in some places still are so vicious and so loose that it is well for england we are not subject to be much priestriddden  it is a strange thing how it should be otherwise than it is with us the poor commonalty when the gentry our pattern and the clergy our teachers are as immoral as we and then to consider the coherence of the thing the parson preaches a thundering sermon against drunkenness and the justice of peace sets my poor neighbor in the stocks and i am like to be much the better for either when i know perhaps that this same parson and this same justice were both drunk together the night before  it may be true for ought we know that a wicked parson may make a good sermon and the spanish proverb may be true of the soul as well as the body if the cure be but wrought let the devil be the doctor but this does not take with the downright ignorant people in the country a poor man gets drunk in a country ale house why are you not ashamed to be such a beast says a good honest neighbor to him the next day ashamed says the fellow why should i be ashamed why there was sir john  and sir robert  and the parson and they were all as drunk as i and why a beast pray i heard sir robert  say that he that drinks least drinks most like a beast   a vicious parson that preaches well but lives ill may be like an unskilful horseman who opens a gate on the wrong side and lets other folks through but shuts himself out this may be possible but it seems most reasonable to think they are a means by that sort of living to hinder both themselves and others and would the gentry and clergy of england but look back on the guilt that really lies on them as gentlemen by whose example so great a part of mankind has been led into and encouraged in the progress of vice they would find matter of very serious reflection  this article of the clergy may seem to lie in the power of their superiors to rectify and therefore may be something more feasible than the other but the gentry are sui juris can no way be reduced but by their own voluntary practice we are in england exceedingly governed by modes and customs the gentry may effectually suppress vice would they but put it out of fashion but to suppress it by force seems impossible  the application of this rough doctrine is in short both to the gentry and clergy physicians heal your selves if you leave off your drunkenness and lewdness first if we do not follow you then set us in the stocks and send us to the house of correction and punish us as you please if you will leave off whoring first then brand us in the foreheads or transport or hang us for fornication or adultery and you are welcome but to preach against drunkenness immediately after an evenings debauch to correct a poor fellow for swearing with the very vice in your mouths these are the unjustest ways in the world and have in themselves no manner of tendency toward the reformation of manners which is the true design of the law  it is acknowledged there are in england a great many sober pious religious persons both among the gentry and clergy and it is hoped such cannot think themselves libelled or injured in this plea if there were not laws would never have been made against those vices for no men make laws to punish themselves it is designed to reflect upon none but such as are guilty and on them no farther than to put them in mind how much the nation owes its present degeneracy to their folly and how much it is in their power to reform it again by their example that the king may not publish proclamations nor the parliament make laws to no purpose but that we might live in england once more like christians and like gentlemen to the glory of god and the honor of the present king and parliament who so publicly have attemped the great work of reformation among us though hitherto to so little purpose  an enquiry into the occasional conformity of dissenters in cases of preferment preface to mr how sir these sheets are addressed to you because the author with submission thinks they something more nearly concern you than ordinary   as you are not unjustly esteemed one of the most learned and judicious of the dissenting ministry and   as you have more immediate relation to our present lord mayor who is or has been a member of the church of christ under your charge   the author has carefully avoided personal reflections and hopes he has no where exceeded the rules of charity or good manners  the treatise is individually the same which the author published in the mayoralty of sir humphry edwin the address by way of preface being only left out  the debate was then young and the practice of this scandalous conformity was new sir john shorter being the first instance of it but it is now growing a received custom to the great scandal of the dissenters in general the offense of such whose consciences forbid them the same latitude and the stumbling of those who being before weak and irresolute are led aside by the eminency and frequency of examples  sir if you knew the author you would easily be satisfied that the reason of this preface is not that he covets to engage in controversy with a person of your capacity and learning being altogether unfit for such a task and no way a match to your talent that way  but he desires in the name of himself and a great many honest good christians who would be glad to see this case decided that you will by your self or some other hand as you please declare to the world whether this practice of alternate communion be allowed either by your congregation in particular on the dissenters in general  and if not so allowed then he conjures you by the honor you owe to your profession and the tenderness you have for the weakness of others by the regard you have to gods honor and the church you serve that such proceedings may receive their due censure tho the persons wear the gay clothes and the gold ring that the sincerity and purity of dissenting protestants may be vindicated to the world both in their discipline as well as doctrine and that without respect of persons  if on the other hand it be allowed it is desired it may be defended by such arguments as you think convenient which the author promises if desired never to reply to or if you give him that liberty shall do it so as you shall easily see is in order only to be informed and always suitable to the respect which is due to your person for whom none has a greater esteem  if none of these requests shall be granted the world must believe that dissenters do allow themselves to practice what they cannot defend  your very humble servant d f  a discourse upon occasional conformity when i review the past times and look back upon the various scenes which they present us as to ecclesiastical transactions within this kingdom there seems nothing more strange than the turns we have had from popish to regal supremacy from the romish religion to reformed from reformed back again to romish and then to reformed again and so on through several degrees of reformation and back again from those degrees to the first steps of reformation and then forward again  king henry the  th a prince of a haughty spirit disdaining the insolence with which his predecessors were treated by the popes gave the first shock to the roman power in these kingdoms i will not say he acted from any principles of conscience whatever his ambition and interest led him to pretend but that was the gloss as it is in most cases of public revolutions however it was having satisfied his pride by subduing the suppremacy of the pope and establishing his own his interest next guided him to the suppression of abbeys and monastries the horrible vices which were protected as well as practiced in those nests of superstition giving his pretense of piety the larger scope and i will for once be so free with the character of that prince as to suppose what to me seems plain that neither this religion or that were of much moment in his thoughts but his interest as the sequel made plain by the seizure he made of the revenues of the church  and yet the justice of providence seems very conspicuous in that point that those houses who under the specious pretenses of religion and extraordinary devotion had amassed to themselves vast revenues to the impoverishing many families and in the mean time secretly practiced most unheard of wickedness should under the same pretense of zeal and piety be suppressed and impoverished by a person who merely to serve his own glory triumphed over them pretending jehu like to show his zeal for the lord  some do assure us that the eyes of this pince were really opened as to the point of religion and that had he lived longer he would most effectually have established the reformation in his time but god who gave him that light if he had it however he might accept his intention as he did that of davids building his house yet he reserved the glory of the performance to his son  king edward the  th of whom wondrous things are spoken in all our english writers and more than we need suppose should be literally true yet was without doubt a prince of the strictest piety not only that ever reigned but that ever lived perhaps since the days of josidh whose parallel our writers say he was  the reformation began in his hand not but that the protestant religion had been received in england many years before by the preaching of john wickliff william tindall and others and had many professors and those such who gallantly offered their lives in defense of the truth  but it got but little ground for religion has but few votaries while all its professors must also be confessors and while exile or martyrdom is all the prospect of advantage to be got by it  none will dare to be dissenters in times of danger but such whose consciences are so awakened that they dare not be otherwise  but in the hands of this young prince the great work was begun and in a shorter time than could be imagined was finished and established the romanists fled or conformed for we find but very few had an inclination to martyrdom if it had been put upon them some indeed to show the nature of their religion pleaded for baal and rebelled stirring up the ignorant people to murder their gideon for throwing down the altars of baal but like the ephramites of old their shiboleth was their undoing  god who thought fit to discover the levity of those who had only conformed and not reformed who in exemplum regis had took up this as they would have done any religion and also for the trial and glory of his church suffered all this great fabric however of his own working to be overthrown at the death this good king and a deluge of cruelty and popery overwhelmed the people in the reign of the queen his sister  but popery found more dissenters than the reformation had done and the impression religion had made on the minds of those who had sincerely embraced it was not so easily defaced as the pretended reformation of others for the glosses men had put on their actions only as a cover from common observation was soon discovered when the safety of owning their old principles rendered those outsides no longer needful but where the true religion had got footing in the mind it was still the same whatever alterations of times might meke it dangerous and yet all people did not burn but some being persecuted in one city fled to another and germany especially was a sanctuary for the distressed english protestants that country having been before hand with us in the reformation  twas here that our exiled clergy having conversed with the learned reformers abroad and particularly with john calvin found that though they were reformed indeed from the gross errors of popery and superstition there was yet several things which might be further and further reformed and being willing to arrive to the greatest perfection they were capable of in religion that as near as possible they might pursue the great example of christ jesus whose name they professed and for whom they could most gloriously die they corrected in themselves those things which they saw needful and by letters to their brethren in england communicated their opinions with their reasons exhorting them to go on unto perfection as they had begun  some of the most zealous for piety and holiness of life rejected this motion and others as zealous and pious closed with it and the disputes were carried so far sometimes as to invade the charity of one another an humble acknowledgment of which you have in a most christian reconciling letter from bishop ridley to bishop hooper two of the most glorious triumphant martyrs that ever confessed the truth of christ at the stake  for the present the fire of the persecution as the greater light obscures the less extinguished that of dissension but when queen elizabeth rescued the protestant religion and the church enjoyed its peace again the debate revived but the first establishment of king edward obtained so on the minds of men that the further reformation was rejected the other party being not at all convinced though overruled submitted their persons to the laws but not their opinion affirming that twas the duty of every christian to endeavor to serve god with the greatest purity of worship as was possible and that this was the purest worship which came nearest to the divine institution which they believed the established liturgy did not and therefore in conscience they must be dissenters  it must be owned that the original authors of these disputes were learned devout and singularly pious strict in conversation to excess if that be possible and from thence in a sort of happy derision were called puritans of whom i shall say nothing but leave for a record the last speech of a famous foreigner who had seen the way of living among those dissenters and speaking of the words of balaam let me die the death of the righteous and let my latter end be like his cried out sit anima mea cum puritanis anglicanis  i shall not take upon me to observe the difference between these primitive dissenters and our present which is too plain nor to dispute the substance of the point in debate between them and the established national church  i shall only observe that the reasons for the present dissenters separation from the established church are said to be exactly the same they were then and the present dissenters are the successors of those first as the present conformists are the successors of the first reformers under king edward the sixth and queen elizabeth  i must acknowledge that it fares with the church of england and with the dissenters both as it has always fared with christs church in the whole world that while suppressed and persecuted their professors were few and their profession more severe but when a religion comes to be the mode of the country so many painted hypocrites get into the church who are not by their voices to be distinguished that guile is not to be seen till it arrive to apostasy the whole ecclesiastical history from the first century of the christian church is full of instances to confirm this that the prosperity of the church of christ has been more fatal to it than all the pesecution of its enemies  i am now brought down to the present time when the dissenting protestant is sheltered by the laws and protected from the violence which he suffered in the late reigns under the arbitrary commands of such state ministers who strove to dash the whole protestant interest to pieces by its own weight and nothing is more apparent to those who are any thing acquainted with the late management of affairs in this land than that the court used both parties alternately as policy and occasion directed to suppress and destroy one another that the whole house which being so divided could not stand might at last fall of it self  but our eyes are at last opened the name of protestant is now the common title of an englishman the church of england extends her protection to the tender consciences of her weaker brethren knowing that all may be christians though not alike informed and the dissenter extends his charity to the church of england believing that in his due time god shall reveal even this unto them if this is not i wish this were the temper of both parties and i am sure it is already the temper of some of each side which few are of the wisest most pious and most judicious  but while frailty and infirmity are essential to humanity and pride and hypocrisy are the two regnant vices of the church this good spirit cannot be universal and we do not expect it  but there is a sort of truth which all men owe to the principles they profess and generally speaking all men pay it a turk is a turk zealously and entirely an idolater is an idolater and will serve the devil to a tittle none but protestants halt between god and baal christians of an amphibious nature who have such preposterous consciences as can believe one way of worship to be right and yet serve god another way themselves this is a strange thing in israel all the histories of religion in the world do not show such a case it is like a ship with her sails haled some back and some full it is like a workman that builds with one hand and pulls down with the other it is like a fisherman who catches fish with one hand and throws them into the sea with another it is like every thing which signifies nothing to say a man can be of two religions is a contradiction unless there be two gods to worship or he has two souls to save  religion is the sacred profession of the name of god serving him believing in him expecting from him and like the god it refers to it is in one and the same object one and the same thing perfectly indivisible and inseparable there is in it no neuter gender no ambiguous article god or baal mediums are impossible  as to the different modes and ways which are the circumstantials of this sacred thing i call religion i will not say but that as ships take different courses at sea yet to the best of their skill keeping to the direct rules of navigating by the compass they may arrive at the same port so christians taking different methods in the serving this god yet going to the best of their judgments by the direct rules of the scripture may arrive at the same heaven but this is nothing at all to the case for no ship would arrive at any port that sailed two ways together if that were possible nor no man can serve one god and at the same time hold two opinions there is but one best and he that gives god two bests gives him the best and the worst and one spoils the other till both are good for nothing  i have said already that both the church of england and the dissenter suffer in their reputation for the mixed multitudes of their members which is occasioned by their present prosperity if a third party were to tyrannize over them both we should see then who were professors and who were confessors but now it cannot be wherefore i think twere well to put both sides in mind of one thing which they are bound mutually to observe and that is that the personal miscarriages of any particular person or member is not really any reflection upon the religion they profess nor ought not to be so accounted unless it be where such miscarriages are the direct dictates of the doctrines they teach and thus i would be understood in the present case wherefore i shall give my essay as to what i understand a real dissenting protestant is or ought to be  he who dissents from an established church on any account but from a real principle of conscience is a politic not a religious dissenter to explain my self he who dissents from any other reasons but such as these that he firmly believes the said established church is not of the purest institution but that he can really serve god more agreeable to his will and that accordingly it is his duty to do it so and no otherwise nay he that cannot dye or at least desire to do so rather than conform ought to conform schism from the church of christ is doubtless a great sin and if i can avoid it i ought to avoid it but if not the cause of that sin carries the guilt with it  but if i shall thus dissent and yet at the same time conform by conforming i deny my dissent being lawful or by my dissenting i damn my conforming as sinful  nothing can be lawful and unlawful at the same time if it be not lawful for me to dissent i ought to conform but if it be unlawful for me to conform i must dissent several opinions may at the same time consist in a country in a city in a family but not in one entire person that is impossible  to come to the point there are dissenters who are separated from the church of england and joined in communion with dissenting churches or congregations they have appeared zealous conscientious and constant have born the reproaches and inconveniences of their party nay suffered persecution and loss of estates and liberty for the cause and who could have so little charity as to doubt the sincerity of their profession and yet these persecuted suffering dissenters to make themselves room in the public advancements and glittering gaudy honors of the age shall conform to that which they refused under all those disadvantages to do before and which is worse than all this hear o heavens as soon as the present honor is attained the present advantage made they return to the former circumstances again and are freely received a double crime as having done no evil  i know not i profess what these persons can say for themselves and therefore cannot pretend to answer their objections but i cannot omit one answer which some people give for them viz that this is no conformity in point of religion but done as a civil action in obedience to the laws of the land which have made it a necessary characteristick quality for admittance into public employments which they think it their duty to accept in order to serve their country which they doubly perform by executing those offices to the public interest and by excluding those who would otherwise get into those places and betray their country and their liberties  i have never met with any considerable excuse made for this fast and loose game of religion but this and this i desire to consider a little particularly    that this is no conformity in point of religion but done as a civil action how this can be possible remains to be determined it is true the morality of an action consists in its end but i cannot conceive that an action purely and originally religious such as the solemn ordinances of gods worship can be made civil actions by any end design will or intention of man whatsoever it is true an oath which is a calling god to witness is an action both civil and religious but still that was appointed and instituted to that end as is expressly noted heb naamans bowing in the house of rimmon to which the prophet answered go in peace which is understood as a permission is a thing still different for naaman only bowed for the convenience or state of the king at the same time publicly disowning the worship as interpreters are of opinion besides bowing the head though it may be a customary act of worship at that place yet is no act confined to worship only and instituted and directed so by the god who is worshipped but is an act used in common salutations thus we kneel to god and to the king but sacraments are things appropriated by the divine institution of god himself as things which have no other signification or import but what is divine had naaman desired to be excused in offering sacrifices to the idol rimmon the prophet would hardly have bid him go in peace some actions are not civil or religious as they are civilly or religiously performed but as they are civil or religious in themselves for some religious actions are so entirely such that they cannot without a horrid invasion of the sovereignty of the institutor be appropriated to any other use and such are in especial manner the two sacraments instituted by christ such was before christ the sacrifices by fire and the judgments of god on nadab and ahihu for attempting to offer sacrifice with strange fire stands as a terrible instance of what we ought to think is the will of god in this matter  further speaking directly of the sacraments are they not the same thing though differently administered in the established church or in a dissenting church and how can you take it as a civil act in one place and a religious act in another this is playingbopeep with god almighty and no man can tell of them when they are about a civil action and when about a religious but to answer this pretense at once sacraments as sacraments are religious acts and can be no other if you do not take it as a sacrament the case differs but how can you say you do not take it as a sacrament an oath is to be taken in the sense of the imposer and a sacrament which is a recognition of the most sacred of oaths must be also taken in the sense of the imposer if the person administering declared at the administration he did not give it as a sacrament but only give you a bit of bread and draught of wine as a friend or the like this was something but can a minister deliver the bread to you and say the body of our lord jesus christ etc and you kneeling with reverence take it as such and repeat the responses at the communion and say amen to the prayer and say it is a civil action this is such bantering with religion as no modest christian can think of without horror    another part of the apology is that without it they cannot be admitted into public places of trust and if they were not admitted such will get in as will betray their country and liberties and they do it purely to secure their country which they think their duty  these are patriots indeed that will damn their souls to save their country a sort of a public spirit hardly to be found in the world and indeed a nonentity in it self for it is a mistake the gentlemen who make this answer put the case wrong for i would desire such to answer a few questions ear  if the service of their country be so de to them pray why should they not choose to expo their bodies and estates for that service rather than their souls  the penalty of the law in accepting the public employments is wholly pecuniary the difference lies here they choose the trespassing on their consciences before the hazard of their estates as the least evil for it is plain any man who will suffer the penalty or run the risque of it which is all one may excuse the conformity for the lord does not say you shall so and so conform but if you do not conform you shall incur such and such penalties any man that will incur the penalty may commit the trespass  so that all this compliance is not to be admitted to places that they may be able to serve their country but to save the five hundred pounds and other penalties of that act    why if we believe the power of god to be omnipotent should we imagine that he is not able to protect our country and liberties without our perpetrating so wicked an act to secure them as doing evil that good may come which is expressly forbidden  but we are told again this is in it self no sinful act and therefore it is not doing evil this is tacitly answered before though it is not a sinful act in it self yet it is either a sinful act in a dissenter or else his dissenting before was a sinful act for if he is satisfied he does well in conforming now why did he not before there is but one answer for that which is he is otherwise convinced to which i reply if that were true he would then as a convert continue in this new communion but it is evident the same persons return immediately to the former profession as dissenters and they can have no such excuse unless it be that they were convinced and reconvincd and then convinced again  some have the folly to argue against the law it self as a most notorious imposition upon the consciences of man by making the sacred institutions of christ a drudge to secular interest and a cause of mens sins by leading them into tempation i could say enough to vindicate that part tho i am no more reconciled to that law than other men but it is remote to our argumnet it is an act of parliament and what is so is of every mans own doing and therefore it is just every one should comply with the terms or suffer the penalty but here is no penalty if no crime if no preferments are sought no honors accepted there is no crime if self denial was as practicable as self advancement here is no need of the crime so that they who do this seek the crime that is the first sin then morgage their consciences to avoid the penalty and so add one sin to another but we are told by some it is not against their consciences they hope both parties are good christians there are differences between them which they dont understand nor meddle with and their consciences are very well satisfied to communicate with either  i would ask such if their consciences would serve to communicate with the church why did they separate for communicating with the dissenter is not an occasional or casual thing but an open declared breaking off from the church established now no man can be said to separate from and join to a thing at the same time if your conscience is satisfied in joining it cannot be satisfied in separating unless you can suppose your conscience to be satisfied and dissatisfied both together if you have a conscience of any religion at all it must be of some religion or other if of this it cannot be of that if of sent and approve are different acts and can never be fixed upon the same object at the same time as for a man passively religious that can communicate any where that man may from the same principle and with far less guilt communicate no where for such a man in downright english has prostituted the little religion he had if ever he had any to his interest and may be turk jew papist or any thing  the latter part of the charge leads me to consider another point which relates to the assemblies of the dissenters who admit and by consequence approve this way of proceeding i do not pretend to examine by what methods such particular churches do procced and i would be as tender as possible in making reflections i wish they would be as charitable in censuring this reproof  i do think with submission it is impossible to prove that any person whose case the foregoing paragraph reaches can be received again into church communion in a dissenting assembly upon any other terms than as a penitent i have heard of some who have been said to have leave from their ministers for this matter if so they have assumed some dispensing authority which i believe does not appertain to the ministerial function nor is not contained in the mission of our savior but i do not affirm that any such thing has been really allowed  as to the relation of churches and the members thereof one to another as the dissenters now established them i am sure the allowance of any member in a promiscuous communion with the church of england and the dissenter at the same time is not pretended to be allowed nor is it consistent with it self it is preposterous and excentrick and is destructive of the very foundation of the dissenters principles as is already noted concerning schisms in the church in this case charity can heal nothing nor help nothing it is of absolute necessity that one man be but of one side at one and the same time either the conformist will mar the dissenter or the dissenter will mar the conformist for if i shall be admitted into the communion of the dissenter and of the church together then the dissenter must have some other reason for being a dissenter than purity of worship  methinks men should seem what they are if a man dissent from the church let him do so and his principle being well grounded for such dissent let him hold it if not wellgrounded let him leave it if he cannot suffer one way let him suffer another and why should we not be as honest to god as our country  the motives to serve our country are strong but there are ways to do it without such a violation of all our principles and profession if not trust gods providence with the issue who never wants agents to preserve and deliver his people when his time is at hand and you can have small hope to expect that the office and trust you shall execute shall receive any assistance from his providence when the first step into it is made by offering the greatest affront to his honor and committing the vilest act of perfidy in the world  but if the gay prospect of a great place tempt any person beyond the power that gods grace is pleased to assist them with in that way let him abide and not be readmitted because of his gold ring and fine apparel without a penitent acknowledgement the dissenters in england can never pretend to be dissenters upon the mere principle of purity of worship as i have related in the beginning of this discourse if such shall be received as blameless into their communion who have deserted them upon the occasion of preferment and have made the sacred institutions of christ jesus become pimps to their secular interest and then wipe their mouths and sit down in the church and say they have done no evil  it is also an intolerable affront to the church of england reflecting upon its doctrine as well as practice to make use of the church for a cover to fence them against the laws at the same time continuing to disown its communion as a thing not fit to be continued in  and yet the church of england is in the right to receive such of the dissenters as shall come to them without the ceremony of recognition because it is agreeable to the notion of a national church which they profess to be but dissenters are bound to justify their separation from them or else their whole constitution falls to the ground now how a separation and a conformity are consistent is to me an inexplicable riddle  i question not here the lawfulness of the dissenters separation it is not the business of this discourse to define it and i am as careful as i can in making reflections upon either but i am bold to affirm that no dissenting church can with lawful cause separate from the church of england establish private churches or communions and at the same times allow the members to conform to the established church too this is incongruous and one must destroy the other from whence i think it becomes the dissenters if they would maintain the doctrine they teach if they would have us believe they dissent purely on the honest principles of conscience and purity of worship with such a one no not to eat and it is not sufficient that the offender a lord mayor or any greater person unless he would be lord mayor without a breach of the sacred relation he had entered into he should be dealt with in that case as the meanest member of such a society  on the other hand if a man be called upon to be a magistrate and has courage enough to follow the impartial dictates of his conscience a query lies before him what shall he do  the case is plain either refuse the honor or run the risque the first indeed is the plainest and easiest way and the ground of it is good for he whose concience dictates to him that the terms are sinful may refuse the call for preferments and honors are a bait that some have refused on mere points of speculative philosophy and it is hard christianity should not carry a man as far well but perhaps a man has a mind to be a sheriff or a lord mayor and is a dissenter or perhaps he really thinks it is his indispensable duty to serve his country if he is called to that or the like office or perhaps he thinks it is a duty he owes his family to advance his children and the like and he is a professed dissenter what shall he do let him boldly run the risque or openly and honestly conform to the church and neither be ashamed of his honor nor of his profession such a man all men will value and god will own he need not fear carrying the sword to a conventicle or bringing the conventicle to his own house but to make the matter a game to dodge religions and go in the morning to church and in the afternoon to the meeting to communicate in private with the church of england to save a penalty and then go back to the dissenters and communicate again there this is such a retrograde devotion that i can see no color of pretense for in all the sacred book  i have heard indeed that some who are ministers of dissenting churches do or did at the same time communicate with the church of england i do not dispute how far a minister may conform as a layman though he cannot as a clergyman but how any dissenting minister can conform as a layman and at the same time execute a pastoral charge over a congregation whom he teaches to separate from the church in a laycommunion i cannot imagine  it is not as i have already noted conformity or nonconformity at the same time in one and the same person that is the point and doing this for a secular end to save a penalty and privately and then as being ashamed of it to go back and sit down as not having done it at all and a churchsociety admitting this without taking notice of it these are the contradictions i must upon and rather wish than expect to see rectified  an enquiry into occasional conformity showing that the dissenters are no way concerned in it he that opposes his own judgment against the current of the times ought to be backed with unanswerable truths and he that has that truth on his side is a fool as well as a coward if he is afraid to own it because of the currency or multitude of other mens opinions  it is hard for a man to say all the world is mistaken but himself but if it be so who can help it  but since it is not likely a single vote should prevail upon espoused errors in an age when every one is so fond of themselves he that starts truth by himself must expect the world will stand still and look on till they see the issue  the act depending in the house of commons about occasional conformity has set abundance of heads to work in the world and be the house in the right or in the wrong i know my own business and their temper too well to meddle with it but i pretend to say that all men i have met with who have meddled with the argument either in print or otherwise are manifestly mistaken  with more humility therefore than i owe to any man i ask leave not to be censured till i am heard and those who call me arrogant before reprove me with more arrogance than is their share among their fellow creatures  but since i who was altogether born in sin have undertaken to teach my superiors i desire to explain my self before they cast me out of the synagogue  for as that blind man thought twas a mavelous thing they should not know whence he came that had opened his eyes  so to me it is every jot as wonderful to find no body of my mind and yet be positively assured that i am in the right  the subject i am upon needs no introduction the history is in every mans knowledge the parliament are upon a bill to prevent occasional conformity and about that bill the press swarms with pamphlets the pulpit sounds with exaltations on one hand and deprecations on the other every one speak their opinions some their hopes some their fears and so it should have been to the end of the chapter if i could have found but one middle sort that free from prejudice of parties could have discerned the native state of the case as it really is discovered from the passions and follies of men  about their act of parliament i affirm most of the people i have met with are mistaken and that i may be as explicit as i can i shall enquire more particularly who are mistaken how and then i doubt not the sequel of this paper shall make it appear that the fact is true  first all those people who designed the act as a blow to the dissenting interest in england are mistaken  secondly all those who take it as a prelude or introduction to the further suppressing of the dissenters and a step to repealing the toleration or intend it as such are mistaken  thirdly all those who think the dissenters at all concerned in it or have designed to mortify them by it are mistaken  fourthly all those hotspurs of divinity who prophecy destruction from the pulpit and from this step pretend to foretell that the time of plundring their brethren is at hand are mistaken  fifthly all those phlegmatic dissenters who fancy themselves undone and that persecution and desolation is at the door again are mistaken  sixthly all those dissenters who are really at all disturbed at it either as an advantage gained by their enemies or as a real disaster upon themselves are mistaken  seventhly all those dissenters who deprecate it as a judgment or would vote against it if it were in their power are mistaken  eighthly that all those who begun or promoted this bill with a design to ruin weaken and destroy the interest or body of the dissenters in england are mistaken  not that i hereby suppose the parliament or the persons originally concerned in moving this bill did it in mere kindness to the dissenters in order to refine and purge them from the scandals which some people had brought upon them that twas an action of christian charity to the dissenters to prevent and detect frauds and hypocrisy in religion and to clear their reputation  i never yet saw or read of a division of parties in any nation but the hot heads of both parties were always for enflaming the reckoning if the hot men of the dissenters have done any mischief i am sorry for it but let us examine a little what other hot men would be now a doing  no sooner was queen ann settled upon the throne of england and had declared that the church of england should be the men of her favor as being the church she had been educated in and ever constant to but these hot men fly out upon their brethren with all the excesses of their furious temper  nothing would serve them but this queen and parliament must root and branch blast the dissenters with their breath blow up their interest in the nation and we should be all one church and one people of a sudden twas to be done with a blow all at once and so certainly that no possible doubt could be made of it  but her majesty was pleased to let these people know from her own mouth that for as much as concerned her they were mistaken in that upon the address of the dissenters to her she gave them her royal word for her protection and whenever she breaks it we shall all be mistaken  upon this the pulpit that drum ecclesiastic began the war and mr sachavrell in his sermon at oxford dooms all the dissenters to destruction without either bell book or candle not regarding common decency not respecting his good manners to the queen nor his deference to the parliament but tells them it is their duty if they will be true members of the church of england to lift up a standard against the phanaticks and the like as much as to say madam whatever your majesty has promised you must break your word and gentlemen of the house of commons we will have you do it  now all these gentlemen have lived to see themselves mistaken and if they retain any expectations of seeing it fulfilled they must exercise their faith upon it as a thing in futuro and believe that some time or other her majesty will break her word but as yet there is no great probability for hitherto we have seen we are all mistaken  but to revive their expectations comes a bill into the house for preventing occasional conformity this has been matter of great triumph to some gentlemen who upon this act revive their common discourse and are pleased to treat the dissenters in this manner well gentlemen now down you go the parliament are a beginning with you and they dont use to do business by halves they have taken the insulted church into consideration they will reduce you and this is the first step you shall soon see some more on it we have got a church parliament now and down ye go this bill will effectually ruin your interest and bring all your great men off from you  this brings us close to the point and it is no small matter for any one to show these gentlemen how they are mistaken  first it is time for these gentlemen to tell us what the parliament will do when they either know it or the house has declared their intentions and till they have it is a presumption some houses would have taken notice of for any people to pretend to lead them to their business and therefore when they tell us this is a taste of the rest they are preparing for us i must say either they are too well acquainted with the mind of the house or they are all mistaken and as to the blow this bill is to the dissenters interest in england  as far as i may be allowed to give my judgment and as the nature of the thing seems to speak its self it is plain this bill is no damage at all to the dissenters in england and we hope the house did not intend it as such  i cannot imagine that so great a spirit of enmity and contempt can be entertained in the breast of a nation against their neighbors their brethren people born in the same climate submitting to the same government professing the same god and in most fundamental points of religion agreeing people linked together in the same common interest by intermarriages continually mixed in relation concerned in the same trade making war with the same enemies and allied with the same friends were it not that these people called dissenters are represented to them under some strange and untrue character or that under the name of dissenter some ill persons are shrouded and disguised who deserve to be thus treated  wherefore in order to set the dissenters right in the eyes of their brethren and that they may have common justice at least if they can have nothing of courtesy that peace may be where there is no occasion for war and quietness and good manners preserved twill be needful to set the matter in a true light and examine who this dissenter is what the people dissenters are and what they have done for which they are treated after so infamous a manner by scurrilous preachers and scandalous pamphleteers and other ignorant people not a few  the dissenter is an englishman that being something desirous of going to heaven having heard his church of england father and schoolmaster and the minister of the parish talk much of it begins seriously to enquire about the way thither and to that purpose consulting his bible and his conscience he finds that in his opinion there are some things in the established way of worship which do not seem to correspond with the rule he has found out in the scripture  now i shall not examine here whether the man thus scrupulous be in the right or whether the church be in the right it does not at all belong to the case in hand  but the man being fully convinced that he ought to worship god in that way exclusive of all others which is most agreeable to the will of god revealed in the scripture and being on mature consideration also and after sincere endeavors to be otherwise satisfied fully convinced that this established way is not so near to that rule as it ought to be ventures the displeasure of the civil magistrate in dissenting in pure obedience to the commands of his conscience and of that rule which bids him obey god rather than man firmly believing that it is his duty so to do and that the compass and extent of humane laws do not reach to bind him in matters of conscience at the same time living in charity with all the rest of the world whose consciences do not require the same restriction and peaceably submitting to the laws and government he lives under as far as either his right as an englishman or his duty as a christian can require  this is the english protestant dissenter which i have been speaking of and concerning whom i have ventured to say so many men so much wiser than i are mistaken  if there are crept into his company state dissenters politic dissenters or any that give no reason or other or less reasons for their dissenting than these they are not of them and we wish they would go out from them  i see no act of parliament a making to the prejudice of this dissenter and let hot men preach print and say what they please it is impossible it should ever enter into the breast of an english protestant parliament or an english protestant queen either to oppress or suppress such a dissenter  it is for the protection of this honest wellmeaning dissenter that in the late reign the king and parliament finding their number great thought it was meet for the quiet of the nation and as an acknowledgement of the superiority of conscience to all humane laws to settle their liberty in an act of parliament the same undisputed authority on which all our civil as well as religious rights are established  this is the dissenter to which her majesty has promised her protection and this act of parliament is the toleration to tender consciences for which her majesty openly declared her self even to the hazard of her royal person  these are the dissenters who never gave her majesty any reason to believe they did not merit her protection and i firmly believe never will  from these the church of england has nothing to fear unless their exemplary lives and unquestioned piety should prevail to weaken her numbers and we heartily wish all the strife were reduced to this viz who should live best and who should preach best  if there are among them vicious youths or grown hypocrites if there are crept in errors heresies and enthusiasts are not the same among the church if there are among these dissenters quakers antinomians sweetsingers muggletonians and the like the church has also her socinians deists antitrinitarians scepticks asgilites and the like there can be no advantage pleaded against heresy and damnable heterodox opinions from one side more than another  if we regard the matters of state the dissenters and the church of england have small advantage of the argument one against another and i may without arrogance challenge the hot churchmen who can treat them with nothing but the odious name of disturbers of the peace enemies of monarchy and authors of confusion to bring the loyalty of the church of england so much boasted of in the world to the test with the loyalty of the dissenter new test of the church of englands loyalty p and as it has lately been done to my hand it is easy to prove that the dissenter has been equally loyal to princes equally true to the government and constitution of england as the church and the church has been equally disloyal and has as often resisted and took arms against the lawful established power and prince as the dissenter and let them enter into this dispute whenever they please  but what is all this to the present case what we do as englishmen is one thing and what we do as christians and dissenters is another  it is also foreign to our purpose to examine or reply to dr stubbs or the multitude of pamphleteers who place themselves at the forelorn hope of the church and begin the war in hopes of drawing on that whole body to an engagement when they can make it out that the dissenter and the church are as far asunder in religion as god and baal i may possibly think they merit what they so much covet viz to be replied to  whole reams of paper are spoiled since that to prove that this act of parliament is needful because it is fit the church should be established to which i answer with a question asked once with much less reason in another case what need all this waste  gentlemen establish your church with all the precaution you can build a fence of impregnable laws about it you are welcome we never did nor we do not now disturb you leave but us your poor brethren liberty to serve god according to our consciences dont bind us to do as you can do whether we can or no take your places and pensions and profits and deserve them of the nation if you can we ask nothing but our right and what is now become so by law if you claim the civil power as yo own you consequently take us into your protection and let us see how generous you will be  as to those among us who can conform to yo church for a place for a salary you are also welcome to take them among you and let them be a pa of your selves all the converts you can make by the mammon of unrighteousness are your own all yo can buy off or bribe off or fright off let em go w readily grant that whoever among us can with satifaction to his conscience conform ought to confor and we heartily wish you would make some smal steps by way of condescension to your brethren such as might open a door for us all to conform t you and then you should dissent from principles o obstinacy and ill nature or from a mere necessity of conscience you should then see whether the dissenters in england were schismatics by nature and heterdox by inclination or whether their objectio are grounded upon scripture and their dissenting from you an act of an enlightened conscience yo would then try the spirits whether they be of god  but since you are of the opinion that you are capable of no amendment that you cannot reform farther and therefore will not condescend one step though twould bring over half a million of souls to you an eminent instance of the charity of your church all we have to say in the case is let us have the protection of the government and the liberty the laws allow us and we are content  upon this score it is that we say the act against occasional conformity does not concern us they who can conform for one reason may conform without two and ought to conform and we are therefore content to be distinguished who cannot conform at all and if we might offer so boldly to you who have any interest in the house of commons we would humbly propose to have the title of the act altered and to have it entitled an act for the better uniting the protestant dissenters by preventing occasional conformity to the church of england and when that is done let it pass with all our hearts and though we can easily see what the design is viz that no dissenter shall be employed in place of trust or profit in the government yet since it must be so we hope gentlemen you will be content to take all the miscarriages of the government on you too we shall acquiesce let us alone in our religion let us worship god as we believe he has directed us and all the rest is your own  but before we part let us have leave to remind you that although you are willing to quit all our civil right to the honors as well as the advantages of serving our country when we are chosen to it by a fair majority rather than not enjoy our religion and he profession we make with peace and liberty yet t is no less an oppression upon us and the hardships re such as can never be defended by reason or equiy  we would be glad we had no cause to think our selves injured and to such of the church of england who can judge without prejudice we would appeal whether it is not very hard  first that the dissenter shall be excluded from all places of profit trust and honor and at the same time shall not be excused from those which are attended with charge trouble and loss of his time  secondly that a dissenter shall be pressed as a sailor to fight at sea listed as a soldier to fight on shore and let his merit be never so much above his fellows shall never be capable of preferment no not a lieutenant at sea or so much as a halbert in the army  thirdly that we must maintain our own clergy and your clergy our own poor and your poor pay equal taxes and equal duties and not be thought worthy to be trusted to set a drunkard in the stocks  we wonder gentlemen you will accept our money on your deficient funds our stocks to help carry on your wars our loans and credits to your victualling office and navy office  if you would go on to distinguish us get a law made we shall buy no lands that we may not be freeholders and see if you could find money to buy us out  transplant us into towns and bodies and let us trade by our selves let us card spin knit and work with and for one another and see how you will maintain your own poor without us  let us freight our ships apart keep our money out of your bank accept none of our bills and separate your selves as absolutely from us in civil matters as we do from you in religious and see how you can go on without us  if you are not willing to do this but we must live among you trade work receive and pay together why may we not do it in peace with love and unity without daily reproach if we have any knaves among us take them if we have any hypocrites any who can conform and do not we are free to part with them that the remainder may be all such as agree with the character here given and when you have garbld us to your hearts desire and ours you need never fear your church as to her politic interest in the world pray then let us be quiet  what have we to do with your distinctions of whig and tory no farther that i know of than this that when distinct from our religious concerns we come to talk of our liberties properties and english privileges we are not for having them destroyed by absolute authority dispensing power and the like and if this be to be whigs ye are whigs  as to kings and rulers we are of the opinion that when they degenerate into tyrants oppress their people destroy the laws with all the et caeteras of arbitrary power it is lawful for the injured people to reduce them to reason and to seek protection and powerful help from any body to assist them to recover their undoubted rights and liberties if this be to be traitors why then gentlemen of the church of england hold up your hands how say you are you guilty or not guilty  as to oaths with which gentlemen ye were the men that loaded your allegiance farther than you had any occasion we are of the opinion that they can bind the subject no longer than the sovereign continues the protection of the executive power and that the late king by his deserting the throne absolved all his subjects from the bond of their allegiance and on this foot we made no scruple to swear to the government as it now stands on the foot of the late revolution and if you have sworn with us and yet do not believe so you may get off of the perjury if you can  and what need is there now of running down the dissenters with a full cry as if this act a coming out was a machine to blow them all up we see no harm in it at all other than the hardships we mentioned before most of which we suffered before and are like only to have them the faster entailed on our posterity  all those gentlemen therefore who think this act will weaken the dissenters or wish it would are manifestly mistaken it may distinguish them better and i am persuaded will fortify them in their honest profession twill teach them that if they will hold fast the truth they must learn to live like people under the power of those who hate them and despitefully use them  the dissenters too are strangely mistaken in their apprehensions of the ill consequences of this act  to such i would say i cannot imagine what they have to fear from it or why they should be uneasy with the honor they are also rid of the encumbrance of being mayors aldermen jurats and sheriffs of the towns and corporations and let them but reflect what was the gain that all the dissenters in england have made by places and pensions from the government since the late revolution i am persuaded twill not all amount to the sum that one churchman will be found to have cheated the nation of  the church are willing to engross all the knaves to themselves and let them do it and welcome though they get all the money into the bargain if they would but come to a fair account with us now and repay all the dissenters money the nation has been cheated of by church knaves i dare undertake the dissenters shall repay all that can be charged on their knaves out of the balance  the foundation of the dissenters safety is lodged by gods especial providence in the queens veracity while her majesty esteems her word sacred as she has assured us she will we have no occasion to be concerned at all  the safety of the dissenters consist in their own honesty and integrity while they do nothing to offend either her majesty or the laws if it were possible to have a parliament of church bigots or of pulpit sachaverells there will be no fear of their liberty  as to the present act i doubt not but they will live to see cause to be thankful for the making it when the miscarriages of all people in public offices and employments are so eminently fixed upon a party and so openly and fairly taken off from them  they are mistaken too in the sense of the present parliament and they may be assured had not their enemies seen that an english protestant parliament as this is is not to be prevailed upon to overthrow so substantial a part of the nations liberty as is settled in the act of toleration they had not rested so long but before now had attempted it  they have tried it in the pulpit scattered it in scandalous pamphlets from the press affirmed that toleration is destructive of the churches as well as the nations safety they have endeavored by calumny and reproach to blacken the dissenters with crimes never committed and which they would never own before are at last come to represent them as a formidable party  and yet all this could never bring so much as one member of the house to be so blind to his countries interest as to make a motion against the act of toleration  being thus disappointed and willing to play at small game rather than stand out they fly to the sanctuary of this bill and feign themselves gratified by it more than ever the bill or the house it self intended for in all their arguments for the bill it is supposed to be a means to reduce humble and mortify the dissenters ridiculus mus is this all why really gentlemen had it been in our power you should have had all this without an act of parliament this will strengthen not reduce us twill please not mortify or humble us and thus you find your selves all mistaken mistaken in the house of commons themselves in thinking the representatives of a protestant nation will repeal the act of toleration upon which the tranquillity of their native country so much depends but above all mistaken in their expectation of the queen to whom their behavior is preposterous and unmannerly  twas preposterous for people to expect that because the queen was a friend to the church a constant member and always espoused the interest of the church that therefore when she came to the crown she must come up to all their extravagant heights  when her majesty was princess and a subject she constantly adhered to the interest of the church but at the same time declared her opinion for tolerating the dissenters in their liberty of protestant worship while they behaved themselves quietly and obediently under the government  when her majesty came to the crown she became the general mother the guardian the refuge of all her subjects she places the church first in her favor promises them her special and particular care as those who by judgment and inclination she stands engaged with but as she finds a great number of her people unhappily divided in opinion yet in all other respects her good subjects what can she do less than give them her protection this she has readily promised them and on this they thankfully depend  but here comes the gentlemen of the long gown and they tell her in so many words she cannot she must not keep her word with us they tell us she will halt between god and baal if she does not so declare for the church as to her best to suppress and destroy all separate worships and have all the priests of baal the best terms they can bestow on the dissenting ministers hewed to pieces before the lord  it is unmannerly that the church of englandmen should expect the queen to break her word with some of her subjects to oblige others and that whereas she has promised them her special favor they should not be content with that unless she will at the same time oppress two millions of her faithful people to oblige them  let them go on but let them be assured the dissenters shall enjoy their liberty of conscience till they can prevail with her majesty to lay aside her veracity and forget her royal word and refuse us her protection which we are resolved never to give her any reason for  as to the bill against occasional conformity it baulks their design on the dissenters for it is for their advantage they always disliked the practice it has more than once been protested against and exploded and i dare undertake not one dissenter offers to present a petition to the house against its passing  it is plain that occasional communion is contrary to the very nature and being of a dissenter who if he can conform ought to conform and if he can for a place of preferment ought to do it without that preferment  it is plain that whatever by the connivance of remiss ministers and with too much regard to parties may have been slightly passed over yet by the very constitution and foundation of a collected separate church or congregation no man can go back to the communion of the church of england and be received again upon any other condition but as a penitent it is an act destructive of all possible pretense for dissenting and never was nor never can be defended by any dissenter without overthrowing all the reasons they could ever give for dissenting  how then can this bill be aimed at the dissenters either they who think it is aimed at them are mistaken or they that point it at them are mistaken for suppressing an error crept in among them contrary to their constitution against their judgment declared by them to be a grievance can never be their injury nor ought to be their trouble  let them name us the dissenter that ever vindicated this practice one passionate author excepted let them tell us the time when any congregation received such conforming nonconformatists without dissatisfactions and discontents let them tell us a time whenever the thing was practiced till the reign of king james  it is a novelty an abuse crept in among us and we are glad to have it condemned by authority at the same time not at all thinking our selves obliged to the authors for their good will  twill be objected this is a feint to close with a thing when you cannot help it  no gentlemen we dont tell you we like that part of the bill which excludes us from the native honors and preferments of our country which are our due our birthright equally with our neighbors and to which we should be called by the suffrage of the people and we cannot but think it a hardship beyond the power of reason to justify but since this right must be clogged with so many inconveniences that we must mortgage our consciences to enjoy them no man can have any charity left for us but must presently conclude we shall freely forego such trifles for our consciences or else that we may have no consciences at all  therefore it is no feint we are so content with the suppressing the grievance of this scandalous ambodexter conformity that we think the hardships put upon us with it not worth naming we doubt not the parliament will one time or other see cause to do us justice and to restore to us the privileges of our ancestors and which we have done nothing to forfeit  but all the parliaments that ever were or will be can never suppress any thing among us so scandalous to our reputation and to that candor with which we desire to guide our actions nor so contrary to and destructive of the very nature of our separating from the church of england and the constitution of all our collected congregations  we acknowledge that if this was an allowed practice among us we could not pretend the character of a dissenter i have here given to be just but without question it is a most just character of all those dissenters who are conscientious and honest it is the original the nature of a dissenter what is crept in more is a corruption and we wish it extinguished and since none has said any thing of this nature but what has been said before and no church of englandman can think or speak worse of it than the truly religious dissenters have done we freely dismiss all those who can thus build with one hand and pull down with another to a liberty of declaring for the future who they are for  only pursuant to what has all along been acknowledged so far as we handled this argument if they would accept of the friendly advice of their brethren it should be that they would for the future conform to the church of england  for it is plain he that can conform to the church to qualify himself for preferment for employment or any such reason can conform if not he must be arrived to a degree of mastership over his conscience so as to subject it to his interest and act against light and he that can do that may do any thing and it is no matter what church he communicates with of such a man i think i trespass not upon charity to say he has all his work of religion to do over again and he also may conform till god shall give his conscience light enough to choose by and him grace to be obedient to the convictions of his own heart and whether that be to conform or dissent let him judge  but if any man who has professed himself a religious dissenter shall upon the passing this act declare himself resolved to turn to the dissenters i think no congregation of dissenters according to the nature of religious communion can receive him upon any other terms than as a penitent  if he has not sinned why should he repent says a learned author in this very case  i answer he either has sinned in conforming or he sinned in dissenting before or he sins in coming off for if he did not sin in conforming he ought to have continued there and his coming off is a plain schism but if he did sin he ought to acknowledge the sin which is what i mean by being received as a penitent  i am told after all this but upon what authority do you write thus you take upon you to write in the name of the dissenters what commission have you to write in the plural and how do we know that the dissenters disown this occasional communion  i answer publication is an appeal to the world if i have wrote what is not true or affirmed that in the name of the dissenters which is not their opinion i am liable to an easy confutation but as i have never yet had my argument refuted so though i have not received a formal commission truth is a general commission and any man may write it  and yet i am not without a general concurrence of all the dissenters i ever converst with and he that can answer the argument is welcome to make his negative as public as this and let the world judge who is in the right  a new test of the church of englands loyalty or whiggish loyalty and church loyalty compared in all the unhappy contentions among parties and factions in this brangling nation the champions of the church of england as they would have themselves called have laid it down as the distinguishing mark of their hierarchy that it is her practice and has been derived from her very constitution as well as doctrine to fix in all her members principles of unshaken loyalty to her prince entire and undisputed obedience to all her commands and an abhorrence of the very thoughts of those hellish principles that it can be lawful on any account whatsoever to resist the established power of their kings  twoud be endless to quote the the reverend dr b  ge who from the text in the   th of romans v     resist not the powers etc for whatsoever powers are he ordained of god whosoever therefore resists the power resists the ordinance of god tells us that if the king should by his royal command execute the greatest violence upon either our person or estate our duty was to submit by prayers and tears first to god almighty to turn the wrath of his vicegerent from his servant and by bumble entreaty to beg his majestys grace and pardon but to lift up the hand against the lords anointed or resist the evil of punishment he thought fit to inflict this were a crime unpardonable either before god or man and a crime says the reverend dr which we bless god the very principles of our ever loyal mother the church of england abhors and detests  let incendiaries phanaticks and bloody peacebreaking wbigs says another learned divine nourish the viprous principles of treason and rebellion and let them meet their due reward of their factious doings in the resentments of a righteous but provoked nation but god be praised our mother the church of england has always brought up her sons in an unspotted loyalty and obedience none have been found lifting up their hands against their sovereign or possessing the rights of the anointed of god etc  the very being and life the original and principles of the church of england says another  0th of january sermon is loyalty and fidelity to god as the immediate supreme and to the king as the lively image of divine authority whose power is immediately derived from holds of and is accountable to none but to god himself  to avoid prolixity of quotation the reader is desired to accept of these as sufficient proofs of what i lay down upon this condition nevertheless that besides the general appeal which i make to the memory of most men i oblige my self upon demand to produce ten thousand fair quotations of nonresistance of princes passiveobedience and divine authority of the kingly power is owned and declared to be an essential part of the profession and practice of the church of england and upon this foot which i hold to be sufficient i think i cannot be censured if i take it for granted  now as this too much divided nation has always been composed of two contending parties those parties have been distinguished as in like cases by names of contempt and though they have often changed them on either side as cavalier and roundhead royalists and rebels malignants and phanaticks tories and whigs yet the division has always been barely the church and the dissenter and there it continues to this day  as the church of england party have boasted of their own loyalty so they have branded the dissenter with rebellion and faction not only in their nature but in their very principles they have laid it down in their writings and sermons and multitudes of their ignorant hearers believe it that the very doctrine of the dissenter is made up of principles in their own nature tending to confusion and rebellion they wont be content that we should own there may be men among all parties of bad designs and who would on all occasions embroil their native country but it must be woven with the very articles of faith and that it is the religion of a dissenter to disturb government kill kings and oppose laws  the phanatical enemies of our king and church says the learned dr p  n drink in rebellion as water it is the very substance of their schismatical doctrine to overwhelm and destory and commonwealths and confusions are the doctrines they preach  he that lays out one groat with a dissenter says the worthy sir roger in one of his famous observators contributes so much as the profits of that groat amounts to in trade toward the subversion of the monarchy and erecting a commonwealth for the very nature and tendency of their profession is destructive of kingly power and the government of the nation  this has been the opinion of the church of england both of themselves on one hand and of the dissenters on the other hand i should be glad if i could only say it has been for we find it is still too much their opinion  let no man say that the author of these sheets is either widening or keeping unheald the breaches of this nation for if i can make it appear that there is really no occasion of such unnatural divisions and that neither the extraordinary opinion of themselves nor the contempt of their neighbors as to the matter of loyalty is a becoming principle no nor a rational one neither for that as to loyalty passiveobedience nonresistance etc there is really no great difference between one side or other i go as far toward healing the breach as any man for there can be no better way to end the strife on both sides than to prove that neither side has any just cause to contend  to examine the matter on both sides seems very useful at this time in order to reconcile parties and to settle the universal character of the nation  the government of england is a limited monarchy composed of king lords and commons each have their several their separate and their conjunctive powers which acting in concert make the harmony of the constitution i shall not invade the province of those learned gentlemen who have undertaken to set forth the branches of the constitution in all their powers limitations and prerogatives it is enough to say the constitution is known the government is confined by laws the crown limited by statutes and the peoples rights confirmed by the concession of ages  to this government all distinction of names set apart i am of the opinion all parties have in their turns been equally loyal i was going to say equally disloyal and if i were to use the language of late times it would be a very proper way of speaking  affirming without demonstrating is an absurd way of arguing and therefore it will be needful to come to particulars and to examine the several acts and deeds of both parties when the kingly prerogative has shocked or clashd with the people  in order to this it is needful co examine the date of the difference and so enter a little into history  our first reformation from popery was in the days of king edward the vi i call it the first because twas under him that the whole nation and the government embraced the protestant reformed religion this protestant religion was established by that zealous king and by his parliament backed with the force of laws and confirmed by all the sanction of authority it was capable of and here it began to be called the church of england  some enquiring christians were for making farther steps and carrying on the reformation to a higher degree and if that good reforming king had lived his zeal and integrity was such that there was no doubt he would have gone on to perfect every thing he had begun as new light or more knowledge had increased but the return of popery under queen mary put a stop to the work in general and went very far toward overturning the whole structure of the reformation  queen elizabeth restored it again but as she was a zealous protestant queen yet she was not for subjecting the reformation to any amendment not that she believed it perfect but she was a politic princess surrounded with enemies that were not to be dallyd with and she was loath to suppose such defects in the reformation as were alleged because twas to lessen the reputation of it and consequently her interest in the world  those who insisted upon the further reformation were then called puritans because they set up for a greater purity of worship and they separated themselves from the established church because as they said their consciences informed them they could serve god more agreeable to his will  i shall not meddle with the arguments made use of on both sides either to defend or expose this principle it is sufficient to acquaint my reader that this is the true original of the dissenters we are now to examine a little further back before this reformation there was no such thing as church of england it was then the church of rome that was the established national church  the protestants under the titles of lollards wickliffians hussites etc what did they do did they as our modern people say every body should conform to what the government commanded no the present church of england party were the dissenters the schismatics and phanaticks in the days of king henry viii were persecuted for not coming to church many of them put to death and always treated with scorn and contempt as enemies to the government broachers of new opinions and contemners of authority as in the case of that famous protomartyr of christs church john lambert and others  in the next ages these come to have the power in their hands and forgetting that they had found it righteous in the sight of god to obey god rather than man they treat those whose consciences oblige them to dissent from them with the same contempt which themselves had received from the roman government  thus far they are upon even terms as to obedience to their superiors  the dissenters have the first occasion after this to show their submission under extraordinary pressures queen elizabeth discountenanced them continually and as good a queen as she was put some of them to death king james i hunted them quite out of the kingdom made thousands of them fly into holland and germany and at last to new england  during the long reign of these two princes we find no charge of treason or rebellion upon them they bore the displeasure of their princes with patience and passive obedience if i may be allowed that ridiculous phrase being persecuted in one city they fled to another they bore illegal prosecutions and things contrary to their right as english men but never took up arms against their prince  under the reign of king charles i the case altered the king and parliament fell out about matters of civil right and invasion of the liberty and properties of the people the puritans or dissenters call them what we please fell in unanimously with the parliament  and here it is worthy remark that the first difference between the king and the english parliament did not respect religion but civil property nor were the majority of the house puritans but true church protestants and english men who stood upon the rights of the people as english men and none were more zealous in the first disputes than the lord digby sir thomas wentworth and such as were afterward deep sufferers for the king  but the parliament finding the puritan party stuck close to their cause they also came over them when things came to a rupture and so the war begun on the score of right invasion of liberty breach of the laws private leagues and maladministration a game we have seen played over again by the very same church of england that have exclaimed so much against it so damned it and so damned themselves by oaths declarations tests and god knows what against it  it is allowed here the puritan broke through his loyalty and his former obedience and fought his way to the liberty he demanded well the war ended to his advantage he subdued his sovereign and brought him to the block to the astonishment of the whole world  i will not dispute here which or which party did or did not do it but to give the enemy all just advantage i am willing to grant it in the largest sense that the dissenters or phanaticks or whigs call them as you please did embrue their hands in the blood of the lords anointed put to death that blessed martyr king charles the i whom the learned divine in a sermon on the  0th of january before the parliament compares both in the manner of his sufferings and the people by whom to our savior and the jews and boldly runs on in the blasphemous parallel to show that the indignities and sufferings of king charles exceed those of jesus christ  i think i have granted as largely as a fair adversary can desire for i have yielded for peacesake to several things which i could fairly disprove  nor shall i return to a repetition of the ill usage the dissenters have received from the contrary party on this account for above  0 years the constant reproaches they and their children after them have met with from those gentlemen who on all occasions have as i hinted before particularly taken care to extol their own unshaken fidelity to their prince till at last an occasion presents to touch them in the same most sensible part their right and property and alas their loyalty what became of it truly the faithful passively obedient vnshakenly loyal church returned to the original nature of their neighbors and did the same thing exactly which the whigs the factious rebellious whigs had done before  no that is false says a disciple of dr sherlocks we did not kill our king we did not dip our hands in royal blood nor hurt the lords anointed  no that is true but the lords anointed may thank himself for that for my part i think the difference only lies here the whigs in    to    took up arms against their king and having conquered him and taken him prisoner and having taken him prisoner cut off his head because they had begun the church of england took arms against their king in    and did not cut off his head because they had him not king charles lost his life because he did not run away and his son king james saved his life because he did run away  it is such a jest such a banter to say we did take up arms but we did not kill him bless us kill our king we would not have hurt a hair of his head why every bullet shot at the battle of the boyne was a killing the king for if you did not twas because you could not hit him  if a highwayman fires at you upon the road when he is taken and brought upon his trial our learned recorder before he pronounces sentence of death harangues him in this manner and besides all this sir you are plainly guilty of murder for you not only assaulted this honest man in order to take away his money but you endeavored to murder him for you shot at him in order to kill him and the intention of murder is equally criminal in the eyes of god with the act it self  now who did we shoot at at the boyne it is true king james generally stood out of the way but who did we shoot at what was our orders to fight against both small and great and not against the king of israel had your bullets commission to show their loyalty and not to touch the lords anointed if he had charged in the first squadrons of his horse had you not killed him if you could i think this needs no further proof  nay if arguments may be allowed to have equal weight on both sides the whigs have been the honester of the two for they never professed any such blind absolute and undisputed obedience to princes as the others have done  it has always been their opinion that government was originally contrived by the consent and for the mutual benefit of the parties governed that the people have an original native right to their property the liberty of their persons and possessions unless forefaulted to the laws that they cannot be divested of their right but by their own consent and that all invasion of this right is destructive of the constitution and dissolves the compact of government and obedience  they have always declared that they understand their allegiance to their governors to be supposing they govern them according to the laws of the land and that if princes break this bond of government the nature of it is inverted and the constitution ceases of course  buchanan in scotland algernoon sidney in england have set their names and the latter his blood to this doctrine and the author of the trueborn englishman is worth quoting in this case the governments ungirt when justice dies and constitutions are nonentities the nations all a mob there is no such thing as lords or commons parliament or king a great promiscuous crowd the hydra lies till laws revive and mutual contract ties a chaos free to choose for their own share what case of government they please to wear if to a king they do the reins commit all men are bound in conscience to submit but then that king must by his oath assent to postulatas of the government which if he breaks he cuts off the entail and power retreats to its original trueborn englishman p     this has been the avowed doctrine of the dissenters and is indeed the true sense of the constitution it self pursuant to this doctrine they thought they had a right to oppose violence with force believing that when kings break coronation oaths the solemn compact with their people and encroach upon their civil rights contrary to the laws of the land by which they are sworn to rule they cease to be the lords anointed any longer the sanction of their office is vanished and they become tyrants and enemies of mankind and may be treated accordingly  now it is no wonder to find people of these principles vigorously withstanding their governors when they tread upon the tender sore places of the constitution it is nothing but what they all along pretended to and declared to be their opinion  but to find the church of englandmen whose loyalty has been the subject of a thousand learned authors and numberless sermons whose character and mark of distinction has been chosen more for her steady adherence and fidelity to her prince than to god almighty whose obedience to her monarch has been declared to be inviolate and immovable and who pretends to be famous through the whole world for her faithfulness to kings for her as soon as ever the king did but as it were seem to aim at crushing her authority as soon as he did but begin to call her clergy to an account and clap her golden condlesticks for disobedience for her to winch and kick fly to foreign princes for protection and rise in arms against her prince o pellin o brady o sherloch o hominum o mores  where is the worthy dr b  ges loyal now his immovable loyalty that after all his absolute submission is so far from being a martyr to his own doctrine that he could not lose a small benefice for it  where is the famous dr s  k who having stood out long in his old antiquated doctrine of passive obedience and confirmed the faith of his suffering brethren by strong and wonderful arguments at last at the powerful instigation of a wife and a good salary has sold all his loyalty for a mess of pottage solving his honesty with the wretched distinction of a power de facto and a power de jure as if the church of englands credit could be saved by such an impotent shift or as if he could make amends to the prebendary for his helping him to sacriflce his brethren to father his conversion on reading honest dr overall whose doctrine it is well known the doctor knew before but that he was loath dr south should have the honor of bringing him over to such old phanatick principles  behold the loyalty of the church of england now let us examine their conscience as to taking oaths and if i do not bring them to be all whigs and fortyonemen or else prove them all perjured then i do nothing  the clergy all the magistrates and officers of the household of the civil or military government were members of the church of england otherwise they could not be employed the sacramental test has done the dissenters this kindness that it is plain all the managing hands in the kingdom were disciples of the church and as an additional circumstance the oath of allegiance which they took and which was god be praised of their own making bound them to that same absolute blind obedience which they professed and confined it to the king his heirs and successors  if this oath be considered literally i am content to be silenced when one fair argument can be brought to evade it the declaration followed it wherein they detest and abhor that devilish doctrine that it is lawful on any pretense whatsoever mark the emphasis to take up arms against the king this equal to an oath declared in the presence of god and the particulars being material to our purpose are as follows i a b do declare and believe that it is not lawful upon any pretense whatsoever to take up arms against the king and that i do abhor that traitorous position of taking arms by his authority against those that are commissioned by him so help me god    notwithstanding this you have taken up arms against deposed and as far as you were able put to death your lawful king the very king you swore allegiance to  now pray gentlemen give commission to some worthy champion of your churchs loyalty to bring you sairly off of your oath and declaration if you can and till you do be not angry with us for making one of these conclusions from the premises and you shall choose for your selves  first that this doctrine of absolute passive and nonresistant obedience is an absurdity in it self contradictory to the nature of government and allegiance and politically introduced by state engines into the church of england to abuse her and betray her members into unforeseen mischiefs and inconveniences  or secondly that the members of the church of england are all apostates from the very fundamental doctrine of their church perjured in the sight of god and man notorious hypocrites and deceivers who having sworn obedience without reserve to their prince are become traitors rebels and murderers of the lords anointed and their lawful sovereign and not having the fear of god before their eyes have deposed and traitorously dethroned their rightful king god almightys vicegerent accountable to no earthly power supreme under god absolute and from divine institution undoubted sole lord of them and their country  or lastly that they only are the true church of england who according to their avowed profession have firmly adhered to their king in all his sufferings and solitude have never blackened their consciences nor gone back from their obedience forgotten their oaths nor sullied their reputation with the horrid crimes of treason and rebellion as they think it to be  now as a fair disputant i am willing the respondent shall choose which of these three consequences he will stand by in behalf of the church of englands loyalty but if they would take the advice of a friend to the honest part of them i would recommend the first conclusion to be fittest for them for the following reasons    because since humane infallibility is and with good reason disowned by the church of england both for her self and every body else it can be no diminution to her reputation when she has found her self mistaken and imposed upon to acknowledge her error a wise man will always own rather than defend a mistake    because it is my opinion that their way is hedged up against any other pretense evasion or reservation and therefore it is with me the only thing that charity can say for them and must remain so till i find something else said that is more to the purpose  but the mischief of all is that if this be honestly acknowledged as is doubtless most true that the church of england was mistaken and imposed upon to espouse a senseless absurd principle contrary to the nature of government and allegiance etc why then they come over to this consequence  that government and allegiance are both conditional and oaths of subjects are always to be considered in a constructive sense with conditions of protection and the like a thing which is without question the real meaning of all oaths of allegiance otherwise subjects may be put under an absolute necessity of perjury or state martyrdom by often swearing what may be impossible for them to perform  the town of aeth in flanders has been about six times and the town of rhinebergh in gueldre about twelve times taken and retaken and as often as new masters had possession of the place so often the poor inhabitants have sworn to their new lords what can the meaning of such an oath be but that they will be faithful to them so long as they keep possession of the place twoud be ridiculous to imagine the imposers of the oath required any more  if our zealous churchmen worded an oath contrary to the very nature of swearing allegiance let them answer for it who first made it then took it then broke it but the nature of the thing can leave room for no other suggestion that i know of  till then some further argument is produced it must rest here that the church of england was mistaken imposed upon etc that she finds when the laws are broken the right of the people invaded the root of the government struck at church and state undermined and despotick tyranny at the door the native right of the people is superior and they may assume a power to right themselves  and so we are brought back to whiggism and forty one and gentlemen there is no remedy for it help it if ye can  where now is the difference between church loyalty and whiggish loyalty roundhead or cavalier churchman or dissenter whig or troy all are alike they are pleased when legally governed quarrelsome and unruly if oppressed and will defend themselves if assaulted though it be by their kings or any body else  why then is the difference kept up methinks they might all be friends together for they are all alike the dissenters have been in their times as loyal and the church of england in their time as disloyal one as another vice versa the dissenters have been as disloyal and the churchmen as loyal as one another upon the same occasion they have been both sufferers and have submitted to the government ay and to the oppressions and persecutions of their superiors and sovereigns and again upon the like occasions they have both of them been rebels if their own language may be so far used they have both of them in their turn taken arms against and deposed their rightful and lawful kings  so that in my opinion with a latitude to all that think otherwise to think as they please the church of england and their neighbors the dissenters have nothing to quarrel with one another about as to loyalty as to other matters i have nothing to say to them nor shall not mingle it with this discourse  nor do i think i am writing a satyr against the church of england nor is it at all intended to be so and to stop all pretenses that way i take the freedom to say here has been no crime the church of england has been in the right of it not in taking arms but the error was in espousing crying up and pretending to a blind absolute obedience to princes be their commands never so absolute tyrannical or illegal this neither the doctrine nor practice of the church of england nor of any church or people in the christian world ever pretended to and therefore the fanlt lay in those people who being themselves members of the church of england suffered themselves to be deluded by state ministers to foster a tenent upon the church which her original constitution never pretended to and then call it the doctrine of the church of england  the first beginning of their pretended doctrine was found in manwarings and sibthorps libels in the days of king charles i cajoling the king and then to please him endeavoring to wheedle the people into a belief of the divine right of kingly government and affirming that the king was not obliged by the laws in the administration of the government  upon this preposterons foundation they built the illegitimate structure of absolute undisputed obedience for if kingly power were once proved to be immediately derived from divine authority absolute obedience would be a consequence no body could dispute since the same obedience without reserve would be due to the delegated power as to the power delegating  and though this is a point easily enough confuted yet being willing to keep the present dispute within as small a compass we can i think our argument has nothing at all to do with it  whether government be of divine original or not seems not the question here for if it be not so then as before the church of england have been mistaken and imposed upon and if it be so then the church of england has trampled under foot their own doctrine turned rebels to god and apostates from the faith they have professed have sacrilegiously and traitorously taken up arms against their prince assaulted the lords anointed resisted the powers which are the ordinance of god deposed their lawful sovereign broken their allegiance and consequently are a parcel of perjured rebels every jot as bad as the worst roundhead regicide and rebel of the year fortyone  what more or less can be said i profess i know not and am in great expectation of something new in the matter for i cannot find in all the writings i have met with any thing to contradict it  the bringing government and obedience to the proper circumstances of mutual compact between king and people seems to me to be the only method to unravel this skein of entangld principles the nature of government has made it the necessary consequence of all argument relating to power and i could give instances in all the nations in the world that some time or other even the right of succession to government which must be as sacred as the power has been interrupted and limited by the people in case of tyranny and illegal governing and every nation and this among the rest has oftentimes deposed their princes for the preservation of the state when either incapacity for government tyrannical usurpation or other maladministration has been the case  but this i think also needless here every one that is versed in history can read the numerous examples in the roman grecian and persian histories even sacred histories where kings were more particularly of divine right than any where are full of them the histories of spain portugal france lombardy the empires of germany and muscovy even the papal chair have suffered convulsions and revolutions the deposing and displacing their sovereigns when the peoples good which is and ever was the soul the center the end and the cause of all government came to be in the dispute  but to return to the principles of the two parties we are now discoursing of the whigs as before have always asserted this to be their notion of government and governors and the church of england however some among them have topt an empty notion upon them have all along and now at last once for all owned it by their practice that kings when they descend to tyranny dissolve the bond and leave the subject free trueborn eng man p     the act for the further limitation of the crown past in the last parliament and the right of the people therein declared and recognized i would ask my opponent whose act and deed it was will they say it was a whiggish act made by a phanatical house of commons i dare say there was not ten dissenters in the house let them descend with us into particulars let them draw out a black list of members who in that loyal honest english parliament gave their hands to the last settlement and declaration of right and let us tell noses and put a brand upon the phanaticks among them  will they tell us it was a phanatical parliament that set the crown upon the queens head i hope they will own her majesty and their lordships the bishops are part of the church of england for if the head and the principal members are not we know not who are  will they tell us that sir e s sir b s sir j b mr h  y sir c  r m  ve and a hundred more of that side were whigs and commonwealthmen  how comes it to pass in england that no papist can inherit divine right ought to supercede all precautions and the young prince of savoy not the house of hannover ought to reign with a non obstante to all humane limitation if all was from heaven where are our right linemen now why truly the reason is plain the church of england people of england a church of england parliament of england have thought fit to declare that for the good of the people to which all right of succession to power must give way because from them all power it self does derive and by the voice of that people in which authority sufficient is legally grounded it is unanimously agreed that we will not have a papist to reign over us  all this is too plain to admit of a dispute and now to me it seems preposterous why any men should keep up the distinction between parties as to loyalty when indeed there is no manner of difference in the case  i have talked several times of bearing suffering being persecuted and oppressed as the dissenters in their time have been more than enough and again in their turn the church of england have been persecuted too for as i noted before they were once the schismatics the whigs and the dissenters now i think it is not very foreign to my argument to examine whether of the two behaved themselves under their sufferings with the greatest submission who showed most absolute obedience to their superiors and who first or oftenest rebelled against their lawful sovereign  the protestants under henry viii were the first dissenters they were kept under persecuted and put to death as rebels and schismatics now upon due search it will be fouhd that under the protection of two protestant queens wives of king henry viii they had more than once formed such interest at court and in the kingdom as to begin to be formidable to the popish powers then reigning and the fall of the lord cromwell was thought a necessary policy in king henry to prevent the plots of the phanatical church of england heretics a long account of which may be read in the life of that prince  king edward the vi a zealous and pious prince made no scruple for the propagation of the protestant church of england of which he was the glorious founder to set aside the lawful and undisputed succession of his own sisters to establish the crown in the lady jane gray who he knew would carry on the work of reformation  there is an instance of the zeal for succession in the right line in the first protestant head that ever the church of england had  after this the gospellers that is the church of england protestants of suffolk having some sense of injury done to the princess mary and willing to have the succession go on in the right line provided they could both preserve their religion and loyalty too capitulate with her and promise to stand by her provided she would promise to preserve and make no alteration in their established church of england  here the church of england men owned the liberty of their religion to be superior to their loyalty to her and that they had a right to submit or not to submit as their liberty was or was not secure and accordingly conditioned with her before they would acknowledge her to be their queen  and we see how heaven punished them for venturing on the word of a prince when their religion and liberty was at stake  in this queens time the church having been again suppressed and popery erected sir thomas wyat an honest church of england protestant with a very good body of men took up arms against their lawful princess for breaking her word in defense of their dear religion established by blessed king edward which were the very words of the manifesto they published the londoners with  00 men sent by the queen against against them thought it no treachery to desert their lawful popish queen and go over to their protestant church of england brethren  we have nothing to do with the justification of this fact it is sufficient that so it was and that these were protestants of the church of england in the first and purest part of their principles and let them justify the fact if they please  queen elizabeth succeeds and then the church of england shone in its meridian glory and then grew up some who aiming as i said before at a further reformation and the church refusing to hearken to it formed a new party of dissenters and these were called puritans and since that phanaticks  now i challenge the defender of this cause to tell me one disloyal act one plot against the government one disturbance of the civil peace among these dissenters from the beginning of this queen which was their own beginning to the reign of king charles i which was a continued term of  0 years and yet during this time they suffered all manner of indignities reproaches fining imprisonings banishment confiscations and corporal punishments  so that hitherto the passive obedience of the dissenters has far exceeded that of the church of england these had but five years oppression under queen mary and in that five years they once capitulated with their sovereign to make her queen upon conditions and once took arms against her after she was queen and by that i must always understand that if they did not depose and destroy her it was because they could not and if they had done it no doubt they had cause sufficient to justify them before god and man the puritans after this suffered all that their too cruel brethren of the church of england laid upon them during three tedious reigns before they so much as made the least offer at doing themselves justice and for  0 years together exercised that passive obedience which they never pretended to  at last they took arms and when they did they did it to purpose carried all before them subdued monarchy cut off their kings head and all that  after the restoration things began to return to their old channel and  0 years more the dissenters endured another egyptian servitude were persecuted plundered indicted imprisoned plagued with impositions stigmatized with a thousand reproaches their meeting houses demolished their estates confiscated their persons excommunicated and anathematized sworn into plots they never heard of and into crimes they never commltted dragged to goals gibbets and scaffolds and the like all this while passiveobedence if there were any such thing was found among them more than any where else for here was no rebellion no insurrection nor breaking of the peace by the dissenters notwithstanding all those oppositions  after this comes king james the second to the crown and he turned the scale and together with invasion of liberty falls upon the church begins to rifle her of her trophies for no essentials had been touched and how long did she bear it not  0 years not  0 years no not so many months  what did she do truly nothing but what she ought to have done defend her liberty and religion by force against unjust invasion and tyranny nothing but what all the nations in the world have done and would do again if they could  the only error we charge upon the church of england was setting up pretenses of what they really would not practice crying up themselves for fools when we knew they were wiser men calling themselves humble slaves but when the trial came proving stubborn refractory liberty mongers even as bad as the worst whig or phanatick of them all  for the future then if a humble mediator might be permitted to give advice to the gentlemen of the church of england it should be in these short and friendly terms  pray gentlemen never be imposed upon to pretend to more loyalty and more slavish principles than you intend to practice  never pretend to more obedience than your sovereign requires our late king who i am not ashamed to show as a pattern for future ages required and her present majesty without affront to her majestys authority it may be said requires no further obedience from the people of england than the laws of england require  to govern according to law is a full satisfaction to the people and to obey according to law is a full satisfaction to the sovereign the laws are the test both of the royal authority and of the subjects obedience and to pretend to more obedience than the law requires is abusing your prince and abusing your selves  never be ashamed to own with your brethren the whigs that you are willing to submit to authority but that you expect to be governed according to the laws and statutes of this realm  let the scoth motto be set upon your liberties and according to your constant practice as well as theirs let all men know you design to make it good nemo me impune lacessit  and as it really never was the principle of the church of england nor were a hundredth part of the members of the church tainted with it so for the future it is hoped you will not suffer such to mingle themselves among you or to act in the name of the church of england who pretend to a blind absolute obedience to princes  and lastly gentlemen a little more modesty to your humble servants your protestant brethren the dissenters or whigs i mean as to matter of loyalty for in truth gentlemen we do not see any reason you have to reproach us in that matter you being in every particular as faulty that way as your neighbors  the shortestway with the dissenters or proposals for the establishment of the church sir roger lestrange tells us a story in his collection of fables of the cock and the horses the cock was gotten to roost in the stable among the horses and there being no racks or other conveniences for him it seems he was forced to roost upon the ground the horses jostling about for room and putting the cock in danger of his life he gives them this grave advice pray gentlefolks let us stand still for fear we should tread upon one another  there are some people in the world who now they are vnpearcht and reduced to an equality with other people and under strong and very just apprehensions of being further treated as they deserve begin with aesopscock to preach up peace and union and the christian duties of moderation forgetting that when they had the power in their hands those graces were strangers in their gates  it is now near fourteen years that the glory and peace of the purest and most flourishing church in the world has been eclipsed buffetted and disturbed by a sort of men who god in his providence has suffered to insult over her and bring her down these have been the days of her humiliation and tribulation she has born with an invincible patience the reproach of the wicked and god has at last heard her prayers and delivered her from the oppression of the stranger  and now they find their day is over their power gone and the throne of this nation possessed by a royal english true and ever constant member of and friend to the church of england now they find that they are in danger of the church of englands just resentments now they cry out peace union forbearance and charity as if the church had not too long harbored her enemies under her wing and nourished the viperous brood till they hiss and fly in the face of the mother that cherished them  no gentlemen the time of mercy is past your day of grace is over you should have practiced peace and moderation and charity if you expected any your selves  we have heard none of this lesson for fourteen years past we have been huffd and bullyd with your act of toleration you have told us that you are the church established by law as well as others have set up your cantingsynagogues at our churchdoors and the church and members have been loaded with reproaches with oaths associations abjurations and what not where has been the mercy the forbearance the charity you have shown to tender consciences of the church of england that could not take oaths as fast you made em that having sworn allegiance to their lawful and rightful king could not dlspence with that oath their king being still alive and swear to your new hodgepodge of a dutch government these have been turned out of their livings and they and their families left to starve their estates double taxed to carry on a war they had no hand in and you got nothing by what account can you give of the multitudes you have forced to comply against their consciences with your new sophistical politics who like new converts in france sin because they cannot starve and now the tables are turned upon you you must not be persecuted it is not a christian spirit  you have butchered one king deposed another king and made a mock king of a third and yet you could have the face to expect to be employed and trusted by the fourth any body that did not know the temper of your party would stand amazed at the impudence as well as fully to think of it  your management of your dutch monarch whom you reduced to a mere king of cl  s is enough to give any future princes such an idea of your principles as to warn them sufficiently from coming into your clutches and god be thanked the queen is out of your hands knows you and will have a care of you  there is no doubt but the supreme authority of a nation has in its self a power and a right to that power to execute the laws upon any part of that nation it governs the execution of the known laws of the land and that with a weak and gentle hand neither was all this phanatical party of this land have ever called persecution this they have magnified to a height that the sufferings of the hugonots in france were not to be compared with  now to execute the known laws of a nation upon those who transgress them after voluntarily consenting to the making those laws can never be called persecution but justice but justice is always violence to the party offending for every man is innocent in his own eyes the first execution of the laws against dissenters in england was in the days of king james the first and what did it amount to truly the worst they suffered was at their own request to let them go to new england and erect a new collony and give them great privileges grants and suitable powers keep them under protection and defend them against all invaders and receive no taxes or revenue from them this was the cruelty of the church of england fatal lenity twas the ruin of that excellent prince king charles the first had king james sent all the puritans in england away to the west indies we had been a national unmixed church the church of england had been kept undivided and entire  to requite the lenity of the father they take up arms against the son conquer pursue take imprison and at last put to death the anointed of god and destroy the very being and nature of government setting up a fordid impostor who had neither title to govern nor understanding to manage but supplied that want with power bloody and desperate councils and craft without conscience  had not king james the first withheld the full execution of the laws had he given them strict justice he had cleared the nation of them and the consequences had been plain his son had never been murdered by them nor the monarchy overwhelmed twas too much mercy shown them was the ruin of his posterity and the ruin of the nations peace one would think the dissenters should not have the face to believe that we are to be wheedld and canted into peace and toleration when they know that they have once requited us with a civil war and once with an intolerable and unrighteous persecution for our former civility  nay to encourage us to be easy with them tls apparent that they never had the upperhand of the church but they treated her with all the severity with all the reproach and contempt as was possible what peace and what mercy did they show the loyal gentry of the church of england in the time of their triumphant commonwealth how did they put all the gentry of england to ransom whether they were actually in arms for the king or not making people compound for their estates and starve their families how did they treat the clergy of the church of england sequestered the ministers devoured the patrimony of the church and divided the spoil by sharing the church lands among their soldiers and turning her clergy out to starve just such measure as they have meted should be measured them again  charity and love is the known doctrine of the church of england and it is plain she has put it in practice toward the dissenters even beyond what they ought till she has been wanting to her self and in effect unkind to own sons particularly in the too much lenity of king james the first mentioned before had he so rooted the puritans from the face of the land which he had an opportunity early to have done they had not had the power to vex the church as since they have done  in the days of king charles the second how did the church reward their bloody doings with lenity and mercy except the barbarous regicides of the pretended court of justice not a soul suffered for all the blood in an unnatural war king charles came in all mercy and love cherished them preferred them employed them withheld the rigor of the law and oftentimes even against the advice of his parliament gave them liberty of conscience and how did they requite him which the villainous contrivance to depose and murder him and his successor at the ryeplot  king james as if mercy was the inherent quality of the family began his reign with unusual favor to them nor could their joining with the duke of monmouth against him move him to do himself justice upon them but that mistaken prince thought to win them by gentleness and love poclaimd an universal liberty to them and rather discountenanced the church of england than them how they requited him all the world knows  the late reign is too fresh in the memory of all the world to need a comment how under pretense of joining with the church in redressing some grievances they pusht things to that extremity in conjunction wirh some mistaken gentlemen as to depose the late king as if the grievance of the nation could not have been redressed but by the absolute ruin of the prince here is an instance of their temper their peace and charity to what height they carried themselves during the reign of a king of their own how they crope into all places of trust and profit how they insinuated into the favor of the king and were at first preferred to the highest places in the nation how they engrossed the ministry and above all how pitifully they managed is too plain to need any remarks  but particularly their mercy and charity the spirit of union they tell us so much of has been remarkable in scotland if any man would see the spirit of a dissenter let him look into scotland there they made entire conquest of the church trampled down the sacred orders and suppressed the episcopal government with an absolute and as they suppose irretrievable victory though it is possible they may find themselves mistaken now twoud be a very proper question to ask their impudent advocate the observator pray how much mercy and favor did the members of the episcopal church find in scotland from the scotch presbyterian government and i shall undertake for the church of england that the dissenters shall still receive as much here though they deserve but little  in a small treatise of the sufferings of the episcopal clergy in scotland twill appear what usage they met with how they not only lost their living but in several places were plundered and abused in their persons the ministers that could not conform turned out with numerous families and no maintenance and hardly charity enough left to relieve them with a bit of bread and the cruelties of the parties are innumerable and not to be attempted in this short piece  and now to prevent the distant cloud which they perceived to hang over their heads from england with a true presbyterian policy they put in for a union of nations that england might unite their church with the kirk of scotland and their presbyterian members sit in our house of commons and their assembly of scotch canting long cloaks in our convocation what might have been if our phanatick whiggish statesmen continued god only knows but we hope we are out of fear of that now  it is alledd by some of the faction and they began to bully us with it that if we will not unite with them they will not settle the crown with us again but when her majesty dies will choose a king for themselves  if they will not we must make them and it is not the first time we have let them know that we are able the crowns of these kingdoms have not so far disowned the right of succession but they may retrieve it again and if scotland thinks to come off from a successive to an elective state of government england has not promised not to assist the right heir and put them into possession without any regard to their ridiculous settlements  these are the gentlemen these their ways of treating the church both at home and abroad now let us examine the reasons they pretend to give why we should be favorable to them why we should continue and tolerate them among us  first they are very numerous they say they are a great part of the nation and we cannot suppress them  to this may be answered   they are not so numerous as the protestants in france and yet the french king effectually cleared the nation of them at once and we dont find he misses them at home  but i am not of the opinion they are so numerous as is pretended their party is more numerous than their persons and those mistaken people of the church who are misled and deluded by their wheedling artifices to join with them make their party the greatter but those will open their eyes when the government shall set heartily about the work and come off from them as some animals which they say always desert a house when it is likely to fall    dly the more numerous the more dangerous and therefore the more need to suppress them and god has suffered us to bear them as goads in our sides for not utterly extinguishing them long ago    dly if we are to allow them only because we cannot suppress them then it ought to be tried whether we can or no and i am of opinion it is easy to be done and could prescribe ways and means if it were proper but i doubt not the government will find effectual methods for the rooting the contagion from the face of this land  another argument they use which is this that it is a time of war and we have need to unite against the common enemy  we answer this common enemy had been no enemy if they had not made him so he was quiet in peace and no way disturbed or encroachd upon us and we know no reason we had to quarrel with him  but further we make no question but we are able to deal with this common enemy without their help but why must we unite with them because of the enemy will they go over to the enemy if we do not prevent it by a union with them  we are very well contented they should and make no question we shall be ready to deal with them and the common enemy too and better without them than with them  besides if we have a common enemy there is the more need to be secure against our private enemies if there is one common enemy we have the less need to have an enemy in our bowels  twas a great argument some people used against suppressing the old money that twas a time of war and twas too great a risque for the nation to run if we should not master it we should be undone and yet the sequel proved the hazard was not so great but it might be mastered and the success was answerable the suppressing the dissenters is not a harder work nor a work of less necessity to the public we can never enjoy a settled uninterrupted union and tranquillity in this nation till the spirit of whiggisme faction and schism is melted down like the oldmoney  to talk of the difficulty is to frighten our selves with chimaeras and notions of a powerful party which are indeed a party without power difficulties often appear greater at a distance than when they are searched into with judgment and distinguished from the vapors and shadows that attend them  we are not to be frightened with it this age is wiser than that by all our own experience and theirs too king charles the first had early suppressed this party if he had took more deliberate measures in short it is not worth arguing to talk of their arms their monmouths and shaftsurys and argiles are gone their dutchsanctuary is at an end heaven has made way for their destruction and if we do not close with the divine occasion we are to blame our selves and may remember that we had once an opportunity to serve the church of england by extirpating her implacable enemies and having let slip the minute that heaven presented may experimentally complain post est occasio calva  here are some popular objections in the way  as first the queen has promised them to continue them in their tolerated liberty and has told us she will be a religious observer of her word  what her majesty will do we cannot help but what as the head of the church she ought to do is another case her majesty has promised to protect and defend the church of england and if she cannot effectually do that without the destruction of the dissenters she must of course dispense with one promise to comply with another but to answer this cavil more effectually her majesty did never promise to maintain the toleration to the destruction of the church but it is upon supposition that it may be compatible with the well being and safety of the church ch which she had declared she would take especial care of now if these two interests clash it is plain her majestys intentions are to upholds protect defend and establish the church and this we conceive is impossible  perhaps it may be said that the church is in no immediate danger from the dissenters and therefore it is time enough but this is a weak answer  for first if a danger be real the distance of it is no argument against but rather a spur to quicken us to prevention lest it be too late hereafter  and  dly here is the opportunity and the only one perhaps that ever the church had to secure her self and destroy her enemies  the representatives of the nation have now an opportunity the time is come which all good men have wished for that the gentlemen of england may serve the church of england now they are protected and encouraged by a church of england queen  what will ye do for your sister in the day that she shall be spoken for  if ever you will establish the best christian church in the world  if ever you will suppress the spirit of enthusiosm  if ever you will free the nation from the viperous brood that have so long sucked the blood of their mother  if ever you will leave your posterity free from faction and rebellion this is the time  this is the time to pull up this heretical weed of sedition that has so long disturbed the peace of our church and poisoned the good corn  but says another hot and cold objector this is renewing fire and faggot reviving the act de heret comburendo this will be cruelty in its nature and barbarous to all the world  i answer it is cruelty to kill a snake or a toad in cold blood but the poison of their nature makes it a charity to our neighbors to destroy those creatures not for any personal injury received but for prevention not for the evil they have done but the evil they may do  serpents toads vipers etc are noxious to the body and poison the sensative life these poison the soul corrupt our posterity ensnare our children destroy the vitals of our happiness our future filicity and contaminate the whole mass  shall any law be given to such wild creatures some beasts are for sport and the huntsmen give them advantages of ground but some are knocked on the head by all possible ways of violence and surprise  i do not prescribe fire and faggot but as scipio said of carthage delenda est carthago they are to be rooted out of this nation is ever we will live in peace serve god or enjoy our own as for the manner i leave it to those hands who have a right to execute gods justice on the nations and the churchs enemies  but if we must be frighted from this justice under the specious pretenses and odious sense of cruelty nothing will be effected twill be more barbarous to our own children and dear posterity when they shall reproach their fathers as we do ours and tell us  you had an opportunity to root out this cursed race from the world under the favor and protection of a true english queen and out of your foolish pity you spared them because forsooth you would not be cruel and now our church is suppressed and persecuted our religion trampled under foot our estates plundered our persons imprisoned and dragged to jails gibbets and scaffolds your sparing this amalekite race is our destruction your mercy to them proves cruelty to your poor posterity  how just will such reflections be when our posterity shall fall under the merciless clntches of this uncharitable generation when our church shall be swallowed up in schism faction enthusiasm and confusion when our government shall be devolved upon foreigners and our monarchy dwindled into a republic  twoud be more rational for us if we must spare this generation to summon our own to a general massacre and as we have brought them into the world free send them out so and not betray them to destruction by our supine negligence and then cry it is mercy  moses was a merciful meek man and yet with what fury did he run through the camp and cut the camp and cut the throats of three and thirty thousand of his dear israelites that were fallen into idolatry what was the reason twas mercy to the rest to make these examples to prevent the destruction of the whole army  how many millions of future souls we save from infection and delusion if the present race of poisoned spirits were purged from the face of the land  it is vain to trifle in this matter the light foolish handling of them by mulcts fines etc it is their glory and their advantage if the gallows instead of the counter and the galleys instead of the fines were the reward of going to a conventicle to preach or hear there would not be so many sufferers the spirit of martyrdom is over they that will go to church to be chosen sheriffs and mayors would go to forty churches rather than be hanged  if one severe law were made and punctually executed that who ever was found at a conventicle should be banished the nation and the preacher be hanged we should soon see an end of the tale they would all come to church and one age would make us all one again  to talk of   s a month for not coming to the sacrament and   s per week for not coming to church this is such a way of converting people as never was known this is selling them a liberty to transgress for so much money if it be not a crime why dont we give them full license and if it be no price ought to compound for the committing it for that is selling a liberty to people to sin against god and the government  if it be a crime of the highest consequence both against the peace and welfare of the nation the glory of god the good of the church and the happiness of the soul let us rank it among capital offenses and let it receive a punishment in proportion to it  we hang men for trifles and banish them for things not worth naming but an offense against god and the church against the welfare of the world and the dignity of religion shall be bought off for   s this is such a shame to a christian government that it is with regret i transmit it to posterity  if men sin against god affront his ordinances rebel against his church and disobey the precepts of their superiors let them suffer as such capital crimes deserve so will religion flourish and this divided nation be once again united  and yet the title of barbarous and cruel will soon be taken off from this law too i am not supposing that all the dissenters in england should be hanged or banished but as in cases of rebellions and insurrections if a few of the ringleaders suffer the multitude are dismissed so a few obstinate people being made examples there is no doubt but the severity of the law would find a stop in the compliance of the multitude  to make the reasonableness of this matter out of question and more unanswerably plain let us examine for what it is that this nation is divided into parties and factions and let us see how they can justify a separation or we of the church of england can justify our bearing the insults and inconveniences of the party  one of their leading pastors and a man of as much learning as most among them in his answer to a pamphlet entitled an enquiry into the occasional conformity has these words p    do the religion of the church and the meetingbouses make two religions wherein do they differ the substance of the same religion is common to them both and the modes and accidents are the things in which only they differ p    thirty nine articles are given us for the summary of our religion thirty six contain the substance of it wherein we agree three the additional appendices about which we have some differences  now if as by their own acknowledgment the church of england is a true church and the difference between them is only in a few modes and accidents why should we expect that they will suffer galleys corporeal punishment and banishment for these trifles there is no question but they will be wiser even their own principles will not bear them out in it they will certainly comply with the laws and with reason and though at the first severity may seem hard the next age will feel nothing of it the contagion will be rooted out the disease being cured there will be no need of the operation but if they should venture to transgress and fall into the pit all the world must condemn their obstinacy as being without ground from their own principles  thus the pretense of cruelty will be taken off and the party actually suppressed and the disquiets they have so often brought upon the nation prevented  their numbers and their wealth makes them haughty and that it is so far from being an argument to persuade us to forbear them that it is a warning to us without any more delay to reconcile them to the unity of the church or remove them from us  at present heaven be praised they are not so formidable as they have been and it is our own fault if ever we suffer them to be so providence and the church of england seems to join in this particular that now the destroyers of the nations peace may be overturned and to this end the present opportunity seems to be put into our hands  to this end her present majesty seems reserved to enjoy the crown that the ecclesiastic as well as civil rights of the nation may be restored by her hand  to this end the face of affairs have received such a turn in the process of a few months as never has been before the leading men of the nation the universal cry of the people the unanimous request of the clergy agree in this that the deliverance of our church is at hand  for this end has providence given us such a parliament such a convocation such a gentry and such a queen as we never had before  and what may be the consequences of a neglect of such opportunities the succession of the crown has but a dark prospect another dutch turn may make the hopes of it ridiculous and the practice impossible be the house of our future princes never so well inclined they will be foreigners and many years will be spent in suiting the genius of strangers to this crown and the interests of the nation and how many ages it may be before the english throne be filled with so much zeal and candor so much tenderness and hearty affection to the church as we see it now covered with who can imagine  it is high time then for the friends of the church of england to think of building up and establishing her in such a manner that she may be no more invaded by foreigners nor divided by factions schisms and error  if this could be done by gentle and easy methods i should be glad but the wound is corroded the vitals begin to mortify and nothing but amputation of members can complete the cure all the ways of tenderness and compassion all persuasive arguments have been made use of in vain  the humor of the dissenters has so increased among the people that they hold the church in defiance and the house of god is an abomination among them nay they have brought up their posterity in such prepossest aversions to our holy religion that the ignorant mob think we are all idolaters and worshippers of baal and account it a sin to come within the walls of our churches  the primitive christians were not more shie of a heathentemple or of meat offered to idols nor the jews of swines flesh than some of our dissenters are of the church and the divine service solemnized therein  this obstinacy must be rooted out with the profession of it while the generation are left at liberty daily to affront god almighty and dishonor his holy worship we are wanting in our duty to god and our mother the church of england  how can we answer it to god to the church and to our posterity to leave them entangled with fanaticism error and obstinacy in the bowels of the nation to leave them an enemy in their streets that in time may involve them in the same crimes and endanger the utter extirpation of religion in the nation  what is the difference betwixt this and being subjected to the power of the church of rome from whence we have reformed if one be an extreme on one hand and one on another it is equally destructive to the truth to have errors settled among us let them be of what nature they will  both are enemies of our church and of our peace and why should it not be as criminal to admit an enthusiast as a jesuit why should the papist with his seven sacraments be worse than the quaker with no sacraments at all why should religioushouses be more intolerable than meeting houses  alas the church of england what with popery on one hand and schismatics on the other how has she been crucified between two thieves  now let us crucify the thieves let her foundations be established upon the destruction of her enemies the doors of mercy being always open to the returning part of the deluded people let the obstinate be ruled with the rod of iron  let all true sons of so holy and oppressed a mother exasperated by her afflictions harden their hearts against those who have oppressed her  and may god almighty put it into the hearts of all the friends of truth to lift up a standard against pride and antichrist that the posterity of the sons of error may be rooted out from the face of this land for ever   a brief explanation of a late pamphlet entitled the shortest way with the dissenters the author professes he thought when he wrote the book he should never need to come to an explication and wonders to find there should be any reason for it  if any man take the pains seriously to reflect upon the contents the nature of the thing and the manner of the style it seems impossible to imagine it should pass for any thing but an irony  that it is free from any seditious design either of stirring up the dissenters to any evil practice by way of prevention much less of animating others to their destruction will be plain i think to any man that understands the present constitution of england and the nature of our government  but since ignorance or prejudice has led most men to a hasty censure of the book and several poor people are like to come under the displeasure of the government for it in justice to those who are in danger to suffer for it in humble submission to the parliament and council who may be offended at it and in courtesy to all mistaken people who it seems have not penetrated into the real design the author presents the world with the native genuine meaning and design of the paper which he hopes may allay the anger of the government or at least satisfy the minds of such as imagine a design to inflame and divide us  the paper without the least retrospect to or concern in the public bills in parliament now depending or any other proceedings of either house or of the government relating to the dissenters whose occasional conformity the author has constantly opposed has its immediate original from the virulent spirits of some men who have thought fit to express themselves to the same effect in their printed books though not in words so plain and at length and by an irony not unusual stands as a fair answer to several books published in this liberty of the press which if they had been handed to the government with the same temper as this has would no question have found the same treatment  the sermon preached at oxford the new association the poetical observator with numberless others have said the same thing in terms very little darker and this book stands fair to let those gentlemen know that what they design can no farther take with mankind than as their real meaning stands disguised by artifice of words but that when the persecution and destruction of the dissenters the very thing they drive at is put into plain english the whole nation will start at the notion and condemn the author to be hanged for his impudence  the author humbly hopes he shall find no harder treatment for plain english without design than those gentlemen for their plain design in duller and darker english  any gentlemen who have patience to peruse the author of the new association will find gallows galleys persecution and destruction of the dissenters are directly pointed at as fairly intended and designed as in this shortest way as had it been real can be pretended there is as much virulence against a union with scotland against king williams government and against the line of hannover there is as much noise and pains taken in mr s  s sermon to blacken the dissenters and thereby to qualify them for the abhorrence of all mankind as is possible  the meaning then of this paper is in short to tell these gentlemen    that it is nonsense to go round about and tell us of the crimes of the dissenters to prepare the world to believe they are not fit to live in a humane society that they are enemies to the government and law to the queen and the public peace and the like the shortest way and the soonest would be to tell us plainly that they would have them all hanged banished and destroyed    but withal to acquaint those gentlemen who fancy the time is come to bring it to pass that they are mistaken for that when the thing they mean is put into plain english the whole nation replies with the assyrian captain is thy servant a dog that he should do these things the gentlemen are mistaken in every partlcular it will not go down the queen the council the parliament are all offended to have it so much as suggested that such a thing was possible to come into their minds and not a man but a learned mercer not far from the corner of fanchurchstreet has been found to approve it  thus a poor author has ventured to have all mankind call him villain and traitor to his country and friends for making other peoples thoughts speak in his words  from this declaration of his real design he humbly hopes the lords of her majestys council or the house of parliament will be no longer offended and that the poor people in trouble on this account shall be pardoned or excused  he also desires that all men who have taken offense at the book mistaking the authors design will suffer themselves to think again and withhold their censure till they find themselves qualified to make a venture like this for the good of their native country  as to expressions which seem to reflect upon persons or nations he declares them to be only the cant of the nonjuring party exposed and thinks it very necessary to let the world know that it is their usual language with which they treat the late king the scotch union and the line of hannover  it is hard after all that this should not be perceived by all the town that not one man can see it either churchman or dissenter  that not the dissenters themselves can see that this was the only way to satisfy them that whatever the parliament might think fit to do to restrain occasional communion persecution and destruction was never in their intention and that therefore they have nothing to do but to be quiet and easy  for any thing in the manner of the paper which may offend either the government parliament or private persons the author humbly begs their pardon and protesting the honesty of his intention resolves if the poor people now in trouble may be excused to throw himself upon the favor of the government rather than others shall be ruined for his mistakes  a dialogue between a dissenter and the observator concerning the shortest way with the dissenters dissen pray sir are you the author of the observator   obser suppose it sir what then   dis nay dont be angry are you the reputed author a come off you taught me in one of your papers about mr f   obs and what then   dis why i wanted a little discourse with you   obs if it be civil as you say you are welcome but you begin odly   dis my questions may be blunt but you are not bound to answer them but let that be as you like em  first pray who do you reckon is the author of this devilish book called the shortest way   obs i shall answer most of your questions with a question i believe and begin with you here  do you think my name is mr bellamy that you take me for an informer read the gazette there you have the man with the sharp chin and a dutch nose   dis ay but sir we begin to doubt that is not the true author that he has been only made the tool of some other party who now they find the world exasperated at it have slipped out of the noose and left him it we begin to be afraid the thing is a reality and there is such a design on foot   obs your answer like parson jacobs text ought to be taken a pieces and explained    if you are not sure he is the author you dissenters have done him a great deal of wrong for you have railed at him more than all the rest of the world and charged him with more crimes than it is well possible for one man to be guilty of    and yet by supposing him not to be the author yon suppose him to be very honest to his friends that he bears all this without discovering them    as for your fears of a real design to put the shortest way in practice upon you no question there are abundance of people in the world who would be glad there was not one of you left i believe no body doubts it   dis pray who do you think they are   obs sir your humble servant no bellamy i tell you not i sir if i were in a plot with the devil i le never evidence besides sir i have no mind to have my nose and chin described but if you please i will answer you negatively who i believe is not concerned in it   dis that may be some satisfaction sir   obs not the queen sir not the parliament not the council not the army not the ministers of state not the government   dis thou art a safe man thou wilt never go to newgate for negatives   obs no sir nor for positives neither if i can help it but you have had your will at catechizing and i ought to have my turn let me ask you a few questions too   dis you are welcome   obs pray why are you dissenters angry at the book called the shortest way it is a little mysterious sir that tho the church men are affronted because twas written against them and the dissenters are affronted because it is wrote against them too i dont well understand it one sort must be fools that is certain   dis i dont care whether i understand it or no he is a rogue a villain and i wish the government had him if i knew where he was i would deliver him up and abate them the  0    obs spoken like a dissenter truly so that i find you are angry at him because you dont understand him and the government because they do   dis you are so sharp upon me i do understand a little too i understand he meddld with that he had nothing to do with and he is a man they say who has been the occasion of all this persecution which is coming upon us by railing at occasional conformity   obs if he exposed you for occasional conformity it is what you ought to have rectified your selves that you need not have been exposed for it and in that he was your friend for had you took the hint and exploded the practice there had been no need of an act of parliament to force you to it   dis but what had he to do with that   obs nay what had mr how to do to meddle with it afterward i will assure you his name is down in my pocketbook and when any man in england defends a cause worse i will put his name out and put to others name in but pray sir why do you call this bringing persecution upon you do you suppose the occasional bill will be a persecution   dis without doubt it will   obs what sort of persecution can you call it it cannot be a persecution for conscience sake   dis why so sir   obs why pray sir suppose one of your brethren dissenters who can go to the meeting to day and to the church to morrow take the sacrament to day fitting and to morrow to get a good place go to church and take it kneeling wipe his mouth and go home to dinner and so to meeting again suppose this gentleman should be put up for sherriff or lord mayor can this man pretend conscience not to conform i tell you sir mr how must make a better answer to the matter before i can be convinced you may call it persecution but it can never be for conscience sake   dis persecution is persecution let it be for what sake it will every man ought to be at liberty   obs ay that is true i am for liberty for every man to serve god as is most agreeable to his conscience but this is not serving god at all besides sir i could easily make it appear this act is for your advantage if you were a sort of people to be convinced   dis pray how sir   obs why sir it will purge you of all your half in half professors that is one thing then it will put all those gentlemen into a capacity of being in places and parliaments who though by this act they are separated from you and rejoined to the church because they can conform will still be friends to your interest in all public concerns and therefore had i been to word the bill so as to have done most harm it should have excluded all that ever were dissenters and have forced you to continue so and not have accepted your return to the church without a public repentance   obs well well you may persuade us it is for our advantage but we dont like it and therefore we hate him for meddling with it for what had he to do with it   obs about as much as you and i have to do with him if a man meddles with what does not concern him that is his fault and if we who really have nothing to do with him meddle with him that is our fault let the government alone with him have you nothing else to talk no   dis why all the town has talked of him as well as we   obs yes and reckoned up all his faults all the sins that ever he committed in his life and abundance more be the man who he will and what he will i dont see but the best of us would be loath all the faults we have should be reckoned up and writ in our foreheads as his are   dis oh he has been a most wicked wretch   obs you force a man to be an advocate for one he has no kindness for a wicked wretch you say why has he been a thief a murderer   dis no no i dont mean that way   obs what has he been clipper or coyner   dis no no nor that neither   obs has he been a whoremaster or a drunkard or a swearer   dis no i cannot say so neither but he broke and cannot pay his debts   obs if you had said he had broke and will not pay his debts you had said more to the purpose  but i must do one piece of justice to the man though i love him no better than you do that is this that meeting a gentleman in a coffeehouse where i and every body else was railing at him the gentleman took us up with this short speech  gentlemen said he i know this d foe as well as any of you and i was one of his creditors and i compounded with him and discharged him fully and several years afterward he sent for me and though he was clearly discharged he paid me all the remainder of his debt voluntarily and of his own accord and he told me that as fast as god should enable him he intended to do so with every body when he had done he desired me to set my hand to a paper to acknowledge it which i readily did and found a great many names to the paper before me and i think my self bound to own it though i am no friend to the book he has wrote no more than you what do you think of this story   dis think of it i dont belive it   obs i cannot help that nor i care not whether you do or no but i assure you after i heard it i never railed at him any more   dis ay but i will rail at him for all that   obs you dissenters are in something like case with the pharisees when the question was put to them by our savior about johns baptism whether it was from heaven or of men if a man should ask you of the shortest way was it wrote for you or against you if you should say for us you would be asked why then are you so mad with the author and if you should say against you the people would laugh at you for all men but you see into it and that a dissenter wrote it you must say therefore we cannot tell and consequently that you rail at the author for you cannot tell what   dis but we dont count him a dissenter   obs he has all the marks of a dissenter upon him but want of brains   dis why are we so empty of brains pray   obs there is reason for it god has given you equivalents   dis i dont understand you   obs that is a further testimony of your being a dissenter why if you will have it take it i say god almighty would have seemed unkind to you if he had not given you a great deal of grace for he has given you but little wit   dis well i hope they will take him still i should be glad to see him hanged for it i am sure he deserves it i heard one met him a little while ago would i had been there   obs alone do you mean sir or to have helped the other   diss any how so i could but have taken him   obs ay and they say twas one of your own party too and one that would fain have got the  0 l but that he drew upon him frighted him out of his wits and made him down of his knees and swear that if ever he met him again he should shut his eyes till he was half a mile off him   diss i dont think he is such a fighting fellow   obs do you know him   diss no not i   obs so i thought by your charity and good nature i know him not neither but the man has the government upon his back already and if they take him they will avenge your quarrel for you let him alone it is ingenerous as i said before in print to triumph over a man in his affliction twas but a little while ago he wrote a book that pleased you and then you cried him up as much as now you cry him down   dis what book pray   obs why the new test of church of england loyalty   dis did he write that book   obs i told you i was no informer go ask mr bellamy   dis why truly that was a good thing i liked it fully twas well done but this cursed shortestway is the devil he must be turned rogue now what ever he was then   obs why this it is to oblige a dissenter if you serve them a hundred times it is well but once get your head in the pillory for them and they will be the first to palt you with rotten eggs what cannot you set down one good thing and one bad and balance with him you understand accounts well enough but you dissenters are like a shopkeeper i knew who having traded  0 year with a gentleman and served all his family and gotten a great deal of money by him at last the poor gentleman fell to decay and owing him  0 s the shopkeeper abused him and called him all the knaves and rogues for cheating him of  0 s   dis no no this has spoilt all   obs well but well go back further with you there is the reformation of manners and the trueborn englishman there he pleased you for certain for he is for reforming your magistrates   dis i dont understand them i am for reformation as much as any body   obs but what say you to the legion paper   dis ay that was a good thing indeed   obs well but if he had been taken in doing that would you not have called him as many rogues then as you do now   dis no indeed should i not   obs but i dont find you call him one rogue the less for it now and that is hard   dis well but you see he denies it and challenges you to prove it   obs ay deny it i told you he was no fool indeed i am not glad i printed it for though it is charged upon him by common fame i am not for hanging men upon suppositions as you do   dis well you do well and i think it is a little hard the man is gone and though he has done ill he might mean no harm and so let him alone i reckon you will not be long before you follow him   obs and when i am gone you will call me as many rogues as you do him will not you   dis no it may be i shall not but i can tell you of some that do already   obs it is all one to me common fame like a common strumpet jilts every body but methinks slander and reproach out of the mouth of a dissenter comes with some more than common ill savor   dis they think they have good reason for it upon you   obs and i think not pray what are their good reasons   dis for abusing your friends   obs my friends prithee who are they i know but very few i have and i am very sure i never abused them   dis they all agree you would not be permitted to write so long but the party would have ruffled you before now only you court them and please them by a sidewind with your railing at king williams friends sometimes   obs king williams enemies you mean look sir i have as much veneration for the memory of king william as any of you and do but once prove them to be king williams friends and i will own all you say and recant all i have wrote   dis it is easy to prove they were his friends   obs pray sir dont you tax me with abusing king william and abuse him your self i have proved sufficiently they were the nations enemies now if you can prove the nations enemies were k williams friends you will make a fine spot of work on it indeed   dis the nations enemies that is because being in great places they got as much money as they could and so would you do and so have all the favorites that ever were or will be   obs when ever favorites did do or shall get money by rapine or injustice and oppression of the subject they were and will be the nations enemies and their sovereigns too   dis but what have you to do with it it is none of your business   obs it is every mans business to discover mischief fraud and ill design as much as every man who first spies fire has a duty upon him to raise the neighbors i am a subject and am cheated among the rest   dis you cheated why what have you to lose   obs why my liberty which you said but now every man had a right to and my money when i have it what is that to you how little or much i have and how do you know how much i may have hereafter   dis nay they say you get money by railing and so you may soon be rich   obs then i rail for something and you get none and yet you rail pray who has the best excuse for it   dis he that has the best reason for it not he that gets the most money by it   obs i believe if you could get money by railing you would count it the best reason in the world   dis why so   obs because you are so willing to rail at any body when you know not for what nor why and charge people with crimes they never committed of all your christian duties you make the least use of your charity   dis why since you put so hard i can tell the time when you abused king william himself as openly as you durst speak it or any body dare print particularly in a poem of yours called the foreigners   obs how do you prove twas mine   dis nay they say twas yours you were the reputed author as you said in another case   obs i tell you there is no people in the world so forward to condemn a man upon hear say as the dissenters when they have a mind to slander a man they take every thing upon trust it is their shortest way   dis these scribbling people are always meddling with things they have nothing to do with what have you to do with kings and favorites or that the other fellow with the shortest way you pamphleteers are always quacking with the state   obs come let us turn the tables now it is my play what have you to do with acts of parliaments you dissenters are always thrusting in your oar too what have you to do to talk of persecution and acts against occasional conformity you are mountebanking with the state too in every coffeehouse pray meddle with your own business   dis we shall have to do with it when we feel it   obs i am persuaded if you were put to it severely few of you would stay to feel it at least few of your wealthy members few of mr hows mind few of such dissenters as go from meeting to church and can backstroke and forestroke communicate on both sides   dis i wish they may not but we are afraid twill not only be a persecution but a very long one   obs why then you are beholding to the author we talked of for you see he is for putting you out of your pain but i am of a different opinion from you in several of your darkest thoughts about persecution   dis pray what is your opinion   obs   i am of opinion that if your enemies were true masters of politics they would not persecute you at all i take you to be a declining party toleration will be your ruin and if god in mercy to you dont send a persecution among you you are lost you will all dwindle back into the church again your old stock of ministers dye off your owens mantons charnocks clarksons baxters and batess are gone and pray what can you name out of the new generation of your leyden doctors fit to succeed them    the occasional bill at once carries off your wealthy members who are the support of your clergy and as mr williams very well observed at saltershall if the rich ones forsake you the party will be weakened so as to make you fear the dissolution of the whole indeed the gentleman was in the right if the wealthy members quit the congregations twill make poor work for the ministers and they like other people generally do their work best where they have best wages   dis i thought you had loved the dissenters better than to abuse them at this rate   obs i dont abuse them i wish them clear of all their hypocrites and that there were none among them but what were dissenters for mere conscience if that were so twould make their enemies at peace with them they would never be persecuted the government would cherish them and be as tender of them as they would desire but to be plain with you it is your own pride and pushing at great things has made you obnoxious and withal your discovering by an alternate double faced conscience that while you pretend to dissent and to have tender consciences you can nevertheless conform if you please this makes your enemies suspect your honesty and apprehend more trick and design in you than i hope they need nay this gives your enemies such advantage against you as you can never answer   dis i do not think any man ought to be confined by laws and acts of parliaments about his religion   obs it may be i think so too but men ought to be honest to their own principles whether there were laws or no and if i see a man pretend he cannot conform and upon occasion i find he can it makes me suspect his honesty and if i once think a man a knave i am not to blame to fence my self against him by laws i tell you an act of parliament to keep you honest can never be called persecution   dis ay if there was no more in it   obs if there be any more in it i wish there was not i am sure i know not what is in it and i believe you dont neither pray have you seen the bill   dis no not i but i hear it is a very terrible bill   obs true to the old way still always to judge before you hear indeed i forgot to ask you but on my conscience i dont believe you ever read the book of the shortest way come be honest   dis read it why the very outside of that is enough for any man to read i thank god i spend my time better   obs i think you ought to spend your time better too than to give your verdict upon any thing before you read it   dis you are a strange man why every body says it is a horrible book and not fit to be read but what is that to this act of parliament   obs why thus much it is that you cry out persecution from this act of parliament and there is not a word of persecution in it   dis i think it is persecution if i must not be at liberty to worship god as i think fit   obs still you are without book why you may be a dissenter all the days of your life and go to meetings as long as you live and never be troubled by this act   dis i cannot imagine what you mean why i must pay god knows what if i am seen at a meeting   obs ay sir that is after you have strained your conscience from the meeting to the church after you have bobd your religion to be sheriff of london or the like and then want to go back again but if you to keep your conscience can be content to be without these gay things called places you may be a dissenter to the end of the chapter so that this will only be a persecution for honor sake not for conscience sake and never fall upon you neither till you bring it upon your self   dis well i hope it will not pass for all that   obs i hope so too but if it dont it must be the lords doing and it will be mavelous in our eyes   dis the house of lords you mean i suppose   obs i must mean as you will have me let it be how it will but if i hope it will not pass it is from different reasons with you   dis pray your reasons   obs because i am against and ever shall be imposing any religious ordinance or part of worship as a qualification for any temporal employment let the princes be at full liberty to employ who or what sort of their subjects they see cause   such impositions are a bait to people to banter their consciences and to comply with that for a preferment which otherwise they would not and so seem to lead them into temptation but i dont know the contents of the bill therefore i will say no more   diss and i would not have it pass because i take it to be a foundation of persecution it is but pulling down the toleration next and then we are all undone   obs you faithless and perverse generation has not the queen promised to maintain your toleration besides what is that to the bill   diss why should not we be afraid of it as well as some of the churchparty have the confidence to hope it nay to condemn the toleration as antichristian and threaten us with the having it overthrown   obs why these are for the shortest way you ought to rail at them as much as you do at the man with the hook nose and sharp chin and more too and no doubt but if you would turn informer you might hook their noses into the gazett too to be sure the government would not allow of it they would never suffer the queen to be so affronted   diss i dont know how it is such things are suffered daily i heard our parson the other day say at a public dinner twoud never be well with england till some course was taken to reconcile all dissenters to the church longest way or sherrest twas all one to him he said he hoped to see the church flourish without them and a great deal more and worse than this   diss that was a topping highflying gentleman indeed and why did you not acquaint the government with it   diss what do you think i am an informer my name is not bellamy any more than yours but pray why do you make so strange of it dont we hear daily people expressing their high flying hopes that a parliament in scotland will restore episcopacy there and yet has not the queen given her word and published it in our gazett that she will maintain the presbyterian government there   obs has she so then though they have the impudence to hope you ought not to have the ignorance to fear it the queen gave her word to maintain it be not slow of heart to believe she has taken up the famous motto of q elizabeth semper eadem and can you so much as doubt she will deface it for a few scotch bishops   diss i am sorry for my fears i beg her majestys pardon there are so many turns and windings in law and state matters that we know not what to say to things   obs say why a promise is a promise and you may depend upon it she has never broke her word with us yet   diss aye but what if the parliament should do it   obs nay if the parliament does it we do it our selves   diss very good so that we may be undone and the toleration bill taken away and yet the queen be as good as her word still   obs yes sir so you may whenever an act of parliament becomes so without the royal assent and when do you think that can be   diss why then these highflying churchmen are very impudent fellows to suggest such things of the queen and to bully us with overturning the toleration and put us in such fears of what they will do to us when it can never be done without the qeens acting so directly against her royalpromise   obs well and what then   dis why i think they ought to be used as they used the author of the shortest way gazetted and a reward for the discoverer   obs or as you have used him rather viz rail at them for being of your own side you dissenters are rare fellows for punishments if god should have no more mercy on you than you show to all men that offend you we should have plagues pestilence and famine every year upon us so now you are come about again these highflying churchmen have bullyd you with the fears of losing your toleration come confess   diss yes   obs and made you distrrst the queens veracity   diss yes god and the queen forgive us   obs and have terrified you with what things they will do when they have pulled down your antichristian toleration have they not   dis ay ay   obs and so you thought the shortest way was wrote to make a beginning with you and to set the dragoons of the church upon your backs did you not   dis it is very true   obs and continued of the same mind like an ignoramus though you heard twas wrote by one of your own party   dis indeed i did   obs now pray after so much patience as i have had with you have a little with me and if i can i will set you right in your thoughts of these things  there are a sort of people among the dissenters who can either dissent or conform as they find their inclinations or interest rather directs them these by their wealth and interest have always put themselves into good places and qualified themselves for that purpose by taking the sacrament of these people even the most moderate church men have an ill opinion and truly so have two thirds of your own friends for it looks as if they were men of no principles at all  against these men the act against occasional conformity is principally designed and if there was nothing else in the bill i believe no good man would be against it  concerning these things two sorts of people have been very grossly mistaken and upon their mistakes have proceeded to act very foolishly  first the high flying church party begun to think all was a going their own way and that the government would fall in with them and do your business for you and away they run with the notion and preach you down and print you down and talk you down like mad men there is sermon upon sermon pamphlet upon pamphlet one says you are all rogues and hypocrites another says you are enemies to the government one flies at the toleration and tells the world it is destructive to the nations happiness and the politicians must pull it down another says it is antichristian and we cannot be true sons of the church of england if we dont pull it down others like harebraind huntsmen that over run the hounds roar you down with full cry till they run themselves out of breath others are for having you deprived of voices in elections of parliaments in hopes of arriving to that blessed day when they shall have a parliament of their own mind and thus they run before they are sent and without reflecting upon their ill grounded zeal without examining any authorities other than their passions without regard to good manners taking no notice of the preamble of the act of parliament which declares against persecution or the honor and sacred promise of her majesty given to make her subjects easy they blow up the fire of persecution and destruction whether the government will or no  you are the next sort of people who are mistaken for being naturally a little hypish as the beaus call it troubled with the spleen and hypocondriack vapors this cloud of raillery so darkened your understanding that you presently take these people and the queen these people and the government these people and the parliament to be all of a mind and the queen having displact all your friends as it is but just that all princes should employ who they please and the parliament falling on your occasional conformers and this book of the shortest way coming out altogether the high church party thundered at you from the press and the pulpit away you run with the notion that you are all to be blown up that all these things aimed at your destruction and that fire and faggot was at the door  but the government is steady and the queen still has maintained her motto the parliament steers in the middle way going about to restrain but not to destroy you and taking no notice either of the heat of one party or folly of the other they hold the balance of your liberty between your exorbitant license and the other partys unchristian fury and in my opinion thus far are you safe   dis but then why has not the government thought fit to disown the zeal of these highflyers by punishment and make examples of some of them   obs i told you the dissenters were all for punishments and examples for the same reason that they have not punished you for supecting the queens honesty to her word charging the parliament with going about to persecute you and the like for this reason because they are more merciful than both parties deserve   dis twould have convinced us very plainly of two very significant things first that there is such a design and then that the authors of it received no countenance from court   obs good manners and common justice ought to have convinced you of the last and your author of the shortest way to his cost opened your eyes in the first if you had not wilfully shut them against the light    good manners would inform you not to doubt the word of your prince till you had some reason from her majesty her self    common justice commands us to suppose every person just and honest till something appears to the contrary and it is a very unchristian uncharitable way of teaching the queen that because some of the high churchmen have had the indiscretion without her authority to swagger you out of your senses therefore you must suppose her promise broken and her word of no value  the author of the shortest way comes with a lanthorn for you and he sums up all the black things this high party had published into one general and if you had any eyes you might learn two things from which he is like to pay dear enough for teaching you  first from the general abhorrence mankind showed of the book you might learn that the destruction of our party is a cruelty not to be found in the english nature  secondly from the outcry made against it by that party in particular you might learn who they were that were touched in the book and where the design against them lay  as to the quarrel you dissenters have at the book that is a mystery no man can unriddle but your selves it is like mr meads wheel within a wheel and a further testimony to the world that you are a most unaccountable people whose ways are past finding out   dis so that you would go about to persuade me the book was writ of our side   obs first sir it is hard to know what side you are of and  secondly sir i know you too well to go about to persuade you to any thing whose peculiar talent is to be unperswadeable but if you will please to answer me a few questions you may perhaps persuade your self of something or other   dis what questions   obs why are the high churchmen angry with him while at the same time they openly declare it is the only way to deal with you and what they would feign be at   dis truly you puzzle me a little there   obs they are angry because they take the book as the author meant it and you because you take it as he wrote it they as he meant viz to expose them and though they are heartily willing to do you a kindness that way and have shown their good will by their words yet knowing they wanted power to execute it and being conscious to themselves that the government was not of their opinion they are enraged to have all their designs laid open in minature and an abridgment communicated to the world in true billingsgate   dis there may be some truth in this but pray why then is the government so angry with him i believe i have puzzled you now   obs no no the government may have reasons to be angry that you nor i know not of nor have nothing to do with but what if i should suppose  that the government not thinking any person could be so barbarous to harbor such a villainous design as the book suggests are displeased at it as an affront done to the church of england to father principles of cruelty and destruction upon her members which they are not guilty off  i say if i suppose this to be a reason i believe you cannot suppose a better   dis i confess i begin to have better thoughts of the government than i had   obs i am glad of that   dis i begin to hope they will not persecute us now and as for occasional conformity what care i i shall never be lord mayor or common councilman if i am called to it it is time enough to come off then   obs god almighty is wonderfully beholden to you when he calls you from a middle state to a good place you will take it for granted he calls you from the meeting to the church and you will be sure to come but i tell you you ought to be so far from the fear of a persecution that if you have any respect to your party you ought to pray for a persecution upon them or ye are all undone   dis why thou art mad thou art for the shortest way   obs no no i ant for such persecution neither but i told you my mind before i am sure you have received more damage in your interest as dissenters and more weakened your reputation as well as your number since the late tolleration than ever your enemies did for you by all the penal laws informers fines and prisons of the last persecution   dis well but here is another danger upon us that we have not talk of yet and fear it will come upon us too   obs pray what is that   dis we are afraid that this restless party will overthrow our settlement for they do not stick to talk that way   obs we afraid who do you mean by we are not the church of england as much concerned in the settlement as you and more too as they are the major part of the nation and we if you will give me leave to talk your way we protestants fear nothing for our settlement and for this i will give you a quotation from the man with the hook nose and sharp chin it may be you will not like it because of the author but his words are these the settlement of the crown says he is the basis of our religion laws and liberties this is the solid bottom on which we all stand and of which with respect to civil right may be said other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid it is the rock on which we are all built and that stone of which according to the scripture it may without profaneness be said whosoever it falls upon he will be broken to pieces but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder  it is the last thing the people of england will part with after all their estates wives and children churches and houses are destroyed  it is the pledge of the divine goodness to the nation which they purchased at the expense of  0 millions of money and the blood of above  00000 englishmen in eleven years war  twas one of the great things king william did for us and the treasure god and his majesty left in our hands in trust for our posterity which if we part with our children will curse our memory and digg us out of our graves  it is a thing so sacred the dissolving of it cannot be mentioned without a crime nor so much as intended without being guilty of treason in the most intense degree  it is the solid prop upon which stands her present majestys throne and the right and just title she has to govern us  it is like the two pillars in the house of dagon whoever pulls them down will like sampson be buried in the ruins and pull the whole nation upon their heads  i fear nothing for this settlement the parliament of england are the trustees for the seeing it forth coming to the people of england and a parliament of england will never betray their trust  the parliament will not and all the rest of humane power dare not attempt to dissolve it no weapon formed against it can prosper   dis is this done by our shortest way man   obs the very same   dis well i shall love him the better for it but there is one thing more still what say you to the prince of wales if ever he comes again you will be hanged that is for certain   obs and if ever we let him come we ought all to be hanged i can do no better than refer you to the same author  the act of settlement says he and the prince of wales are the two bucketts keep one but up and the other must be down and put the one down and the other comes up of course there can be no pretense made to alter or dispose the settlement but the bringing in the prince of wales therefore whoever they are that mention it we ought to suppose they would be so understood   dis so that you are of opinion we are in no danger of our settlement   obs indeed i am of the opinion your fears both of the prince of wales and of altering the settlement and of persecution are all groundless and equally so i would only advise the dissenters to be honest to their own principles if they can conform they ought to do it if they cannot no body forces them let them dissent and not for the desire of preferment bring such a scandal upon their integrity as if they were men of no principles it is scandalous to the very name of a dissenter and injurious to all the rest of that body who are honest and conscientious   and so i bid you farewell lex talionis or an enquiry into the most proper ways to prevent the persecution of the protestants in france evrope has now for nine years past been afflicted with a bloody a cruel and a destructive war carried on with a vast effusion of blood and treasure and in all parts of it managed with more eagerness and fury than any war among the european princes ever was in the memory of man  the french who are masters of address used all the skill and cunning with the roman catholic princes especially those of italy to have made it pass for a war of religion thinking by that fineness to have drawn them off from the confederacy but innocent xi who twas likely knew as much of religion and the interest of the church as the statesmen of france saw through that artifice and readily agreed with the emperor and the king of spain that the growing greatness of france and the measures laid for the subjecting europe to her government were really more dangerous things and of more immediate consequence to the public liberty than the matter of religion could be and therefore though the court of rome made some seeming difficulties at first yet the french having thrown off the mask and fallen upon his catholic confederate the duke of savoy the most bigoted romanist made no scruple to entertain the heretic soldiers to recall the banished vaudois to fight under the command of protestant generals to accept of the subsidial supplies of protestant money and the protection of protestant armies thereby evidently declaring to the world that this was a war of state not of religion and that the real interest of princes is to preserve themselves and their subjects against a too powerful invader by leagues and assistances let their religious interests be what they will  nor have the protestant princes though their forces in this confederacy have been much superior been backward to push on the common interest with their utmost vigor but have with extraordinary cheerfulness assisted the roman catholic confederates with their armies fleets and moneys witness the subsidies paid to the duke of savoy by the english and dutch the army maintained under the command of duke schombergh in english pay in piedmont the forces shipped from england to catalonia to aid the spaniard which saved the city of barcelona a whole year witness also the english fleet wintering at cadiz under admiral russel the squadron sent to the west indies to relieve carthagena and indeed the whole series of the war has been one continual instance of the safety and protection the roman catholic countries have enjoyed by the sword and power of the protestant interest  so that it has been apparent beyond the power of contradiction that this has been a war of state not a war of religion nor can i imagine generally speaking that it can ever be the interest of the powers of europe take them together to commence a war of religion for though it is true that the pope always exalted both his power and credit in the blind ages of bigoted devotion by his crusadoes and holy expeditions yet since the world has more years over its head and the cheat has been discovered interest has prevailed too much upon devotion to be deceived any more at that rate and the reformed kingdoms of europe are too potent to be used so any more  it is true the protestant religion has lost ground in france and that kingdom where once the protestants were strong enough to contend with their governors for their liberty is now wholly roman at least seems to be so but notwithstanding that i believe the protestant interest in europe very well able to stand a shock with the popish when ever the pope thinks fit to publish another bloody jubilee and display the standard of st peter against st paul and not to descend to particulars i shall only draw up the several kingdoms on each side who would form this great division in case of such a war  on the roman catholic side  there would be the emperor the pope the king of france the king of spain the king of portugal the king of poland the princes of italy five electoral princes of germany and the catholic cantons of swisserland  on the protestant side  the king of england king of denmark king of sweden the czar of moscovy states of holland three electoral princes of germany but those by far the strongest the protestant cantons of swisserland the grisons hungarians transilvanians and moldaviaens  in the first place i think it would easily be granted that the english dutch dane and swede united would be able to maintain so absolute a dominion of the seas as would entirely ruin the negotiation of the catholic party beggar their merchants starve their islands and destroy all their trade they should never be able to build a ship without leave their ports should be bombarded and destroyed their open country be ruined by descents and all their coasts continually harrassd and alarmed by fleets and volant parties  what the armies at land could do i referr to the history of the present war and of gustavus adolphus king of sweden who barely on a war of religion and with only his own single force and the protestant princes of germany who were then much weaker than they are now in two years and a half passed the rhine and the danube and shook the imperial crown on the head of ferdinand the second  it would take up too much room in this short treatise to consider the proportion of the force of these nations in general it is true that the weight of the force of the catholic party lies in the power of the french who must in such a case be the bulwark and support of their cause  as to the spaniard he would as he has in all cases have work enough to secure his own the empires separated from the protestant party with the swede dane brandenburghers saxons and all the prince of the augustane confession on its front with the protestants of upper hungaria and transylvania in the rear with the switz and grisons in the flank would be very hard bestead having no power but the bavarian and the small electorates of ments triers and cologne which are of no consideration to uphold it some support might be drawn from italy indeed but the french must give a powerful assistance or the emperor would be devoured in two campaigns the english dutch and eastern germans as the lunenburghers of hannover and brunswick would be the opposites to the french on this side and there the contention would be strongest  i believe no wise man wishes for so universal a distraction as such a war would make in europe but it is needful to suppose such a thing in order to examine whether we ought to apprehend any danger from it in case such an attempt should ever be made in europe for it is apparent some princes of the roman catholic party have will enough to such an enterprise and the pope would be forward enough to set it on foot if he were but sure of the success  the glorious peace of reswick in which all the world must acknowledge the french have been very much reduced has but one clause that any way eclipses the honor of its conclusion on the protestant side and that is that it left the poor protestant subjects of the king of france without any shelter from the violences of their persecutors as if the protestant princes had so much excluded the interests of religion from the articles that they had not one compassionate thought for their distressed persecuted brethren it is true the war was wholly a war of state as is before noted and the invasion of property was the occasion of it and therefore the surrender of luxemburgh to the spaniard who is a roman catholic nay a few villages in the chattelany of aeth made more bustle in the treaty than the restoration of three hundred thousand banished christians to their country and estates  some have presumed to say that had the restoration of the edict of nants been insisted on with the same vigor as the duchy of lorrain it would as easily have been obtained and these people among whom some of the french refugees are of that mind think the protestant interest was not so much considered in that treaty as it ought to have been i could easily answer such objectors by telling them that the ground of this war being only matter of right to reduce the power of france to a balance and to oblige her to restore what she had by force and injustice taken from her neighbors this being obtained the end was answered and the confederate princes had no farther pretense for a war as to the protestant refugees they were the subjects of the king of france and strictly speaking with respect of princes no body had any thing to do with it let him use them how he would  besides to have made it an article of the peace it could not be expected that the catholic branches of the confederacy would have insisted on it or indeed have desired it and the treaty being managed in one body by the resolutions and measures of several princes and states in congress the catholic princes would have immediately protested against it and the union must have been dissolved  so that there was no room to espouse the interests of the protestant subjects of france in the general treaty any other way than by intercession with their king to use them mercifully and this has been done by all parties though hitherto without success  it remains now to examine what methods are further to be used in order to oblige the king of france to use his protestant subjects with more humanity and if possible either to preserve them that peace and enjoyment of their properties and estates which is their natural right or to procure them some other equivalent which may give them some kind of satisfaction and repose  to commence a war against the king of france for the prosecution of his protestant subjects seems to be very unjust because speaking of right and wrong we are not interested in the quarrel i make no question but the protestants of france themselves have by the laws of nature and reason a right to defend their own possessions and inheritances and to maintain themselves in them by force if they had a power and by the same rule might by strength of hand recover and take possession of their own rights be they never so just only thus far it is plain that by the particular article of the peace of reswick respecting the kings of england and france england is foreclosed from such an attempt both sides having expressly stipulated not to assist the subjects of either against their sovereign the fourth article of the said treaty ptoviding as follows viz  and since the most christian king was never more desirous of any thing than that the peace be firm and inviolable the said king promises and agrees for himself and his successors that he will on no account whatsoever disturb the said king of great britain in the free possession of the kingdoms countries lands or dominions which he now enjoys and therefore engages his honor upon the faith and word of a king that he will not give or afford any assistance directly or indirectly to any enemy or enemies of the said king of great britain and that he will in no manner whatsoever favor the conspiracies or plots which any rebels or illdisposed persons may in any place excite or contrive against the said king and for that end promises and engages that he will not assist with arms ammunition provisions ships or money or in any other way by sea or land any person or persons who shall hereafter under any pretense whatsoever disturb or molest the said king of great britain in the free and full possession of his kingdoms countries lands and dominions the king of great britain likewise promises and engages for himself and successors kings of great britain that he will inviolably do and perform the same toward the said most christian king his kingdoms countries lands and dominions  there seems to be but one way left either to make any amends to these poor desolate people or to bring to pass their readmission i do not say that the princes of europe will find it their interest to put it in practice any more than i believe it is really the interest of the king of france to ruin so many thousand families of his peaceable subjects i mean the old standard law of retaliation but if it might be a means to reestablish those poor people in peace and liberty the sacrificing ten thousand families of other persons as innocent as them seems to be a justice their present case calls for  lex talionis seems to me to be the foundationlaw of right and wrong the scripture is full of instances of this nature adonibezek agag declare it to be agreeable to the divine method of executive justice the reason of rewards and punishments seems to be wholly measured by it and if exactly administered it carries so convictive a force that no person who ever fell under the severest part of it could object against the execution of it adonibezek abovementioned made a confession of the justice of his punishment when his thumbs and great toes were cut off as a retaliation of his barbarities judge     and samuels return upon agag that as his sword had made women childless so should his mother be childless among women declares both the reason and the justice of gods decree against him   samuel xv     it is true this retaliation is strictly personal and all retaliation ought to be so if possible but in some cases it differs and where a personal retaliation is not practicable then people are considered in collective bodies nations families and states thus in a war the subjects of either party account is very justifiable to make themselves satisfaction for injuries received on any of the subjects of the contrary party though the wrong particularly suffered is not chargeable on those particular persons who suffer for it  by the same rule it seems justifiable if we cast the whole body of europe into two sorts popish and protestant that while the one part commit hostilities and depredations on the other the injured party should have a right of retaliation on any member of the same body of what nation or government soever they shall be where the power is properly put into their hands for power in such a case may pass for a sufficient right of directing the said punishment since nothing but want of power interrupts its being personal  the french king has given a challenge to all the protestant princes of europe in his present usage of the reformed churches of france he has carried on though not with much success a war for above eight years against the whole united power of europe at last he has made a peace not at all to his advantage nor much for his honor and now the war of state is at an end he seems to be beginning a war of religion and that he may lay the foundation of it safely he has began it upon his own subjects  i cannot imagine why all the protestant princes of europe should not think themselves concerned in this invasion of their religion since nothing is more certain than that they are all struck at though more remotely and by all the rules of human policy prevention ought to extend as far as the evil is designed  if the weakening the protestant interest in general were only the design the strengthening that interest ought to be the care of the other besides the papists are the aggressors as they always have been and the injustice of their cause so great that they have hardly ever attempted to make any other pretenses for all their barbarities than the absolute will and pleasure of their omnipotent monarch who will have but one religion within his dominions  i confess to me it seems very proper for the ease of all parties that religion should really divide the whole body of europe and that all the roman catholics and all the protestants if they could but agree it among themselves should live by themselves that if the french king will have no protestants in his dominion the protestants should suffer no roman catholics in theirs and when all parties are withdrawn to their own sort and the division completed let the roman catholics begin a war of religion as soon as they please  it is in my opinion the unjustest thing in the world that since the spaniards and italians suffer no protestants to live amongst them but the bloody inquisition destroys them and the french have dragoond three hundred thousand of their protestant subjects to mass and hurried three hundred thousand more out of their country to seek comfort from the charity of neighbor states the duke of savoy has exiled all his protestant vaudois and hardly any popish country admit the protestants among them some few parts of germany excepted yet the protestantgovernments at the same time suffer three millions of papists to live among them and enjoy their liberties and estates unmolested  nor is this all the protestants of france savoy and hungary have been persecuted under the assurances of the most solemn treaties the most sacred edicts and the firmest peace that could be made they have never their enemies themselves being judges been guilty of the breach of their faith or loyalty henry iii of france acknowledged it when he had recourse to them for protection against his own mutinous catholic subjects the duke of savoy acknowledged it in his speech to those vaudois whom he had released out of the citadel of turin we never read of any war begun by the protestants they were always defendants we have not one instance of a massacre committed or a king assassinated or of nobles undermined in order to be blown up by them they have always been men of peace till selfdefence has obliged them to be men of war on the contrary the roman catholics have been always uneasy to the governments they have lived under our histories are full of their treasons ireland has twice been deluged in blood by their rebellions and cruelties two kings of france have been murdered by their assassinations and innumerable protestants massacred and butchered in cold blood under the pretenses of friendship and assurance of a treaty  the reigns of all our kings and queens in england since henry viii have been strangely disturbed by the plots the treasons and rebellions of the papists they have often forfeited their estates and liberties to the public justice of the nation had they been dealt with by the rules of strict retaliation england scotland and ireland have such reasons for entire removing them out of their dominions as no nation in the world can have greater and yet here they live in peace under the protection of those very princes they refuse to swear allegiance to and under the shelter of those laws they refuse to be bound by it is no plea in bar of any right that the plaintiff is a papist our courts of justice are as open to them as to any of the kings most faithful subjects of which more hereafter  on the contrary the protestants of france tho charged with no disloyalty nor guilty of no crimes are dispossessed of their estates banished their native country dragoond shipped to the galleys and many of them hanged their children torn from them by violence and buried alive in monasteries and nunneries and all the cruelties an unbridled soldiery can inflict acted upon them without any manner of crime alleged but their religion and this when that very religion was secured to them by the solemnest leagues and treaties in the world declared in the famous edict of nants entered received and registered in all the parliaments of the kingdom  the king of france in persecuting his protestant subjects acts not only the part of a tyrant over them as they are his subjects but is guilty of the breach of the faith and honor of a king oppressing those people who had their religion tolerated and allowed to them by his ancestors in the most sacred manner possible and he is also guilty of the greatest unkindness to those very people who were the instruments and agents of the glory of his family and of his person  to make good which reflection that i may not seem to be guilty of disrespect to the majesty of the king of france it is needful to examine a little the ground on which the protestant interest in france stood for the last century of years and the history of the present royal family of france and how they came to the crown  in the year      on the   th day of august charles ix being king of france the third war with the hugonots having been lately ended and a peace made with the protestants the cities of rochel montauban coignac and la charity being put into their hands for security and the chief of the protestants wholly resting on the faith and honor of the king in full satisfaction of his sincere intentions being come to court was acted the massacre of paris at which in the space of five days above thirty thousand protestants were barbarously surprised and butchered in cold blood  upon which followed the fourth and fifth civil war during which king charles ix died and the crown fell to henry iii the last of the house of valois and then newly elected king of poland the beginning of his reign being entangled with civil broils the protestant interest grew very strong and though the league forced the king to make three several wars with them yet they still maintained their liberty and religion  at length the faction of the guises known by the name of the catholic league declared themselves so absolutely against the king and grew so powerful especially after the death of the duke and cardinal of guise whom the king had caused to be killed that they had almost driven him out of the kingdom in this exigence the protestants against whom they had carried on four persecutions and wars and therein destroyed many thousands of their brethren undertook his defense and joining all their forces in order to restore him marched with him to the very gates of paris where while he was preparing for a general attack of the city he was barbarously assassinated by jacques clement a jacobin monk sent out of the city on purpose being stabbed in the belly with a poynard of which he died the day after  henry iv the present kings grandfather was then king of navarre and a protestant and being lawful heir to the crown as also recommended to the nobility by the deceased king at his death took upon him the style and title of king of france the league backed by the power of the king of spain opposed him with all the vigor imaginable and many of the catholic nobility deserted him on the account of his being an heretic  the protestants served him with all the glory and loyalty that ever was shown perhaps in any war in the world and as is computed during the years war he maintained against the league and the spanish power above an hundred and sixty thousand protestant soldiers lost their lives in his service at length to put an end to the war and assure himself of the kingdom he deserted his religion and turned roman catholic by which means he obtained a full possession of the crown ruined the league the chief heads of it making their peace with him one by one and at last concluded the war with the spaniard at the peace of vervin  the protestants however never withdrew their loyalty nor their services from him the famous marshall de biron the dukes de bouillon du plessis and de la tremouille continuing to do him the most faithful and important services against the spaniards to the last  having settled himself in the kingdom and made peace with all the world the protestants who had served him so faithfully and who expected no other reward than the security of their religion and estates obtained from him the famous edict of nantes in which is particularly stated and stipulated the terms of their liberty in what places they should erect their temples how they should hold their synods and assemblies money was allotted out of the public revenues to maintain their ministers cities were allotted to them for their security the garrisons whereof were to be paid by the king and the edict was made perpetual and irrevocable by being entered and registered in the parliaments and courts of justice all over the kingdom  but all the services of the protestants to this great king by which he was brought to the crown of france nor the solemn engagement of this edict could not preserve them but that in the ministry of cardinal richlieu under the very next reign they were again attacked and driven to the necessity of taking arms in their own defense which cardinal after three times making peace and breaking it again at his pleasure completed the conquest of them in the taking of rochelle the protestants being miserably deserted by the english and thirteen thousand people starved to death in the town  since this in the infancy of the present king while the contests between the prince of conde and the queen mother were so hot as to break out into a war the protestants as subjects only were not a little instrumental to the maintaining him in that very power which now he makes use of to their destruction  i think this history fully makes good the assertion that the present usage of the protestants is both perfidious and ungrateful perfidious as being acted while under the protection of a sacred league and solemn treaty and ungrateful as it is exercised on those very people who with their lives and estates raised the present fortune of the house of bourbon to the greatness it now enjoys  i have been the more particular in this account because from hence it will appear that the protestants of france stand on a different foot from other subjects of that monarchy and that his right of dealing with them differs from his power over the rest of his subjects for they are his subjects by express stipulations and agreements whose obedience to him has been always allowed to be conditional they have made peace and war with their kings not as rebels but as persons having a lawful right to plead and to defend their kings have given them cautionary towns for the performance of the treaties made with them a thing which in its own nature implies that they might hold those towns against him if he did not perform the postulata of those treaties without the scandal of rebellion  so that their right to the liberty of their religion had an authority sufficient to justify them in taking arms nor does any of the french histories that ever i saw though wrote with the greatest partiality ever call it a rebellion but a war with the hugonots and the conclusions were always called a peace with the hugonots as is evident through d avilas whole history of the civil wars of france  the history of the protestants of the upper hungary and of bohemia might in many respects bear a parallel with this the persecutions and illusage of them having been after the solemnest agreement and treaties with them that could be made insomuch as that poor unhappy people being so absolutely separated from any relief of their brethren of germany have been forced to fly for protection to the enemies of christianity the turk with whom however they have this satisfaction that whatever bargain they make for their religion they are sure they will keep it and i remember very well a banished hungarian minister told me discoursing of this very case he was sorry to say it that the turks though they made them pay dear for it were juster and truer to their leagues and treaties than the imperialists who called themselves christians  it may possibly be objected here that while we exclaim against the french and germans for their violence to their subjects if we should do the same thing to the papists it would be practicing what we condemn and doing evil that good may come  the answer to this is included in what goes before viz taking the whole roman catholic and protestant party in europe asunder and considering them as two collective bodies divided in interest and religion it seems to me to be just that a retaliation of the injuries done upon the members of one party in one place may be made upon the members of the same party in another place by the same rule that depredations of the subjects of one prince in war may be paid by reprizal upon sny of the subjects of the same prince  but this may be more fully answered thus that if the popish subjects of some protestant governments have so behaved themselves to their governors as to make their extirpation just that justice however suspended in mercy to them hitherto will absolutely justify removing them from those governments and by that means lex talionis be executed by the hands of public justice and one banishment be at the same time both a punishment of their several crimes and a retaliation of the oppressions of their party this is a method god almighty often takes himself while he suffers a punishment for a public crime of less guilt to be the executor of his vengeance for some crime of a higher nature not known  to go no farther than ireland for an instance of this the present inhabitants i mean the popish irish by a bloody massacre of two hundred thousand protestants in      by little less intended and as much as they were able executed this late war have deserved no doubt to have been used at the discretion of the english and oliver cromwell was more than once consulting to transplant the whole nation from that island if he had done it or if it had now been done i am of the opinion no nation in the world would have taxed us with injustice and i do verily think oliver acted with more generosity than discretion in omitting it for this is certain that if he had done it this last war and the expense of so much treasure as it cost this nation and the ruin of so many thousand protestant families who were driven from thence by king james all the destruction at londonderry the sickness at dundalk and the blood of   0000 people who at least one way or other on both sides perished in it had been prevented  it may be enquired whithere oliver designed to transplant them i could answer directly to that also but it is sufficient to my purpose to say had he cleared the island of them it had been no matter at all to us whither they had gone and the king of france has set a rule for such as banish their subjects to let them go where they please and then they certainly separate whereas had he sent the protestants to any particular place they would have been so many and so united they might possibly have come back again with swords in their hands and have bidden fair for another hugonot war  i have also seen among the letters of state written by mr milton who was his secretary for the foreign dispatches a letter written to the states of holland wherein by way of argument to prevail for some ease to the protestants of piedmont he proposes a confederacy with the dutch and all their reformed friends to reduce the duke of savoy to a necessity of giving better conditions to the vaudois and seems to threaten to expel all the roman catholics in engiand scotland and ireland out of his dominions i remember upon discoursing of this passage in some company one asked what if he had and another by way of repartee made answer then there would have been none left i repeat it not for any great wit in the answer but to introduce the question  what if he had    if he had possibly we had not been troubled with any popish plot in      nor none of the bloody consequences of it we had had no shamplot upon that no russel sidney nor armstrong murdered no blood lost in an invasion by the duke of monmouth nor cruel executions in the west we had had no popish successor no standing army no bishops sent to the tower no invasion of charters nor privilege of universities no ecclesiastical commission etc    we had had no nuncio from rome to take his progress over the kingdom no fireworks for a shamprince of wales nor no mass sung in windsor chapel no seminaries or priests nor nunneries of whores at chelsea lincolninn fields or hammersmith    in short we had had no war of nine years to restore a popish king the nation had not spent  0 millions sterling nor lost  00000 of the stoutest of her inhabitants to maintain her liberty king william had been king in right of his wife and a peaceable admission had been given him  in all probability this had been the consequence if oliver cromwell had sent them all out of the kingdom i beshrew his heart he did not  i do not pretend to lead my reader to any political reasons why this should be done now our governors are best judges of the public interest but thus far i think may be assumed without danger of religion  if the nation should think fit in compassion to the miseries of our poor distressed brethren of france to retaliate their usage upon the roman catholics of england and ireland the following consequences would in all probability ensue which whether it would be just in the whole or beneficial to england and ireland in particular i leave to the judgment of impartial readers to consider    it might be a means by the intercession of parties to procure some reasonable conditions for the poor protestants of france as the stopping the marshall boufflers at the surrender of namure procured justice to the imprisoned garrisons of deinse and dixmude this is a practice too well known in the war to need any contention where the putting a prisoner of war to death or any other breach of articles has been requited buy putting some other prisoner of war to death on the contrary side and though the latter be an innocent person lex talionis is the word the justice of it is not disputed    it would put these kingdoms in a condition to entertain and relieve that great multitude of distressed christians with the very substance of their adversaries and the king of france might if he pleased make the roman catholics amends by giving them the estates of the hugonots or what other way he thought fit  this is most certain that the roman catholics of england would not have half the reason to complain of hard usage that the protestants of france have they have no leagues or capitulations to show for their permission the laws of the kingdom are expressly against them and they have in all reigns for   0 years past been the disturbers of the peace of it they refuse now to swear allegiance to the government and if they do not disturb it it is owing to their want of power not their want of will  but if they had all those defenses to make which have been hinted on behalf of the protestants of france they would have no body to thank for such usage but their own friends and the pope if he owed them so much care might use his interest with the king of france to let the protestants enjoy their liberty in order to save them from the same fate  some indeed object against the receiving such vast numbers of foreigners among us as prejudicial to the interest of trade and to our own manufacturers and inhabitants by eating the bread out of our months and starving our own poor  this is an argument would require a little volume to answer but in general i presume to affirm that no number of foreigners can be prejudicial to england let it be never so great number of inhabitants is the wealth and strength of a kingdom and if we had a million of people in england more than we have let them be of what nation they would it would be far from being a damage to us  it is true if these million of people were all artisans manufacturers it would be some detriment to our poor who are employed in those particular manufactures but allow one third to be artisans one third laborers husbandmen or sailors and one third merchants shopkeepers or gentlemen and if the greatest number that can be supposed came to settle in england it could be no injury but a vast advantage to the kingdom in general and it will appear by this one particular well examined  an addition of a million of people suppose that were the number would devour a proportioned quantity of corn and flesh for food and drink and a proportioned quantity of manufactures for cloth and housholdstuff the one employs more land and the other more people now it is apparent we have in england more land lies unimprovd common and waste than would feed a vast many people more than we have and we have a staple of wool never to be exhausted in manufactures the more lands we improve the greater the rents will be and the greater the general stock of the nation will be and the more manufactures are made the better the poor are employed and the richer the manufacturer is made  many other arguments might be used to prove that the coming over of foreigners can be no general prejudice to the nation as to trade but that is not the main thing here if the roman catholic princes pursue their protestant subjects with such cruelty and drive them into banishment and exile to seek relief in foreign countries the case seems to speak for it self the protestants can have no readier way either to prevent the miserics of those poor persecuted people or to relieve them in their exile than by dealing with the papists in their dominions in the same manner and inviting the said persecuted french to come and live in the estates and in the places of their adversaries this is lex talionis and this is a way that would soon tire the papists out for i think i may be allowed to suppose there are much the greater number of papists among the protestants than there are of protestants among the papists and the exile of the parties would also dister as to place for generally speaking the protestant countries are the best for strangers to live in the protestant people are the trading people of the world therefore the exile of the protestants of france and hungary would be less to their disadvantage than the papists of england ireland and holland who must apply themselves to countries where there are few manufactures small trade and but very indifferent means for a stranger to live so that the popish exiles would be in much the worse circumstances and there is no question but whenever the protestant princes of europe shall find it needful to use this remedy the roman catholic powers will find it for their interest to make some cartel or condition upon which all their subjects though they are protestants may enjoy some sort of liberty in their own native countries and so persecution as well as war might end in an an universal happy peace to europe both in matters of religion as well as civil affairs which has so often been attempted by other methods to so little purpose  a letter to mr how by way of reply to his considerations of the preface to an enquiry into the occasional conformity of dissenters sir after such an account as you have given of your self in the five first pages of your book with the aversion you have to any thing which should interrupt you in your more recluse studies i presume no man could imagine you would break thorough your own measures to attack a poor prefacer as you call me and wholly quitting the argument amuse the world and content your self to lash the author with the severity of your wit  herein sir i must own that not only your opponent but all the town seem disappointed exceedingly that mr how who thinks the subject not worth answering should trouble his head or spend his time about the impertinence of a sorry prefacer  when i addressed the preface to you i thought i had so carefully revised both it and the book that as i mentioned to you i could nowhere be taxed with exceeding the rules of charity and good manners  and though i would always make them both my rule yet i thought my self obliged to it more now than ordinarily by how much the person to whom and the persons of whom i wrote were equally known and very much valued by me and i did not question but i should either not be replied to at all or it would be done with the charity of a christian the civility of a gentleman and the force and vigor of a scholar  but since it seems good to you sir to descend so far below your self as to quit the dispute offered and fall upon me personally and to mix raillery and reproach with your argument which i am sure you know too well to think betters the cause you must blame your self sir for obliging me in my own defense to be a little freer with you than otherwise i should have thought had become me  nor sir should i have engaged with you even in my own defense knowing i am to struggle with so unequal a match both as to your learning and reputation had i not seen your book differ so much from your constant character and pardon me sir for the word in many places from the truth  and since i am obliged thus publicly to animadvert upon my superiors for such i own you to be both in learning and office  i shall ask your leave to lay down several mistakes upon which i must be allowed to suppose you have gone in the censures which you have made which suppositions i draw from the whole tenor of your writing  i presume sir that you are mistaken in these four points in the person temper profession and intention of the author  which mistakes i shall venture to suppose are the reasons which moved you to treat your adversary with so much indecent contempt  as to my person and temper it is true sir i have chosen to conceal my name and though bating humane frailty sins and misfortunes i know no reason why the argument should be ashamed of the author or the author of the argument yet when i considered how constant a practice it is in the world to answer an argument with recriminations instead of reasonings i thought it best to continue retired that the case i had entered upon might not come clogged with the dead weight of the meanness and imperfections of the author  i need not go back to the instance of our savior whose arguments were confronted with the contempt of that question is not this the carpenters son for i find that even mr how himself would have searched my character to have completed his remarks with personal reflections  and yet i cannot imagine what relation my name has to the argument it could be only useful to furnish you with something in my character to reproach me with which god knows you might have found enough of  but what would all this be to the point in hand the occasional conformity of dissenters is not condemned or defended by the names of authors on either side but by truth scripture and reason  thou was it altogether born in sin says the high priest and the elders of the sanhedrim to the poor man whom christ had healed and do thou teach us and yet the poor man was in the right and if i am so though i was the meanest and most scandalous of scriblers is my argument the worse  but sir to answer all those particulars and let you know that i am not altogether so shy of my name as you imagine i shall give you a genuine honest account of my self and then my name is at your service  first sir i am to tell you that i am and acknowledge my self to be possessed with a strong aversion to doubling and shifting in points of religion and do think that the case in hand is be allowed no less and therefore wrote the enquiry with two very honest designs viz to see if by strength of argument i could receive satisfaction and to explode and as far as in me lies to oppose the practice  secondly had your book given me or any body else that i can meet with whose judgment is to be valued the satisfaction i desired i assure you i am so little fond of an opinion because it is mine that i should not have been ashamed to have owned my self mistaken and possibly have shown as much humility in acknowledging it as you think i have pride in opposing  as to personal miscarriages and misfortunes of which no man has more and which perhaps may weaken the reputation of the author but i am sure ought not of my argument to them i shall only say god in his merciful providence has healed the last and i hope has pardoned the first and if so i am upon even terms in point of reasoning  by this you may see i am sensible of the beam in my own eye and have for some years taken up the part of a penitent on that very account but did never understand that thereby i was barred from enquiring into what i judged scandalous to the profession of a party in general of whom though unworthy i was a member  nor sir am i anywhere guilty of judging another where the case is not so plain as that it really seems to speak it self for i must remember also that we are no more to call good evil or evil good than we are to judge one another  thus sir i am gone over my own character and shall only demand this from you of right that so far as truth and honesty is on my side it may not nor ought not to be despised for being ushered in by an unworthy instrument  and it is strange sir that you who animadvert upon me for judging should so severely judge me and that wrongfully too as shall appear in the particulars of this short discourse  i could not be satisfied to say less to this point on these accounts because i must put in a caveat against personal reflections as unfair in the dispute he that pleases first to confute the argument is welcome to show his wit in satyrizing upon the follies and afflictions of the author and there i leave it and proceed to what i conceive is your third mistake about me  viz my profession and this you seem to make plain while from the   th to the   th page you treat me as an independent and spend your time to reply to the prticular teens in dispute between you and them which with submission i conceive to be nothing at all to the purpose  after this p  0       i am talked with as a fifthmonarchyman and leveller what of these principles any where appears in the enquiry i confess i am at a loss to know nor sir have you been so kind to lay it down  indeed i own my self somewhat surpised to see you run on in answering the scrupulous independent about kneeling at the sacrament and the extravagant fifthmonarchyman about seizing the properties of mankind for the use of the saints and such things as these by way of reply to an enquiry about occasional promiscuous conformity and am still at a loss to find an antecedent to this relative  i assure you i am no independent nor fifthmonarchyman nor leveller you have shown your learning sir and confuted an error inconsistent with civil society very well but this had been better done by it self it had no more relation to the case in hand than a lecture against the alchoran and you may as well conjecture me to be a mohammedan as a fifthmonarchyman from any thing in the book that looks like either but sir since i am led by you to give an account of my profession which i hope i shall always be ready to do i shall do it in few words that i am of the same class and in the same denomination of a dissenter with your self your office excepted and am willing to be guided by and to practice the great rule of christian charity in all the proper and legal extents of it indeed i have more need to practice it than you because i stand more in need of it from others with respect to the causes already named and however by wresting words and mistaking my intentions you are pleased to see nothing of it i am not yet convinced that i have broken that great christian rule of charity in any thing i have written  i come now to the fourth thing in which you are mistaken which is in my intentions in which you rashly and i assure you wrongfully judge me however cautious you would have me be of judging others but sir humanum est errare you are no more infallible i see than i and are fallen into the same rash error you reprove me for with so much severity by judging that the principal design of this book was to reflect upon a worthy gentlemen who is named in the preface and in one place you are pleased to join me with the party who opposed him and bring me in making my court to them  all these sir i shall make appear to be not only mistakes but groundless mistakes such as nothing but the same thoughts which put you out of temper could lead you into and i can solemnly appeal in the form you have set down that you have wronged me in your censure  first sir the enquiry was published three years ago and therefore could not be designed as a personal invective against the gentleman you speak of all that can be said is that the cause being again given the reprinting it was designed as a reproof to the practice and so much i own as for persons i am indifferent if the coat fits any body let them wear it  secondly sir i declare my self if of any party i am and ever was for the english liberty and for the putting such men into magistracy who in concurrence with the king our supreme magistrate would protect and preserve that liberty and as a person every way qualified to execute a trust of so much honor whether profitable or not i will not examine i gave my vote for sir thomas abney and should have done so if i had the power of ten thousand voices and no man has more respect for or opinion of his honesty and ability than my self nor have i god be thanked any occasion to say this to flatter him for i neither want his favor nor fear his anger  herein therefore i presume to say you have been entirely mistaken and these errors have led you to waste your time and the readers too in making needless remarks and answering those people who never opposed you  i come now to that part of your book which respects the case in hand which as it is the least part and indeed seems to agree with the title that it is only a consideration of the preface for really with submission there is very little answer to the fact so it requires not that i should reply to the argument for i see none but that drawing back the curtain which you have spread over the subject i should set it in a true light that all men may judge by their own consciences and the scripturerule and take care they be not distinguished out of their reason and religion by the cunning and artifice of words  please therefore sir to admit me to run over your book with as modest animadversions as my just defense will allow and i am content to stand corrected where i fail in point of decency  first you quarrel with me for a breach of kindness and equity in hiding my own name and revealing yours designing my self to fight in the dark and expecting you to do it in open light and you give us five whole pages including the quotation of your self in your preface to the inhabitants of torrington to show your indifferency in controverted disputes and consequently your unwillingness to engage in this  truly sir as to the first i thought a public appeal to you who are a public person had been no sin apainst kindness or equity if it be i ask your pardon  as to my concealing my name i have given you my reasons already and as to my exposing yours had you thought fit to have replied to the book which lay three years unanswered without being addressed to any person in particular you had been at liberty to have remained as unexposd as the author  but the enquiry being unanswered gave some people more prejudice against the integrity of dissenters in general than i could wish to have found upon which i thought it necessary to have the matter discussed if possible and knew no man more concerned to do it nor more capable than your self  nor is your answering me such a disappointment as you are pleased to mention but that you should attempt it and do it to no more purpose is i confess more disappointment to me than any thing i could have met with  whether sir the indifferency you are so pleased with in your temper be congruous to your profession as a gospel minister i shall not examine whether you that are pastor of a dissenting church and administer the ordinances of christ to a select people in a way dissenting from the established church and thereby maintain a schism in the said established church ought to be so indifferent as to boast that you never persuaded any man to conform or not to conform i leave it to your self to consider i am sure if i was arrived to that coldness in the matter my self i would conform immediately for i think what i affirmed in the enquiry page remains a truth unanswered by you that schism from a true established church of christ is a great sin and if i can conform i ought to conform  from this declaration of your own indifferency to meddle in matters of controversy with your reasons for it which i suppose you would have taken as introductory to what follows you are pleased to proceed very angrily to examine why i engage you in this quarrel i have given you an account of it already with all the honesty and plainness i can and i thought a person in your place would never have resented the being put upon the defense of his profession or being civilly asked a question about it and i cannot but observe how carefully you avoid being engaged in the present dispute  i ought to have been well assured you say   that you did advise one way or the other or   that you ought to have done so  really sir i think it immaterial whether you were or on or whether you ought or no for i never charged you with the first or affirmed the last but only asked this fair question  whether it was allowed by dissenters in general or by your congregation in particular to which question you give no answer  but i shall answer you honestly and directly i am assured as far as rationally i can be by consequences of things that you have not advised one way or other nor do i affirm you ought to have done so unless the person concerned applied to you for advice in point of conscience on the case if he did i do not see how you could decline it so that to me it seems you either were obliged or not obliged as the application of the person concerned might alter the case i do not say you were obliged officiously to tender your advice in the case if i am wrong here i shall acknowledge my error when i am better informed  the next thing will come close to the point whether it be a fault an unlawful action or no for a dissenter as such to hold occasional communion with the established church and at the same time continue in or return to his relative conjunction with a separate church  that it is not a sinful act simply to have communion with the established church i willingly agree but since on this point depends the weight of our present dispute i must conclude that i think it is a sinful act circumstantially and conjunctively  and because i would be rightly understood i shall endeavor to be explicit though i run the hazard of being counted impertinent  i have laid down the case i thought fairly and of which you are pleased to take no notice in the enquiry page     he who dissents from an established church from any other reasons but such as these that he really believes the said established church is not of the purest institution but that be can serve god in a form more agreeable to his will and that accordingly it is his duty to do it so and no otherwise such a one ought to conform because to make a wilful schism in the church is doubtless a great sin and if i can avoid it i ought to avoid it  if then i am guided by this real principle of conscience to dissent how can i conform without sinning against that conscience by which only my dissenting is made lawful  and thus sir i am brought to my argument again of which i shall give you this short abstract and you or any body else are welcome to be angry with me if you will be pleased first to answer it  that he who dissents from the established church except from a true principle of conscience is guilty of a great sin  that he who conforms to the established church against his conscience is guilty of a great sin  that he who both dissents and conforms at the same time and in the same point of religion must be guilty of one of these great sins  that he who has committed either of these sins ought not to be received again on either side on any other terms than as a penitent  i do not examine as i hinted then whether the gentleman you would embroil me with be thus guilty be that to himself  but i must now come to your distinctions indeed sir i believe as you say that taking which side you will you may puzzle the most of plain people who are but of ordinary understandings in the controversy about ceremonies and give me leave to add that such is the subtilty and nicety of sophistical reasonings that men may almost distinguish themselves into and out of any opinion and some people who are masters of the art of nice arguing too often lose both themselves and their religion in the labyrinchs of words school divinity and practical christianity are two things and seldom understood by the same heads  but sir with the greatest respect and some concern let me tell you i did not think to find all the difference between the dissenters and the church of england dwindld into three additional appendices in which we have some difference and so and this from mr how who is pastor of a separate church  if we differ from them in trifles or have but a trifling difference i think we can never justify making so large a chasm in the church we have much to answer for without question in the too fatal divisions of this nation if it has all been occasioned by a few small appendices  if our differences are not matters of conscience i have no more to say if they are it is a mystery yet hidden from the common understandings how they can be first insisted on from a principle of conscience and then waved without acting against that conscience which only could justify the first insisting on them if you can distinguish us into this i am mistaken  i allow your distinctions of sins which are consistent or inconsistent with the christian state to be orthodox and right  i allow your distinctions of negative and affirmative precepts and according to my weak talent agree with you in them  but the consequence you draw with submission does not reach the case which is that scrupulous persons ought to be fully persuaded in their own minds and fellow christians were not to judge but to receive them  this you have answered your self p    to be meant in dubious and small matters and if we must stick here we are next to examine whether the difference between us and the established church be only in dubious and small matters if it be i know not how we shall ward off the below of being guilty of schism the sin of which i suppose you will not dispute wherefore to descend to some particulars  if i know why we dissent from the established church it is principally on such accounts as these   on account of the episcopal clarksons no scriptureevidence for diocesan bishops hierarchy prelatical ordination and superintendency   on account of their imposing things owned to be indifferent as terms of communion   on account of their imposing things owned to be otherwise indifferent as made necessary by the command of the civil magistrate   as to partial conformity dissent in some things and conforming in others which you mention page  it does not seem to concern this case no man among the dissenters i believe pretended to dissent in every thing but we are speaking of conforming in those very points in which we dissent and that no less than the article of communion  if these are your small things i am content to stand by it and ready to prove as i said in the enquiry  that whoever separates from this church and at the same time conforms to it by conforming denies his dissent being lawful or by his dissenting damns his conforming as sinful  all this sir you have not thought fit to touch upon for reasons which you know best and i really wonder you should take so much pains to cavil at me and a simple preface which really was not worth your while and when you have led your self into the argument take no notice of the thing it self as it is objected but distinguish so nicely about the smaller matters and omit the greater  if we differ from the established church in small things only we are to blame to make the breach so wide was it for small and dubious things only that we suffered process of the law excommunications seizures of our estates and imprisonment of our persons and since you are pleased to bring in that honorable gentleman speaking in the first person to the point as an inference drawn from your distinctions and your self telling us what he may perhaps do  give me leave to go through those supposititions cases with you sir as to the particular person you concern him in it not i    you say he may have arguments so specious that supposing he err may impose upon the judgment and thereby direct the practice of a very intelligent discerning and vprighthearted man so as to make him think that which is perhaps an error his present duty and so not offer violence to his conscience  i answer admit he does so yet while you at the same time allow he errs that is sins why ought not he to be admonished to repent of that sin before he be received again into communion this is what i mean by being received as a penitent you grant  p   a man is to do the part of a penitent for a fault and this error is a fault though it were an error of ignorance    then you say p    as judging such a church true as to essentials he may think occasion inviting he has greater reason though it be defective in accidents to communicate with it sometimes than to shun its communion always  pardon me sir i must say this seems a sophism in religion for allow he may think so you must allow he ought not to think so and why occasion inviting why not occasion compelling it is manifest for could not compel why should occasion invite  i confine not my argument to this gentleman but of others i can prove that force could not compel them but occasion that is honor and preferment could invite them now if you please to reconcile this for me i shall be gotten over one point whether a man can justify suffering to the ruin perhaps of his family rather than comply with that which he may do without imposing upon his conscience and which occasion inviting he may judge lawful  you have another distinction which i confess hardly think to be rational that is unprofitable preferment page first i neither understand that the instance you are upon is unprofitable nor believe it nor that the epithet can be proper to the word for that which is unprofitable cannot be a preferment  i must also observe here sir that the conformity exacted in the late reigns was not so large as what these gentlemen are pleased to comply with voluntarily now as to the ceremonies you insist on and which indeed i do not as the way of administration kneeling etc it was allowed to be so indifferent than that many received in the church standing but when these unprofitable preferments as you please to call them invite they seek of themselves what before they could not be forced to    you ask us another question what if some have thought that alone a sufficient reason for their occasional communion with a church with whom they have not a constant communion that they may testify to the world they decline it not as no church but so far practically own it as the reason of the thing requires may not be supposed to do this as thinking it a good reason whether it be so or no without going against conscience herein  truly sir i must suppose these it may bes and why may nots are put in to make out what you said page that you could puzzle a mean understanding both ways and i thank god you are driven to the necessity of these arts but to let you see these suppositions may be replied to    sir the church of england however must own her self very much obliged to such gentlemen who will conform only to vindicate her reputation    they may be supposed to do thus but they cannot be supposed to do so without a manifest gross ignorance and taking that for a good reason which is none at all for if sir you will admit that a man is in the right as to himself while he thinks he is so then you open the way to the fatal latitude of all manner of error for no man is guilty of an error as an error but as his judgment may be perverted to believe himself right when he is wrong  page    you are pleased to object for me since sir you think it not unlawful to communicate with such a church sometimes why should you not for common order sake do it always  sir if you please to give me leave to ask questions for my self i would state it something more fairly to the case in hand thus since sir you think it not unlawful to communicate with such a church sometimes why should you not to avoid the just imputation of schism which is a great sin have done it always and why never do it but when upon an occasion of preferment inviting you find it necessary to protect you from the penalty of the law  i should have been very glad you had stated this question fully and suppose what answer you please for upon my word i can suppose none unless i would bring him in owning the crime and repenting of it which i should be glad to hear of  what you say i shall stare at page  0 i willingly admit that what is simply best may not be best for practice in present circumstances and i must likewise remind you sir that what may be simply lawful may be unlawful circumstantially and so i affirm this to be and dare undertake to prove it so without coming in the number of solomons fools with whom you have ranked me for proposing hastily beyond seven men that can render a reason  here sir viz at your  0th page i must leave you to combat with the independents and let them answer for themselves i am not at all concerned in the quarrel  and you spend three or four pages as an advocate for the church of england concerning modes and gestures in which i am sure i am far from placing the least weight where serious christianity is to be found and god forbid either you or i sir should be found making a rent in the christian union of this church and nation if their kneeling at the sacrament or the use of a liturgy were all the dispute it is you have led me into saying any thing of the difference between the national church and the dissenters  i know that the  of the primitive church included the forms of their administrations and public services and need not recite my authorities for it to you who know it better than i nor that they are found in the time of tertullian and long before him but i know also and the contrary has never been proved that those forms were not imposed as terms of communion and under the penalty of laws at least till the divisions of the church between the arrians and the orthodox when error and persecution got into the church and the evil spirit reigned to the destruction of both sides  and now sir i find you no more talking to me till you come to page    where you are pleased to satyrize upon my title and preface  really sir i believe my self capable to defend my book against all that the power of cavil and sophistry can suggest and therefore i am not sollcitous for my preface and title page  but that i may satisfy your request and telling you first that you oblige me to it i shall be plain  you desire me to examine my own heart what i meant by that suggestion in cases of preferment mentioned in the title was it not to insinuate that preferment was the inducement to that worthy person to act against his conscience  sir will you be pleased to examine your own reason how that can be when the words were printed three years before the fact and i appeal to god and the world whether you have not wrongfully judged me then but to make it more plain  i do not say he or any body else does it for preferment you are pleased strangely to mistake me i say they may have the preferment without it  it is done to save their money to save the five hundred pounds which is the penalty of the act i am sorry you have not read the book before you ventured to make so severe a remark for your better information therefore sir i refer you to p    in the enquiry where my words are plain  as to the worthy gentleman whose cause you would have this to be you say this has been his known judgment and practice several years  though it were true yet sir this is no argument to prove the thing lawful or to prove that it is not practiced even in every part that i have laid down by others before him and like to be so after him it only quits him of doing it against his conscience to qellsie himself for the unprofitable preferment you mention and this i never charged him with  that he had done the fact no body disputes but that he did it against his conscience i never alleged you put that upon me sir unjustly be his conscience to god and himself i know better than to judge him nor can you without a breach of charity suggest it of me  nor do i anywhere say that others have acted against their consciences that do so possibly they may by the help of nice distinguishing reason themselves into a belief of their being in the right  but the point in debate is whether whatever their opinions may be in the case the act it self be not as i have said circumstantially sinful for i hope you will grant me they are never the more in the right for its being their opinion truth is always unmoved sullen and the same whatever gloss our fancy or interest puts upon it  but since you will have it be this gentlemans practice which i think no reputation to him nor defense of the practice nor do i think you or he can justify your dissenting from the church of england and that practice together since i say you will have it be that gentlemans practice all you gain by that in point of argument is that he did not do it against his conscience nor to serve the present turn and what then i affirm to you i neither meant him nor any man else but him that is guilty and i meant him and every body else if they are guilty and what is all this to the purpose the question is not here who is or is not guilty of it but whether the thing in its own nature aggravated with the circumstances of turn and return timed for preferment with all the black et ceteras of it as it is lately practiced and as i have laid it down be a crime or no  if this gentleman you would embroil me with did formerly live in a general or ordinary communion both with the church of england and a private congregation before eit the preferments i mention invited or the penalty of the law forced him to it then he stands clear of this part of the charge that he did it for the protection of his interest but still the matter of fact is true  thus sir i have said what i thought my self obliged to by way of reply to your considerations and as to your censures though i have a great opinion of your charity however you seem to be out of temper in this case yet i appeal from your judgment to the judgment of truth and waving all your puzzling distinctions which my respect for your person and character will not permit me to descant upon give me leave to make this short conclusion  sincerity is the glory of a christian the native luster of an honest heart is impossible to be hid twill shine through all his life in one action or another in spite of scandal and it wants no artifice to set it out  if the practice we discourse of be to be defended let it be a practice i mean let it be voluntary let it be free and spontaneous and if gentlemen who have such a latitude in their opinions would not have it thought they are moved to it by their interests let them practice it openly and not time it so to the very eve of an election as to have it speak of it self and as it were force men to believe it done on purpose nay let them not put such a reproach in the mouths of their enemies as to have it spoken in contempt with circumstances that stop the mouths of argument and are as convincing as demonstration  you have given your blessing to them at the conclusion of your book with a let them go on and prosper i wish you have not spoken peace where there is no peace as to its being a secret between god and them i shall only say enter not into their secret o my soul it is an arcana that is hidden from my eyes and i doubt very much how it can consist with consulting the rule with the serious diligence you recommend for certainly were the great christian rule consulted it would instruct them that the profession of the christian religion is not a thing the forms whereof are of such indifference as you seem to make it that it is not a light thing to shift and change communion with an established and with a separate church as often as convenience or reason of state or interest invite  and whether i set my name to this or no whether i am an independent i hope they are christians too as well as other folks whether i am a fifthmonarchyman whether the book was designed against my lord mayor though twas wrote three years before he was chosen or whether any thing else you censoriously charge me with be true or no seems to me not worth your while to examine since if i should grant them all the argument of occasional conformity remains untouched  if the truth be made the worse for my temper i am sorry for it but this is another of mr how is paradoxes and something like your unprofitable preferment that truth though it be mixed with the worst temper in the world should thereby be so debased as to become worse than error  sir i had ended here but for a clause you force me to reply to concerning the old puritans who you tax me with abusing indeed twas as remote from my thoughts as twas that ever it was possible you could treat an adversary with such language  and but that i shall not suffer my self to be transported beyond the bounds of civility and so fall into your error i could allow my self to be very much moved that such a man as you should venture to charge me with what is neither true in fact nor can be suggested by consequence from any thing i have wrote and sir you must give me leave to say i am sorry you should lay your self so open and force me to so severe a remark  you are pleased to affirm that i industriously represent the primitive english puritans as if they were generally of my stingy narrow spirit  and here you run upon me with ill language how i could think to impose upon the world in a matter of so recent memory and how i could have the confidence etc this is really a new sort of style from mr how  sir i have industriously examined the book i wrote and as i am sure i never entertained a thought in prejudice of the best character that can be given those primitive reformers so i cannot find one word in the whole book which can no not with the help of an innuendo be so much as pretended to look that way  wherefore sir unless you can make it out or by the help of some of your distinctions come off from it i hope you will do me so much justice as you are a man of truth and honesty to recant the scandal and acknowledge your self mistaken  and that i may leave it to every body to judge whether i have not just ground for what i say i shall quote here all that i have said relating to the puritans and impartially lay down the matter of fact  after i had given a short abridgment of our reformation and recited the controversy between bishop ridley and bishop hooper i proceeded thus page the  th when queen elizabeth restored the protestant religion and the church enjoyed its peace again the debate revived but the first establishment of king edward obtained so on the minds of men that the farther reformation was rejected the other party being not at all convinced though overruled submitted their persons to the laws but not their opinions affirming that it was the duty of every christian to endeavor to serve god with the greatest purity of worship as was possible and that this was the purest worship which came nearest the divine institution which they believed the established liturgy did not and therefore in conscience they must be dissenters  having made this quotation which i have sufficient authority to prove genuine from a manuscript of a famous man in those days which i have seen and on occasion am ready to produce i go on thus  it must be owned that the original authors of these disputes were learned devout and singularly pious strict in conversation to excess if that were possible and from thence in a sort of happy derision were called puritans of whom i shall say nothing but leave for a record the last speech of a famous foreigner sit anima mea cum puritanis anglicanis  this is all the words that have the least retrospect on the puritans unless you will pretend that a few words page    is meant of them which no man can have any color of reason for but lest that should be pretended i shall quote them also page     the dissenters can never pretend to be dissenters upon the mere principle of purity of worship as i have related in the beginning of this discourse if such shall be received as blameless into their communion who have deserted them upon occasion of preferment  this refers back to page    where i say i shall give my essay as to what i understand a real dissenting protestant is nor can it refer to any other place but if you should still say it looks back to the puritans twoud puzzle a better head than mine to find out a reflection on them in it  but this is not the only thing in which you are pleased to injure both me and the truth for page    you tell me with some heat too that throughout my book such as are so stingily your favorite word sir bigoted to a party as i are treated with this sort of charity to be styled painted hypocrites such as play bopeep with god almighty that if such an occasion offer it self to any of them to serve god and their country in a public station do what the law requires and which they may sinlesly do in order to it do trespass upon their consciences and d their souls to save their countries  sir for godsake how came you to let your passion thus outrun your memory  there is not one word of all this true pardon me that i am obliged in my own defense to say so i refer you to the criginal to convince your self of it and i will take the pains to go along with you in the examination  first as to painted hypocrites it is spoken of the whole body of protestants in england in haec verba  p   i must acknowledge it fares with the chsrch of england and with dissenters both as it has always fared with christs church in the whole world that while suppressed and persecuted their professors were few and their profession more severe but when religion comes to be the mode of a country so many painted hypocrites there is the word get into the church that guile is not to be seen till it arrive to apostasy  pray sir who can these painted hypocrites refer to that you should say innuendo all those that are not of my party or that are not so stingy as i  these painted hypocrites must belong to that religion which is the mode of the country which must rather mean the church of england than the dissenters and yet if i meant either of them it cannot be made a reflection because it is confined only to such as are apostates from religion not such as continue to conform to both or either of them  this is judging me indeed neither with charity nor truth the next words are such as play bopeep with god almighty pray good sir reflect on solomon and what is said of such as judge of a matter before they hear it i am persuaded you did not read the clause which is thus  i had been examining the woeful excuse of some people and too many such we had who would take the sacrament at the church and pretend twas done only as a civil action on which i made such remarks as i think so profane a practice deserved and at last added this is playing bopeep with god almighty  and pray sir if i may be so free with you do but examine the circumstance as i have laid it down and tell me from the sincerity of your soul if you are not of the same mind  the other reflection is on such who though it be against their consciences pretend it is to serve their country of these i say they are patriots indeed who will damn their souls to save their country not that thereby i imply that to take the sacrament with the church of england would damn any mans soul if he communicated with a right principle but to do it to serve a turn which is the question in hand i will not answer for though it were inverted from the church to a dissenting congregation  all these instances sir and more which i could reckon up serve to make me admire wherein i have so provoked you as to remove you from your wonted candor and since my writing on a cause which i expected fairer quarter in so exceedingly moves you i shall choose rather to lay down the controversy than to engage with a person who i should be very much concerned to see exceed the rules which he has with so much success and so much applause prescribed to others  i always thought men might dispute without railing and differ without quarrelling and that opinions need not affect our tempers but since it is not to be found i leave it to those who have a better talent that way than i  postcript besides your book sir which i think treats me coursly enough i am since threatened to be worse used by a gentleman who thinks himself concerned in my affronting you as he calls it  i assure you sir i do not charge you with any part of it i believe you to be more a of a christian and more of a gentleman nor am i sensible i gave you any affront i am sure i intended you none  but because that gentleman i understand expects some answer this way i have this to say to him  that if he thinks himself capable to give me personal correction he knows me well enough and need never want an opportunity to be welcome   d f  finis
