an essay on the character of hamlet as performed by mr henderson at the theater royal in the haymarket  to hold as it were the mirror up to nature  now this oerdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of which one must in your allowance oerweigh a whole theater of others shakespeare london printed for w flexney the corner of southamptonbuildings holborn  dedication to george coleman esquire as one of the town i consider myself your debtor for the unexpected addition you have made to our dramatic entertainments the haymarket hitherto has been considered merely as a little summer retreat the proprietor of which never furnished more than a glass of wine and a sweatmeat but you sir like a wise host extend your plan and beside the light regale of aristophanes and fun indulge your guests with the rich banquet of shakespeare and strong sense but i have another motive for addressing the following little essay to you it is to beg pardon for attempting to analyze the performance of an actor whose merit was sealed by the sanction of your patronage i have the honor to be  sir your most humble and obedient servant the author  an essay on the character of hamlet the writings of shakespeare have maintained the post of eminence so long that most people feign or possess some relish for them his beauties have been acknowledged by every man of fine taste and his obscurities elucidated by the most subtle elaborate and learned commentators this country has produced to venture therefore upon the investigation of a subject apparently exhausted might be as hazardous as it seems barren but though it would be presumption in an artist to design the model of a temple or a palace after a master in architecture it surely cannot arraign his discretion to fix on a single column and catch some minute beauty in the architrave or frieze which may have escaped a mind expanded to embrace a vaster object  the writer of this essay means to insulate the character of hamlet from the other persons of the drama and after having considered the philosophic prince in regard to situation temper passions and understanding to examine with coolness and impartiality mr hendersons representation of him compare shade with shade and tint with tint then finally ascertain the degree of conception and execution that gentleman exhibited in his performance  this speices of criticism has at least novelty to recommend it for though taste and learning dedicate every effort to establish the reputation and perpetuate the memory of the poet the actor to whom he is often indebted for more than one laurel is rarely honored with a leaf to protect him from oblivion the graces of action the harmony of elocution and the energy of soul which distinguishes the favorite of the sister muses purchase a transitory fame which perishes with the possessor and had garrick no personal interest with apollo the smiles of thalia and the favor of melpomene would have been a precarious tenure on immortality  the character of hamlet though not the most finished is certainly one of the most splendid efforts of shakespeares genius he has combined in it every circumstance which can affect the heart or interest the understanding he represents a prince in the bloom of life plunged into a deep melancholy at the death of a father whom he tenderly loved the filial piety of a son is finely contrasted by the levity of a mother who in defiance of censure and the ties of consanguinity marries her deceased husbands brother  ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her gauled eyes hamlets understanding is sound and his sensibility exquisite he is moreover adorned with every liberal accomplishment which can distinguish the gentleman and the scholar his reasonings are deep and his passions ardent and as both are excited by great and adequate motives his character affords the most ample field for the display of theatrical abilities such is the contour of hamlet as delineated by shakespeare and which he has filled with as rich and glowing colors as ever dropped from the pencil of imagination the appearance of a young performer in a character of this importance must excite the curiosity of every admirer of the drama but in this sickly winter this blight of the stage when figure and voice in general are the only substitutes for feeling conception and imagination it is no wonder every dawn of those fine faculties is received with pleasure and fostered with approbation  mr henderson after having given infinite satisfaction in the character of shylock appeared for the first time in hamlet his success must have surpassed his most sanguine expectations he deserved and obtained great praise but in justice to his abilities and in order to maintain the candor and ascert the dignity of taste it is necessary to examine with coolness and precision his performance and judging by the standards of nature and truth pronounce where he merited censure and where approbation it has often been contested by theatrical polemicks whether figure may not be dispensed with in an actor of real genius it must be allowed that a man of sense and feeling with a tolerable person will please a judicious audience much more than a blockhead with beauty and grace but in order to completely fill the idea impressed on the mind by the poet every youthful personage that stands eminently forward in the drama unless marked by record or tradition with deformity should certainly possess those external requisites which at sight conciliate respect and esteem they augment our interest in the happiness or misery of the character and render sympathy more exquisite from the express words of the poet hamlet should have the most prepossessing aspect and demeanor  the courtiers soldiers scholars eye tongue sword the expectancy and rose of the fair state the glass of fashion and the mould of form and again  that unmatched form and feature of blown youth mr hendersons person is far from striking it is rather under the middle size and molded with no extraordinary elegance or symmetry his eye is good and all his other features bold and marking but his countenance seemed incapable of assuming the pathetic engaging look which should peculiarly distinguish the character his deportment was easy but not graceful and was considerably injured by his appearing over solicitous about the disposal of his hands it is particular and ungraceful to confine them too much to the bosom mr hendersons first impression therefore was not very favorable to him but if he appeared inadequate to the character in aspect and deportment he soon convinced his auditors that he was not deficient in judgment and feeling when the queen charges hamlet almost in direct terms with hypocrisy persevering in obstinate sorrow for a loss which could not be retrieved mr henderson delivered his pathetic reply with great sensibility his look tone and gesture were as well conceived as executed and finely marked the resentment of a delicate and liberal spirit hurt by a reproach it was conscious of not meriting excellence in speaking a soliloquy is one of the greatest difficulties in the art of acting nature is the only dictator inspirited and impassioned scenes moreover in dialogue the eye of the speaker is fixed by the person addressed but in those cool deliberations which the mind holds with itself when reason drops a curtain before the eye of sense and every external object is excluded it is then the genius of the actor is tried for unless he has a strong imagination to render him thoroughly possessed of the character united to a sound judgment and the happiest powers of execution his attention will unavoidably be solicited by the audience and render his words ridiculous and unnatural though we cannot pronounce mr henderson excellent in this department of the histrionic art yet he was far from reprehensible he appeared to want practice more than judgment and a young actor seldom possesses his powers at once in full flexibility when the mind is strongly agitated the body is restless and unsettled  therefore mr hendersons walking to and fro during the time he waited to see his fathers spirit was extremely natural however we most earnestly entreat him never in future to prepare us for a start by pulling off his hat immediately before the appearance of the ghost if he apprehends that appendage to dress may conceal the part of his face where terror and anxiety are most strongly expressed let him contrive to get rid of it in his first confusion which if he cannot do with ease let him remember that in the fine arts nothing is a beauty which militates with nature and truth in the solemn address to the ghost mr hendersons voice was low tremulous and interrupted rising gradually to a more confirmed tone as his fears subsided but his ejaculation to the protecting angels of grace was offered up before he saw the spirit his succeeding pause was just and natural for terror incites an instantaneous wish for safety and it is always some time before the mind recovers itself enough to attend to any other object there is a very capital blunder in the conduct of this scene of which most hamlets are guilty when the spirit appears horatio and marcellus instead of consulting their own safeties seize hamlets arms as if from their prior acquaintance with the ghost they were become familiar this is not only absurd and unnatural but robs the principal object of a picturesque and striking attitude hamlet when first acquainted of the apparition seems to have a precognition that his father was come to reveal some important secret for he says  i pray you all if you have hitherto concealed this sight let it be treble in your silence still and whatsoever shall befall to night give it an understanding but no tongue and from the following passage he appears determined in spite of opposition to interrogate the spirit and know what seduced him from the bourne of eternity   if it assume my noble fathers person i will speak to it though hell should gape and bid me hold my peace the apparition instead of replying continues to make repeated signals as if he wished to impart something to hamlet alone  he prepares to follow but is held by his friends it is natural to suppose that this check must rather increase than diminish his anxiety and by his own words he appears worked up to the most extravagant pitch of desperation  he declares that he does not value his life that he thinks himself summoned by the voice of fate and that he feels the pettiest channel that throbs with life in his body as hardy as the nemaean lions nerve therefore during the struggle to disengage himself from marcellus and horatio his look and gesture should be wild and his voice piercingly energic  mr henderson fell infinitely short of this conception either from want of vivacity of passion or a deficiency of power in the upper tones of his voice his painting was just but not bold or masterly from faintness of coloring the effect of light and shade was inconsiderable had he been more animated the transition from extremity of emotion to respect and duty when he bids the ghost proceed would have had a prodigious fine effect  short as this scene is garricks excellence in it was astonishing he preserved shakespeares fire undiminished faithful as the electric and sent the animated shock of natures flame home to the heart  it is to be regretted that a young performer of mr hendersons abilities can never behold this great model of theatrical perfection for men of real genius profit from each other without descending to the servility of imitation  during the subsequent scene with the ghost mr henderson was every thing that criticism could wish but if he would observe the minutiae of propriety he would drop his sword when the spirit tells him that he is his father hitherto he had but presumptive proofs  it must be confessed that this is a piece of stage etiquette which may be complied or dispensed with ad libitum and perhaps it never would have been noticed by the writer of this essay but for the extraordinary ingenuity of a newspaper drawcansir who most sagaciously remarked in one of his daily critiques that hamlets promising to revenge his fathers death after he had dropped his sword was absurd judiciously supposing that he could not take it up again  from the disappearing of the ghost to the close of the first act there are few opportunities for the display of superior talents mr henderson spoke the soliloquy previous to the entry of horatio and marcellus with great feeling and propriety and preserved a beauty in this speech which is either lost or rendered rediculous by the generality of performers it is hamlets taking his tablets out in order to set down   that man may smile and smile and be a villain this is an action strong emotion may dictate but which nothing else can authorize therefore if the actor be not animated it will pass unnoticed or appear like the flight of a lunatic mr henderson felt and nature sustained no injury at the conclusion of the first act hamlet becomes a new character determined on avenging the murder of his father and justly alarmed for his own safety he assumes the mask of insanity to conceal his intentions and lull the suspicions of the king his uncle there is no part of acting more difficult to exhibit than that of madness it requires great flexibility of voice and countenance to express the rapid succession of images that float across a distracted fancy the eye should be wild yet vacant and the tones piercing it is true hamlets madness is feigned but it is evident from the following lively description that the poet meant it should be counterfeited with great strength of imagination and masterly touches of nature   my lord as i was sewing in my closet lord hamlet with his doublet all unbraced no hat upon his head his stockings loose ungartered and down gyred to his ankle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors thus he comes before me in the first scene with polonius mr henderson would have been unexceptionable had he paid more regard to a striking and picturesque manner he looked and conceived the poet justly but diminished the fine effect his disordered appearance would have had by inattention to attitude and grace there never was perhaps a more admirable description of a rooted melancholy than the relation hamlet gives to rosincraus and guildenstern of the progress of his distemper it rises with striking and noble images in grand succession to an astonishing pitch of sublimity the last objection made to mr henderson stands here also against him his tones and manner had not the correspondent weight which the majesty of the sentiments he uttered required if he delivered this speech less rapidly and made a short pause previous to the words  what a piece of work is man it would have had a much better effect in his scene with the players he was easy sensible and spirited and gave the charge to them as well perhaps as any man who ever performed the character  it is painful to point out blemishes where many beauties are to be met with but the parterre will be soon overrun if the weeds are suffered to remain lest the act of removing them should lacerate the flowers  hamlet is stung with shame to see a player by the force of imagination deeply affected for the calamities of a person who has been dead for centuries and naturally asks what would such a man do had he motives to stir the cause of vengeance which he himself had in enumerating them his passion kindles till he becomes frantic with rage mr henderson wanted fire and rapidity in reasoning upon the imagination of the player and his own tardiness to revenge he was striking and natural but his indignation was not vented with the energy of strong passion when the mind is shook with violent anger every sentence is uttered in the highest key of the voice it is the native tone of rage and if the performer cannot reach it he comes tardy of the poets conception mr henderson never employs the upper key which we are inclined to attribute to want of judgment rather than to want of genius rant consists in the misapplication not in the great exertion of the voice for in the impassioned part of this speech every word mr garrick utters seems to rush from the burning mint of sensibility which proves that the loudest extent of voice will not offend when the heart replies to it in sympathy mr henderson laid a glaring false emphasis in this speech in repeating what is hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her he puts the stress upon her though there is no antithesis hamlet is not surprised at the players weeping for hecuba in particular but that he should weep for any person with whom he was utterly unconnected if this passage be received as mr henderson spoke it one would be apt to conclude that there was something in the miseries of hecuba which excluded her from compassion  the third act opens with the celebrated soliloquy upon suicide hamlet weary of being obliged to procrastinate his revenge and sick of the calamities of life from which he saw no rank or condition to be exempted reflects which should be preferred in adversity existence or death warburton in his comment upon this soliloquy from a happy facility he often displays of sophisticating the sense of the clearest passages gives a strange turn to shakespeares meaning he interprets to be or not to be am i to exist hereafter or not hamlet at first appears satisfied that he would not for he asks is it nobler to endure calamity or end it by death this leads him to consider the nature of death which he concludes to be a sleep a privation from feeling a tomb in which life and sufferance were both buried he afterward hazards a conjecture that there may be dreams in this sleep and that the dread of them must certainly prevent the wretched putting a period to their existence but there is one circumstance which has escaped the learned commentator why should hamlet doubt the separate existence of the soul after having seen and conversed with his fathers spirit johnson remarks upon this speech that the prince enumerate evils to which the lower orders of life only were subject but hamlet does not adduce them as causes for his own disgust with the world they are merely the observations of a speculative mind touched with the miseries of human nature the magnitude of this subject gives great scope to an actor of genius mr henderson appeared in every respect equal to it his words and action seemed to flow from deep and strong thinking and both were regulated by the strictest rules of taste and judgment hamlets meditations are interrupted by the presence of ophelia he addresses her at first with gentleness and delicacy but recollecting the character he had to sustain he starts wildly from the point and under the shelter of frenzy vents the keenest satyr against the sex in general here mr henderson was too tame he should remember that though there be truth and strong sense in what he says that he is still the madman and that unless his look and manner be wild and his utterance rapid he will be discovered no actor will perform this scene well without a fine imagination to catch the enthusiasm of the poet and out of love to the expiring genius of the stage we hope mr henderson possesses it it would be tedious and unnecessary to dwell upon passages which any performer of good sense may execute without incurring censure or extorting applause we shall confine our observations to those parts alone where excellence may be displayed from the kings confusion at the murder of gonzago hamlet is convinced of his guilt his doubts therefore are removed respecting the veracity of the ghost and he determines upon revenge the first opportunity upon finding the king at prayers he is about to put him to death but recollecting that it was not in the moment of contrition he killed his father that he took him full of bread with all his crimes broad blown as flush as may he resolves to defer his vengeance to the unprepared hour of pleasure and debauch this principal link being omitted in the representation and no other cause substituted for hamlets continuing to procrastinate he appears weak and inconsistent during the last two acts at the private interview hamlet has with his mother mr henderson was rather too boisterous and irreverent to a queen and his parent a liberal mind will preserve delicacy even in reproaches in speaking you are the queen your husbands brothers wife would it were not so you are my mother he pauses after the words your husbands brothers wife and by uttering the rest of the passage in one continued tone perverts the sense appearing to desire that the queen was not his mother when the poet means he should wish that she was not married to his uncle this interpretation of the passage is sanctified not only by hamlets general character but by his own words notwithstanding the incontinence of his mother he constantly betrays the tenderness of a son and feels for her weakness as a woman  o heart lose not thy nature let not ever the soul of nero enter this firm bosom let me be cruel but not unnatural twill speak daggers to her but use none hamlets producing the picture of his father and his uncle is a happy and affecting incident but we think mr hendersons conception in one part of it erroneous when the pious prince dwells upon the personal beauty of his father and contrasts it with the deformity of his uncle admiration not grief is the predominant passion sorrow chills the fancy and the following images appear to be the offspring of the most glowing imagination  an eye like mars to threaten or command a station like the herald mercury new lighted on a heavenkissing hill a combination and a form indeed where every god had set his seal to give the world assurance of a man imagery rich as this requires a firm animated tone of grandeur but mr hendersons voice broke into a boyish whimper which not a syllable he had to utter could justify or dictate throwing away the kings picture savours rather of trick besides it does not seem to augment our sensibility mr hendersons terror was finely expressed upon the appearance of the ghost his voice countenance and attitude consprired with united force to strike us with awe pity and admiration and if he would avoid the errors hinted at his closet scene would be a most capital piece of acting  one of the principal defects in this tragedy is the almost total exclusion of hamlet from the fourth act so long losing sight of the chief personage in the drama our interest for him is diminished as the piece was originally written hamlet has three scenes in the fourth act but two of which are retained though the third contains a most beautiful soliloquy in which hamlet justifies himself for suspending the revenge he promised his father in mr garricks alteration this speech is preserved the opening of the fifth act is stained with low ribaldry but so intimately connected with striking beauties that it would be impossible to expunge the one without losing the other hamlets reflections upon the last humiliating state of human nature are awful and affecting particularly those upon the skull of yorick when he beholds the sad disfigured remains of a man who was once dear to him mouldring into dust hideous with deformity the food and habitation of the worm but the genius of shakespeare penetrated all nature and his voice is heard from the tomb we were surprised and chagrined to find mr henderson fell short of our expectations in this scene his expression was languid and unimpassioned he appeared over solicitous to give force and solemnity to his manner and in the attempt lost the fine spirit of the poet in uttering the rant into which hamlet breaks at ophelias funeral mr henderson distorts the sense of one line by a false emphasis laertes when his sisters obsequies are nearly finished overcome with sorrow leaps into her grave and cries now heap your mountains on the quick and dead desiring in the extravagance of grief to be interred alive with one so dear to him hamlet whose affection for ophelia was not less ardent challenges him to give a proof of superior tenderness and after proposing the wildest tests which frenzy could dictate says be buried quick with her and so will i as this was a proposal of laertes not hamlet the emphatical word undoubtedly is the monosylable be mr henderson does not observe this emphasis therefore from his tone we would conclude that laertes had not prior to hamlet desired to be interred with ophelia but that this thought was originally the latters and only in the climas of extravagant images which burst from him in the effervescence of imagination when ostrick cries a hit a palpable hit laertes point is at hamlets breast owing to mr hendersons ignorance of the sword fencing is an accomplishment not to be dispensed with in an actor and nothing so much promotes gracefulness of deportment mr hendersons dying scene was capital it appeared indeed the last struggle of the spirit when life hangs quivering to a point and death extinguishes it   having thus progressively traced mr henderson through the character of hamlet and remarked with equal candor upon his merits and imperfections we must pronounce him notwithstanding some blemishes the best performer now left to support the drooping trophies of the stage he possesses taste feeling and good sense and though not blessed by nature with that portion of aetherial fire which alone could once purchase him eminence on the stage he must always maintain the superiority of men who in general are indebted to accident person or interest for their situations  is it not ridiculous and disgusting to hear a man without an atom of feeling draul out in one uniform unvaried tone the most pointed observation or lively passion is it not monstrous to behold another with the sepulchral aspect of an undertaker and a voice as dismal as the hooting of the owl warbling out romeo and putting shakespeare to death but what is infinitely if possible more preposterous we are sometimes obliged to bear a man whose enormous bulk and drousy eye would incline us to believe that he had better taste in calipash and calipee than in delicacy of sentiment and resembles an alderman or a butcher more than a lover or a hero this great man who for some time added considerable weight to the edinburgh stage was one night to doze through a capital character in which he expected to infuse more of the poppy than usual but a wag who was sensible that no man contributed so much as himself to the repose of an audience politely inserted at the bottom of the bills n b gentlemen are requested to bring nightcape for heavens sake does a manager ever purchase actors by the pound tha he will employ such people we congratulate the public upon their acquisition in mr henderson and hope his genius will protect us at least in part from like mortifications in future  finis
