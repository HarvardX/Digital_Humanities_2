preface in the treatises that i have met with upon the subject of morals i appear to myself to have remarked the following imperfections—either that the principle was erroneous or that it was indistinctly explained or that the rules deduced from it were not sufficiently adapted to real life and to actual situations the writings of grotius and the larger work of puffendorff are of too forensic a cast too much mixed up with civil law and with the jurisprudence of germany to answer precisely the design of a system of ethics—the direction of private consciences in the general conduct of human life perhaps indeed they are not to be regarded as institutes of morality calculated to instruct an individual in his duty so much as a species of lawbooks and lawauthorities suited to the practice of those courts of justice whose decisions are regulated by general principles of natural equity in conjunction with the maxims of the roman code of which kind i understand there are many upon the continent to which may be added concerning both these authors that they are more occupied in describing the rights and usages of independent communities than is necessary in a work which professes not to adjust the correspondence of nations but to delineate the offices of domestic life the profusion also of classical quotations with which many of their pages abound seems to me a fault from which it will not be easy to excuse them if these extracts be intended as decorations of style the composition is overloaded with ornaments of one kind to any thing more than ornament they can make no claim to propose them as serious arguments gravely to attempt to establish or fortify a moral duty by the testimony of a greek or roman poet is to trifle with xxxvi the attention of the reader or rather to take it off from all just principles of reasoning in morals of our own writers in this branch of philosophy i find none that i think perfectly free from the three objections which i have stated there is likewise a fourth property observable almost in all of them namely that they divide too much the law of nature from the precepts of revelation some authors industriously declining the mention of scripture authorities as belonging to a different province and others reserving them for a separate volume which appears to me much the same defect as if a commentator on the laws of england should content himself with stating upon each head the common law of the land without taking any notice of acts of parliament or should choose to give his readers the common law in one book and the statute law in another when the obligations of morality are taught says a pious and celebrated writer let the sanctions of christianity never be forgotten by which it will be shown that they give strength and lustre to each other religion will appear to be the voice of reason and morality will be the will of god the manner also in which modern writers have treated of subjects of morality is in my judgement liable to much exception it has become of late a fashion to deliver moral institutes in strings or series of detached propositions without subjoining a continued argument or regular dissertation to any of them this sententious apophthegmatising style by crowding propositions and paragraphs too fast upon the mind and by carrying the eye of the reader from subject to subject in too quick a succession gains not a sufficient hold upon the attention to leave either the memory furnished or the understanding satisfied however useful a syllabus of topics or a series of propositions may be in the hands of a lecturer or as a guide to a student who is supposed to consult other books xxxvii or to institute upon each subject researches of his own the method is by no means convenient for ordinary readers because few readers are such thinkers as to want only a hint to set their thoughts at work upon or such as will pause and tarry at every proposition till they have traced out its dependency proof relation and consequences before they permit themselves to step on to another a respectable writer of this class has comprised his doctrine of slavery in the three following propositions no one is born a slave because every one is born with all his original rights no one can become a slave because no one from being a person can in the language of the roman law become a thing or subject of property the supposed property of the master in the slave therefore is matter of usurpation not of right it may be possible to deduce from these few adages such a theory of the primitive rights of human nature as will evince the illegality of slavery but surely an author requires too much of his reader when he expects him to make these deductions for himself or to supply perhaps from some remote chapter of the same treatise the several proofs and explanations which are necessary to render the meaning and truth of these assertions intelligible there is a fault the opposite of this which some moralists who have adopted a different and i think a better plan of composition have not always been careful to avoid namely the dwelling upon verbal and elementary distinctions with a labour and prolixity proportioned much more to the subtlety of the question than to its value and importance in the prosecution of the subject a writer upon the law of nature† whose explications in every part of philosophy xxxviii though always diffuse are often very successful has employed three long sections in endeavouring to prove that permissions are not laws the discussion of this controversy however essential it might be to dialectic precision was certainly not necessary to the progress of a work designed to describe the duties and obligations of civil life the reader becomes impatient when he is detained by disquisitions which have no other object than the settling of terms and phrases and what is worse they for whose use such books are chiefly intended will not be persuaded to read them at all i am led to propose these strictures not by any propensity to depreciate the labours of my predecessors much less to invite a comparison between the merits of their performances and my own but solely by the consideration that when a writer offers a book to the public upon a subject on which the public are already in possession of many others he is bound by a kind of literary justice to inform his readers distinctly and specifically what it is he professes to supply and what he expects to improve the imperfections above enumerated are those which i have endeavoured to avoid or remedy of the execution the reader must judge but this was the design concerning the principle of morals it would be premature to speak but concerning the manner of unfolding and explaining that principle i have somewhat which i wish to be remarked an experience of nine years in the office of a public tutor in one of the universities and in that department of education to which these chapters relate afforded me frequent occasions to observe that in discoursing to young minds upon topics of morality it required much more pains to make them perceive the difficulty than to understand the solution that unless the subject was so drawn up to a point as to exhibit the full force of an objection or the exact place of a doubt before any explanation was entered upon—in other words unless some curiosity was excited before it was attempted to be satisfied the labour of the teacher was lost when xxxix information was not desired it was seldom i found retained i have made this observation my guide in the following work that is upon each occasion i have endeavoured before i suffered myself to proceed in the disquisition to put the reader in complete possession of the question and to do it in the way that i thought most likely to stir up his own doubts and solicitude about it in pursuing the principle of morals through the detail of cases to which it is applicable i have had in view to accommodate both the choice of the subjects and the manner of handling them to the situations which arise in the life of an inhabitant of this country in these times this is the thing that i think to be principally wanting in former treatises and perhaps the chief advantage which will be found in mine i have examined no doubts i have discussed no obscurities i have encountered no errors i have adverted to no controversies but what i have seen actually to exist if some of the questions treated of appear to a more instructed reader minute or puerile i desire such reader to be assured that i have found them occasions of difficulty to young minds and what i have observed in young minds i should expect to meet with in all who approach these subjects for the first time upon each article of human duty i have combined with the conclusion of reason the declarations of scripture when they are to be had as of coordinate authority and as both terminating in the same sanctions in the manner of the work i have endeavoured so to attemper the opposite plans above animadverted upon as that the reader may not accuse me either of too much haste or too much delay i have bestowed upon each subject enough of dissertation to give a body and substance to the chapter in which it is treated of as well as coherence and perspicuity on the other hand i have seldom i hope exercised the patience of the reader by the length and prolixity of my essays or disappointed that patience at last by the tenuity and unimportance of the conclusion xl there are two particulars in the following work for which it may be thought necessary that i should offer some excuse the first of which is that i have scarcely ever referred to any other book or mentioned the name of the author whose thoughts and sometimes possibly whose very expressions i have adopted my method of writing has constantly been this to extract what i could from my own stores and my own reflections in the first place to put down that and afterwards to consult upon each subject such readings as fell in my way which order i am convinced is the only one whereby any person can keep his thoughts from sliding into other mens trains the effect of such a plan upon the production itself will be that whilst some parts in matter or manner may be new others will be little else than a repetition of the old i make no pretensions to perfect originality i claim to be something more than a mere compiler much no doubt is borrowed but the fact is that the notes for this work having been prepared for some years and such things having been from time to time inserted in them as appeared to me worth preserving and such insertions made commonly without the name of the author from whom they were taken i should at this time have found a difficulty in recovering those names with sufficient exactness to be able to render to every man his own nor to speak the truth did it appear to me worth while to repeat the search merely for this purpose when authorities are relied upon names must be produced when a discovery has been made in science it may be unjust to borrow the invention without acknowledging the author but in an argumentative treatise and upon a subject which allows no place for discovery or invention properly so called and in which all that can belong to a writer is his mode of reasoning or his judgement of probabilities i should have thought it superfluous had it been easier to me than it was to have interrupted my text or crowded my margin with references to every author whose sentiments i have xli made use of there is however one work to which i owe so much that it would be ungrateful not to confess the obligation i mean the writings of the late abraham tucker esq part of which were published by himself and the remainder since his death under the title of the light of nature pursued by edward search esq i have found in this writer more original thinking and observation upon the several subjects that he has taken in hand than in any other not to say than in all others put together his talent also for illustration is unrivalled but his thoughts are diffused through a long various and irregular work i shall account it no mean praise if i have been sometimes able to dispose into method to collect into heads and articles or to exhibit in more compact and tangible masses what in that otherwise excellent performance is spread over too much surface the next circumstance for which some apology may be expected is the joining of moral and political philosophy together or the addition of a book of politics to a system of ethics against this objection if it be made one i might defend myself by the example of many approved writers who have treated de officiis hominis et civis or as some choose to express it of the rights and obligations of man in his individual and social capacity in the same book i might allege also that the part a member of the commonwealth shall take in political contentions the vote he shall give the counsels he shall approve the support he shall afford or the opposition he shall make to any system of public measures—is as much a question of personal duty as much concerns the conscience of the individual who deliberates as the determination of any doubt which relates to the conduct of private life that consequently political philosophy is properly speaking a continuation of moral philosophy or rather indeed a part of it supposing moral philosophy to have for its aim the information of the human conscience in every deliberation that is likely to come before it i might xlii avail myself of these excuses if i wanted them but the vindication upon which i rely is the following in stating the principle of morals the reader will observe that i have employed some industry in explaining the theory and showing the necessity of general rules without the full and constant consideration of which i am persuaded that no system of moral philosophy can be satisfactory or consistent this foundation being laid or rather this habit being formed the discussion of political subjects to which more than to almost any other general rules are applicable became clear and easy whereas had these topics been assigned to a distinct work it would have been necessary to have repeated the same rudiments to have established over again the same principles as those which we had already exemplified and rendered familiar to the reader in the former parts of this in a word if there appear to any one too great a diversity or too wide a distance between the subjects treated of in the course of the present volume let him be reminded that the doctrine of general rules pervades and connects the whole it may not be improper however to admonish the reader that under the name of politics he is not to look for those occasional controversies which the occurrences of the present day or any temporary situation of public affairs may excite and most of which if not beneath the dignity it is beside the purpose of a philosophical institution to advert to he will perceive that the several disquisitions are framed with a reference to the condition of this country and of this government but it seemed to me to belong to the design of a work like the following not so much to discuss each altercated point with the particularity of a political pamphlet upon the subject as to deliver those universal principles and to exhibit that mode and train of reasoning in politics by the due application of which every man might be enabled to attain to just conclusions of his own i am not ignorant of an objection that has been advanced against all abstract speculations concerning the xliii origin principle or limitation of civil authority namely that such speculations possess little or no influence upon the conduct either of the state or of the subject of the governors or the governed nor are attended with any useful consequences to either that in times of tranquillity they are not wanted in times of confusion they are never heard this representation however in my opinion is not just times of tumult it is true are not the times to learn but the choice which men make of their side and party in the most critical occasions of the commonwealth may nevertheless depend upon the lessons they have received the books they have read and the opinions they have imbibed in seasons of leisure and quietness some judicious persons who were present at geneva during the troubles which lately convulsed that city thought they perceived in the contentions there carrying on the operation of that political theory which the writings of rousseau and the unbounded esteem in which these writings are holden by his countrymen had diffused amongst the people throughout the political disputes that have within these few years taken place in great britain in her sisterkingdom and in her foreign dependencies it was impossible not to observe in the language of party in the resolutions of public meetings in debate in conversation in the general strain of those fugitive and diurnal addresses to the public which such occasions call forth the prevalency of those ideas of civil authority which are displayed in the works of mr locke the credit of that great name the courage and liberality of his principles the skill and clearness with which his arguments are proposed no less than the weight of the arguments themselves have given a reputation and currency to his opinions of which i am persuaded in any unsettled state of public affairs the influence would be felt as this is not a place for examining the truth or tendency of these doctrines i would not be understood by what i have said to express any judgement concerning either i mean only to remark that such xliv doctrines are not without effect and that it is of practical importance to have the principles from which the obligations of social union and the extent of civil obedience are derived rightly explained and well understood indeed as far as i have observed in political beyond all other subjects where men are without some fundamental and scientific principles to resort to they are liable to have their understandings played upon by cant phrases and unmeaning terms of which every party in every country possesses a vocabulary we appear astonished when we see the multitude led away by sounds but we should remember that if sounds work miracles it is always upon ignorance the influence of names is in exact proportion to the want of knowledge these are the observations with which i have judged it expedient to prepare the attention of my reader concerning the personal motives which engaged me in the following attempt it is not necessary that i say much the nature of my academical situation a great deal of leisure since my retirement from it the recommendation of an honoured and excellent friend the authority of the venerable prelate to whom these labours are inscribed the not perceiving in what way i could employ my time or talents better and my disapprobation in literary men of that fastidious indolence which sits still because it disdains to do little were the considerations that directed my thoughts to this design nor have i repented of the undertaking whatever be the fate or reception of this work it owes its author nothing in sickness and in health i have found in it that which can alone alleviate the one or give enjoyment to the other—occupation and engagement vl the principles of moral and political philosophy vli   book i preliminary considerations chapter   definition and use of the science moral philosophy morality ethics casuistry natural law mean all the same thing namely that science which teaches men their duty and the reasons of it the use of such a study depends upon this that without it the rules of life by which men are ordinarily governed oftentimes mislead them through a defect either in the rule or in the application these rules are the law of honour the law of the land and the scriptures chapter   the law of honour the law of honour is a system of rules constructed by people of fashion and calculated to facilitate their intercourse with one another and for no other purpose consequently nothing is adverted to by the law of honour but what tends to incommode this intercourse hence this law only prescribes and regulates the duties betwixt equals omitting such as relate to the supreme being as well as those which we owe to our inferiors   for which reason profaneness neglect of public worship or private devotion cruelty to servants rigorous treatment of tenants or other dependants want of charity to the poor injuries done to tradesmen by insolvency or delay of payment with numberless examples of the same kind are accounted no breaches of honour because a man is not a less agreeable companion for these vices nor the worse to deal with in those concerns which are usually transacted between one gentleman and another again the law of honour being constituted by men occupied in the pursuit of pleasure and for the mutual conveniency of such men will be found as might be expected from the character and design of the lawmakers to be in most instances favourable to the licentious indulgence of the natural passions thus it allows of fornication adultery drunkenness prodigality duelling and of revenge in the extreme and lays no stress upon the virtues opposite to these chapter   the law of the land that part of mankind who are beneath the law of honour often make the law of the land their rule of life that is they are satisfied with themselves so long as they do or omit nothing for the doing or omitting of which the law can punish them whereas every system of human laws considered as a rule of life labours under the two following defects i human laws omit many duties as not objects of compulsion such as piety to god bounty to the poor forgiveness of injuries education of children gratitude to benefactors the law never speaks but to command nor commands but where it can compel consequently those duties which by their   nature must be voluntary are left out of the statutebook as lying beyond the reach of its operation and authority ii human laws permit or which is the same thing suffer to go unpunished many crimes because they are incapable of being defined by any previous description of which nature are luxury prodigality partiality in voting at those elections in which the qualifications of the candidate ought to determine the success caprice in the disposition of mens fortunes at their death disrespect to parents and a multitude of similar examples for this is the alternative either the law must define beforehand and with precision the offences which it punishes or it must be left to the discretion of the magistrate to determine upon each particular accusation whether it constitute that offence which the law designed to punish or not which is in effect leaving to the magistrate to punish or not to punish at his pleasure the individual who is brought before him which is just so much tyranny where therefore as in the instances abovementioned the distinction between right and wrong is of too subtile or of too secret a nature to be ascertained by any preconcerted language the law of most countries especially of free states rather than commit the liberty of the subject to the discretion of the magistrate leaves men in such cases to themselves chapter   the scriptures whoever expects to find in the scriptures a specific direction for every moral doubt that arises looks for more than he will meet with and to what a magnitude such a detail of particular precepts would have enlarged the sacred volume may be partly understood from the following consideration the laws of this country   including the acts of the legislature and the decisions of our supreme courts of justice are not contained in fewer than fifty folio volumes and yet it is not once in ten attempts that you can find the case you look for in any lawbook whatever to say nothing of those numerous points of conduct concerning which the law professes not to prescribe or determine any thing had then the same particularity which obtains in human laws so far as they go been attempted in the scriptures throughout the whole extent of morality it is manifest they would have been by much too bulky to be either read or circulated or rather as st john says even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written morality is taught in scripture in this wise general rules are laid down of piety justice benevolence and purity such as worshipping god in spirit and in truth doing as we would be done by loving our neighbour as ourself forgiving others as we expect forgiveness from god that mercy is better than sacrifice that not that which entereth into a man nor by parity of reason any ceremonial pollutions but that which proceedeth from the heart defileth him these rules are occasionally illustrated either by fictitious examples as in the parable of the good samaritan and of the cruel servant who refused to his fellowservant that indulgence and compassion which his master had shown to him or in instances which actually presented themselves as in christs reproof of his disciples at the samaritan village his praise of the poor widow who cast in her last mite his censure of the pharisees who chose out the chief rooms and of the tradition whereby they evaded the command to sustain their indigent parents or lastly in the resolution of questions which those who were about our saviour proposed to him as his answer to the young man who asked him what lack i yet and to the honest scribe   who had found out even in that age and country that to love god and his neighbour was more than all whole burntofferings and sacrifice and this is in truth the way in which all practical sciences are taught as arithmetic grammar navigation and the like rules are laid down and examples are subjoined not that these examples are the cases much less all the cases which will actually occur but by way only of explaining the principle of the rule and as so many specimens of the method of applying it the chief difference is that the examples in scripture are not annexed to the rules with the didactic regularity to which we are nowadays accustomed but delivered dispersedly as particular occasions suggested them which gave them however especially to those who heard them and were present to the occasions which produced them an energy and persuasion much beyond what the same or any instances would have appeared with in their places in a system besides this the scriptures commonly presuppose in the persons to whom they speak a knowledge of the principles of natural justice and are employed not so much to teach new rules of morality as to enforce the practice of it by new sanctions and by a greater certainty which last seems to be the proper business of a revelation from god and what was most wanted thus the unjust covenantbreakers and extortioners are condemned in scripture supposing it known or leaving it where it admits of doubt to moralists to determine what injustice extortion or breach of covenant are the above considerations are intended to prove that the scriptures do not supersede the use of the science of which we profess to treat and at the same time to acquit them of any charge of imperfection or insufficiency on that account   chapter   the moral sense the father of caius toranius had been proscribed by the triumvirate caius toranius coming over to the interests of that party discovered to the officers who were in pursuit of his fathers life the place where he concealed himself and gave them withal a description by which they might distinguish his person when they found him the old man more anxious for the safety and fortunes of his son than about the little that might remain of his own life began immediately to inquire of the officers who seized him whether his son was well whether he had done his duty to the satisfaction of his generals that son replied one of the officers so dear to thy affections betrayed thee to us by his information thou art apprehended and diest the officer with this struck a poniard to his heart and the unhappy parent fell not so much affected by his fate as by the means to which he owed it now the question is whether if this story were related to the wild boy caught some years ago in the woods of hanover or to a savage without experience and without instruction cut off in his infancy from all intercourse with his species and consequently under no possible influence of example authority education sympathy or habit whether i say such a one would feel upon the   relation any degree of that sentiment of disapprobation of toraniuss conduct which we feel or not they who maintain the existence of a moral sense of innate maxims of a natural conscience that the love of virtue and hatred of vice are instinctive or the perception of right and wrong intuitive all which are only different ways of expressing the same opinion affirm that he would they who deny the existence of a moral sense c affirm that he would not and upon this issue is joined as the experiment has never been made and from the difficulty of procuring a subject not to mention the impossibility of proposing the question to him if we had one is never likely to be made what would be the event can only be judged of from probable reasons they who contend for the affirmative observe that we approve examples of generosity gratitude fidelity c and condemn the contrary instantly without deliberation without having any interest of our own concerned in them ofttimes without being conscious of or able to give any reason for our approbation that this approbation is uniform and universal the same sorts of conduct being approved or disapproved in all ages and countries of the world—circumstances say they which strongly indicate the operation of an instinct or moral sense on the other hand answers have been given to most of these arguments by the patrons of the opposite system and first as to the uniformity above alleged they controvert the fact they remark from authentic accounts of historians and travellers that there is scarcely a single vice which in some age or country of the world has not been countenanced by public opinion that in one country it is esteemed an office of piety in children to sustain their aged parents in another to despatch them out of the way that suicide in one age of the world has been heroism is in another   felony that theft which is punished by most laws by the laws of sparta was not unfrequently rewarded that the promiscuous commerce of the sexes although condemned by the regulations and censure of all civilised nations is practised by the savages of the tropical regions without reserve compunction or disgrace that crimes of which it is no longer permitted us even to speak have had their advocates amongst the sages of very renowned times that if an inhabitant of the polished nations of europe be delighted with the appearance wherever he meets with it of happiness tranquillity and comfort a wild american is no less diverted with the writhings and contortions of a victim at the stake that even amongst ourselves and in the present improved state of moral knowledge we are far from a perfect consent in our opinions or feelings that you shall hear duelling alternately reprobated and applauded according to the sex age or station of the person you converse with that the forgiveness of injuries and insults is accounted by one sort of people magnanimity by another meanness that in the above instances and perhaps in most others moral approbation follows the fashions and institutions of the country we live in which fashions also and institutions themselves have grown out of the exigencies the climate situation or local circumstances of the country or have been set up by the authority of an arbitrary chieftain or the unaccountable caprice of the multitude—all which they observe looks very little like the steady hand and indelible characters of nature but secondly because after these exceptions and abatements it cannot be denied but that some sorts of actions command and receive the esteem of mankind more than others and that the approbation of them is general though not universal as to this they say that the general approbation of virtue even in instances where we have no interest of our own to induce us to it may be accounted for without the assistance of a moral sense thus having experienced in some instance a particular conduct to be beneficial to ourselves or observed that it would be so a   sentiment of approbation rises up in our minds which sentiment afterwards accompanies the idea or mention of the same conduct although the private advantage which first excited it no longer exist and this continuance of the passion after the reason of it has ceased is nothing more say they than what happens in other cases especially in the love of money which is in no person so eager as it is oftentimes found to be in a rich old miser without family to provide for or friend to oblige by it and to whom consequently it is no longer and he may be sensible of it too of any real use or value yet is this man as much overjoyed with gain and mortified by losses as he was the first day he opened his shop and when his very subsistence depended upon his success in it by these means the custom of approving certain actions commenced and when once such a custom hath got footing in the world it is no difficult thing to explain how it is transmitted and continued for then the greatest part of those who approve of virtue approve of it from authority by imitation and from a habit of approving such and such actions inculcated in early youth and receiving as men grow up continual accessions of strength and vigour from censure and encouragement from the books they read the conversations they hear the current application of epithets the general turn of language and the various other causes by which it universally comes to pass that a society of men touched in the feeblest degree with the same passion soon communicate to one another a great degree of it this is the case with most of us at present and is the cause also that  0 the process of association described in the last paragraph but one is little now either perceived or wanted amongst the causes assigned for the continuance and diffusion of the same moral sentiments amongst mankind we have mentioned imitation the efficacy of this principle is most observable in children indeed if there be any thing in them which deserves the name of an instinct it is their propensity to imitation now there is nothing which children imitate or apply more readily than expressions of affection and aversion of approbation hatred resentment and the like and when these passions and expressions are once connected which they soon will be by the same association which unites words with their ideas the passion will follow the expression and attach upon the object to which the child has been accustomed to apply the epithet in a word when almost every thing else is learned by imitation can we wonder to find the same cause concerned in the generation of our moral sentiments another considerable objection to the system of moral instincts is this that there are no maxims in the science which can well be deemed innate as none perhaps can be assigned which are absolutely and universally true in other words which do not bend to circumstances veracity which seems if any be a natural duty is excused in many cases towards an enemy a thief or a madman the obligation of promises which is a first principle in morality depends upon the circumstances under which they were made they may have been unlawful or become so since or inconsistent with former promises or erroneous or extorted under all which cases instances may be suggested where the obligation to perform the promise would be very dubious and so of most other general rules when they come to be actually applied an argument has been also proposed on the same side of the question of this kind together with the instinct there must have been implanted it is said a clear and precise idea of the object    upon which it was to attach the instinct and the idea of the object are inseparable even in imagination and as necessarily accompany each other as any correlative ideas whatever that is in plainer terms if we be prompted by nature to the approbation of particular actions we must have received also from nature a distinct conception of the action we are thus prompted to approve which we certainly have not received but as this argument bears alike against all instincts and against their existence in brutes as well as in men it will hardly i suppose produce conviction though it may be difficult to find an answer to it upon the whole it seems to me either that there exist no such instincts as compose what is called the moral sense or that they are not now to be distinguished from prejudices and habits on which account they cannot be depended upon in moral reasoning i mean that it is not a safe way of arguing to assume certain principles as so many dictates impulses and instincts of nature and then to draw conclusions from these principles as to the rectitude or wrongness of actions independent of the tendency of such actions or of any other consideration whatever aristotle lays down as a fundamental and selfevident maxim that nature intended barbarians to be slaves and proceeds to deduce from this maxim a train of conclusions calculated to justify the policy which then prevailed and i question whether the same maxim be not still selfevident to the company of merchants trading to the coast of africa nothing is so soon made as a maxim and it appears from the example of aristotle that authority and convenience education prejudice and general practice have no small share in the making of them and that the laws of custom are very apt to be mistaken for the order of nature for which reason i suspect that a system of morality built upon instincts will only find out reasons and excuses for opinions    and practices already established—will seldom correct or reform either but further suppose we admit the existence of these instincts what it may be asked is their authority no man you say can act in deliberate opposition to them without a secret remorse of conscience but this remorse may be borne with and if the sinner choose to bear with it for the sake of the pleasure or the profit which he expects from his wickedness or finds the pleasure of the sin to exceed the remorse of conscience of which he alone is the judge and concerning which when he feels them both together he can hardly be mistaken the moralinstinct man so far as i can understand has nothing more to offer for if he allege that these instincts are so many indications of the will of god and consequently presages of what we are to look for hereafter this i answer is to resort to a rule and a motive ulterior to the instincts themselves and at which rule and motive we shall byandby arrive by a surer road—i say surer so long as there remains a controversy whether there be any instinctive maxims at all or any difficulty in ascertaining what maxims are instinctive this celebrated question therefore becomes in our system a question of pure curiosity and as such we dismiss it to the determination of those who are more inquisitive than we are concerned to be about the natural history and constitution of the human species chapter   human happiness the word happy is a relative term that is when we call a man happy we mean that he is happier than some others with whom we compare him than the generality of others or than he himself was    in some other situation thus speaking of one who has just compassed the object of a long pursuit now we say he is happy and in a like comparative sense compared that is with the general lot of mankind we call a man happy who possesses health and competency in strictness any condition may be denominated happy in which the amount or aggregate of pleasure exceeds that of pain and the degree of happiness depends upon the quantity of this excess and the greatest quantity of it ordinarily attainable in human life is what we mean by happiness when we inquire or pronounce what human happiness consists in    in which inquiry i will omit much usual declamation on the dignity and capacity of our nature the superiority of the soul to the body of the rational to the animal part of our constitution upon the worthiness refinement and delicacy of some satisfactions or the meanness grossness and sensuality of others because i hold that pleasures differ in nothing but in continuance and intensity from a just computation of which confirmed by what we observe of the apparent cheerfulness tranquillity and contentment of men of different tastes tempers stations and pursuits every question concerning human happiness must receive its decision it will be our business to show if we can i what human happiness does not consist in ii what it does consist in first then happiness does not consist in the pleasures of sense in whatever profusion or variety they be enjoyed by the pleasures of sense i mean as well the animal gratifications of eating drinking and that by which the species is continued as the more refined pleasures of music painting architecture gardening splendid shows theatric exhibitions and the pleasures lastly of active sports as of hunting shooting fishing c for  st these pleasures continue but a little while at a time this is true of them all especially of the grosser sort of them laying aside the preparation and the expectation and computing strictly the actual sensation we shall be surprised to find how inconsiderable a portion of our time they occupy how few hours in the fourandtwenty they are able to fill up  dly these pleasures by repetition lose their relish it is a property of the machine for which we know no remedy that the organs by which we perceive pleasure are blunted and benumbed by being frequently exercised in the same way there is hardly any one who has not found the difference between a    gratification when new and when familiar or any pleasure which does not become indifferent as it grows habitual  dly the eagerness for high and intense delights takes away the relish from all others and as such delights fall rarely in our way the greater part of our time becomes from this cause empty and uneasy there is hardly any delusion by which men are greater sufferers in their happiness than by their expecting too much from what is called pleasure that is from those intense delights which vulgarly engross the name of pleasure the very expectation spoils them when they do come we are often engaged in taking pains to persuade ourselves how much we are pleased rather than enjoying any pleasure which springs naturally out of the object and whenever we depend upon being vastly delighted we always go home secretly grieved at missing our aim likewise as has been observed just now when this humour of being prodigiously delighted has once taken hold of the imagination it hinders us from providing for or acquiescing in those gently soothing engagements the due variety and succession of which are the only things that supply a vein or continued stream of happiness what i have been able to observe of that part of mankind whose professed pursuit is pleasure and who are withheld in the pursuit by no restraints of fortune or scruples of conscience corresponds sufficiently with this account i have commonly remarked in such men a restless and inextinguishable passion for variety a great part of their time to be vacant and so much of it irksome and that with whatever eagerness and expectation they set out they become by degrees fastidious in their choice of pleasure languid in the enjoyment yet miserable under the want of it the truth seems to be that there is a limit at which these pleasures soon arrive and from which they ever afterwards decline they are by necessity of short duration as the organs cannot hold on    their emotions beyond a certain length of time and if you endeavour to compensate for this imperfection in their nature by the frequency with which you repeat them you suffer more than you gain by the fatigue of the faculties and the diminution of sensibility we have said nothing in this account of the loss of opportunities or the decay of faculties which whenever they happen leave the voluptuary destitute and desperate teased by desires that can never be gratified and the memory of pleasures which must return no more it will also be allowed by those who have experienced it and perhaps by those alone that pleasure which is purchased by the encumbrance of our fortune is purchased too dear the pleasure never compensating for the perpetual irritation of embarrassed circumstances these pleasures after all have their value and as the young are always too eager in their pursuit of them the old are sometimes too remiss that is too studious of their ease to be at the pains for them which they really deserve secondly neither does happiness consist in an exemption from pain labour care business suspense molestation and those evils which are without such a state being usually attended not with ease but with depression of spirits a tastelessness in all our ideas imaginary anxieties and the whole train of hypochondriacal affections for which reason the expectations of those who retire from their shops and countinghouses to enjoy the remainder of their days in leisure and tranquillity are seldom answered by the effect much less of such as in a fit of chagrin shut themselves up in cloisters and hermitages or quit the world and their stations in it for solitude and repose where there exists a known external cause of uneasiness the cause may be removed and the uneasiness will cease but those    imaginary distresses which men feel for want of real ones and which are equally tormenting and so far equally real as they depend upon no single or assignable subject of uneasiness admit oftentimes of no application of relief hence a moderate pain upon which the attention may fasten and spend itself is to many a refreshment as a fit of the gout will sometimes cure the spleen and the same of any less violent agitation of the mind as a literary controversy a lawsuit a contested election and above all gaming the passion for which in men of fortune and liberal minds is only to be accounted for on this principle thirdly neither does happiness consist in greatness rank or elevated station were it true that all superiority afforded pleasure it would follow that by how much we were the greater that is the more persons we were superior to in the same proportion so far as depended upon this cause we should be the happier but so it is that no superiority yields any satisfaction save that which we possess or obtain over those with whom we immediately compare ourselves the shepherd perceives no pleasure in his superiority over his dog the farmer in his superiority over the shepherd the lord in his superiority over the farmer nor the king lastly in his superiority over the lord superiority where there is no competition is seldom contemplated what most men are quite unconscious of but if the same shepherd can run fight or wrestle better than the peasants of his village if the farmer can show better cattle if he keep a better horse or be supposed to have a longer purse than any farmer in the hundred if the lord have more interest in an election greater favour at court a better house or larger estate than any nobleman in the county if the king possess a more extensive territory a more powerful fleet or army a more splendid establishment more loyal subjects or more weight and authority in adjusting the    affairs of nations than any prince in europe in all these cases the parties feel an actual satisfaction in their superiority now the conclusion that follows from hence is this that the pleasures of ambition which are supposed to be peculiar to high stations are in reality common to all conditions the farrier who shoes a horse better and who is in greater request for his skill than any man within ten miles of him possesses for all that i can see the delight of distinction and of excelling as truly and substantially as the statesman the soldier and the scholar who have filled europe with the reputation of their wisdom their valour or their knowledge no superiority appears to be of any account but superiority over a rival this it is manifest may exist wherever rivalships do and rivalships fall out amongst men of all ranks and degrees the object of emulation the dignity or magnitude of this object makes no difference as it is not what either possesses that constitutes the pleasure but what one possesses more than the other philosophy smiles at the contempt with which the rich and great speak of the petty strifes and competitions of the poor not reflecting that these strifes and competitions are just as reasonable as their own and the pleasure which success affords the same our position is that happiness does not consist in greatness and this position we make out by showing that even what are supposed to be the peculiar advantages of greatness the pleasures of ambition and superiority are in reality common to all conditions but whether the pursuits of ambition be ever wise whether they contribute more to the happiness or misery of the pursuers is a different question and a question concerning which we may be allowed to entertain great doubt the pleasure of success is exquisite so also is the anxiety of the pursuit and the pain of disappointment—and what is the worst part of the account the pleasure is shortlived we soon cease to look back upon those whom we    have left behind new contests are engaged in new prospects unfold themselves a succession of struggles is kept up whilst there is a rival left within the compass of our views and profession and when there is none the pleasure with the pursuit is at an end ii we have seen what happiness does not consist in we are next to consider in what it does consist in the conduct of life the great matter is to know beforehand what will please us and what pleasure will hold out so far as we know this our choice will be justified by the event and this knowledge is more scarce and difficult than at first sight it may seem to be for sometimes pleasures which are wonderfully alluring and flattering in the prospect turn out in the possession extremely insipid or do not hold out as we expected at other times pleasures start up which never entered into our calculation and which we might have missed of by not foreseeing whence we have reason to believe that we actually do miss of many pleasures from the same cause i say to know beforehand for after the experiment is tried it is commonly impracticable to retreat or change beside that shifting and changing is apt to generate a habit of restlessness which is destructive of the happiness of every condition by the reason of the original diversity of taste capacity and constitution observable in the human species and the still greater variety which habit and fashion have introduced in these particulars it is impossible to propose any plan of happiness which will succeed to all or any method of life which is universally eligible or practicable all that can be said is that there remains a presumption in favour of those conditions of life in which men generally appear most cheerful and contented for though the apparent happiness of mankind be not always a true measure of their real happiness it is the best measure we have  0 taking this for my guide i am inclined to believe that happiness consists i in the exercise of the social affections those persons commonly possess good spirits who have about them many objects of affection and endearment as wife children kindred friends and to the want of these may be imputed the peevishness of monks and of such as lead a monastic life of the same nature with the indulgence of our domestic affections and equally refreshing to the spirits is the pleasure which results from acts of bounty and beneficence exercised either in giving money or in imparting to those who want it the assistance of our skill and profession another main article of human happiness is ii the exercise of our faculties either of body or mind in the pursuit of some engaging end it seems to be true that no plenitude of present gratifications can make the possessor happy for a continuance unless he have something in reserve—something to hope for and look forward to this i conclude to be the case from comparing the alacrity and spirits of men who are engaged in any pursuit which interests them with the dejection and ennui of almost all who are either born to so much that they want nothing more or who have used up their satisfactions too soon and drained the sources of them it is this intolerable vacuity of mind which carries the rich and great to the horsecourse and the gamingtable and often engages them in contests and pursuits of which the success bears no proportion to the solicitude and expense with which it is sought an election for a disputed borough shall cost the parties twenty or thirty thousand pounds each—to say nothing of the anxiety humiliation and fatigue of the canvass when a seat in the house of commons of exactly the same value may be had for a tenth part of the money and with no trouble i do not mention this to blame    the rich and great perhaps they cannot do better but in confirmation of what i have advanced hope which thus appears to be of so much importance to our happiness is of two kinds—where there is something to be done towards attaining the object of our hope and where there is nothing to be done the first alone is of any value the latter being apt to corrupt into impatience having no power but to sit still and wait which soon grows tiresome the doctrine delivered under this head may be readily admitted but how to provide ourselves with a succession of pleasurable engagements is the difficulty this requires two things judgement in the choice of ends adapted to our opportunities and a command of imagination so as to be able when the judgement has made choice of an end to transfer a pleasure to the means after which the end may be forgotten as soon as we will hence those pleasures are most valuable not which are most exquisite in the fruition but which are most productive of engagement and activity in the pursuit a man who is in earnest in his endeavours after the happiness of a future state has in this respect an advantage over all the world for he has constantly before his eyes an object of supreme importance productive of perpetual engagement and activity and of which the pursuit which can be said of no pursuit besides lasts him to his lifes end yet even he must have many ends besides the far end but then they will conduct to that be subordinate and in some way or other capable of being referred to that and derive their satisfaction or an addition of satisfaction from that engagement is every thing the more significant however our engagements are the better such as the planning of laws institutions manufactures charities improvements public works and the endeavouring by our interest address solicitations and activity to carry them into effect or upon a smaller scale the    procuring of a maintenance and fortune for our families by a course of industry and application to our callings which forms and gives motion to the common occupations of life training up a child prosecuting a scheme for his future establishment making ourselves masters of a language or a science improving or managing an estate labouring after a piece of preferment and lastly any engagement which is innocent is better than none as the writing of a book the building of a house the laying out of a garden the digging of a fishpond—even the raising of a cucumber or a tulip whilst our minds are taken up with the objects or business before us we are commonly happy whatever the object or business be when the mind is absent and the thoughts are wandering to something else than what is passing in the place in which we are we are often miserable iii happiness depends upon the prudent constitution of the habits the art in which the secret of human happiness in a great measure consists is to set the habits in such a manner that every change may be a change for the better the habits themselves are much the same for whatever is made habitual becomes smooth and easy and nearly indifferent the return to an old habit is likewise easy whatever the habit be therefore the advantage is with those habits which allow of an indulgence in the deviation from them the luxurious receive no greater pleasure from their dainties than the peasant does from his bread and cheese but the peasant whenever he goes abroad finds a feast whereas the epicure must be well entertained to escape disgust those who spend every day at cards and those who go every day to plough pass their time much alike intent upon what they are about wanting nothing regretting nothing they are both for the time in a state of ease but then whatever suspends the occupation of the cardplayer distresses    him whereas to the labourer every interruption is a refreshment and this appears in the different effects that sunday produces upon the two which proves a day of recreation to the one but a lamentable burthen to the other the man who has learned to live alone feels his spirits enlivened whenever he enters into company and takes his leave without regret another who has long been accustomed to a crowd or continual succession of company experiences in company no elevation of spirits nor any greater satisfaction than what the man of a retired life finds in his chimneycorner so far their conditions are equal but let a change of place fortune or situation separate the companion from his circle his visitors his club commonroom or coffeehouse and the difference and advantage in the choice and constitution of the two habits will show itself solitude comes to the one clothed with melancholy to the other it brings liberty and quiet you will see the one fretful and restless at a loss how to dispose of his time till the hour come round when he may forget himself in bed the other easy and satisfied taking up his book or his pipe as soon as he finds himself alone ready to admit any little amusement that casts up or to turn his hands and attention to the first business that presents itself or content without either to sit still and let his train of thought glide indolently through his brain without much use perhaps or pleasure but without hankering after any thing better and without irritation a reader who has inured himself to books of science and argumentation if a novel a wellwritten pamphlet an article of news a narrative of a curious voyage or a journal of a traveller fall in his way sits down to the repast with relish enjoys his entertainment while it lasts and can return when it is over to his graver reading without distaste another with whom nothing will go down but works of humour and pleasantry or whose curiosity must be interested by perpetual novelty will consume a booksellers window in half a forenoon during which time he is rather    in search of diversion than diverted and as books to his taste are few and short and rapidly read over the stock is soon exhausted when he is left without resource from this principal supply of harmless amusement so far as circumstances of fortune conduce to happiness it is not the income which any man possesses but the increase of income that affords the pleasure two persons of whom one begins with a hundred and advances his income to a thousand pounds a year and the other sets off with a thousand and dwindles down to a hundred may in the course of their time have the receipt and spending of the same sum of money yet their satisfaction so far as fortune is concerned in it will be very different the series and sum total of their incomes being the same it makes a wide difference at which end they begin iv happiness consists in health by health i understand as well freedom from bodily distempers as that tranquillity firmness and alacrity of mind which we call good spirits and which may properly enough be included in our notion of health as depending commonly upon the same causes and yielding to the same management as our bodily constitution health in this sense is the one thing needful therefore no pains expense selfdenial or restraint to which we subject ourselves for the sake of health is too much whether it require us to relinquish lucrative situations to abstain from favourite indulgences to control intemperate passions or undergo tedious regimens whatever difficulties it lays us under a man who pursues his happiness rationally and resolutely will be content to submit when we are in perfect health and spirits we feel in ourselves a happiness independent of any particular outward gratification whatever and of which we can give no account this is an enjoyment which the deity has annexed to life and it probably constitutes in a great measure the happiness of infants and    brutes especially of the lower and sedentary orders of animals as of oysters periwinkles and the like for which i have sometimes been at a loss to find out amusement the above account of human happiness will justify the two following conclusions which although found in most books of morality have seldom i think been supported by any sufficient reasons first that happiness is pretty equally distributed amongst the different orders of civil society secondly that vice has no advantage over virtue even with respect to this worlds happiness chapter   virtue virtue is the doing good to mankind in obedience to the will of god and for the sake of everlasting happiness according to which definition the good of mankind is the subject the will of god the rule and everlasting happiness the motive of human virtue virtue has been divided by some moralists into benevolence prudence fortitude and temperance benevolence proposes good ends prudence suggests the best means of attaining them fortitude enables us to encounter the difficulties dangers and discouragements which stand in our way in the pursuit of these ends temperance repels and overcomes the passions that obstruct it benevolence for instance prompts us to undertake the cause of an oppressed orphan prudence suggests the best means of going about it fortitude enables us to confront the danger and bear up against the loss disgrace or repulse that may attend our undertaking and temperance keeps under the love of money of ease or amusement which might divert us from it    virtue is distinguished by others into two branches only prudence and benevolence prudence attentive to our own interest benevolence to that of our fellowcreatures both directed to the same end the increase of happiness in nature and taking equal concern in the future as in the present the four cardinal virtues are prudence fortitude temperance and justice but the division of virtue to which we are in modern times most accustomed is into duties— towards god as piety reverence resignation gratitude c towards other men or relative duties as justice charity fidelity loyalty c towards ourselves as chastity sobriety temperance preservation of life care of health c more of these distinctions have been proposed which it is not worth while to set down i shall proceed to state a few observations which relate to the general regulation of human conduct unconnected indeed with each other but very worthy of attention and which fall as properly under the title of this chapter as of any future one i mankind act more from habit than reflection it is on few only and great occasions that men deliberate at all on fewer still that they institute any thing like a regular inquiry into the moral rectitude or depravity of what they are about to do or wait for the result of it we are for the most part determined at once and by an impulse which is the effect and energy of preestablished habits and this constitution seems well adapted to the exigencies of human life and to the imbecility of our moral principle in the current    occasions and rapid opportunities of life there is oftentimes little leisure for reflection and were there more a man who has to reason about his duty when the temptation to transgress it is upon him is almost sure to reason himself into an error if we are in so great a degree passive under our habits where it is asked is the exercise of virtue the guilt of vice or any use of moral and religious knowledge i answer in the forming and contracting of these habits and hence results a rule of life of considerable importance viz that many things are to be done and abstained from solely for the sake of habit we will explain ourselves by an example or two a beggar with the appearance of extreme distress asks our charity if we come to argue the matter whether the distress be real whether it be not brought upon himself whether it be of public advantage to admit such application whether it be not to encourage idleness and vagrancy whether it may not invite impostors to our doors whether the money can be well spared or might not be better applied when these considerations are put together it may appear very doubtful whether we ought or ought not to give any thing but when we reflect that the misery before our eyes excites our pity whether we will or not that it is of the utmost consequence to us to cultivate this tenderness of mind that it is a quality cherished by indulgence and soon stifled by opposition when this i say is considered a wise man will do that for his own sake which he would have hesitated to do for the petitioners he will give way to his compassion rather than offer violence to a habit of so much general use a man of confirmed good habits will act in the same manner without any consideration at all this may serve for one instance another is the following a man has been brought up from his infancy with a dread of lying an occasion presents itself where at the expense of a little veracity he may divert his company set off his own wit with advantage attract    the notice and engage the partiality of all about him this is not a small temptation and when he looks at the other side of the question he sees no mischief that can ensue from this liberty no slander of any mans reputation no prejudice likely to arise to any mans interest where there nothing further to be considered it would be difficult to show why a man under such circumstances might not indulge his humour but when he reflects that his scruples about lying have hitherto preserved him free from this vice that occasions like the present will return where the inducement may be equally strong but the indulgence much less innocent that his scruples will wear away by a few transgressions and leave him subject to one of the meanest and most pernicious of all bad habits—a habit of lying whenever it will serve his turn when all this i say is considered a wise man will forego the present or a much greater pleasure rather than lay the foundation of a character so vicious and contemptible from what has been said may be explained also the nature of habitual virtue by the definition of virtue placed at the beginning of this chapter it appears that the good of mankind is the subject the will of god the rule and everlasting happiness the motive and end of all virtue yet in fact a man shall perform many an act of virtue without having either the good of mankind the will of god or everlasting happiness in his thought how is this to be understood in the same manner as that a man may be a very good servant without being conscious at every turn of a particular regard to his masters will or of an express attention to his masters interest indeed your best old servants are of this sort but then he must have served for a length of time under the actual direction of these motives to bring it to this in which service his merit and virtue consist there are habits not only of drinking swearing and lying and of some other things which are commonly acknowledged to be habits and called so but of every modification of action speech and thought man is a bundle of habits    there are habits of industry attention vigilance advertency of a prompt obedience to the judgement occurring or of yielding to the first impulse of passion of extending our views to the future or of resting upon the present of apprehending methodising reasoning of indolence and dilatoriness of vanity selfconceit melancholy partiality of fretfulness suspicion captiousness censoriousness of pride ambition covetousness of overreaching intriguing projecting in a word there is not a quality or function either of body or mind which does not feel the influence of this great law of animated nature ii the christian religion hath not ascertained the precise quantity of virtue necessary to salvation this has been made an objection to christianity but without reason for as all revelation however imparted originally must be transmitted by the ordinary vehicle of language it behoves those who make the objection to show that any form of words could be devised that might express this quantity or that it is possible to constitute a standard of moral attainments accommodated to the almost infinite diversity which subsists in the capacities and opportunities of different men it seems most agreeable to our conceptions of justice and is consonant enough to the language of scripture to suppose that there  0 are prepared for us rewards and punishments of all possible degrees from the most exalted happiness down to extreme misery so that our labour is never in vain whatever advancement we make in virtue we procure a proportionable accession of future happiness as on the other hand every accumulation of vice is the treasuring up so much wrath against the day of wrath it has been said that it can never be a just oeconomy of providence to admit one part of mankind into heaven and condemn the other to hell since there must be very little to choose between the worst man who is received into heaven and the best who is excluded and how know we it might be answered but that there may be as little to choose in the conditions without entering into a detail of scripture morality which would anticipate our subject the following general positions may be advanced i think with safety   that a state of happiness is not to be expected by those who are conscious of no moral or religious rule i mean those who cannot with truth say that they have been prompted to one action or withholden from one gratification by any regard to virtue or religion either immediate or habitual there needs no other proof of this than the consideration that a brute would be as proper an object of reward as such a man and that if the case were so the penal sanctions of religion could have no place for whom would you punish if you make such a one as this happy—or rather indeed religion itself both natural and revealed would cease to have either use or authority   that a state of happiness is not to be expected by those who reserve to themselves the habitual practice of any one sin or neglect of one known duty because no obedience can proceed upon proper motives which is not universal that is which is not directed to every command of god alike as they all stand upon the same authority because such an allowance would in effect amount to a toleration of every vice in the world    and because the strain of scripture language excludes any such hope when our duties are recited they are put collectively that is as all and every one of them required in the christian character add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charityp on the other hand when vices are enumerated they are put disjunctively that is as separately and severally excluding the sinner from heaven neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of heaven† those texts of scripture which seem to lean a contrary way as that charity shall cover the multitude of sins‡ that he which converteth a sinner from the error of his way shall hide a multitude of sins§ cannot i think for the reasons above mentioned be extended to sins deliberately habitually and obstinately persisted in   that a state of mere unprofitableness will not go unpunished this is expressly laid down by christ in the parable of the talents which supersedes all further reasoning upon the subject then he which had received one talent came and said lord i knew thee that thou art an austere man reaping where thou hast not sown and gathering where thou hast not strawed and i was afraid and hid thy talent in the earth lo there thou hast that is thine his lord answered and said unto him thou wicked and slothful servant thou knewest or knewest thou that i reap where i sowed not and gather where i have not strawed thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers and    then at my coming i should have received mine own with usury take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him which hath ten talents for unto every one that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth iii in every question of conduct where one side is doubtful and the other side safe we are bound to take the safe side this is best explained by an instance and i know of none more to our purpose than that of suicide suppose for examples sake that it appear doubtful to a reasoner upon the subject whether he may lawfully destroy himself he can have no doubt that it is lawful for him to let it alone here therefore is a case in which one side is doubtful and the other side safe by virtue therefore of our rule he is bound to pursue the safe side that is to forbear from offering violence to himself whilst a doubt remains upon his mind concerning the lawfulness of suicide it is prudent you allow to take the safe side but our observation means something more we assert that the action concerning which we doubt whatever it may be in itself or to another would in us whilst this doubt remains upon our minds be certainly sinful the case is expressly so adjudged by st paul with whose authority we will for the present rest contented i know and am persuaded by the lord jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean to him it is unclean happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth and he that doubteth is damned condemned if he eat for whatsoever is not of faith ie not done with a full persuasion of the lawfulness of it is sin†    book ii moral obligation chapter   the question why am i obliged to keep my word considered why am i obliged to keep my word because it is right says one because it is agreeable to the fitness of things says another because it is conformable to reason and nature says a third because it is conformable to truth says a fourth because it promotes the public good says a fifth because it is required by the will of god concludes a sixth upon which different accounts two things are observable first that they all ultimately coincide the fitness of things means their fitness to produce happiness the nature of things means that actual constitution of the world by which some things as such and such actions for example produce happiness and others misery reason is the principle by which we discover or judge of this constitution truth is this judgement expressed or drawn out into propositions so that it necessarily comes to pass that what promotes the public happiness or happiness on the whole is agreeable to the fitness of things to nature to reason and to truth and such as will appear by and by is the divine character that what promotes the general happiness is required by the will of god and what has all the above properties must needs be right for right means no more than conformity to the rule we go by whatever that rule be    and this is the reason that moralists from whatever different principles they set out commonly meet in their conclusions that is they enjoin the same conduct prescribe the same rules of duty and with a few exceptions deliver upon dubious cases the same determinations secondly it is to be observed that these answers all leave the matter short for the inquirer may turn round upon his teacher with a second question in which he will expect to be satisfied namely why am i obliged to do what is right to act agreeably to the fitness of things to conform to reason nature or truth to promote the public good or to obey the will of god the proper method of conducting the inquiry is first to examine what we mean when we say a man is obliged to do any thing and then to show why he is obliged to do the thing which we have proposed as an example namely to keep his word chapter   what we mean when we say a man is obliged to do a thing a man is said to be obliged when he is urged by a violent motive resulting from the command of another i the motive must be violent if a person who has done me some little service or has a small place in his disposal ask me upon some occasion for my vote i may possibly give it to him from a motive of gratitude or expectation but i should hardly say that i was obliged to give it him because the inducement does not rise high enough whereas if a father or a master any great benefactor or one on whom my fortune depends require my vote i give it him of course and my answer to all who ask me why i voted so and so is that my father or my master obliged me that i had received so    many favours from or had so great a dependence upon such a one that i was obliged to vote as he directed me secondly it must result from the command of another offer a man a gratuity for doing any thing for seizing for example an offender he is not obliged by your offer to do it nor would he say he is though he may be induced persuaded prevailed upon tempted if a magistrate or the mans immediate superior command it he considers himself as obliged to comply though possibly he would lose less by a refusal in this case than in the former i will not undertake to say that the words obligation and obliged are used uniformly in this sense or always with this distinction nor is it possible to tie down popular phrases to any constant signification but wherever the motive is violent enough and coupled with the idea of command authority law or the will of a superior there i take it we always reckon ourselves to be obliged and from this account of obligation it follows that we can be obliged to nothing but what we ourselves are to gain or lose something by for nothing else can be a violent motive to us as we should not be obliged to obey the laws or the magistrate unless rewards or punishments pleasure or pain somehow or other depended upon our obedience so neither should we without the same reason be obliged to do what is right to practise virtue or to obey the commands of god chapter   the question why am i obliged to keep my word resumed let it be remembered that to be obliged is to be urged by a violent motive resulting from the command of another    and then let it be asked why am i obliged to keep my word and the answer will be because i am urged to do so by a violent motive namely the expectation of being after this life rewarded if i do or punished for it if i do not resulting from the command of another namely of god this solution goes to the bottom of the subject as no further question can reasonably be asked therefore private happiness is our motive and the will of god our rule when i first turned my thoughts to moral speculations an air of mystery seemed to hang over the whole subject which arose i believe from hence—that i supposed with many authors whom i had read that to be obliged to do a thing was very different from being induced only to do it and that the obligation to practise virtue to do what is right just c was quite another thing and of another kind than the obligation which a soldier is under to obey his officer a servant his master or any of the civil and ordinary obligations of human life whereas from what has been said it appears that moral obligation is like all other obligations and that obligation is nothing more than an inducement of sufficient strength and resulting in some way from the command of another there is always understood to be a difference between an act of prudence and an act of duty thus if i distrust a man who owed me a sum of money i should reckon it an act of prudence to get another person bound with him but i should hardly call it an act of duty on the other hand it would be thought a very unusual and loose kind of language to say that as i had made such a promise it was prudent to perform it or that as my friend when he went abroad placed a box of jewels in my hands it would be prudent in me to preserve it for him till he returned now in what you will ask does the difference consist inasmuch as according to our account of the matter both in the one    case and the other in acts of duty as well as acts of prudence we consider solely what we ourselves shall gain or lose by the act the difference and the only difference is this that in the one case we consider what we shall gain or lose in the present world in the other case we consider also what we shall gain or lose in the world to come they who would establish a system of morality independent of a future state must look out for some different idea of moral obligation unless they can show that virtue conducts the possessor to certain happiness in this life or to a much greater share of it than he could attain by a different behaviour to us there are two great questions i will there be after this life any distribution of rewards and punishments at all ii if there be what actions will be rewarded and what will be punished the first question comprises the credibility of the christian religion together with the presumptive proofs of a future retribution from the light of nature the second question comprises the province of morality both questions are too much for one work the affirmative therefore of the first although we confess that it is the foundation upon which the whole fabric rests must in this treatise be taken for granted chapter   the will of god as the will of god is our rule to inquire what is our duty or what we are obliged to do in any instance is in effect to inquire what is the will of god in that instance which consequently becomes the whole business of morality    now there are two methods of coming at the will of god on any point i by his express declarations when they are to be had and which must be sought for in scripture ii by what we can discover of his designs and disposition from his works or as we usually call it the light of nature and here we may observe the absurdity of separating natural and revealed religion from each other the object of both is the same—to discover the will of god—and provided we do but discover it it matters nothing by what means an ambassador judging by what he knows of his sovereigns disposition and arguing from what he has observed of his conduct or is acquainted with of his designs may take his measures in many cases with safety and presume with great probability how his master would have him act on most occasions that arise but if he have his commission and instructions in his pocket it would be strange not to look into them he will be directed by both rules when his instructions are clear and positive there is an end to all further deliberation unless indeed he suspect their authenticity where his instructions are silent or dubious he will endeavour to supply or explain them by what he has been able to collect from other quarters of his masters general inclination or intentions mr hume in his fourth appendix to his principles of morals has been pleased to complain of the modern scheme of uniting ethics with the christian theology they who find themselves disposed to join in this complaint will do well to observe what mr hume himself has been able to make of morality without this union and for that purpose let them read the second part of the ninth section of the above essay which part contains the practical    application of the whole treatise—a treatise which mr hume declares to be incomparably the best he ever wrote when they have read it over let them consider whether any motives there proposed are likely to be found sufficient to withhold men from the gratification of lust revenge envy ambition avarice or to prevent the existence of these passions unless they rise up from this celebrated essay with stronger impressions upon their minds than it ever left upon mine they will acknowledge the necessity of additional sanctions but the necessity of these sanctions is not now the question if they be in fact established if the rewards and punishments held forth in the gospel will actually come to pass they must be considered such as reject the christian religion are to make the best shift they can to build up a system and lay the foundation of morality without it but it appears to me a great inconsistency in those who receive christianity and expect something to come of it to endeavour to keep all such expectations out of sight in their reasonings concerning human duty the method of coming at the will of god concerning any action by the light of nature is to inquire into the tendency of the action to promote or diminish the general happiness this rule proceeds upon the presumption that god almighty wills and wishes the happiness of his creatures and consequently that those actions which promote that will and wish must be agreeable to him and the contrary as this presumption is the foundation of our whole system it becomes necessary to explain the reasons upon which it rests chapter   the divine benevolence when god created the human species either he wished their happiness or he wished their misery or he was indifferent and unconcerned about both  0 if he had wished our misery he might have made sure of his purpose by forming our senses to be so many sores and pains to us as they are now instruments of gratification and enjoyment or by placing us amidst objects so illsuited to our perceptions as to have continually offended us instead of ministering to our refreshment and delight he might have made for example every thing we tasted bitter every thing we saw loathsome every thing we touched a sting every smell a stench and every sound a discord if he had been indifferent about our happiness or misery we must impute to our good fortune as all design by this supposition is excluded both the capacity of our senses to receive pleasure and the supply of external objects fitted to produce it but either of these and still more both of them being too much to be attributed to accident nothing remains but the first supposition that god when he created the human species wished their happiness and made for them the provision which he has made with that view and for that purpose the same argument may be proposed in different terms thus contrivance proves design and the predominant tendency of the contrivance indicates the disposition of the designer the world abounds with contrivances and all the contrivances which we are acquainted with are directed to beneficial purposes evil no doubt exists but is never that we can perceive the object of contrivance teeth are contrived to eat not to ache their aching now and then is incidental to the contrivance perhaps inseparable from it or even if you will let it be called a defect in the contrivance but it is not the object of it this is a distinction which well deserves to be attended to in describing implements of husbandry you would hardly say of the sickle that it is made to cut the reapers fingers though from the construction of the instrument and the manner of using it this mischief often happens but if you had occasion to describe instruments of torture or execution this    engine you would say is to extend the sinews this to dislocate the joints this to break the bones this to scorch the soles of the feet here pain and misery are the very objects of the contrivance now nothing of this sort is to be found in the works of nature we never discover a train of contrivance to bring about an evil purpose no anatomist ever discovered a system of organization calculated to produce pain and disease or in explaining the parts of the human body ever said this is to irritate this to inflame this duct is to convey the gravel to the kidneys this gland to secrete the humour which forms the gout if by chance he come at a part of which he knows not the use the most he can say is that it is useless no one ever suspects that it is put there to incommode to annoy or to torment since then god hath called forth his consummate wisdom to contrive and provide for our happiness and the world appears to have been constituted with this design at first so long as this constitution is upholden by him we must in reason suppose the same design to continue the contemplation of universal nature rather bewilders the mind than affects it there is always a bright spot in the prospect upon which the eye rests a single example perhaps by which each man finds himself more convinced than by all others put together i seem for my own part to see the benevolence of the deity more clearly in the pleasures of very young children than in any thing in the world the pleasures of grown persons may be reckoned partly of their own procuring especially if there has been any industry or contrivance or pursuit to come at them or if they are founded like music painting c upon any qualification of their own acquiring but the pleasures of a healthy infant are so manifestly provided for it by another and the benevolence of the provision is so unquestionable that every child i see at its sport affords to my mind a kind of sensible evidence of the finger of god and of the disposition which directs it    but the example which strikes each man most strongly is the true example for him and hardly two minds hit upon the same which shows the abundance of such examples about us we conclude therefore that god wills and wishes the happiness of his creatures and this conclusion being once established we are at liberty to go on with the rule built upon it namely that the method of coming at the will of god concerning any action by the light of nature is to inquire into the tendency of that action to promote or diminish the general happiness chapter   utility so then actions are to be estimated by their tendency whatever is expedient is right it is the utility of any moral rule alone which constitutes the obligation of it but to all this there seems a plain objection viz that many actions are useful which no man in his senses will allow to be right there are occasions in which the hand of the assassin would be very useful the present possessor of some great estate employs his influence and fortune to annoy corrupt or oppress all about him his estate would devolve by his death to a successor of an opposite character it is useful therefore to despatch such a one as soon as possible out of the way as the neighbourhood will exchange    thereby a pernicious tyrant for a wise and generous benefactor it might be useful to rob a miser and give the money to the poor as the money no doubt would produce more happiness by being laid out in food and clothing for half a dozen distressed families than by continuing locked up in a misers chest it may be useful to get possession of a place a piece of preferment or of a seat in parliament by bribery or false swearing as by means of them we may serve the public more effectually than in our private station what then shall we say must we admit these actions to be right which would be to justify assassination plunder and perjury or must we give up our principle that the criterion of right is utility it is not necessary to do either the true answer is this that these actions after all are not useful and for that reason and that alone are not right to see this point perfectly it must be observed that the bad consequences of actions are twofold particular and general the particular bad consequence of an action is the mischief which that single action directly and immediately occasions the general bad consequence is the violation of some necessary or useful general rule thus the particular bad consequence of the assassination above described is the fright and pain which the deceased underwent the loss he suffered of life which is as valuable to a bad man as to a good one or more so the prejudice and affliction of which his death was the occasion to his family friends and dependants the general bad consequence is the violation of this necessary general rule that no man be put to death for his crimes but by public authority although therefore such an action have no particular bad consequences or greater particular good consequences yet it is not useful by reason of the general consequence which is of more importance and which is evil and the same of the other two instances and of a million more which might be mentioned    but as this solution supposes that the moral government of the world must proceed by general rules it remains that we show the necessity of this chapter   the necessity of general rules you cannot permit one action and forbid another without showing a difference between them consequently the same sort of actions must be generally permitted or generally forbidden where therefore the general permission of them would be pernicious it becomes necessary to lay down and support the rule which generally forbids them thus to return once more to the case of the assassin the assassin knocked the rich villain on the head because he thought him better out of the way than in it if you allow this excuse in the present instance you must allow it to all who act in the same manner and from the said motive that is you must allow every man to kill any one he meets whom he thinks noxious or useless which in the event would be to commit every mans life and safety to the spleen fury and fanaticism of his neighbour—a disposition of affairs which would soon fill the world with misery and confusion and ere long put an end to human society if not to the human species the necessity of general rules in human government is apparent but whether the same necessity subsist in the divine oeconomy in that distribution of rewards and punishments to which a moralist looks forward may be doubted i answer that general rules are necessary to every moral government and by moral government i mean any dispensation whose object is to influence the conduct of reasonable creatures for if of two actions perfectly similar one be punished and the other be rewarded or forgiven which is the consequence of rejecting    general rules the subjects of such a dispensation would no longer know either what to expect or how to act rewards and punishments would cease to be such—would become accidents like the stroke of a thunderbolt or the discovery of a mine like a blank or a benefitticket in a lottery they would occasion pain or pleasure when they happened but following in no known order from any particular course of action they could have no previous influence or effect upon the conduct an attention to general rules therefore is included in the very idea of reward and punishment consequently whatever reason there is to expect future reward and punishment at the hand of god there is the same reason to believe that he will proceed in the distribution of it by general rules before we prosecute the consideration of general consequences any further it may be proper to anticipate a reflection which will be apt enough to suggest itself in the progress of our argument as the general consequence of an action upon which so much of the guilt of a bad action depends consists in the example it should seem that if the action be done with perfect secrecy so as to furnish no bad example that part of the guilt drops off in the case of suicide for instance if a man can so manage matters as to take away his own life without being known or suspected to have done so he is not chargeable with any mischief from the example nor does his punishment seem necessary in order to save the authority of any general rule in the first place those who reason in this manner do not observe that they are setting up a general rule of all others the least to be endured namely that secrecy whenever secrecy is practicable will justify any action    were such a rule admitted for instance in the case above produced is there not reason to fear that people would be disappearing perpetually in the next place i would wish them to be well satisfied about the points proposed in the following queries   whether the scriptures do not teach us to expect that at the general judgement of the world the most secret actions will be brought to light   for what purpose can this be but to make them the objects of reward and punishment   whether being so brought to light they will not fall under the operation of those equal and impartial rules by which god will deal with his creatures they will then become examples whatever they be now and require the same treatment from the judge and governor of the moral world as if they had been detected from the first chapter   the consideration of general consequences pursued the general consequence of any action may be estimated by asking what would be the consequence if the same sort of actions were generally permitted but suppose they were and a thousand such actions perpetrated under this permission is it just to charge a single action with the collected guilt and mischief of the whole    thousand i answer that the reason for prohibiting and punishing an action and this reason may be called the guilt of the action if you please will always be in proportion to the whole mischief that would arise from the general impunity and toleration of actions of the same sort whatever is expedient is right but then it must be expedient on the whole at the long run in all its effects collateral and remote as well as in those which are immediate and direct as it is obvious that in computing consequences it makes no difference in what way or at what distance they ensue to impress this doctrine on the minds of young readers and to teach them to extend their views beyond the immediate mischief of a crime i shall here subjoin a string of instances in which the particular consequence is comparatively insignificant and where the malignity of the crime and the severity with which human laws pursue it is almost entirely founded upon the general consequence the particular consequence of coining is the loss of a guinea or of half a guinea to the person who receives the counterfeit money the general consequence by which i mean the consequence that would ensue if the same practice were generally permitted is to abolish the use of money the particular consequence of forgery is a damage of twenty or thirty pounds to the man who accepts the forged bill the general consequence is the stoppage of papercurrency the particular consequence of sheepstealing or horsestealing is a loss to the owner to the amount of the value of the sheep or horse stolen the general consequence is that the land could not be occupied nor the market supplied with this kind of stock the particular consequence of breaking into a house empty of inhabitants is the loss of a pair of silver candlesticks or a few spoons the general consequence is that nobody could leave their house empty    the particular consequence of smuggling may be a deduction from the national fund too minute for computation the general consequence is the destruction of one entire branch of public revenue a proportionable increase of the burthen upon other branches and the ruin of all fair and open trade in the article smuggled the particular consequence of an officers breaking his parole is the loss of a prisoner who was possibly not worth keeping the general consequence is that this mitigation of captivity would be refused to all others and what proves incontestably the superior importance of general consequences is that crimes are the same and treated in the same manner though the particular consequence be very different the crime and fate of the housebreaker is the same whether his booty be five pounds or fifty and the reason is that the general consequence is the same the want of this distinction between particular and general consequences or rather the not sufficiently attending to the latter is the cause of that perplexity which we meet with in ancient moralists on the one hand they were sensible of the absurdity of pronouncing actions good or evil without regard to the good or evil they produced on the other hand they were startled at the conclusions to which a steady adherence to consequences seemed sometimes to conduct them to relieve this difficulty they contrived the to prepon or the honestum by which terms they meant to constitute a measure of right distinct from utility whilst the utile served them that is whilst it corresponded with their habitual notions of the rectitude of actions they went by it when they fell in with such cases as those mentioned in the sixth chapter they took leave of their guide and resorted to the honestum the only account they could give of the matter was that these actions might be useful but because they were not at the same time honesta they were by no means to be deemed just or right    from the principles delivered in this and the two preceding chapters a maxim may be explained which is in every mans mouth and in most mens without meaning viz not to do evil that good may come that is let us not violate a general rule for the sake of any particular good consequence we may expect which is for the most part a salutary caution the advantage seldom compensating for the violation of the rule strictly speaking that cannot be evil from which good comes but in this way and with a view to the distinction between particular and general consequences it may we will conclude this subject of consequences with the following reflection a man may imagine that any action of his with respect to the public must be inconsiderable so also is the agent if his crime produce but a small effect upon the universal interest his punishment or destruction bears a small proportion to the sum of happiness and misery in the creation chapter   of right right and obligation are reciprocal that is wherever there is a right in one person there is a corresponding obligation upon others if one man has a right to an estate others are obliged to abstain from it—if parents have a right to reverence from their children children are obliged to reverence their parents—and so in all other instances now because moral obligation depends as we have seen upon the will of god right which is correlative to it must depend upon the same right therefore signifies consistency with the will of god but if the divine will determine the distinction of right and wrong what else is it but an identical proposition to say of god  0 that he acts right or how is it possible to conceive even that he should act wrong yet these assertions are intelligible and significant the case is this by virtue of the two principles that god wills the happiness of his creatures and that the will of god is the measure of right and wrong we arrive at certain conclusions which conclusions become rules and we soon learn to pronounce actions right or wrong according as they agree or disagree with our rules without looking any further and when the habit is once established of stopping at the rules we can go back and compare with these rules even the divine conduct itself and yet it may be true only not observed by us at the time that the rules themselves are deduced from the divine will right is a quality of persons or of actions of persons as when we say such a one has a right to this estate parents have a right to reverence from their children the king to allegiance from his subjects masters have a right to their servants labour a man has not a right over his own life of actions as in such expressions as the following it is right to punish murder with death his behaviour on that occasion was right it is not right to send an unfortunate debtor to gaol he did or acted right who gave up his place rather than vote against his judgement in this latter set of expressions you may substitute the definition of right above given for the term itself eg it is consistent with the will of god to punish murder with death his behaviour on that occasion was consistent with the will of god it is not consistent with the will of god to send an unfortunate debtor to gaol he did or acted consistently with the will of god who gave up his place rather than vote against his judgement in the former set you must vary the construction a little when you introduce the definition instead of the term such a one has a right to this estate that is it is consistent with the will of god    that such a one should have it parents have a right to reverence from their children that is it is consistent with the will of god that children should reverence their parents and the same of the rest chapter  0 the division of rights rights when applied to persons are   natural or adventitious   alienable or unalienable   perfect or imperfect i rights are natural or adventitious natural rights are such as would belong to a man although there subsisted in the world no civil government whatever adventitious rights are such as would not natural rights are a mans right to his life limbs and liberty his right to the produce of his personal labour to the use in common with others of air light water if a thousand different persons from a thousand different corners of the world were cast together upon a desert island they would from the first be every one entitled to these rights adventitious rights are the right of a king over his subjects of a general over his soldiers of a judge over the life and liberty of a prisoner a right to elect or appoint magistrates to impose taxes decide disputes direct the descent or disposition of property a right in a word in any one man or particular body of men to make laws and regulations for the rest for none of these rights would exist in the newly inhabited island and here it will be asked how adventitious rights are created or which is the same thing how any new rights can accrue from    the establishment of civil society as rights of all kinds we remember depend upon the will of god and civil society is but the ordinance and institution of man for the solution of this difficulty we must return to our first principles god wills the happiness of mankind and the existence of civil society as conducive to that happiness consequently many things which are useful for the support of civil society in general or for the conduct and conservation of particular societies already established are for that reason consistent with the will of god or right which without that reason ie without the establishment of civil society would not have been so from whence also it appears that adventitious rights though immediately derived from human appointment are not for that reason less sacred than natural rights nor the obligation to respect them less cogent they both ultimately rely upon the same authority the will of god such a man claims a right to a particular estate he can show it is true nothing for his right but a rule of the civil community to which he belongs and this rule may be arbitrary capricious and absurd notwithstanding all this there would be the same sin in dispossessing the man of his estate by craft or violence as if it had been assigned to him like the partition of the country amongst the twelve tribes by the immediate designation and appointment of heaven ii rights are alienable or unalienable which terms explain themselves the right we have to most of those things which we call property as houses lands money c is alienable the right of a prince over his people of a husband over his wife of a master over his servant is generally and naturally unalienable the distinction depends upon the mode of acquiring the right if the right originate from a contract and be limited to the person by the express terms of the contract or by the common interpretation    of such contracts which is equivalent to an express stipulation or by a personal condition annexed to the right then it is unalienable in all other cases it is alienable the right to civil liberty is alienable though in the vehemence of mens zeal for it and the language of some political remonstrances it has often been pronounced to be an unalienable right the true reason why mankind hold in detestation the memory of those who have sold their liberty to a tyrant is that together with their own they sold commonly or endangered the liberty of others which certainly they had no right to dispose of iii rights are perfect or imperfect perfect rights may be asserted by force or what in civil society comes into the place of private force by course of law imperfect rights may not examples of perfect rights—a mans right to his life person house for if these be attacked he may repel the attacked by instant violence or punish the aggressor by law a mans right to his estate furniture clothes money and to all ordinary articles of property for if they be injuriously taken from him he may compel the author of the injury to make restitution or satisfaction examples of imperfect rights—in elections or appointments to offices where the qualifications are prescribed the best qualified candidate has a right to success yet if he be rejected he has no remedy he can neither seize the office by force nor obtain redress at law his right therefore is imperfect a poor neighbour has a right to relief yet if it be refused him he must not extort it a benefactor has a right to returns of gratitude from the person he has obliged yet if he meet with none he must acquiesce children have a right to affection and education from their parents and parents on their part to duty and reverence from their children yet if these rights be on either side withholden there is no compulsion by which they can be enforced    it may be at first view difficult to apprehend how a person should have a right to a thing and yet have no right to use the means necessary to obtain it this difficulty like most others in morality is resolvable into the necessity of general rules the reader recollects that a person is said to have a right to a thing when it is consistent with the will of god that he should possess it so that the question is reduced to this how it comes to pass that it should be consistent with the will of god that a person should possess a thing and yet not be consistent with the same will that he should use force to obtain it the answer is that by reason of the indeterminateness either of the object or of the circumstances of the right the permission of force in this case would in its consequence lead to the permission of force in other cases where there existed no right at all the candidate above described has no doubt a right to success but his right depends upon his qualifications for instance upon his comparative virtue learning c there must be somebody therefore to compare them the existence degree and respective importance of these qualifications are all indeterminate there must be somebody therefore to determine them to allow the candidate to demand success by force is to make him the judge of his own qualifications you cannot do this but you must make all other candidates the same which would open a door to demands without number reason or right in like manner a poor man has a right to relief from the rich but the mode season and quantum of that relief who shall contribute to it or how much are not ascertained yet these points must be ascertained before a claim to relief can be prosecuted by force for to allow the poor to ascertain them for themselves would be to expose property to so many of these claims that it would lose its value or rather its nature that is cease indeed to be property the same observation holds of all other cases of imperfect rights not to mention that in the instances of gratitude affection reverence and the like force is excluded by the very    idea of the duty which must be voluntary or cannot exist at all wherever the right is imperfect the corresponding obligation is so too i am obliged to prefer the best candidate to relieve the poor be grateful to my benefactors take care of my children and reverence my parents but in all these cases my obligation like their right is imperfect i call these obligations imperfect in conformity to the established language of writers upon the subject the term however seems ill chosen on this account that it leads many to imagine that there is less guilt in the violation of an imperfect obligation than of a perfect one which is a groundless notion for an obligation being perfect or imperfect determines only whether violence may or may not be employed to enforce it and determines nothing else the degree of guilt incurred by violating the obligation is a different thing and is determined by circumstances altogether independent of this distinction a man who by a partial prejudiced or corrupt vote disappoints a worthy candidate of a station in life upon which his hopes possibly or livelihood depended and who thereby grievously discourages merit and emulation in others commits i am persuaded a much greater crime than if he filched a book out of a library or picked a pocket of a handkerchief though in the one case he violates only an imperfect right in the other a perfect one as positive precepts are often indeterminate in their extent and as the indeterminateness of an obligation is that which makes it imperfect it comes to pass that positive precepts commonly produce an imperfect obligation negative precepts or prohibitions being generally precise constitute accordingly perfect obligations the fifth commandment is positive and the duty which results from it is imperfect the sixth commandment is negative and imposes a perfect obligation    religion and virtue find their principal exercise among the imperfect obligations the laws of civil society taking pretty good care of the rest chapter    the general rights of mankind by the general rights of mankind i mean the rights which belong to the species collectively the original stock as i may say which they have since distributed among themselves these are   a right to the fruits or vegetable produce of the earth the insensible parts of the creation are incapable of injury and it is nugatory to inquire into the right where the use can be attended with no injury but it may be worth observing for the sake of an inference which will appear below that as god had created us with a want and desire of food and provided things suited by their nature to sustain and satisfy us we may fairly presume that he intended we should apply these things to that purpose   a right to the flesh of animals this is a very different claim from the former some excuse seems necessary for the pain and loss which we occasion to brutes by restraining them of their liberty mutilating their bodies and at last putting an end to their lives which we suppose to be the whole of their existence for our pleasure or conveniency the reasons alleged in vindication of this practice are the following that the several species of brutes being created to prey upon one another affords a kind of analogy to prove that the human species were intended to feed upon them that if let alone    they would overrun the earth and exclude mankind from the occupation of it that they are requited for what they suffer at our hands by our care and protection upon which reasons i would observe that the analogy contended for is extremely lame since brutes have no power to support life by any other means and since we have for the whole human species might subsist entirely upon fruit pulse herbs and roots as many tribes of hindoos actually do the two other reasons may be valid reasons as far as they go for no doubt if man had been supported entirely by vegetable food a great part of those animals which die to furnish his table would never have lived but they by no means justify our right over the lives of brutes to the extent in which we exercise it what danger is there for instance of fish interfering with us in the occupation of their element or what do we contribute to their support or preservation it seems to me that it would be difficult to defend this right by any arguments which the light and order of nature afford and that we are beholden for it to the permission recorded in scripture gen ix     and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air and upon all that moveth upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are they delivered every moving thing shall be meat for you even as the green herb have i given you all things to adam and his posterity had been granted at the creation every green herb for meat and nothing more in the last clause of the passage now produced the old grant is recited and extended to the flesh of animals even as the green herb have i given you all things but this was not till after the flood the inhabitants of the antediluvian world had therefore no such permission that we know of whether they actually refrained from the flesh of animals is another question abel we read was a keeper of    sheep and for what purpose he kept them except for food is difficult to say unless it were sacrifices might not however some of the stricter sects among the antediluvians be scrupulous as to this point and might not noah and his family be of this description for it is not probable that god would publish a permission to authorise a practice which had never been disputed wanton and what is worse studied cruelty to brutes is certainly wrong as coming within one of these reasons from reason then or revelation or from both together it appears to be god almightys intention that the productions of the earth should be applied to the sustentation of human life consequently all waste and misapplication of these productions is contrary to the divine intention and will and therefore wrong for the same reason that any other crime is so such as what is related of william the conqueror the converting of twenty manors into a forest for hunting or which is not much better suffering them to continue in that state or the letting of large tracts of land lie barren because the owner cannot cultivate them nor will part with them to those who can or destroying or suffering to perish great part of an article of human provision in order to enhance the price of the remainder which is said to have been till lately the case with fish caught upon the english coast or diminishing the breed of animals by a wanton or improvident consumption of the young as of the spawn of shellfish or the fry of salmon by the use of unlawful nets or at improper seasons to this head may also be referred what is the same evil in a smaller way the expending of human food on superfluous dogs or horses and lastly the reducing of the quantity in order to alter the quality and to alter    it generally for the worse as the distillation of spirits from breadcorn the boiling down of solid meat for sauces essences c this seems to be the lesson which our saviour after his manner inculcates when he bids his disciples gather up the fragments that nothing be lost and it opens indeed a new field of duty schemes of wealth or profit prompt the active part of mankind to cast about how they may convert their property to the most advantage and their own advantage and that of the public commonly concur but it has not as yet entered into the minds of mankind to reflect that it is a duty to add what we can to the common stock of provision by extracting out of our estates the most they will yield or that it is any sin to neglect this from the same intention of god almighty we also deduce another conclusion namely that nothing ought to be made exclusive property which can be conveniently enjoyed in common it is the general intention of god almighty that the produce of the earth be applied to the use of man this appears from the constitution of nature or if you will from his express declaration and this is all that appears at first under this general donation one man has the same right as another you pluck an apple from a tree or take a lamb from a flock for your immediate use and nourishment and i do the same and we both plead for what we do the general intention of the supreme proprietor so far all is right but you cannot claim the whole tree or the whole flock and exclude me from any share of them and plead this general intention for what you do the plea will not serve you you must show something more you must show by probable arguments at least that it is gods intention that these things should be parcelled out to individuals and that the established distribution under which you claim should be upholden show me this and i am satisfied but until this be shown the general intention which has been made appear and which is all that does appear must prevail and under  0 that my title is as good as yours now there is no argument to induce such a presumption but one that the thing cannot be enjoyed at all or enjoyed with the same or with nearly the same advantage while it continues in common as when appropriated this is true where there is not enough for all or where the article in question requires care or labour in the production or preservation but where no such reason obtains and the thing is in its nature capable of being enjoyed by as many as will it seems an arbitrary usurpation upon the rights of mankind to confine the use of it to any if a medicinal spring were discovered in a piece of ground which was private property copious enough for every purpose to which it could be applied i would award a compensation to the owner of the field and a liberal profit to the author of the discovery especially if he had bestowed pains or expense upon the search but i question whether any human laws would be justified or would justify the owner in prohibiting mankind from the use of the water or setting such a price upon it as would almost amount to a prohibition if there be fisheries which are inexhaustible as the codfishery upon the banks of newfoundland and the herringfishery in the british seas are said to be then all those conventions by which one or two nations claim to themselves and guaranty to each other the exclusive enjoyment of these fisheries are so many encroachments upon the general rights of mankind upon the same principle may be determined a question which makes a great figure in books of natural law utrum mare sit liberum that is as i understand it whether the exclusive right of navigating particular seas or a control over the navigation of these seas can be claimed consistently with the law of nature by any nation what is necessary for each nations safety we allow as their own bays creeks and harbours the sea contiguous to that is within    cannonshot or three leagues of their coast and upon this principle of safety if upon any principle must be defended the claim of the venetian state to the adriatic of denmark to the baltic sea and of great britain to the seas which invest the island but when spain asserts a right to the pacific ocean or portugal to the indian seas or when any nation extends its pretensions much beyond the limits of its own territories they erect a claim which interferes with the benevolent designs of providence and which no human authority can justify   another right which may be called a general right as it is incidental to every man who is in a situation to claim it is the right of extreme necessity by which is meant a right to use or destroy anothers property when it is necessary for our own preservation to do so as a right to take without or against the owners leave the first food clothes or shelter we meet with when we are in danger of perishing through want of them a right to throw goods overboard to save the ship or to pull down a house in order to stop the progress of a fire and a few other instances of the same kind of which right the foundation seems to be this that when property was first instituted the institution was not intended to operate to the destruction of any therefore when such consequences would follow all regard to it is superseded or rather perhaps these are the few cases where the particular consequence exceeds the general consequence where the remote mischief resulting from the violation of the general rule is overbalanced by the immediate advantage restitution however is due when in our power because the laws of property are to be adhered to so far as consists with safety and because restitution which is one of those laws supposes the danger to be over but what is to be restored not the full value of the property destroyed but what it was worth at the time of destroying it which considering the danger it was in of perishing might be very little       book iii relative duties part i of relative duties which are determinate chapter   of property if you should see a flock of pigeons in a field of corn and if instead of each picking where and what it liked taking just as much as it wanted and no more you should see ninetynine of them gathering all they got into a heap reserving nothing for themselves but the chaff and the refuse keeping this heap for one and that the weakest perhaps worst pigeon of the flock sitting round and looking on all the winter whilst this one was devouring throwing about and wasting it and if a pigeon more hardy or hungry than the rest touched a grain of the hoard all the others instantly flying upon it and tearing it to pieces if you should see this you would see nothing more than what is every day practised and established among men among men you see the ninetyandnine toiling and scraping together a heap of superfluities for one and this one too oftentimes the feeblest and worst of the whole set a child a woman a madman or a fool getting nothing for themselves all the while but a little of the coarsest of the provision which their own industry produces looking quietly on while they see the fruits    of all their labour spent or spoiled and if one of the number take or touch a particle of the hoard the others joining against him and hanging him for the theft chapter   the use of the institution of property there must be some very important advantages to account for an institution which in the view of it above given is so paradoxical and unnatural the principal of these advantages are the following i it increases the produce of the earth the earth in climates like ours produces little without cultivation and none would be found willing to cultivate the ground if others were to be admitted to an equal share of the produce the same is true of the care of flocks and herds of tame animals crabs and acorns red deer rabbits game and fish are all which we should have to subsist upon in this country if we trusted to the spontaneous productions of the soil and it fares not much better with other countries a nation of northamerican savages consisting of two or three hundred will take up and be halfstarved upon a tract of land which in europe and with european management would be sufficient for the maintenance of as many thousands in some fertile soils together with great abundance of fish upon their coasts and in regions where clothes are unnecessary a considerable degree of population may subsist without property in land which is the case in the islands of otaheite but in less favoured situations as in the country of new zealand though this sort of property obtain in a small degree the inhabitants for want of a more secure and regular establishment of it are driven oftentimes by the scarcity of provision to devour one another    ii it preserves the produce of the earth to maturity we may judge what would be the effects of a community of right to the productions of the earth from the trifling specimens which we see of it at present a cherrytree in a hedgerow nuts in a wood the grass of an unstinted pasture are seldom of much advantage to any body because people do not wait for the proper season of reaping them corn if any were sown would never ripen lambs and calves would never grow up to sheep and cows because the first person that met them would reflect that he had better take them as they are than leave them for another iii it prevents contests war and waste tumult and confusion must be unavoidable and eternal where there is not enough for all and where there are no rules to adjust the division iv it improves the conveniency of living this it does two ways it enables mankind to divide themselves into distinct professions which is impossible unless a man can exchange the productions of his own art for what he wants from others and exchange implies property much of the advantage of civilised over savage life depends upon this when a man is from necessity his own tailor tentmaker carpenter cook huntsman and fisherman it is not probable that he will be expert at any of his callings hence the rude habitations furniture clothing and implements of savages and the tedious length of time which all their operations require it likewise encourages those arts by which the accommodations of human life are supplied by appropriating to the artist the benefit of his discoveries and improvements without which appropriation ingenuity will never be exerted with effect upon these several accounts we may venture with a few exceptions to pronounce that even the poorest and the worst provided in countries where property and the consequences of    property prevail are in a better situation with respect to food raiment houses and what are called the necessaries of life than any are in places where most things remain in common the balance therefore upon the whole must preponderate in favour of property with a manifest and great excess inequality of property in the degree in which it exists in most countries of europe abstractedly considered is an evil but it is an evil which flows from those rules concerning the acquisition and disposal of property by which men are incited to industry and by which the object of their industry is rendered secure and valuable if there be any great inequality unconnected with this origin it ought to be corrected chapter   the history of property the first objects of property were the fruits which a man gathered and the wild animals he caught next to these the tents or houses which he built the tools he made use of to catch or prepare his food and afterwards weapons of war and offence many of the savage tribes in north america have advanced no further than this yet for they are said to reap their harvest and return the produce of their market with foreigners into the common hoard or treasury of the tribe flocks and herds of tame animals soon became property abel the second from adam was a keeper of sheep sheep and oxen camels and asses composed the wealth of the jewish patriarchs as they do still of the modern arabs as the world was first peopled in the east where there existed a great scarcity of water wells probably were    next made property as we learn from the frequent and serious mention of them in the old testament the contentions and treaties about them and from its being recorded among the most memorable achievements of very eminent men that they dug or discovered a well land which is now so important a part of property which alone our laws call real property and regard upon all occasions with such peculiar attention was probably not made property in any country till long after the institution of many other species of property that is till the country became populous and tillage began to be thought of the first partition of an estate which we read of was that which took place between abram and lot and was one of the simplest imaginable if thou wilt take the left hand then i will go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then i will go to the left there are no traces of property in land in caesars account of britain little of it in the history of the jewish patriarchs none of it found amongst the nations of north america the scythians are expressly said to have appropriated their cattle and houses but to have left their land in common property in immoveables continued at first no longer than the occupation that is so long as a mans family continued in possession of a cave or whilst his flocks depastured upon a neighbouring hill no one attempted or thought he had a right to disturb or drive them out but when the man quitted his cave or changed his pasture the first who found them unoccupied entered upon them by the same title as his predecessors and made way in his turn for any one that happened to succeed him all more permanent property in land was probably posterior to civil government and to laws and therefore settled by these or according to the will of the reigning chief    chapter   in what the right of property is founded we now speak of property in land and there is a difficulty in explaining the origin of this property consistently with the law of nature for the land was once no doubt common and the question is how any particular part of it could justly be taken out of the common and so appropriated to the first owner as to give him a better right to it than others and what is more a right to exclude all others from it moralists have given many different accounts of this matter which diversity alone perhaps is a proof that none of them are satisfactory one tells us that mankind when they suffered a particular person to occupy a piece of ground by tacit consent relinquished their right to it and as the piece of ground they say belonged to mankind collectively and mankind thus gave up their right to the first peaceable occupier it thenceforward became his property and no one afterwards had a right to molest him in it the objection to this account is that consent can never be presumed from silence where the person whose consent is required knows nothing about the matter which must have been the case with all mankind except the neighbourhood of the place where the appropriation was made and to suppose that the piece of ground previously belonged to the neighbourhood and that they had a just power of conferring a right to it upon whom they pleased is to suppose the question resolved and a partition of land to have already taken place another says that each mans limbs and labour are his own exclusively that by occupying a piece of ground a man inseparably    mixes his labour with it by which means the piece of ground becomes thenceforward his own as you cannot take it from him without depriving him at the same time of something which is indisputably his this is mr lockes solution and seems indeed a fair reason where the value of the labour bears a considerable proportion to the value of the thing or where the thing derives its chief use and value from the labour thus game and fish though they be common whilst at large in the woods or water instantly become the property of the person that catches them because an animal when caught is much more valuable than when at liberty and this increase of value which is inseparable from and makes a great part of the whole value is strictly the property of the fowler or fisherman being the produce of his personal labour for the same reason wood or iron manufactured into utensils becomes the property of the manufacturer because the value of the workmanship far exceeds that of the materials and upon a similar principle a parcel of unappropriated ground which a man should pare burn plough harrow and sow for the production of corn would justly enough be thereby made his own but this will hardly hold in the manner it has been applied of taking a ceremonious possession of a tract of land as navigators do of newdiscovered islands by erecting a standard engraving an inscription or publishing a proclamation to the birds and beasts or of turning your cattle into a piece of ground setting up a landmark digging a ditch or planting a hedge round it nor will even the clearing manuring and ploughing of a field give the first occupier a right to it in perpetuity and after this cultivation and all effects of it are ceased another and in my opinion a better account of the first right of ownership is the following that as god has provided these things for the use of all he has of consequence given each leave to take of them what he wants by virtue therefore of this leave a man  0 may appropriate what he stands in need of to his own use without asking or waiting for the consent of others in like manner as when an entertainment is provided for the freeholders of a county each freeholder goes and eats and drinks what he wants or chooses without having or waiting for the consent of the other guests but then this reason justifies property as far as necessaries alone or at the most as far as a competent provision for our natural exigencies for in the entertainment we speak of allowing the comparison to hold in all points although every particular freeholder may sit down and eat till he be satisfied without any other leave than that of the master of the feast or any other proof of that leave than the general invitation or the manifest design with which the entertainment is provided yet you would hardly permit any one to fill his pockets or his wallet or to carry away with him a quantity of provision to be hoarded up or wasted or given to his dogs or stewed down into sauces or converted into articles of superfluous luxury especially if by so doing he pinched the guests at the lower end of the table these are the accounts that have been given of the matter by the best writers upon the subject but were these accounts perfectly unexceptionable they would none of them i fear avail us in vindicating our present claims of property in land unless it were more probable than it is that our estates were actually acquired at first in some of the ways which these accounts suppose and that a regular regard had been paid to justice in every successive transmission of them since for if one link in the chain fail every title posterior to it falls to the ground the real foundation of our right is the law of the land it is the intention of god that the produce of the earth be applied to the use of man this intention cannot be fulfilled without establishing property it is consistent therefore with his will that property be established the land cannot be divided into    separate property without leaving it to the law of the country to regulate that division it is consistent therefore with the same will that the law should regulate the division and consequently consistent with the will of god or right that i should possess that share which these regulations assign me by whatever circuitous train of reasoning you attempt to derive this right it must terminate at last in the will of god the straightest therefore and shortest way of arriving at this will is the best hence it appears that my right to an estate does not at all depend upon the manner or justice of the original acquisition nor upon the justice of each subsequent change of possession it is not for instance the less nor ought it to be impeached because the estate was taken possession of at first by a family of aboriginal britons who happened to be stronger than their neighbours nor because the british possessor was turned out by a roman or the roman by a saxon invader nor because it was seized without colour of right or reason by a follower of the norman adventurer from whom after many interruptions of fraud and violence it has at length devolved to me nor does the owners right depend upon the expediency of the law which gives it to him on one side of a brook an estate descends to the eldest son on the other side to all the children alike the right of the claimants under both laws of inheritance is equal though the expediency of such opposite rules must necessarily be different the principles we have laid down upon this subject apparently tend to a conclusion of which a bad use is apt to be made as the right of property depends upon the law of the land it seems to follow that a man has a right to keep and take every thing which the law will allow him to keep and take which in many cases will authorize the most flagitious chicanery if a creditor upon a simple contract neglect to demand his debt for six years the debtor may refuse to pay it would it be right therefore to do so where he is conscious of the justice of the debt if a person who is under twentyone years of age    contract a bargain other than for necessaries he may avoid it by pleading his minority but would this be a fair plea where the bargain was originally just the distinction to be taken in such cases is this with the law we acknowledge resides the disposal of property so long therefore as we keep within the design and intention of a law that law will justify us as well in foro conscientiae as in foro humano whatever be the equity or expediency of the law itself but when we convert to one purpose a rule or expression of law which is intended for another purpose then we plead in our justification not the intention of the law but the words that is we plead a dead letter which can signify nothing for words without meaning or intention have no force or effect in justice much less words taken contrary to the meaning and intention of the speaker or writer to apply this distinction to the examples just now proposed in order to protect men against antiquated demands from which it is not probable they should have preserved the evidence of their discharge the law prescribes a limited time to certain species of private securities beyond which it will not enforce them or lend its assistance to the recovery of the debt if a man be ignorant or dubious of the justice of the demand made upon him he may conscientiously plead this limitation because he applies the rule of law to the purpose for which it was intended but when he refuses to pay a debt of the reality of which he is conscious he cannot as before plead the intention of the statute and the supreme authority of law unless he could show that the law intended to interpose its supreme authority to acquit men of debts of the existence and justice of which they were themselves sensible again to preserve youth from the practices and impositions to which their inexperience exposes them the law compels the payment of no debts incurred within a certain age nor the performance of any engagements except for such necessaries as are suited to their condition and fortunes if a young person therefore perceive that he has been practised or imposed upon he may honestly avail himself of the privilege of his nonage to defeat the circumvention but if he shelter himself under    this privilege to avoid a fair obligation or an equitable contract he extends the privilege to a case in which it is not allowed by intention of law and in which consequently it does not in natural justice exist as property is the principal subject of justice or of the determinate relative duties we have put down what we had to say upon it in the first place we now proceed to state these duties in the best order we can chapter   promises i from whence the obligation to perform promises arises ii in what sense promises are to be interpreted iii in what cases promises are not binding i from whence the obligation to perform promises arises they who argue from innate moral principles suppose a sense of the obligation of promises to be one of them but without assuming this or any thing else without proof the obligation to perform promises may be deduced from the necessity of such a conduct to the wellbeing or the existence indeed of human society men act from expectation expectation is in most cases determined by the assurances and engagements which we receive from others if no dependence could be placed upon these assurances it would be impossible to know what judgement to form of many future events or how to regulate our conduct with respect to them confidence therefore in promises is essential to the intercourse of    human life because without it the greatest part of our conduct would proceed upon chance but there could be no confidence in promises if men were not obliged to perform them the obligation therefore to perform promises is essential to the same ends and in the same degree some may imagine that if this obligation were suspended a general caution and mutual distrust would ensue which might do as well but this is imagined without considering how every hour of our lives we trust to and depend upon others and how impossible it is to stir a step or what is worse to sit still a moment without such trust and dependence i am now writing at my ease not doubting or rather never distrusting and therefore never thinking about it that the butcher will send in the joint of meat which i ordered that his servant will bring it that my cook will dress it that my footman will serve it up and that i shall find it upon table at one oclock yet have i nothing for all this but the promise of the butcher and the implied promise of his servant and mine and the same holds of the most important as well as the most familiar occurrences of social life in the one the intervention of promises is formal and is seen and acknowledged our instance therefore is intended to show it in the other where it is not so distinctly observed ii in what sense promises are to be interpreted where the terms of promise admit of more senses than one the promise is to be performed in that sense in which the promiser apprehended at the time that the promisee received it it is not the sense in which the promiser actually intended it that always governs the interpretation of an equivocal promise because at that rate you might excite expectations which you never meant nor would be obliged to satisfy much less is it the sense in which the promisee actually received the promise for according to that rule you might be drawn into engagements which you never designed to undertake it must therefore be the    sense for there is no other remaining in which the promiser believed that the promisee accepted his promise this will not differ from the actual intention of the promiser where the promise is given without collusion or reserve but we put the rule in the above form to exclude evasion in cases in which the popular meaning of a phrase and the strict grammatical signification of the words differ or in general wherever the promiser attempts to make his escape through some ambiguity in the expressions which he used temures promised the garrison of sebastia that if they would surrender no blood should be shed the garrison surrendered and temures buried them all alive now temures fulfilled the promise in one sense and in the sense too in which he intended it at the time but not in the sense in which the garrison of sebastia actually received it nor in the sense in which temures himself knew that the garrison received it which last sense according to our rule was the sense in which he was in conscience bound to have performed it from the account we have given of the obligation of promises it is evident that this obligation depends upon the expectations which we knowingly and voluntarily excite consequently any action or conduct towards another which we are sensible excites expectations in that other is as much a promise and creates as strict an obligation as the most express assurances taking for instance a kinsmans child and educating him for a liberal profession or in a manner suitable only for the heir of a large fortune as much obliges us to place him in that profession or to leave him such a fortune as if we had given him a promise to do so under our hands and seals in like manner a great man who encourages an indigent retainer or a minister of state who distinguishes and caresses at his levee one who is in a situation to be obliged by his patronage engages by such behaviour to provide for him this is the foundation of tacit promises    you may either simply declare your present intention or you may accompany your declaration with an engagement to abide by it which constitutes a complete promise in the first case the duty is satisfied if you were sincere at the time that is if you entertained at the time the intention you expressed however soon or for whatever reason you afterwards change it in the latter case you have parted with the liberty of changing all this is plain but it must be observed that most of those forms of speech which strictly taken amount to no more than declarations of present intention do yet in the usual way of understanding them excite the expectation and therefore carry with them the force of absolute promises such as i intend you this place—i design to leave you this estate—i purpose giving you my vote—i mean to serve you in which although the intention the design the purpose the meaning be expressed in words of the present time yet you cannot afterwards recede from them without a breach of good faith if you choose therefore to make known your present intention and yet to reserve to yourself the liberty of changing it you must guard your expressions by an additional clause as i intend at present if i do not alter or the like and after all as there can be no reason for communicating your intention but to excite some degree of expectation or other a wanton change of an intention which is once disclosed always disappoints somebody and is always for that reason wrong there is in some men an infirmity with regard to promises which often betrays them into great distress from the confusion or hesitation or obscurity with which they express themselves especially when overawed or taken by surprise they sometimes encourage expectations and bring upon themselves demands which possibly they never dreamed of this is a want not so much of integrity as of presence of mind iii in what cases promises are not binding   promises are not binding where the performance is impossible    but observe that the promiser is guilty of a fraud if he be secretly aware of the impossibility at the time of making the promise for when any one promises a thing he asserts his belief at least of the possibility of performing it as no one can accept or understand a promise under any other supposition instances of this sort are the following the minister promises a place which he knows to be engaged or not at his disposal a father in settling marriagearticles promises to leave his daughter an estate which he knows to be entailed upon the heir male of his family a merchant promises a ship or share of a ship which he is privately advised is lost at sea an incumbent promises to resign a living being previously assured that his resignation will not be accepted by the bishop the promiser as in these cases with knowledge of the impossibility is justly answerable in an equivalent but otherwise not when the promiser himself occasions the impossibility it is neither more nor less than a direct breach of the promise as when a soldier maims or a servant disables himself to get rid of his engagements   promises are not binding where the performance is unlawful there are two cases of this one where the unlawfulness is known to the parties at the time of making the promise as where an assassin promises his employer to despatch his rival or his enemy a servant to betray his master a pimp to procure a mistress or a friend to give his assistance in a scheme of seduction the parties in these cases are not obliged to perform what the promise requires because they were under a prior obligation to the contrary from which prior obligation what is there to discharge them their promise—their own act and deed but an obligation from which a man can discharge himself by his own act is no obligation at all the guilt therefore of such promises lies in the making not in the breaking of them and if in the interval betwixt the promise and the performance    a man so far recover his reflection as to repent of his engagements he ought certainly to break through them the other case is where the unlawfulness did not exist or was not known at the time of making the promise as where a merchant promises his correspondent abroad to send him a shipload of corn at a time appointed and before the time arrive an embargo is laid upon the exportation of corn—a woman gives a promise of marriage before the marriage she discovers that her intended husband is too nearly related to her or that he has a wife yet living in all such cases where the contrary does not appear it must be presumed that the parties supposed what they promised to be lawful and that the promise proceeded entirely upon this supposition the lawfulness therefore becomes a condition of the promise which condition failing the obligation ceases of the same nature was herods promise to his daughterinlaw that he would give her whatever she asked even to the half of his kingdom the promise was not unlawful in the terms in which herod delivered it and when it became so by the daughters choice by her demanding john the baptists head herod was discharged from the obligation of it for the reason now laid down as well as for that given in the last paragraph this rule that promises are void where the performance is unlawful extends also to imperfect obligations for the reason of the rule holds of all obligations thus if you promise a man a place or your vote and he afterwards render himself unfit to receive either you are absolved from the obligation of your promise or if a better candidate appear and it be a case in which you are bound by oath or otherwise to govern yourself by the qualification the promise must be broken through and here i would recommend to young persons especially a caution from the neglect of which many involve themselves in embarrassment and disgrace and that is never to give a promise    which may interfere in the event with their duty for if it do so interfere their duty must be discharged though at the expense of their promise and not unusually of their good name the specific performance of promises is reckoned a perfect obligation and many casuists have laid down in opposition to what has been here asserted that where a perfect and an imperfect obligation clash the perfect obligation is to be preferred for which opinion however there seems to be no reason but what arises from the terms perfect and imperfect the impropriety of which has been remarked above the truth is of two contradictory obligations that ought to prevail which is prior in point of time it is the performance being unlawful and not unlawfulness in the subject or motive of the promise which destroys its validity therefore a bribe after the vote is given the wages of prostitution the reward of any crime after the crime is committed ought if promised to be paid for the sin and mischief by this supposition are over and will be neither more nor less for the performance of the promise in like manner a promise does not lose its obligation merely because it proceeded from an unlawful motive a certain person in the lifetime of his wife who was then sick had paid his addresses and promised marriage to another woman the wife died and the woman demanded performance of the promise the man who it seems had changed his mind either felt or pretended doubts concerning the obligation of such a promise and referred his case to bishop sanderson the most eminent in this kind of knowledge of his time bishop sanderson after writing a dissertation upon the question adjudged the promise to be void in which however upon our principles he was wrong for however criminal the affection might be which induced the promise the performance when it was demanded was lawful which is the only lawfulness required a promise cannot be deemed unlawful where it produces when performed no effect beyond what would have taken place had the  0 promise never been made and this is the single case in which the obligation of a promise will justify a conduct which unless it had been promised would be unjust a captive may lawfully recover his liberty by a promise of neutrality for his conqueror takes nothing by the promise which he might not have secured by his death or confinement and neutrality would be innocent in him although criminal in another it is manifest however that promises which come into the place of coercion can extend no further than to passive compliances for coercion itself could compel no more upon the same principle promises of secrecy ought not to be violated although the public would derive advantage from the discovery such promises contain no unlawfulness in them to destroy their obligation for as the information would not have been imparted upon any other condition the public lose nothing by the promise which they would have gained without it   promises are not binding where they contradict a former promise because the performance is then unlawful which resolves this case into the last   promises are not binding before acceptance that is before notice given to the promisee for where the promise is beneficial if notice be given acceptance may be presumed until the promise be communicated to the promisee it is the same only as a resolution in the mind of the promiser which may be altered at pleasure for no expectation has been excited therefore none can be disappointed but suppose i declare my intention to a third person who without any authority from me conveys my declaration to the promisee is that such a notice as will be binding upon me it certainly is not for i have not done that which constitutes the essence of a promise—i have not voluntarily excited expectation   promises are not binding which are released by the promisee this is evident but it may be sometimes doubted who the promisee is if i give a promise to a of a place or vote for b as to    a father for his son to an uncle for his nephew to a friend of mine for a relation or friend of his then a is the promisee whose consent i must obtain to be released from the engagement if i promise a place or vote to b by a that is if a be a messenger to convey the promise as if i should say you may tell b that he shall have this place or may depend upon my vote or if a be employed to introduce bs request and i answer in any terms which amount to a compliance with it then b is the promisee promises to one person for the benefit of another are not released by the death of the promisee for his death neither makes the performance impracticable nor implies any consent to release the promiser from it   erroneous promises are not binding in certain cases as   where the error proceeds from the mistake or misrepresentation of the promisee because a promise evidently supposes the truth of the account which the promisee relates in order to obtain it a beggar solicits your charity by a story of the most pitiable distress you promise to relieve him if he will call again in the interval you discover his story to be made up of lies this discovery no doubt releases you from your promise one who wants your service describes the business or office for which he would engage you you promise to undertake it when you come to enter upon it you find the profits less the labour more or some material circumstance different from the account he gave you in such case you are not bound by your promise   when the promise is understood by the promisee to proceed upon a certain supposition or when the promiser apprehended it to be so understood and that supposition turns out to be false then the promise is not binding this intricate rule will be best explained by an example a father receives an account from abroad of the death of his only son soon after which he promises his fortune to his nephew the account turns out to be false the father we say is released from    his promise not merely because he never would have made it had he known the truth of the case for that alone will not do but because the nephew also himself understood the promise to proceed upon the supposition of his cousins death or at least his uncle thought he so understood it and could not think otherwise the promise proceeded upon this supposition in the promisers own apprehension and as he believed in the apprehension of both parties and this belief of his is the precise circumstance which sets him free the foundation of the rule is plainly this a man is bound only to satisfy the expectation which he intended to excite whatever condition therefore he intended to subject that expectation to becomes an essential condition of the promise errors which come not within this description do not annul the obligation of a promise i promise a candidate my vote presently another candidate appears for whom i certainly would have reserved it had i been acquainted with his design here therefore as before my promise proceeded from an error and i never should have given such a promise had i been aware of the truth of the case as it has turned out but the promisee did not know this he did not receive the promise subject to any such condition or as proceeding from any such supposition nor did i at the time imagine he so received it this error therefore of mine must fall upon my own head and the promise be observed notwithstanding a father promises a certain fortune with his daughter supposing himself to be worth so much—his circumstances turn out upon examination worse than he was aware of here again the promise was erroneous but for the reason assigned in the last case will nevertheless be obligatory the case of erroneous promises is attended with some difficulty for to allow every mistake or change of circumstances to dissolve the obligation of a promise would be to allow a latitude which might evacuate the force of almost all promises and on    the other hand to gird the obligation so tight as to make no allowances for manifest and fundamental errors would in many instances be productive of great hardship and absurdity it has long been controverted amongst moralists whether promises be binding which are extorted by violence or fear the obligation of all promises results we have seen from the necessity or the use of that confidence which mankind repose in them the question therefore whether these promises are binding will depend upon this whether mankind upon the whole are benefited by the confidence placed on such promises a highwayman attacks you—and being disappointed of his booty threatens or prepares to murder you you promise with many solemn asseverations that if he will spare your life he shall find a purse of money left for him at a place appointed upon the faith of this promise he forbears from further violence now your life was saved by the confidence reposed in a promise extorted by fear and the lives of many others may be saved by the same this is a good consequence on the other hand confidence in promises like these greatly facilitates the perpetration of robberies they may be made the instruments of almost unlimited extortion this is a bad consequence and in the question between the importance of these opposite consequences resides the doubt concerning the obligations of such promises there are other cases which are plainer as where a magistrate confines a disturber of the public peace in gaol till he promise to behave better or a prisoner of war promises if set at liberty to return within a certain time these promises say moralists are binding because the violence or duress is just but the truth is    because there is the same use of confidence in these promises as of confidence in the promises of a person at perfect liberty vows are promises to god the obligation cannot be made out upon the same principle as that of other promises the violation of them nevertheless implies a want of reverence to the supreme being which is enough to make it sinful there appears no command or encouragement in the christian scriptures to make vows much less any authority to break through them when they are made the few instances of vows which we read of in the new testament were religiously observed the rules we have laid down concerning promises are applicable to vows thus jephthas vow taken in the sense in which that transaction is commonly understood was not binding because the performance in that contingency became unlawful chapter   contracts a contract is a mutual promise the obligation therefore of contracts the sense in which they are to be interpreted and the cases where they are not binding will be the same as of promises from the principle established in the last chapter that the obligation of promises is to be measured by the expectation which the promiser any how voluntarily and knowingly excites results a rule which governs the construction of all contracts and is capable from its simplicity of being applied with great ease and certainty viz that    whatever is expected by one side and known to be so expected by the other is to be deemed a part or condition of the contract the several kinds of contracts and the order in which we propose to consider them may be exhibited at one view thus  chapter   contracts of sale the rule of justice which wants with most anxiety to be inculcated in the making of bargains is that the seller is bound in conscience to disclose the faults of what he offers to sale amongst other methods of proving this one may be the following i suppose it will be allowed that to advance a direct falsehood in recommendation of our wares by ascribing to them some quality which we know that they have not is dishonest now compare with this the designed concealment of some fault which we know that they have the motives and the effects of actions are the only points of comparison in which their moral quality can differ but the motive in these two cases is the same viz to procure a higher price than we expect otherwise to obtain the effect that is the prejudice to the buyer is also the same for he finds himself equally out of pocket by his bargain whether the commodity when he gets home with it turn out worse than he had supposed by the want of    some quality which he expected or the discovery of some fault which he did not expect if therefore actions be the same as to all moral purposes which proceed from the same motives and produce the same effects it is making a distinction without a difference to esteem it a cheat to magnify beyond the truth the virtues of what we have to sell but none to conceal its faults it adds to the value of this kind of honesty that the faults of many things are of a nature not to be known by any but by the persons who have used them so that the buyer has no security from imposition but in the ingenuousness and integrity of the seller there is one exception however to this rule namely where the silence of the seller implies some fault in the thing to be sold and where the buyer has a compensation in the price for the risk which he runs as where a horse in a london repository is sold by public auction without warranty the want of warranty is notice of some unsoundness and produces a proportionable abatement in the price to this of concealing the faults of what we want to put off may be referred the practice of passing bad money this practice we sometimes hear defended by a vulgar excuse that we have taken the money for good and must therefore get rid of it which excuse is much the same as if one who had been robbed upon the highway should allege that he had a right to reimburse himself out of the pocket of the first traveller he met the justice of which reasoning the traveller possibly may not comprehend where there exists no monopoly or combination the marketprice is always a fair price because it will always be proportionable to the use and scarcity of the article hence there need be no scruple about demanding or taking the marketprice and all those expressions provisions are extravagantly dear corn bears an unreasonable price and the like import no unfairness or unreasonableness in the seller    if your tailor or your draper charge or even ask of you more for a suit of clothes than the marketprice you complain that you are imposed upon you pronounce the tradesman who makes such a charge dishonest although as the mans goods were his own and he had a right to prescribe the terms upon which he would consent to part with them it may be questioned what dishonesty there can be in the case or wherein the imposition consists whoever opens a shop or in any manner exposes goods to public sale virtually engages to deal with his customers at a marketprice because it is upon the faith and opinion of such an engagement that any one comes within his shopdoors or offers to treat with him this is expected by the buyer is known to be so expected by the seller which is enough according to the rule delivered above to make it a part of the contract between them though not a syllable be said about it the breach of this implied contract constitutes the fraud inquired after hence if you disclaim any such engagement you may set what value you please upon your property if upon being asked to sell a house you answer that the house suits your fancy or conveniency and that you will not turn yourself out of it under such a price the price fixed may be double of what the house cost or would fetch at a public sale without any imputation of injustice or extortion upon you if the thing sold be damaged or perish between the sale and the delivery ought the buyer to bear the loss or the seller this will depend upon the particular construction of the contract if the seller either expressly or by implication or by custom engage to deliver the goods as if i buy a set of china and the chinaman ask me to what place he shall bring or send them and they be broken in the conveyance the seller must abide by the loss if the thing sold remain with the seller at the instance or for the conveniency of the buyer then the buyer undertakes the risk as if i buy a horse and mention that i will send for it on such a day which is in effect desiring that it may continue with the seller till i do send for it    then whatever misfortune befalls the horse in the mean time must be at my cost and here once for all i would observe that innumerable questions of this sort are determined solely by custom not that custom possesses any proper authority to alter or ascertain the nature of right and wrong but because the contracting parties are presumed to include in their stipulation all the conditions which custom has annexed to contracts of the same sort and when the usage is notorious and no exception made to it this presumption is generally agreeable to the fact if i order a pipe of port from a winemerchant abroad at what period the property passes from the merchant to me whether upon delivery of the wine at the merchants warehouse upon its being put on shipboard at oporto upon the arrival of the ship in england at its destined port or not till the wine be committed to my servants or deposited in my cellar are all questions which admit of no decision but what custom points out whence in justice as well as law what is called the custom of merchants regulates the construction of mercantile concerns chapter   contracts of hazard by contracts of hazard i mean gaming and insurance what some say of this kind of contracts that one side ought not to have any advantage over the other is neither practicable    nor true it is not practicable for that perfect equality of skill and judgement which this rule requires is seldom to be met with i might not have it in my power to play with fairness a game at cards billiards or tennis lay a wager at a horserace or underwrite a policy of insurance once in a twelvemonth if i must wait till i meet with a person whose art skill and judgement in these matters is neither greater nor less than my own nor is this equality requisite to the justice of the contract one party may give to the other the whole of the stake if he please and the other party may justly accept it if it be given him much more therefore may one give to the other a part of the stake or what is exactly the same thing an advantage in the chance of winning the whole the proper restriction is that neither side have an advantage by means of which the other is not aware for this is an advantage taken without being given although the event be still an uncertainty your advantage in the chance has a certain value and so much of the stake as that value amounts to is taken from your adversary without his knowledge and therefore without his consent if i sit down to a game at whist and have an advantage over the adversary by means of a better memory closer attention or a superior knowledge of the rules and chances of the game the advantage is fair because it is obtained by means of which the adversary is aware for he is aware when he sits down with me that i shall exert the skill that i possess to the utmost but if i gain an advantage by packing the cards glancing my eye into the adversaries hands or by concerted signals with my partner it is a dishonest advantage because it depends upon means which the adversary never suspects that i make use of the same distinction holds of all contracts into which chance enters if i lay a wager at a horserace founded upon the conjecture i form from the appearance and character and breed of the horses i am justly entitled to any advantage which my judgment gives me but if i carry on a clandestine correspondence with the jockeys and find out from them that a trial has been actually made or that it is  0 settled beforehand which horse shall win the race all such information is so much fraud because derived from sources which the other did not suspect when he proposed or accepted the wager in speculations in trade or in the stocks if i exercise my judgement upon the general aspect and prospect of public affairs and deal with a person who conducts himself by the same sort of judgement the contract has all the equality in it which is necessary but if i have access to secrets of state at home or private advice of some decisive measure or event abroad i cannot avail myself of these advantages with justice because they are excluded by the contract which proceeded upon the supposition that i had no such advantage in insurances in which the underwriter computes his risk entirely from the account given by the person insured it is absolutely necessary to the justice and validity of the contract that this account be exact and complete chapter   contracts of lending of inconsumable property when the identical loan is to be returned as a book a horse a harpsichord it is called inconsumable in opposition to corn wine money and those things which perish or are parted with in the use and can therefore only be restored in kind the questions under this head are few and simple the first is if the thing lent be lost or damaged who ought to bear the loss or damage if it be damaged by the use or by accident in the use for which it was lent the lender ought to bear it as if i hire a jobcoach the wear tear and soiling of the coach must belong to the lender or a    horse to go a particular journey and in going the proposed journey the horse die or be lamed the loss must be the lenders on the contrary if the damage be occasioned by the fault of the borrower or by accident in some use for which it was not lent then the borrower must make it good as if the coach be overturned or broken to pieces by the carelessness of your coachman or the horse be hired to take a mornings ride upon and you go a hunting with him or leap him over hedges or put him into your cart or carriage and he be strained or staked or galled or accidentally hurt or drop down dead whilst you are thus using him you must make satisfaction to the owner the two cases are distinguished by this circumstance that in one case the owner foresees the damage or risk and therefore consents to undertake it in the other case he does not it is possible that an estate or a house may during the term of a lease be so increased or diminished in its value as to become worth much more or much less than the rent agreed to be paid for it in some of which cases it may be doubted to whom of natural right the advantage or disadvantage belongs the rule of justice seems to be this if the alteration might be expected by the parties the hirer must take the consequence if it could not the owner an orchard or a vineyard or a mine or a fishery or a decoy may this yield nothing or next to nothing yet the tenant shall pay his rent and if they next year produce tenfold the usual profit no more shall be demanded because the produce is in its nature precarious and this variation might be expected if an estate in the fens of lincolnshire or the isle of ely be overflowed with water so as to be incapable of occupation the tenant notwithstanding is bound by his lease because he entered into it with a knowledge and foresight of the danger on the other hand if by the irruption of the sea into a country where it was never known to have come before by the change of the course of a river the fall of a rock the breaking out of a volcano the bursting of a moss the incursions of an enemy or    by a mortal contagion amongst the cattle if by means like these an estate change or lose its value the loss shall fall upon the owner that is the tenant shall either be discharged from his agreement or be entitled to an abatement of rent a house in london by the building of a bridge the opening of a new road or street may become of ten times its former value and by contrary causes may be as much reduced in value here also as before the owner not the hirer shall be affected by the alteration the reason upon which our determination proceeds is this that changes such as these being neither foreseen nor provided for by the contracting parties form no part or condition of the contract and therefore ought to have the same effect as if no contract at all had been made for none was made with respect to them that is ought to fall upon the owner chapter  0 contracts concerning the lending of money there exists no reason in the law of nature why a man should not be paid for the lending of his money as well as of any other property into which the money might be converted the scruples that have been entertained upon this head and upon the foundation of which the receiving of interest or usury for they formerly meant the same thing was once prohibited in almost all christian countries arose from a passage in the law of    moses deuteronomy xxiii     0 thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother usury of money usury of victuals usury of any thing that is lent upon usury unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury this prohibition is now generally understood to have been intended for the jews alone as part of the civil or political law of that nation and calculated to preserve amongst themselves that distribution of property to which many of their institutions were subservient as the marriage of an heiress within her own tribe of a widow who was left childless to her husbands brother the year of jubilee when alienated estates reverted to the family of the original proprietor—regulations which were never thought to be binding upon any but the commonwealth of israel this interpretation is confirmed i think beyond all controversy by the distinction made in the law between a jew and a foreigner unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury but unto thy brother thou mayest not lend upon usury a distinction which could hardly have been admitted into a law which the divine author intended to be of moral and of universal obligation the rate of interest has in most countries been regulated by law the roman law allowed of twelve pounds per cent which justinian reduced at one stroke to four pounds a statute of the thirteenth year of queen elizabeth which was the first that tolerated the receiving of interest in england at all restrained it to ten pounds per cent a statute of james the first to eight pounds of charles the second to six pounds of queen anne to five pounds on pain of forfeiture of treble the value of the money lent at which rate and penalty the matter now stands the policy of these regulations is to check the power of accumulating wealth without industry to give encouragement to trade by enabling adventurers in it to borrow money at a moderate price and of late years to enable the state to borrow the subjects money itself    compound interest though forbidden by the law of england is agreeable enough to natural equity for interest detained after it is due becomes to all intents and purposes part of the sum lent it is a question which sometimes occurs how money borrowed in one country ought to be paid in another where the relative value of the precious metals is not the same for example suppose i borrow a hundred guineas in london where each guinea is worth oneandtwenty shillings and meet my creditor in the east indies where a guinea is worth no more perhaps than nineteen is it a satisfaction of the debt to return a hundred guineas or must i make up so many times oneandtwenty shillings i should think the latter for it must be presumed that my creditor had he not lent me his guineas would have disposed of them in such a manner as to have now had in the place of them so many oneandtwenty shillings and the question supposes that he neither intended nor ought to be a sufferer by parting with the possession of his money to me when the relative value of coin is altered by an act of the state if the alteration would have extended to the identical pieces which were lent it is enough to return an equal number of pieces of the same denomination or their present value in any other as if guineas were reduced by act of parliament to twenty shillings so many twenty shillings as i borrowed guineas would be a just repayment it would be otherwise if the reduction was owing to a debasement of the coin for then respect ought to be had to the comparative value of the old guinea and the new whoever borrows money is bound in conscience to repay it this every man can see but every man cannot see or does not however reflect that he is in consequence also bound to use the means necessary to enable himself to repay it if he pay the money when he has it or has it to spare he does all that an honest man can do and all he imagines that is required of him whilst the previous measures which are necessary to furnish him with that money    he makes no part of his care nor observes to be as much his duty as the other such as selling a familyseat or a family estate contracting his plan of expense laying down his equipage reducing the number of his servants or any of those humiliating sacrifices which justice requires of a man in debt the moment he perceives that he has no reasonable prospect of paying his debts without them an expectation which depends upon the continuance of his own life will not satisfy an honest man if a better provision be in his power for it is a breach of faith to subject a creditor when we can help it to the risk of our life be the event what it will that not being the security to which credit was given i know few subjects which have been more misunderstood than the law which authorises the imprisonment of insolvent debtors it has been represented as a gratuitous cruelty which contributed nothing to the reparation of the creditors loss or to the advantage of the community this prejudice arises principally from considering the sending of a debtor to gaol as an act of private satisfaction to the creditor instead of a public punishment as an act of satisfaction or revenge it is always wrong in the motive and often intemperate and undistinguishing in the exercise consider it as a public punishment founded upon the same reason and subject to the same rules as other punishments and the justice of it together with the degree to which it should be extended and the objects upon whom it may be inflicted will be apparent there are frauds relating to insolvency against which it is as necessary to provide punishment as for any public crimes whatever as where a man gets your money into his possession and forthwith runs away with it or what is little better squanders it in vicious expenses or stakes it at the gamingtable in the alley or upon wild adventures in trade or is conscious at the time he borrows it that he can never repay it or wilfully puts it out of his power by profuse living or conceals his effects or transfers them by collusion to another not    to mention the obstinacy of some debtors who had rather rot in a gaol than deliver up their estates for to say the truth the first absurdity is in the law itself which leaves it in a debtors power to withhold any part of his property from the claim of his creditors the only question is whether the punishment be properly placed in the hands of an exasperated creditor for which it may be said that these frauds are so subtile and versatile that nothing but a discretionary power can overtake them and that no discretion is likely to be so well informed so vigilant or so active as that of the creditor it must be remembered however that the confinement of a debtor in gaol is a punishment and that every punishment supposes a crime to pursue therefore with the extremity of legal rigour a sufferer whom the fraud or failure of others his own want of capacity or the disappointments and miscarriages to which all human affairs are subject have reduced to ruin merely because we are provoked by our loss and seek to relieve the pain we feel by that which we inflict is repugnant not only to humanity but to justice for it is to pervert a provision of law designed for a different and a salutary purpose to the gratification of private spleen and resentment any alteration in these laws which could distinguish the degrees of guilt or convert the service of the insolvent debtor to some public profit might be an improvement but any considerable mitigation of their rigour under colour of relieving the poor would increase their hardships for whatever deprives the creditor of his power of coercion deprives him of his security and as this must add greatly to the difficulty of obtaining credit the poor especially the lower sort of tradesmen are the first who would suffer by such a regulation as tradesmen must buy before they sell you would exclude from trade two thirds of those who now carry it on if none were enabled to enter into it without a capital sufficient for prompt payments an advocate therefore for the interests of this    important class of the community will deem it more eligible that one out of a thousand should be sent to gaol by his creditors than that the nine hundred and ninetynine should be straitened and embarrassed and many of them lie idle by the want of credit chapter    contracts of labour service service in this country is as it ought to be voluntary and by contract and the masters authority extends no further than the terms or equitable construction of the contract will justify the treatment of servants as to diet discipline and accommodation the kind and quantity of work to be required of them the intermission liberty and indulgence to be allowed them must be determined in a great measure by custom for where the contract involves so many particulars the contracting parties express a few perhaps of the principal and by mutual understanding refer the rest to the known custom of the country in like cases a servant is not bound to obey the unlawful commands of his master to minister for instance to his unlawful pleasures or to assist him by unlawful practices in his profession as in smuggling or adulterating the articles in which he deals for the servant is bound by nothing but his own promise and the obligation of a promise extends not to things unlawful for the same reason the masters authority is no justification of the servant in doing wrong for the servants own promise upon which that authority is founded would be none clerks and apprentices ought to be employed entirely in the profession or trade which they are intended to learn instruction is    their hire and to deprive them of the opportunities of instruction by taking up their time with occupations foreign to their business is to defraud them of their wages the master is responsible for what a servant does in the ordinary course of his employment for it is done under a general authority committed to him which is in justice equivalent to a specific direction thus if i pay money to a bankers clerk the banker is accountable but not if i had paid it to his butler or his footman whose business it is not to receive money upon the same principle if i once send a servant to take up goods upon credit whatever goods he afterwards takes up at the same shop so long as he continues in my service are justly chargeable to my account the law of this country goes great lengths in intending a kind of concurrence in the master so as to charge him with the consequences of his servants conduct if an innkeepers servant rob his guests the innkeeper must make restitution if a farriers servant lame a horse the farrier must answer for the damage and still further if your coachman or carter drive over a passenger in the road the passenger may recover from you a satisfaction for the hurt he suffers but these determinations stand i think rather upon the authority of the law than any principle of natural justice    there is a carelessness and facility in giving characters as it is called of servants especially when given in writing or according to some established form which to speak plainly of it is a cheat upon those who accept them they are given with so little reserve and veracity that i should as soon depend says the author of the rambler upon an acquittal at the old bailey by way of recommendation of a servants honesty as upon one of these characters it is sometimes carelessness and sometimes also to get rid of a bad servant without the uneasiness of a dispute for which nothing can be pleaded but the most ungenerous of all excuses that the person whom we deceive is a stranger there is a conduct the reverse of this but more injurious because the injury falls where there is no remedy i mean the obstructing of a servants advancement because you are unwilling to spare his service to stand in the way of your servants interest is a poor return for his fidelity and affords slender encouragement for good behaviour in this numerous and therefore important part of the community it is a piece of injustice which if practised towards an equal the law of honour would lay hold of as it is it is neither uncommon nor disreputable a master of a family is culpable if he permit any vices among his domestics which he might restrain by due discipline and a proper interference this results from the general obligation to prevent misery when in our power and the assurance which we have that vice and misery at the long run go together care to maintain in his family a sense of virtue and religion received the divine approbation in the person of abraham gen xviii    i know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgement and indeed no authority seems so well adapted to this purpose as that of masters of families because none operates upon the subjects of it with an influence so immediate and constant what the christian scriptures have delivered concerning the relation and reciprocal duties of masters and servants breathes a spirit of liberality very little known in ages when servitude was slavery and which flowed from a habit of contemplating mankind under the common relation in which they stand to their creator and with respect to their interest in another existence servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto  00 christ not with eyeservice as menpleasers but as the servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart with good will doing service as to the lord and not to men knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of the lord whether he be bond or free and ye masters do the same thing unto them forbearing threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven neither is there respect of persons with him the idea of referring their service to god of considering him as having appointed them their task that they were doing his will and were to look to him for their reward was new and affords a greater security to the master than any inferior principle because it tends to produce a steady and cordial obedience in the place of that constrained service which can never be trusted out of sight and which is justly enough called eyeservice the exhortation to masters to keep in view their own subjection and accountableness was no less seasonable chapter    contracts of labour commissions whoever undertakes another mans business makes it his own that is promises to employ upon it the same care attention and diligence that he would do if it were actually his own for he knows that the business was committed to him with that expectation and he promises nothing more than this therefore an agent is not obliged to wait inquire solicit ride about the country toil or study whilst there remains a possibility of benefiting his employer if he exert so much of his activity and use such caution as the value  0  of the business in his judgement deserves that is as he would have thought sufficient if the same interest of his own had been at stake he has discharged his duty although it should afterwards turn out that by more activity and longer perseverance he might have concluded the business with greater advantage this rule defines the duty of factors stewards attorneys and advocates one of the chief difficulties of an agents situation is to know how far he may depart from his instructions when from some change or discovery in the circumstances of his commission he sees reason to believe that his employer if he were present would alter his intention the latitude allowed to agents in this respect will be different according as the commission was confidential or ministerial and according as the general rule and nature of the service require a prompt and precise obedience to orders or not an attorney sent to treat for an estate if he found out a flaw in the title would desist from proposing the price he was directed to propose and very properly on the other hand if the commanderinchief of an army detach an officer under him upon a particular service which service turns out more difficult or less expedient than was supposed insomuch that the officer is convinced that his commander if he were acquainted with the true state in which the affair is found would recall his orders yet must this officer if he cannot wait for fresh directions without prejudice to the expedition he is sent upon pursue at all hazards those which he brought out with him what is trusted to an agent may be lost or damaged in his hands by misfortune an agent who acts without pay is clearly not answerable for the loss for if he give his labour for nothing it cannot be presumed that he gave also security for the success of it if the agent be hired to the business the question will depend upon  0  the apprehension of the parties at the time of making the contract which apprehension of theirs must be collected chiefly from custom by which probably it was guided whether a public carrier ought to account for goods sent by him the owner or master of a ship for the cargo the postoffice for letters or bills enclosed in letters where the loss is not imputed to any fault or neglect of theirs are questions of this sort any expression which by implication amounts to a promise will be binding upon the agent without custom as where the proprietors of a stagecoach advertise that they will not be accountable for money plate or jewels this makes them accountable for every thing else or where the price is too much for the labour part of it may be considered as a premium for insurance on the other hand any caution on the part of the owner to guard against danger is evidence that he considers the risk to be his as cutting a bankbill in two to send by the post at different times universally unless a promise either express or tacit can be proved against the agent the loss must fall upon the owner the agent may be a sufferer in his own person or property by the business which he undertakes as where one goes a journey for another and lames his horse or is hurt himself by a fall upon the road can the agent in such a case claim a compensation for the misfortune unless the same be provided for by express stipulation the agent is not entitled to any compensation from his employer on that account for where the danger is not foreseen there can be no reason to believe that the employer engaged to indemnify the agent against it still less where it is foreseen for whoever knowingly undertakes a dangerous employment in common construction takes upon himself the danger and the consequences as where a fireman undertakes for a reward to rescue a box of writings from the flames or a sailor to bring off a passenger from a ship in a storm  0  chapter    contracts of labour partnership i know nothing upon the subject of partnership that requires explanation but in what manner the profits are to be divided where one partner contributes money and the other labour which is a common case rule from the stock of the partnership deduct the sum advanced and divide the remainder between the moneyed partner and the labouring partner in the proportion of the interest of the money to the wages of the labourer allowing such a rate of interest as money might be borrowed for upon the same security and such wages as a journeyman would require for the same labour and trust example a advances a thousand pounds but knows nothing of the business b produces no money but has been brought up to the business and undertakes to conduct it at the end of the year the stock and the effects of the partnership amount to twelve hundred pounds consequently there are two hundred pounds to be divided now nobody would lend money upon the event of the business succeeding which is as security under six per cent therefore a must be allowed sixty pounds for the interest of his money b before he engaged in the partnership earned thirty pounds a year in the same employment his labour therefore ought to be valued at thirty pounds and the two hundred pounds must be divided between the parties in the proportion of sixty to thirty that is a must receive one hundred and thirtythree pounds six shillings and eight pence and b sixtysix pounds thirteen shillings and four pence if there be nothing gained a loses his interest and b his labour which is right if the original stock be diminished by this  0  rule b loses only his labour as before whereas a loses his interest and part of the principal for which eventual disadvantage a is compensated by having the interest of his money computed at six per cent in the division of the profits when there are any it is true that the division of the profit is seldom forgotten in the constitution of the partnership and is therefore commonly settled by express agreements but these agreements to be equitable should pursue the principle of the rule here laid down all the partners are bound to what any one of them does in the course of the business for quoad hoc each partner is considered as an authorised agent for the rest chapter    contracts of labour offices  0  in many offices as schools fellowships of colleges professorships of the universities and the like there is a twofold contract one with the founder the other with the electors the contract with the founder obliges the incumbent of the office to discharge every duty appointed by the charter statutes deed of gift or will of the founder because the endowment was given and consequently accepted for that purpose and upon those conditions the contract with the electors extends this obligation to all duties that have been customarily connected with and reckoned a part of the office though not prescribed by the founder for the electors expect from the person they choose all the duties which his predecessors have discharged and as the person elected cannot be ignorant of their expectation if he meant to have refused this condition he ought to have apprised them of his objection and here let it be observed that the electors can excuse the conscience of the person elected from this last class of duties alone because this class results from a contract to which the electors and the person elected are the only parties the other class of duties results from a different contract it is a question of some magnitude and difficulty what offices may be conscientiously supplied by a deputy we will state the several objections to the substitution of a deputy and then it will be understood that a deputy may be allowed in all cases to which these objections do not apply an office may not be discharged by deputy   where a particular confidence is reposed in the judgement and conduct of the person appointed to it as the office of a steward guardian judge commanderinchief by land or sea   where the custom hinders as in the case of schoolmasters tutors and of commissions in the army or navy   where the duty cannot from its nature be so well performed by a deputy as the deputygovernor of a province may not possess the legal authority or the actual influence of his principal   when some inconveniency would result to the service in general from the permission of deputies in such cases for example it is probable that military merit would be much discouraged if the duties belonging to commissions in the army were generally allowed to be executed by substitutes the nonresidence of the parochial clergy who supply the duty of their benefices by curates is worthy of a more distinct consideration and in order to draw the question upon this case to a point we will suppose the officiating curate to discharge every duty which his principal were he present would be bound to discharge and in a manner equally beneficial to the parish under which circumstances the only objection to the absence of the principal at least the only one of the foregoing objections is the last  0  and in my judgement the force of this objection will be much diminished if the absent rector or vicar be in the mean time engaged in any function or employment of equal or of greater importance to the general interest of religion for the whole revenue of the national church may properly enough be considered as a common fund for the support of the national religion and if a clergyman be serving the cause of christianity and protestantism it can make little difference out of what particular portion of this fund that is by the tithes and glebe of what particular parish his service be requited any more than it can prejudice the kings service that an officer who has signalised his merit in america should be rewarded with the government of a fort or castle in ireland which he never saw but for the custody of which proper provision is made and care taken upon the principle thus explained this indulgence is due to none more than to those who are occupied in cultivating or communicating religious knowledge or the sciences subsidiary to religion this way of considering the revenues of the church as a common fund for the same purpose is the more equitable as the value of particular preferments bears no proportion to the particular charge or labour but when a man draws upon this fund whose studies and employments bear no relation to the object of it and who is no further a minister of the christian religion than as a cockade makes a soldier it seems a misapplication little better than a robbery and to those who have the management of such matters i submit this question whether the impoverishment of the fund by converting the best share of it into annuities for the gay and illiterate youth of great families threatens not to starve and stifle the little clerical merit that is left amongst us all legal dispensations from residence proceed upon the supposition that the absentee is detained from his living by some  0  engagement of equal or of greater public importance therefore if in a case where no such reason can with truth be pleaded it be said that this question regards a right of property and that all right of property awaits the disposition of law that therefore if the law which gives a man the emoluments of a living excuse him from residing upon it he is excused in conscience we answer that the law does not excuse him by intention and that all other excuses are fraudulent chapter    lies a lie is a breach of promise for whoever seriously addresses his discourse to another tacitly promises to speak the truth because he knows that the truth is expected or the obligation of veracity may be made out from the direct ill consequences of lying to social happiness which consequences consist either in some specific injury to particular individuals or in the destruction of that confidence which is essential to the intercourse of human life for which latter reason a lie may be pernicious in its general tendency and therefore criminal though it produce no particular or visible mischief to any one there are falsehoods which are not lies that is which are not criminal as   where no one is deceived which is the case in parables fables novels jests tales to create mirth ludicrous embellishments of a story where the declared design of the speaker is not to inform but to divert compliments in the subscription of a letter a servants denying his master a prisoners pleading not guilty an advocate asserting the justice or his belief of the justice of his clients cause in such instances no confidence is destroyed because none  0  was reposed no promise to speak the truth is violated because none was given or understood to be given   where the person to whom you speak has no right to know the truth or more properly where little or no inconveniency results from the want of confidence in such cases as where you tell a falsehood to a madman for his own advantage to a robber to conceal your property to an assassin to defeat or divert him from his purpose the particular consequence is by the supposition beneficial and as to the general consequence the worst that can happen is that the madman the robber the assassin will not trust you again which beside that the first is incapable of deducing regular conclusions from having been once deceived and the last two not likely to come a second time in your way is sufficiently compensated by the immediate benefit which you propose by the falsehood it is upon this principle that by the laws of war it is allowed to deceive an enemy by feints false colours spies false intelligence and the like but by no means in treaties truces signals of capitulation or surrender and the difference is that the former suppose hostilities to continue the latter are calculated to terminate or suspend them in the conduct of war and whilst the war continues there is no use or rather no place for confidence betwixt the contending parties but in whatever relates to the termination of war the most religious fidelity is expected because without it wars could not cease nor the victors be secure but by the entire destruction of the vanquished many people indulge in serious discourse a habit of fiction and exaggeration in the accounts they give of themselves of their acquaintance or of the extraordinary things which they have seen  0  or heard and so long as the facts they relate are indifferent and their narratives though false are inoffensive it may seem a superstitious regard to truth to censure them merely for truths sake in the first place it is almost impossible to pronounce beforehand with certainty concerning any lie that it is inoffensive volat irrevocabile and collects sometimes accretions in its flight which entirely change its nature it may owe possibly its mischief to the officiousness or misrepresentation of those who circulate it but the mischief is nevertheless in some degree chargeable upon the original editor in the next place this liberty in conversation defeats its own end much of the pleasure and all the benefit of conversation depends upon our opinion of the speakers veracity for which this rule leaves no foundation the faith indeed of a hearer must be extremely perplexed who considers the speaker or believes that the speaker considers himself as under no obligation to adhere to truth but according to the particular importance of what he relates but beside and above both these reasons white lies always introduce others of a darker complexion i have seldom known any one who deserted truth in trifles that could be trusted in matters of importance nice distinctions are out of the question upon occasions which like those of speech return every hour the habit therefore of lying when once formed is easily extended to serve the designs of malice or interest—like all habits it spreads indeed of itself pious frauds as they are improperly enough called pretended inspirations forged books counterfeit miracles are impositions of a more serious nature it is possible that they may sometimes though seldom have been set up and encouraged with a design to do good but the good they aim at requires that the belief of them should be perpetual which is hardly possible and the detection of the fraud is sure to disparage the credit of all pretensions of the same nature christianity has suffered more injury from this cause than from all other causes put together   0 as there may be falsehoods which are not lies so there may be lies without literal or direct falsehood an opening is always left for this species of prevarication when the literal and grammatical signification of a sentence is different from the popular and customary meaning it is the wilful deceit that makes the lie and we wilfully deceive when our expressions are not true in the sense in which we believe the hearer to apprehend them besides that it is absurd to contend for any sense of words in opposition to usage for all senses of all words are founded upon usage and upon nothing else or a man may act a lie as by pointing his finger in a wrong direction when a traveller inquires of him his road or when a tradesman shuts up his windows to induce his creditors to believe that he is abroad for to all moral purposes and therefore as to veracity speech and action are the same speech being only a mode of action or lastly there may be lies of omission a writer of english history who in his account of the reign of charles the first should wilfully suppress any evidence of that princes despotic measures and designs might be said to lie for by entitling his book a history of england he engages to relate the whole truth of the history or at least all that he knows of it chapter    oaths   i forms of oaths   ii signification   iii lawfulness   iv obligation   v what oaths do not bind   vi in what sense oaths are to be interpreted     i the forms of oaths like other religious ceremonies have in all ages been various consisting however for the most part of some bodily action and of a prescribed form of words amongst the jews the juror held up his right hand towards heaven which explains a passage in the    th psalm whose mouth speaketh vanity and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood the same form is retained in scotland still amongst the same jews an oath of fidelity was taken by the servants putting his hand under the thigh of his lord as eliezer did to abraham gen xxiv   from whence with no great variation is derived perhaps the form of doing homage at this day by putting the hands between the knees and within the hands of the liege amongst the greeks and romans the form varied with the subject and occasion of the oath in private contracts the parties took hold of each others hand whilst they swore to the performance or they touched the altar of the god by whose divinity they swore upon more solemn occasions it was the custom to slay a victim and the beast being struck down with certain ceremonies and invocations gave birth to the expressions temnein orkon ferire pactum and to our english phrase translated from these of striking a bargain the forms of oaths in christian countries are also very different but in no country in the world i believe worse contrived either to convey the meaning or impress the obligation of an oath than in our own the juror with us after repeating the promise or affirmation which the oath is intended to confirm adds so help me god or more frequently the substance of the oath is repeated to the juror by the officer or magistrate who administers it adding     in the conclusion so help you god the energy of the sentence resides in the particle so so that is hâc lege upon condition of my speaking the truth or performing this promise and not otherwise may god help me the juror whilst he hears or repeats the words of the oath holds his right hand upon a bible or other book containing the four gospels the conclusion of the oath sometimes runs ita me deus adjuvet et haec sancta evangelia or so help me god and the contents of this book which last clause forms a connexion between the words and action of the juror that before was wanting the juror then kisses the book the kiss however seems rather an act of reverence to the contents of the book as in the popish ritual the priest kisses the gospel before he reads it than any part of the oath this obscure and elliptical form together with the levity and frequency with which it is administered has brought about a general inadvertency to the obligation of oaths which both in a religious and political view is much to be lamented and it merits public consideration whether the requiring of oaths on so many frivolous occasions especially in the customs and in the qualification for petty offices has any other effect than to make them cheap in the minds of the people a pound of tea cannot travel regularly from the ship to the consumer without costing half a dozen oaths at the least and the same security for the due discharge of their office namely that of an oath is required from a churchwarden and an archbishop from a petty constable and the chief justice of england let the law continue its own sanctions if they be thought requisite but let it spare the solemnity of an oath and where from the want of something better to depend upon it is necessary to accept mens own word or own account let it annex to prevarication penalties proportioned to the public mischief of the offence ii but whatever be the form of an oath the signification is the same it is the calling upon god to witness ie to take notice of     what we say and it is invoking his vengeance or renouncing his favour if what we say be false or what we promise be not performed iii quakers and moravians refuse to swear upon any occasion founding their scruples concerning the lawfulness of oaths upon our saviours prohibition matt v    i say unto you swear not at all the answer which we give to this objection cannot be understood without first stating the whole passage ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths but i say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is gods throne nor by the earth for it is his footstool neither by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or black but let your communication be yea yea nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil to reconcile with this passage of scripture the practice of swearing or of taking oaths when required by law the following observations must be attended to   it does not appear that swearing by heaven by the earth by jerusalem or by their own head was a form of swearing ever made use of amongst the jews in judicial oaths and consequently it is not probable that they were judicial oaths which christ had in his mind when he mentioned those instances   as to the seeming universality of the prohibition swear not at all the emphatic clause not at all is to be read in connexion with what follows not at all he neither by the heaven nor by the earth nor by jerusalem nor by thy head not at all does not mean upon no occasion but by none of these forms our saviours argument seems to suppose that the people to whom he spake made a distinction between swearing directly by the name of god and swearing by those inferior objects of veneration the     heavens the earth jerusalem or their own head in opposition to which distinction he tells them that on account of the relation which these things bore to the supreme being to swear by any of them was in effect and substance to swear by him by heaven for it is his throne by the earth for it is his footstool by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king by thy head for it is his workmanship not thine—thou canst not make one hair white or black for which reason he says swear not at all that is neither directly by god nor indirectly by any thing related to him this interpretation is greatly confirmed by a passage in the twentythird chapter of the same gospel where a similar distinction made by the scribes and pharisees is replied to in the same manner   our saviour himself being adjured by the living god to declare whether he was the christ the son of god or not condescended to answer the highpriest without making any objection to the oath for such it was upon which he examined him god is my witness says st paul to the romans that without ceasing i make mention of you in my prayers and to the corinthians still more strongly i call god for a record upon my soul that to spare you i came not as yet to corinth both these expressions contain the nature of oaths the epistle to the hebrews speaks of the custom of swearing judicially without any mark of censure or disapprobation men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife upon the strength of these reasons we explain our saviours words to relate not to judicial oaths but to the practice of vain wanton and unauthorised swearing in common discourse saint jamess words chap v    are not so strong as our saviours and therefore admit the same explanation with more ease iv oaths are nugatory that is carry with them no proper force or obligation unless we believe that god will punish false swearing     with more severity than a simple lie or breach of promise for which belief there are the following reasons   perjury is a sin of greater deliberation the juror has the thought of god and of religion upon his mind at the time at least there are very few who can shake them off entirely he offends therefore if he do offend with a high hand in the face that is and in defiance of the sanctions of religion his offence implies a disbelief or contempt of gods knowledge power and justice which cannot be said of a lie where there is nothing to carry the mind to any reflection upon the deity or the divine attributes at all   perjury violates a superior confidence mankind must trust to one another and they have nothing better to trust to than one anothers oath hence legal adjudications which govern and affect every right and interest on this side of the grave of necessity proceed and depend upon oaths perjury therefore in its general consequence strikes at the security of reputation property and even of life itself a lie cannot do the same mischief because the same credit is not given to it   god directed the israelites to swear by his name† and was pleased in order to show the immutability of his own counsel‡ to confirm his covenant with that people by an oath neither of which it is probable he would have done had he not intended to represent oaths as having some meaning and effect beyond the obligation of a bare promise which effect must be owing to the severer punishment with which he will vindicate the authority of oaths     v promissory oaths are not binding where the promise itself would not be so for the several cases of which see the chapter of promises vi as oaths are designed for the security of the imposer it is manifest that they must be interpreted and performed in the sense in which the imposer intends them otherwise they afford no security to him and this is the meaning and reason of the rule jurare in animum imponentis which rule the reader is desired to carry along with him whilst we proceed to consider certain particular oaths which are either of greater importance or more likely to fall in our way than others chapter    oath in evidence the witness swears to speak the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth touching the matter in question upon which it may be observed that the designed concealment of any truth which relates to the matter in agitation is as much a violation of the oath as to testify a positive falsehood and this whether the witness be interrogated as to that particular point or not for when the person to be examined is sworn upon a voir dire that is in order to inquire whether he ought to be admitted to give evidence in the cause at all the form runs thus you shall true answer make to all such questions as shall be asked you but when he comes to be sworn in chief he swears to speak the whole truth without restraining it as before to the questions that shall be asked which difference shows that the law intends in this latter case to require of the witness that he give a complete and unreserved account of what he knows of the subject of the trial whether the questions proposed to him reach the extent of his knowledge or not so that if it     be inquired of the witness afterwards why he did not inform the court so and so it is not a sufficient though a very common answer to say because it was never asked me i know but one exception to this rule which is when a full discovery of the truth tends to accuse the witness himself of some legal crime the law of england constrains no man to become his own accuser consequently imposes the oath of testimony with this tacit reservation but the exception must be confined to legal crimes a point of honour of delicacy or of reputation may make a witness backward to disclose some circumstance with which he is acquainted but will in no wise justify his concealment of the truth unless it could be shown that the law which imposes the oath intended to allow this indulgence to such motives the exception of which we are speaking is also withdrawn by a compact between the magistrate and the witness when an accomplice is admitted to give evidence against the partners of his crime tenderness to the prisoner although a specious apology for concealment is no just excuse for if this plea be thought sufficient it takes the administration of penal justice out of the hands of judges and juries and makes it depend upon the temper of prosecutors and witnesses questions may be asked which are irrelative to the cause which affect the witness himself or some third person in which and in all cases where the witness doubts of the pertinency and propriety of the question he ought to refer his doubts to the court the answer of the court in relaxation of the oath is authority enough to the witness for the law which imposes the oath may remit what it will of the obligation and it belongs to the court to declare what the mind of the law is nevertheless it cannot be said universally that the answer of the court is conclusive upon the conscience of the witness for his obligation depends upon what he apprehended at the time of taking the oath to be the design of the     law in imposing it and no afterrequisition or explanation by the court can carry the obligation beyond that chapter    oath of allegiance i do sincerely promise and swear that i will be faithful and bear true allegiance to his majesty king george formerly the oath of allegiance ran thus i do promise to be true and faithful to the king and his heirs and truth and faith to bear of life and limb and terrene honour and not to know or hear of any ill or damage intended him without defending him therefrom and was altered at the revolution to the present form so that the present oath is a relaxation of the old one and as the oath was intended to ascertain not so much the extent of the subjects obedience as the person to whom it was due the legislature seems to have wrapped up its meaning upon the former point in a word purposely made choice of for its general and indeterminate signification it will be most convenient to consider first what the oath excludes as inconsistent with it secondly what it permits   the oath excludes all intention to support the claim or pretensions of any other person or persons to the crown and government than the reigning sovereign a jacobite who is persuaded of the pretenders right to the crown and who moreover designs to join with the adherents to that cause to assert this right whenever a proper opportunity with a reasonable prospect of success presents itself cannot take the oath of allegiance or if he could the oath of abjuration follows which contains an express renunciation of all opinions in favour of the claim of the exiled family   the oath excludes all design at the time of attempting to depose the reigning prince for any reason whatever let the     justice of the revolution be what it would no honest man could have taken even the present oath of allegiance to james the second who entertained at the time of taking it a design of joining in the measures which were entered into to dethrone him   the oath forbids the taking up of arms against the reigning prince with views of private advancement or from motives of personal resentment or dislike it is possible to happen in this what frequently happens in despotic governments that an ambitious general at the head of the military force of the nation might by a conjuncture of fortunate circumstances and a great ascendency over the minds of the soldiery depose the prince upon the throne and make way to it for himself or for some creature of his own a person in this situation would be withholden from such an attempt by the oath of allegiance if he paid regard to it if there were any who engaged in the rebellion of the year fortyfive with the expectation of titles estates or preferment or because they were disappointed and thought themselves neglected and illused at court or because they entertained a family animosity or personal resentment against the king the favourite or the minister—if any were induced to take up arms by these motives they added to the many crimes of an unprovoked rebellion that of wilful and corrupt perjury if in the late american war the same motives determined others to connect themselves with that opposition their part in it was chargeable with perfidy and falsehood to their oath whatever was the justice of the opposition itself or however wellfounded their own complaints might be of private injury we are next to consider what the oath of allegiance permits or does not require   it permits resistance to the king when his ill behaviour or imbecility is such as to make resistance beneficial to the community it may fairly be presumed that the convention parliament which introduced the oath in its present form did not   0 intend by imposing it to exclude all resistance since the members of that legislature had many of them recently taken up arms against james the second and the very authority by which they sat together was itself the effect of a successful opposition to an acknowledged sovereign some resistance therefore was meant to be allowed and if any it must be that which has the public interest for its object   the oath does not require obedience to such commands of the king as are unauthorised by law no such obedience is implied by the terms of the oath the fidelity there promised is intended of fidelity in opposition to his enemies and not in opposition to law and allegiance at the utmost can only signify obedience to lawful commands therefore if the king should issue a proclamation levying money or imposing any service or restraint upon the subject beyond what the crown is empowered by law to enjoin there would exist no sort of obligation to obey such a proclamation in consequence of having taken the oath of allegiance   the oath does not require that we should continue our allegiance to the king after he is actually and absolutely deposed driven into exile carried away captive or otherwise rendered incapable of exercising the regal office whether by his fault or without it the promise of allegiance implies and is understood by all parties to suppose that the person to whom the promise is made continues king continues that is to exercise the power and afford the protection which belongs to the office of king for it is the possession of this power which makes such a particular person the object of the oath without it why should i swear allegiance to this man rather than to any man in the kingdom beside which the contrary doctrine is burthened with this consequence that every conquest revolution of government or disaster which befalls the person of the prince must be followed by perpetual and irremediable anarchy     chapter    oath against bribery in the election of members of parliament i do swear i have not received or had by myself or any person whatsoever in trust for me or for my use and benefit directly or indirectly any sum or sums of money office place or employment gift or reward or any promise or security for any money office employment or gift in order to give my vote at this election the several contrivances to evade this oath such as the electors accepting money under colour of borrowing it and giving a promissory note or other security for it which is cancelled after the election receiving money from a stranger or a person in disguise or out of a drawer or purse left open for the purpose or promises of money to be paid after the election or stipulating for a place living or other private advantage of any kind if they escape the legal penalties of perjury incur the moral guilt for they are manifestly within the mischief and design of the statute which imposes the oath and within the terms indeed of the oath itself for the word indirectly is inserted on purpose to comprehend such cases as these chapter  0 oath against simony from an imaginary resemblance between the purchase of a benefice and simon maguss attempt to purchase the gift of the holy ghost acts viii    the obtaining of ecclesiastical preferment by pecuniary considerations has been termed simony the sale of advowsons is inseparable from the allowance of private patronage as patronage would otherwise devolve to the most     indigent and for that reason the most improper hands it could be placed in nor did the law ever intend to prohibit the passing of advowsons from one patron to another but to restrain the patron who possesses the right of presenting at the vacancy from being influenced in the choice of his presentee by a bribe or benefit to himself it is the same distinction with that which obtains in a freeholders vote for his representative in parliament the right of voting that is the freehold to which the right pertains may be bought and sold as freely as any other property but the exercise of that right the vote itself may not be purchased or influenced by money for this purpose the law imposes upon the presentee who is generally concerned in the simony if there be any the following oath i do swear that i have made no simoniacal payment contract or promise directly or indirectly by myself or by any other to my knowledge or with my consent to any person or persons whatsoever for or concerning the procuring and obtaining of this ecclesiastical place c nor will at any time hereafter perform or satisfy any such kind of payment contract or promise made by any other without my knowledge or consent so help me god through jesus christ it is extraordinary that bishop gibson should have thought this oath to be against all promises whatsoever when the terms of the oath expressly restrain it to simoniacal promises and the law alone must pronounce what promises as well as what payments and contracts are simoniacal and consequently come within the oath and what do not so now the law adjudges to be simony   all payments contracts or promises made by any person for a benefice already vacant the advowson of a void turn by law cannot be transferred from one patron to another therefore if the void turn be procured by money it must be by a pecuniary     influence upon the then subsisting patron in the choice of his presentee which is the very practice the law condemns   a clergymans purchasing of the next turn of a benefice for himself directly or indirectly that is by himself or by another person with his money it does not appear that the law prohibits a clergyman from purchasing the perpetuity of a patronage more than any other person but purchasing the perpetuity and forthwith selling it again with a reservation of the next turn and with no other design than to possess himself of the next turn is in fraudem legis and inconsistent with the oath   the procuring of a piece of preferment by ceding to the patron any rights or probable rights belonging to it this is simony of the worst kind for it is not only buying preferment but robbing the succession to pay for it   promises to the patron of a portion of the profit of a remission of tithes and dues or other advantage out of the produce of the benefice which kind of compact is a pernicious condescension in the clergy independent of the oath for it tends to introduce a practice which may very soon become general of giving the revenue of churches to the lay patrons and supplying the duty by indigent stipendiaries   general bonds of resignation that is bonds to resign upon demand i doubt not but that the oath against simony is binding upon the consciences of those who take it though i question much the expediency of requiring it it is very fit to debar public patrons such as the king the lord chancellor bishops ecclesiastical corporations and the like from this kind of traffic because from them may be expected some regard to the qualifications of the persons whom they promote but the oath lays a snare for the integrity of the clergy and i do not perceive that the requiring of it in cases of private patronage produces any good effect sufficient to compensate for this danger     where advowsons are holden along with manors or other principal estates it would be an easy regulation to forbid that they should ever hereafter be separated and would at least keep church preferment out of the hands of brokers chapter    oaths to observe local statutes members of colleges in the universities and of other ancient foundations are required to swear to the observance of their respective statutes which observance is become in some cases unlawful in others impracticable in others useless in others inconvenient unlawful directions are countermanded by the authority which made them unlawful impracticable directions are dispensed with by the necessity of the case the only question is how far the members of these societies may take upon themselves to judge of the inconveniency of any particular direction and make that a reason for laying aside the observation of it the animus imponentis which is the measure of the jurors duty seems to be satisfied when nothing is omitted but what from some change in the circumstances under which it was prescribed it may fairly be presumed that the founder himself would have dispensed with to bring a case within this rule the inconveniency must—   be manifest concerning which there is no doubt   it must arise from some change in the circumstances of the institution for let the inconveniency be what it will if it existed at the time of the foundation it must be presumed that the founder did not deem the avoiding of it of sufficient importance to alter his plan       the direction of the statute must not only be inconvenient in the general for so may the institution itself be but prejudicial to the particular end proposed by the institution for it is this last circumstance which proves that the founder would have dispensed with it in pursuance of his own purpose the statutes of some colleges forbid the speaking of any language but latin within the walls of the college direct that a certain number and not fewer than that number be allowed the use of an apartment amongst them that so many hours of each day be employed in public exercises lectures or disputations and some other articles of discipline adapted to the tender years of the students who in former times resorted to universities were colleges to retain such rules nobody nowadays would come near them they are laid aside therefore though parts of the statutes and as such included within the oath not merely because they are inconvenient but because there is sufficient reason to believe that the founders themselves would have dispensed with them as subversive of their own designs chapter    subscription to articles of religion subscription to articles of religion though no more than a declaration of the subscribers assent may properly enough be considered in connexion with the subject of oaths because it is governed by the same rule of interpretation which rule is the animus imponentis the inquiry therefore concerning subscription will be quis imposuit et quo animo the bishop who receives the subscription is not the imposer any more than the crier of a court who administers the oath to the     jury and witnesses is the person that imposes it nor consequently is the private opinion or interpretation of the bishop of any signification to the subscriber one way or other the compilers of the thirtynine articles are not to be considered as the imposers of subscription any more than the framer or drawer up of a law is the person that enacts it the legislature of the   th eliz is the imposer whose intention the subscriber is bound to satisfy they who contend that nothing less can justify subscription to the thirtynine articles than the actual belief of each and every separate proposition contained in them must suppose that the legislature expected the consent of ten thousand men and that in perpetual succession not to one controverted proposition but to many hundreds it is difficult to conceive how this could be expected by any who observed the incurable diversity of human opinion upon all subjects short of demonstration if the authors of the law did not intend this what did they intend they intended to exclude from offices in the church   all abettors of popery   anabaptists who were at that time a powerful party on the continent   the puritans who were hostile to an episcopal constitution and in general the members of such leading sects or foreign establishments as threatened to overthrow our own whoever finds himself comprehended within these descriptions ought not to subscribe nor can a subscriber to the articles take advantage of any latitude which our rule may seem to allow who is not first convinced that he is truly and substantially satisfying the intention of the legislature during the present state of ecclesiastical patronage in which private individuals are permitted to impose teachers upon parishes     with which they are often little or not at all connected some limitation of the patrons choice may be necessary to prevent unedifying contentions between neighbouring teachers or between the teachers and their respective congregations but this danger if it exist may be provided against with equal effect by converting the articles of faith into articles of peace chapter    wills the fundamental question upon this subject is whether wills are of natural or of adventitious right that is whether the right of directing the disposition of property after his death belongs to a man in a state of nature and by the law of nature or whether it be given him entirely by the positive regulations of the country he lives in the immediate produce of each mans personal labour as the tools weapons and utensils which he manufactures the tent or hut that he builds and perhaps the flocks and herds which he breeds and rears are as much his own as the labour was which he employed upon them that is are his property naturally and absolutely and consequently he may give or leave them to whom he pleases there being nothing to limit the continuance of his right or to restrain the alienation of it but every other species of property especially property in land stands upon a different foundation we have seen in the chapter upon property that in a state of nature a mans right to a particular spot of ground arises from his using it and his wanting it consequently ceases with the use and want so that at his death the estate reverts to the community without any regard to the last owners will or even any preference of his     family further than as they become the first occupiers after him and succeed to the same want and use moreover as natural rights cannot like rights created by act of parliament expire at the end of a certain number of years if the testator have a right by the law of nature to dispose of his property one moment after his death he has the same right to direct the disposition of it for a million of ages after him which is absurd the ancient apprehensions of mankind upon the subject were conformable to this account of it for wills have been introduced into most countries by a positive act of the state as by the laws of solon into greece by the twelve tables into rome and that not till after a considerable progress had been made in legislation and in the oeconomy of civil life tacitus relates that amongst the germans they were disallowed and what is more remarkable in this country since the conquest lands could not be devised by will till within little more than two hundred years ago when this privilege was restored to the subject by an act of parliament in the latter end of the reign of henry the eighth no doubt many beneficial purposes are attained by extending the owners power over his property beyond his life and beyond his natural right it invites to industry it encourages marriage it secures the dutifulness and dependency of children but a limit must be assigned to the duration of this power the utmost extent to which in any case entails are allowed by the laws of england to operate is during the lives in existence at the death of the testator and oneandtwenty years beyond these after which there are ways and means of setting them aside from the consideration that wills are the creatures of the municipal law which gives them their efficacy may be deduced a determination of the question whether the intention of the testator in an informal will be binding upon the conscience of those who by operation of law succeed to his estate by an informal will i mean a     will void in law for want of some requisite formality though no doubt be entertained of its meaning or authenticity as suppose a man make his will devising his freehold estate to his sisters son and the will be attested by two only instead of three subscribing witnesses would the brothers son who is heir at law to the testator be bound in conscience to resign his claim to the estate out of deference to his uncles intention or on the contrary would not the devisee under the will be bound upon discovery of this flaw in it to surrender the estate suppose he had gained possession of it to the heir at law generally speaking the heir at law is not bound by the intention of the testator for the intention can signify nothing unless the person intending have a right to govern the descent of the estate that is the first question now this right the testator can only derive from the law of the land but the law confers the right upon certain conditions with which conditions he has not complied therefore the testator can lay no claim to the power which he pretends to exercise as he hath not entitled himself to the benefit of that law by virtue of which alone the estate ought to attend his disposal consequently the devisee under the will who by concealing this flaw in it keeps possession of the estate is in the situation of any other person who avails himself of his neighbours ignorance to detain from him his property the will is so much waste paper from the defect of right in the person who made it nor is this catching at an expression of law to pervert the substantial design of it for i apprehend it to be the deliberate mind of the legislature that no will should take effect upon real estates unless authenticated in the precise manner which the statute describes had testamentary dispositions been founded in any natural right independent of positive constitutions i should have thought differently of this question for then i should have considered the law rather as refusing its assistance to enforce the right of the devisee than as extinguishing or working any alteration in the right itself   0 and after all i should choose to propose a case where no consideration of pity to distress of duty to a parent or of gratitude to a benefactor interfered with the general rule of justice the regard due to kindred in the disposal of our fortune except the case of lineal kindred which is different arises either from the respect we owe to the presumed intention of the ancestor from whom we received our fortunes or from the expectations which we have encouraged the intention of the ancestor is presumed with greater certainty as well as entitled to more respect the fewer degrees he is removed from us which makes the difference in the different degrees of kindred for instance it may be presumed to be a fathers intention and desire that the inheritance which he leaves after it has served the turn and generation of one son should remain a provision for the families of his other children equally related and dear to him as the oldest whoever therefore without cause gives away his patrimony from his brothers or sisters family is guilty not so much of an injury to them as of ingratitude to his parent the deference due from the possessor of a fortune to the presumed desire of his ancestor will also vary with this circumstance whether the ancestor earned the fortune by his personal industry acquired it by accidental successes or only transmitted the inheritance which he received where a mans fortune is acquired by himself and he has done nothing to excite expectation but rather has refrained from those particular attentions which tend to cherish expectation he is perfectly disengaged from the force of the above reasons and at liberty to leave his fortune to his friends to charitable or public purposes or to whom he will the same blood proximity of blood and the like are merely modes of speech implying nothing real nor any obligation of themselves there is always however a reason for providing for our poor relations in preference to others who may be equally necessitous     which is that if we do not no one else will mankind by an established consent leaving the reduced branches of good families to the bounty of their wealthy alliances the not making a will is a very culpable omission where it is attended with the following effects where it leaves daughters or younger children at the mercy of the oldest son where it distributes a personal fortune equally amongst the children although there be no equality in their exigencies or situations where it leaves an opening for litigation or lastly and principally where it defrauds creditors for by a defect in our laws which has been long and strangely overlooked real estates are not subject to the payment of debts by simple contract unless made so by will although credit is in fact generally given to the possession of such estates he therefore who neglects to make the necessary appointments for the payment of his debts as far as his effects extend sins as it has been justly said in his grave and if he omits this on purpose to defeat the demands of his creditors he dies with a deliberate fraud in his heart anciently when any one died without a will the bishop of the diocese took possession of his personal fortune in order to dispose of it for the benefit of his soul that is to pious or charitable uses it became necessary therefore that the bishop should be satisfied of the authenticity of the will when there was any before he resigned the right which he had to take possession of the dead mans fortune in case of intestacy in this way wills and controversies relating to wills came within the cognisance of ecclesiastical courts under the jurisdiction of which wills of personals the only wills that were made formerly still continue though in truth no more nowadays connected with religion than any other instruments of conveyance this is a peculiarity in the english laws succession to intestates must be regulated by positive rules of law there being no principle of natural justice whereby to ascertain     the proportion of the different claimants not to mention that the claim itself especially of collateral kindred seems to have little foundation in the law of nature these regulations should be guided by the duty and presumed inclination of the deceased so far as these considerations can be consulted by general rules the statutes of charles the second commonly called the statutes of distribution which adopt the rule of the roman law in the distribution of personals are sufficiently equitable they assign onethird to the widow and twothirds to the children in case of no children one half to the widow and the other half to the next of kin where neither widow nor lineal descendants survive the whole to the next of kin and to be equally divided amongst kindred of equal degree without distinction of whole blood and half blood or of consanguinity by the fathers or mothers side the descent of real estates of houses that is and land having been settled in more remote and in ruder times is less reasonable there never can be much to complain of in a rule which every person may avoid by so easy a provision as that of making his will otherwise our law in this respect is chargeable with some flagrant absurdities such as that an estate shall in no wise go to the brother or sister of the half blood though it came to the deceased from the common parent that it shall go to the remotest relation the intestate has in the world rather than to his own father or mother or even be forfeited for want of an heir though both parents survive that the most distant paternal relation shall be preferred to an uncle or own cousin by the mothers side notwithstanding the estate was purchased and acquired by the intestate himself land not being so divisible as money may be a reason for making a difference in the course of inheritance but there ought to be no difference but what is founded upon that reason the roman law made none     part ii of relative duties which are indeterminate chapter   charity i use the term charity neither in the common sense of bounty to the poor nor in st pauls sense of benevolence to all mankind but i apply it at present in a sense more commodious to my purpose to signify the promoting the happiness of our inferiors charity in this sense i take to be the principal province of virtue and religion for whilst worldly prudence will direct our behaviour towards our superiors and politeness towards our equals there is little beside the consideration of duty or an habitual humanity which comes into the place of consideration to produce a proper conduct towards those who are beneath us and dependant upon us there are three principal methods of promoting the happiness of our inferiors   by the treatment of our domestics and dependants   by professional assistance   by pecuniary bounty     chapter   charity the treatment of our domestics and dependants a party of friends setting out together upon a journey soon find it to be the best for all sides that while they are upon the road one of the company should wait upon the rest another ride forward to seek out lodging and entertainment a third carry the portmanteau a fourth take charge of the horses a fifth bear the purse conduct and direct the route not forgetting however that as they were equal and independent when they set out so they are all to return to a level again at their journeys end the same regard and respect the same forbearance lenity and reserve in using their service the same mildness in delivering commands the same study to make their journey comfortable and pleasant which he whose lot it was to direct the rest would in common decency think himself bound to observe towards them ought we to show to those who in the casting of the parts of human society happen to be placed within our power or to depend upon us another reflection of a like tendency with the former is that our obligation to them is much greater than theirs to us it is a mistake to suppose that the rich man maintains his servants tradesmen tenants and labourers the truth is they maintain him it is their industry which supplies his table furnishes his wardrobe builds his houses adorns his equipage provides his amusements it is not the estate but the labour employed upon it that pays his rent all that he does is to distribute what others produce which is the least part of the business nor do i perceive any foundation for an opinion which is often handed round in genteel company that good usage is thrown away upon low and ordinary minds that they are insensible of kindness     and incapable of gratitude if by low and ordinary minds are meant the minds of men in low and ordinary stations they seem to be affected by benefits in the same way that all others are and to be no less ready to requite them and it would be a very unaccountable law of nature if it were otherwise whatever uneasiness we occasion to our domestics which neither promotes our service nor answers the just ends of punishment is manifestly wrong were it only upon the general principle of diminishing the sum of human happiness by which rule we are forbidden   to enjoin unnecessary labour or confinement from the mere love and wantonness of domination   to insult our servants by harsh scornful or opprobrious language   to refuse them any harmless pleasures and by the same principle are also forbidden causeless or immoderate anger habitual peevishness and groundless suspicion chapter   slavery the prohibitions of the last chapter extend to the treatment of slaves being founded upon a principle independent of the contract between masters and servants i define slavery to be an obligation to labour for the benefit of the master without the contract or consent of the servant this obligation may arise consistently with the law of nature from three causes   from crimes   from captivity   from debt     in the first case the continuance of the slavery as of any other punishment ought to be proportioned to the crime in the second and third cases it ought to cease as soon as the demand of the injured nation or private creditor is satisfied the slavetrade upon the coast of africa is not excused by these principles when slaves in that country are brought to market no questions i believe are asked about the origin or justice of the vendors title it may be presumed therefore that this title is not always if it be ever founded in any of the causes above assigned but defect of right in the first purchase is the least crime with which this traffic is chargeable the natives are excited to war and mutual depredation for the sake of supplying their contracts or furnishing the market with slaves with this the wickedness begins the slaves torn away from parents wives children from their friends and companions their fields and flocks their home and country are transported to the european settlements in america with no other accommodation on shipboard than what is provided for brutes this is the second stage of cruelty from which the miserable exiles are delivered only to be placed and that for life in subjection to a dominion and system of laws the most merciless and tyrannical that ever were tolerated upon the face of the earth and from all that can be learned by the accounts of the people upon the spot the inordinate authority which the plantationlaws confer upon the slaveholder is exercised by the english slaveholder especially with rigour and brutality but necessity is pretended the name under which every enormity is attempted to be justified and after all what is the necessity it has never been proved that the land could not be cultivated there as it is here by hired servants it is said that it could not be cultivated with quite the same conveniency and cheapness as by the labour of slaves by which means a pound of sugar which     the planter now sells for sixpence could not be afforded under sixpencehalfpenny—and this is the necessity the great revolution which has taken place in the western world may probably conduce and who knows but that it was designed to accelerate the fall of this abominable tyranny and now that this contest and the passions which attend it are no more there may succeed perhaps a season for reflecting whether a legislature which had so long lent its assistance to the support of an institution replete with human misery was fit to be trusted with an empire the most extensive that ever obtained in any age or quarter of the world slavery was a part of the civil constitution of most countries when christianity appeared yet no passage is to be found in the christian scriptures by which it is condemned or prohibited this is true for christianity soliciting admission into all nations of the world abstained as behoved it from intermeddling with the civil institutions of any but does it follow from the silence of scripture concerning them that all the civil institutions which then prevailed were right or that the bad should not be exchanged for better besides this the discharging of slaves from all obligation to obey their masters which is the consequence of pronouncing slavery to be unlawful would have had no better effect than to let loose one half of mankind upon the other slaves would have been tempted to embrace a religion which asserted their right to freedom masters would hardly have been persuaded to consent to claims founded upon such authority the most calamitous of all contests a bellum servile might probably have ensued to the reproach if not the extinction of the christian name the truth is the emancipation of slaves should be gradual and be carried on by provisions of law and under the protection of civil government christianity can only operate as an alterative by the mild diffusion of its light and influence the minds of men are insensibly prepared to perceive and correct the enormities which     folly or wickedness or accident have introduced into their public establishments in this way the greek and roman slavery and since these the feudal tyranny has declined before it and we trust that as the knowledge and authority of the same religion advance in the world they will banish what remains of this odious institution chapter   charity professional assistance this kind of beneficence is chiefly to be expected from members of the legislature magistrates medical legal and sacerdotal professions   the care of the poor ought to be the principal object of all laws for this plain reason that the rich are able to take care of themselves much has been and more might be done by the laws of this country towards the relief of the impotent and the protection and encouragement of the industrious poor whoever applies himself to collect observations upon the state and operation of the poorlaws and to contrive remedies for the imperfections and abuses which he observes and digests these remedies into acts of parliament and conducts them by argument or influence through the two branches of the legislature or communicates his ideas to those who are more likely to carry them into effect deserves well of a class of the community so numerous that their happiness forms a principal part of the whole the study and activity thus employed is charity in the most meritorious sense of the word   the application of parochial relief is intrusted in the first instance to overseers and contractors who have an interest in opposition to that of the poor inasmuch as whatever they allow them     comes in part out of their own pocket for this reason the law has deposited with justices of the peace a power of superintendence and control and the judicious interposition of this power is a most useful exertion of charity and ofttimes within the ability of those who have no other way of serving their generation a country gentleman of very moderate education and who has little to spare from his fortune by learning so much of the poorlaw as is to be found in dr burns justice and by furnishing himself with a knowledge of the prices of labour and provision so as to be able to estimate the exigencies of a family and what is to be expected from their industry may in this way place out the one talent committed to him to great account   of all private professions that of medicine puts it in a mans power to do the most good at the least expense health which is precious to all is to the poor invaluable and their complaints as agues rheumatisms c are often such as yield to medicine and with respect to the expense drugs at first hand cost little and advice costs nothing where it is only bestowed upon those who could not afford to pay for it   the rights of the poor are not so important or intricate as their contentions are violent and ruinous a lawyer or attorney of tolerable knowledge in his profession has commonly judgement enough to adjust these disputes with all the effect and without the expense of a lawsuit and he may be said to give a poor man twenty pounds who prevents his throwing it away upon law a legal man whether of the profession or not who together with a spirit of conciliation possesses the confidence of his neighbourhood will be much resorted to for this purpose especially since the great increase of costs has produced a general dread of going to law nor is this line of beneficence confined to arbitration seasonable counsel coming with the weight which the reputation of the adviser gives it will often keep or extricate the rash and uninformed out of great difficulties   0 lastly i know not a more exalted charity than that which presents a shield against the rapacity or persecution of a tyrant   betwixt argument and authority i mean that authority which flows from voluntary respect and attends upon sanctity and disinterestedness of character something may be done amongst the lower orders of mankind towards the regulation of their conduct and the satisfaction of their thoughts this office belongs to the ministers of religion or rather whoever undertakes it becomes a minister of religion the inferior clergy who are nearly upon a level with the common sort of their parishioners and who on that account gain an easier admission to their society and confidence have in this respect more in their power than their superiors the discreet use of this power constitutes one of the most respectable functions of human nature chapter   charity pecuniary bounty i the obligation to bestow relief upon the poor ii the manner of bestowing it iii the pretences by which men excuse themselves from it i the obligation to bestow relief upon the poor they who rank pity amongst the original impulses of our nature rightly contend that when this principle prompts us to the relief of human misery it indicates the divine intention and our duty indeed the same conclusion is deducible from the existence     of the passion whatever account be given of its origin whether it be an instinct or a habit it is in fact a property of our nature which god appointed and the final cause for which it was appointed is to afford to the miserable in the compassion of their fellowcreatures a remedy for those inequalities and distresses which god foresaw that many must be exposed to under every general rule for the distribution of property beside this the poor have a claim founded in the law of nature which may be thus explained all things were originally common no one being able to produce a charter from heaven had any better title to a particular possession than his next neighbour there were reasons for mankinds agreeing upon a separation of this common fund and god for these reasons is presumed to have ratified it but this separation was made and consented to upon the expectation and condition that every one should have left a sufficiency for his subsistence or the means of procuring it and as no fixed laws for the regulation of property can be so contrived as to provide for the relief of every case and distress which may arise these cases and distresses when their right and share in the common stock were given up or taken from them were supposed to be left to the voluntary bounty of those who might be acquainted with the exigencies of their situation and in the way of affording assistance and therefore when the partition of property is rigidly maintained against the claims of indigence and distress it is maintained in opposition to the intention of those who made it and to his who is the supreme proprietor of every thing and who has filled the world with plenteousness for the sustentation and comfort of all whom he sends into it the christian scriptures are more copious and explicit upon this duty than upon almost any other the description which christ hath left us of the proceedings of the last day establishes the obligation of bounty beyond controversy when the son of man     shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was an hungered and ye gave me meat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me and inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me it is not necessary to understand this passage as a literal account of what will actually pass on that day supposing it only a scenical description of the rules and principles by which the supreme arbiter of our destiny will regulate his decisions it conveys the same lesson to us it equally demonstrates of how great value and importance these duties in the sight of god are and what stress will be laid upon them the apostles also describe this virtue as propitiating the divine favour in an eminent degree and these recommendations have produced their effect it does not appear that before the times of christianity an infirmary hospital or public charity of any kind existed in the world whereas most countries in christendom have long abounded with these institutions to which may be added that a spirit of private liberality seems to flourish amidst the decay of many other virtues not to mention the legal provision for the poor which obtains in this country and which was unknown and unthought of by the most humanised nations of antiquity st paul adds upon the subject an excellent direction and which is practicable by all who have any thing to give upon the first day of the week or any other stated time let every one of you lay by in     store as god hath prospered him by which i understand st paul to recommend what is the very thing wanting with most men the being charitable upon a plan that is upon a deliberate comparison of our fortunes with the reasonable expenses and expectation of our families to compute what we can spare and to lay by so much for charitable purposes in some mode or other the mode will be a consideration afterwards the effect which christianity produced upon some of its first converts was such as might be looked for from a divine religion coming with full force and miraculous evidence upon the consciences of mankind it overwhelmed all worldly considerations in the expectation of a more important existence and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things in common neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need acts iv    nevertheless this community of goods however it manifested the sincere zeal of the primitive christians is no precedent for our imitation it was confined to the church at jerusalem continued not long there was never enjoined upon any acts v   and although it might suit with the particular circumstances of a small and select society is altogether impracticable in a large and mixed community the conduct of the apostles upon the occasion deserves to be noticed their followers laid down their fortunes at their feet but so far were they from taking advantage of this unlimited confidence to enrich themselves or to establish their own authority that they soon after got rid of this business as inconsistent with the main object of their mission and transferred the custody and     management of the public fund to deacons elected to that office by the people at large acts vi ii the manner of bestowing bounty or the different kinds of charity every question between the different kinds of charity supposes the sum bestowed to be the same there are three kinds of charity which prefer a claim to attention the first and in my judgement one of the best is to give stated and considerable sums by way of pension or annuity to individuals or families with whose behaviour and distress we ourselves are acquainted when i speak of considerable sums i mean only that five pounds or any other sum given at once or divided amongst five or fewer families will do more good than the same sum distributed amongst a greater number in shillings or halfcrowns and that because it is more likely to be properly applied by the persons who receive it a poor fellow who can find no better use for a shilling than to drink his benefactors health and purchase half an hours recreation for himself would hardly break into a guinea for any such purpose or be so improvident as not to lay it by for an occasion of importance eg for his rent his clothing fuel or stock of winters provision it is a still greater recommendation of this kind of charity that pensions and annuities which are paid regularly and can be expected at the time are the only way by which we can prevent one part of a poor mans sufferings—the dread of want   but as this kind of charity supposes that proper objects of such expensive benefactions fall within our private knowledge and observation which does not happen to all a second method of doing good which is in every ones power who has the money to spare is by subscription to public charities public charities admit of this argument in their favour that your money goes farther towards attaining the end for which it is given than it can do by any private and separate beneficence a guinea for example contributed to an infirmary becomes the means of providing one     patient at least with a physician surgeon apothecary with medicine diet lodging and suitable attendance which is not the tenth part of what the same assistance if it could be procured at all would cost to a sick person or family in any other situation   the last and compared with the former the lowest exertion of benevolence is in the relief of beggars nevertheless i by no means approve the indiscriminate rejection of all who implore our alms in this way some may perish by such a conduct men are sometimes overtaken by distress for which all other relief would come too late beside which resolutions of this kind compel us to offer such violence to our humanity as may go near in a little while to suffocate the principle itself which is a very serious consideration a good man if he do not surrender himself to his feelings without reserve will at least lend an ear to importunities which come accompanied with outward attestations of distress and after a patient audience of the complaint will direct himself not so much by any previous resolution which he may have formed upon the subject as by the circumstances and credibility of the account that he receives there are other species of charity well contrived to make the money expended go far such as keeping down the price of fuel or provision in case of monopoly or temporary scarcity by purchasing the articles at the best market and retailing them at prime cost or at a small loss or the adding of a bounty to particular species of labour when the price is accidentally depressed the proprietors of large estates have it in their power to facilitate the maintenance and thereby to encourage the establishment of families which is one of the noblest purposes to which the rich and great can convert their endeavours by building cottages splitting farms erecting manufactories cultivating wastes embanking the sea draining marshes and other expedients which the situation of each estate points out if the profits of these undertakings     do not repay the expense let the authors of them place the difference to the account of charity it is true of almost all such projects that the public is a gainer by them whatever the owner be and where the loss can be spared this consideration is sufficient it is become a question of some importance under what circumstances works of charity ought to be done in private and when they may be made public without detracting from the merit of the action if indeed they ever may the author of our religion having delivered a rule upon this subject which seems to enjoin universal secrecy when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth that thy alms may be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly matt vi     from the preamble to this prohibition i think it however plain that our saviours sole design was to forbid ostentation and all publishing of good works which proceeds from that motive take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven therefore when thou doest thine alms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men verily i say unto you they have their reward ver   there are motives for the doing our alms in public beside those of ostentation with which therefore our saviours rule has no concern such as to testify our approbation of some particular species of charity and to recommend it to others to take off the prejudice which the want or which is the same thing the suppression of our name in the list of contributors might excite against the charity or against ourselves and so long as these motives are free from any mixture of vanity they are in no danger of invading our saviours prohibition they rather seem to comply with another direction which he has left us let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven if it be necessary to     propose a precise distinction upon the subject i can think of none better than the following when our bounty is beyond our fortune and station that is when it is more than could be expected from us our charity should be private if privacy be practicable when it is not more than might be expected it may be public for we cannot hope to influence others to the imitation of extraordinary generosity and therefore want in the former case the only justifiable reason for making it public having thus described several different exertions of charity it may not be improper to take notice of a species of liberality which is not charity in any sense of the word i mean the giving of entertainments or liquor for the sake of popularity or the rewarding treating and maintaining the companions of our diversions as hunters shooters fishers and the like i do not say that this is criminal i only say that it is not charity and that we are not to suppose because we give and give to the poor that it will stand in the place or supersede the obligation of more meritorious and disinterested bounty iii the pretences by which men excuse themselves from giving to the poor   that they have nothing to spare ie nothing for which they have not provided some other use nothing which their plan or expense together with the savings they have resolved to lay by will not exhaust never reflecting whether it be in their power or that it is their duty to retrench their expenses and contract their plan that they may have to give to them that need or rather that this ought to have been part of their plan originally   that they have families of their own and that charity begins at home the extent of this plea will be considered when we come to explain the duty of parents   that charity does not consist in giving money but in benevolence philanthropy love to all mankind goodness of heart c hear st james if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of     daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be ye warmed and filled notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body what doth it profit james ii         that giving to the poor is not mentioned in st pauls description of charity in the thirteenth chapter of his first epistle to the corinthians this is not a description of charity but of goodnature and it is not necessary that every duty be mentioned in every place   that they pay the poorrates they might as well allege that they pay their debts for the poor have the same right to that portion of a mans property which the laws assign to them that the man himself has to the remainder   that they employ many poor persons—for their own sake not the poors—otherwise it is a good plea   that the poor do not suffer so much as we imagine that education and habit have reconciled them to the evils of their condition and make them easy under it habit can never reconcile human nature to the extremities of cold hunger and thirst any more than it can reconcile the hand to the touch of a redhot iron besides the question is not how unhappy any one is but how much more happy we can make him   that these people give them what you will will never thank you or think of you for it in the first place this is not true in the second place it was not for the sake of their thanks that you relieved them   that we are liable to be imposed upon if a due inquiry be made our merit is the same beside that the distress is generally real although the cause be untruly stated  0 that they should apply to their parishes this is not always practicable to which we may add that there are many requisites to a comfortable subsistence which parish relief does not     supply and that there are some who would suffer almost as much from receiving parish relief as by the want of it and lastly that there are many modes of charity to which this answer does not relate at all    that giving money encourages idleness and vagrancy this is true only of injudicious and indiscriminate generosity    that we have too many objects of charity at home to bestow any thing upon strangers or that there are other charities which are more useful or stand in greater need the value of this excuse depends entirely upon the fact whether we actually relieve those neighbouring objects and contribute to those other charities beside all these excuses pride or prudery or delicacy or love of ease keep one half of the world out of the way of observing what the other half suffer chapter   resentment resentment may be distinguished into anger and revenge by anger i mean the pain we suffer upon the receipt of an injury or affront with the usual effects of that pain upon ourselves by revenge the inflicting of pain upon the person who has injured or offended us farther than the just ends of punishment or reparation require anger prompts to revenge but it is possible to suspend the effect when we cannot altogether quell the principle we are bound also to endeavour to qualify and correct the principle itself so that our duty requires two different applications of the mind and for that reason anger and revenge may be considered separately chapter   anger   0 be ye angry and sin not therefore all anger is not sinful i suppose because some degree of it and upon some occasions is inevitable it becomes sinful or contradicts however the rule of scripture when it is conceived upon slight and inadequate provocations and when it continues long   when it is conceived upon slight provocations for charity suffereth long is not easily provoked let every man be slow to anger peace longsuffering gentleness meekness are enumerated among the fruits of the spirit gal v    and compose the true christian temper as to this article of duty   when it continues long for let not the sun go down upon your wrath these precepts and all reasoning indeed on the subject suppose the passion of anger to be within our power and this power consists not so much in any faculty we possess of appeasing our wrath at the time for we are passive under the smart which an injury or affront occasions and all we can then do is to prevent its breaking out into action as in so mollifying our minds by habits of just reflection as to be less irritated by impressions of injury and to be sooner pacified reflections proper for this purpose and which may be called the sedatives of anger are the following the possibility of mistaking the motives from which the conduct that offends us proceeded how often our offences have been the effect of inadvertency when they were construed into indications of malice the inducement which prompted our adversary to act as he did and how powerfully the same inducement has at one time or other operated upon     ourselves that he is suffering perhaps under a contrition which he is ashamed or wants opportunity to confess and how ungenerous it is to triumph by coldness or insult over a spirit already humbled in secret that the returns of kindness are sweet and that there is neither honour nor virtue nor use in resisting them—for some persons think themselves bound to cherish and keep alive their indignation when they find it dying away of itself we may remember that others have their passions their prejudices their favourite aims their fears their cautions their interests their sudden impulses their varieties of apprehension as well as we we may recollect what hath sometimes passed in our minds when we have gotten on the wrong side of a quarrel and imagine the same to be passing in our adversarys mind now when we became sensible of our misbehaviour what palliations we perceived in it and expected others to perceive how we were affected by the kindness and felt the superiority of a generous reception and ready forgiveness how persecution revived our spirits with our enmity and seemed to justify the conduct in ourselves which we before blamed add to this the indecency of extravagant anger how it renders us whilst it lasts the scorn and sport of all about us of which it leaves us when it ceases sensible and ashamed the inconveniences and irretrievable misconduct into which our irascibility has sometimes betrayed us the friendships it has lost us the distresses and embarrassments in which we have been involved by it and the sore repentance which on one account or other it always cost us but the reflection calculated above all others to allay the haughtiness of temper which is ever finding out provocations and which renders anger so impetuous is that which the gospel proposes namely that we ourselves are or shortly shall be suppliants for mercy and pardon at the judgementseat of god imagine our secret sins disclosed and brought to light imagine us thus humbled and exposed trembling under the hand of god casting ourselves     on his compassion crying out for mercy imagine such a creature to talk of satisfaction and revenge refusing to be entreated disdaining to forgive extreme to mark and to resent what is done amiss—imagine i say this and you can hardly frame to yourself an instance of more impious and unnatural arrogance the point is to habituate ourselves to these reflections till they rise up of their own accord when they are wanted that is instantly upon the receipt of an injury or affront and with such force and colouring as both to mitigate the paroxysms of our anger at the time and at length to produce an alteration in the temper and disposition itself chapter   revenge all pain occasioned to another in consequence of an offence or injury received from him further than what is calculated to procure reparation or promote the just ends of punishment is so much revenge there can be no difficulty in knowing when we occasion pain to another nor much in distinguishing whether we do so with a view only to the ends of punishment or from revenge for in the one case we proceed with reluctance in the other with pleasure it is highly probable from the light of nature that a passion which seeks its gratification immediately and expressly in giving pain is disagreeable to the benevolent will and counsels of the creator other passions and pleasures may and often do produce pain to some one but then pain is not as it is here the object of the passion and the direct cause of the pleasure this probability is converted into certainty if we give credit to the authority which dictated the several passages of the christian scriptures that condemn revenge or what is the same thing which enjoin forgiveness     we will set down the principal of these passages and endeavour to collect from them what conduct upon the whole is allowed towards an enemy and what is forbidden if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses—and his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses—put on bowels of mercy kindness humbleness of mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as christ forgave you so also do ye—be patient towards all men see that none render evil for evil to any man—avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good i think it evident from some of these passages taken separately and still more so from all of them together that revenge as described in the beginning of this chapter is forbidden in every degree under all forms and upon every occasion we are likewise forbidden to refuse to an enemy even the most imperfect right if he hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink† which are examples of imperfect rights if one who has offended us solicit     from us a vote to which his qualifications entitle him we may not refuse it from motives of resentment or the remembrance of what we have suffered at his hands his right and our obligation which follows the right are not altered by his enmity to us or by ours to him on the other hand i do not conceive that these prohibitions were intended to interfere with the punishment or prosecution of public offenders in the eighteenth chapter of st matthew our saviour tells his disciples if thy brother who has trespassed against thee neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican immediately after this when st peter asked him how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him till seven times christ replied i say not unto thee until seven times but until seventy times seven that is as often as he repeats the offence from these two adjoining passages compared together we are authorised to conclude that the forgiveness of an enemy is not inconsistent with the proceeding against him as a public offender and that the discipline established in religious or civil societies for the restraint or punishment of criminals ought to be upholden if the magistrate be not tied down with these prohibitions from the execution of his office neither is the prosecutor for the office of the prosecutor is as necessary as that of the magistrate nor by parity of reason are private persons withholden from the correction of vice when it is in their power to exercise it provided they be assured that it is the guilt which provokes them and not the injury and that their motives are pure from all mixture and every particle of that spirit which delights and triumphs in the humiliation of an adversary thus it is no breach of christian charity to withdraw our company or civility when the same tends to discountenance any vicious practice this is one branch of that extrajudicial discipline which     supplies the defects and the remissness of law and is expressly authorised by st paul   cor v    but now i have written unto you not to keep company if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an idolater or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner with such an one no not to eat the use of this association against vice continues to be experienced in one remarkable instance and might be extended with good effect to others the confederacy amongst women of character to exclude from their society keptmistresses and prostitutes contributes more perhaps to discourage that condition of life and prevents greater numbers from entering into it than all the considerations of prudence and religion put together we are likewise allowed to practise so much caution as not to put ourselves in the way of injury or invite the repetition of it if a servant or tradesman has cheated us we are not bound to trust him again for this is to encourage him in his dishonest practices which is doing him much harm where a benefit can be conferred only upon one or few and the choice of the person upon whom it is conferred is a proper object of favour we are at liberty to prefer those who have not offended us to those who have the contrary being nowhere required christ who as hath been well demonstrated estimated virtues by their solid utility and not by their fashion or popularity prefers this of the forgiveness of injuries to every other he enjoins it oftener with more earnestness under a greater variety of forms and with this weighty and peculiar circumstance that the forgiveness of others is the condition upon which alone we are to expect or even ask from god forgiveness for ourselves and this preference is justified by the superior importance of the virtue itself the feuds and animosities in families and between neighbours which disturb the intercourse of     human life and collectively compose half the misery of it have their foundation in the want of a forgiving temper and can never cease but by the exercise of this virtue on one side or on both chapter   duelling duelling as a punishment is absurd because it is an equal chance whether the punishment fall upon the offender or the person offended nor is it much better as a reparation it being difficult to explain in what the satisfaction consists or how it tends to undo the injury or to afford a compensation for the damage already sustained the truth is it is not considered as either a law of honour having annexed the imputation of cowardice to patience under an affront challenges are given and accepted with no other design than to prevent or wipe off this suspicion without malice against the adversary generally without a wish to destroy him or any other concern than to preserve the duellists own reputation and reception in the world the unreasonableness of this rule of manners is one consideration the duty and conduct of individuals while such a rule exists is another as to which the proper and single question is this whether a regard for our own reputation is or is not sufficient to justify the taking away the life of another murder is forbidden and wherever human life is deliberately taken away otherwise than by public authority there is murder the value and security of human life make this rule necessary for i do not see what other idea or definition of murder can be admitted which will not let in so much private violence as to render society a scene of peril and bloodshed     if unauthorised laws of honour be allowed to create exceptions to divine prohibitions there is an end of all morality as founded in the will of the deity and the obligation of every duty may at one time or other be discharged by the caprice and fluctuations of fashion but a sense of shame is so much torture and no relief presents itself otherwise than by an attempt upon the life of our adversary what then the distress which men suffer by the want of money is oftentimes extreme and no resource can be discovered but that of removing a life which stands between the distressed person and his inheritance the motive in this case is as urgent and the means much the same as in the former yet this case finds no advocate take away the circumstance of the duellists exposing his own life and it becomes assassination add this circumstance and what difference does it make none but this that fewer perhaps will imitate the example and human life will be somewhat more safe when it cannot be attacked without equal danger to the aggressors own experience however proves that there is fortitude enough in most men to undertake this hazard and were it otherwise the defence at best would be only that which a highwayman or housebreaker might plead whose attempt had been so daring and desperate that few were likely to repeat the same in expostulating with the duellist i all along suppose his adversary to fall which supposition i am at liberty to make because if he have no right to kill his adversary he has none to attempt it in return i forbear from applying to the case of duelling the christian principle of the forgiveness of injuries because it is possible to suppose the injury to be forgiven and the duellist to act entirely from a concern for his own reputation where this is not the case the guilt of duelling is manifest and is greater in this view it seems unnecessary to distinguish between him who gives and him who accepts a challenge for on the one hand they incur an equal hazard of destroying life and on the other     both act upon the same persuasion that what they do is necessary in order to recover or preserve the good opinion of the world public opinion is not easily controlled by civil institutions for which reason i question whether any regulations can be contrived of sufficient force to suppress or change the rule of honour which stigmatises all scruples about duelling with the reproach of cowardice the insufficiency of the redress which the law of the land affords for those injuries which chiefly affect a man in his sensibility and reputation tempts many to redress themselves prosecutions for such offences by the trifling damages that are recovered serve only to make the sufferer more ridiculous this ought to be remedied for the army where the point of honour is cultivated with exquisite attention and refinement i would establish a court of honour with a power of awarding those submissions and acknowledgements which it is generally the purpose of a challenge to obtain and it might grow into a fashion with persons of rank of all professions to refer their quarrels to this tribunal duelling as the law now stands can seldom be overtaken by legal punishment the challenge appointment and other previous circumstances which indicate the intention with which the combatants met being suppressed nothing appears to a court of justice but the actual rencounter and if a person be slain when actually fighting with his adversary the law deems his death nothing more than manslaughter chapter  0 litigation if it be possible live peaceably with all men which precept contains an indirect confession that this is not always possible     the instances in the fifth chapter of saint matthew are rather to be understood as proverbial methods of describing the general duties of forgiveness and benevolence and the temper which we ought to aim at acquiring than as directions to be specifically observed or of themselves of any great importance to be observed the first of these is if thine enemy smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also yet when one of the officers struck jesus with the palm of his hand we find jesus rebuking him for the outrage with becoming indignation if i have spoken evil bear witness of the evil but if well why smitest thou me john xviii    it may be observed likewise that the several examples are drawn from instances of small and tolerable injuries a rule which forbade all opposition to injury or defence against it could have no other effect than to put the good in subjection to the bad and deliver one half of mankind to the depredation of the other half which must be the case so long as some considered themselves as bound by such a rule whilst others despised it saint paul though no one inculcated forgiveness and forbearance with a deeper sense of the value and obligation of these virtues did not interpret either of them to require an unresisting submission to every contumely or a neglect of the means of safety and selfdefence he took refuge in the laws of his country and in the privileges of a roman citizen from the conspiracy of the jews acts xxv    and from the clandestine violence of the chief captain acts xxii    and yet this is the same apostle who reproved the litigiousness of his corinthian converts with so much severity now therefore there is utterly a fault among you because ye go to law one with   0 another why do ye not rather take wrong why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded on the one hand therefore christianity excludes all vindictive motives and all frivolous causes of prosecution so that where the injury is small where no good purpose of public example is answered where forbearance is not likely to invite a repetition of the injury or where the expense of an action becomes a punishment too severe for the offence there the christian is withholden by the authority of his religion from going to law on the other hand a lawsuit is inconsistent with no rule of the gospel when it is instituted   for the establishing of some important right   for the procuring a compensation for some considerable damage   for the preventing of future injury but since it is supposed to be undertaken simply with a view to the ends of justice and safety the prosecutor of the action is bound to confine himself to the cheapest process which will accomplish these ends as well as to consent to any peaceable expedient for the same purpose as to a reference in which the arbitrators can do what the law cannot divide the damage when the fault is mutual or to a compounding of the dispute by accepting a compensation in the gross without entering into articles and items which it is often very difficult to adjust separately as to the rest the duty of the contending parties may be expressed in the following directions not by appeals to prolong a suit against your own conviction not to undertake or defend a suit against a poor adversary or render it more dilatory or expensive than necessary with the hope of intimidating or wearing him out by the expense not to influence evidence by authority or expectation     nor to stifle any in your possession although it make against you hitherto we have treated of civil actions in criminal prosecutions the private injury should be forgotten and the prosecutor proceed with the same temper and upon the same motives as the magistrate the one being a necessary minister of justice as well as the other and both bound to direct their conduct by a dispassionate care of the public welfare in whatever degree the punishment of an offender is conducive or his escape dangerous to the interest of the community in the same degree is the party against whom the crime was committed bound to prosecute because such prosecutions must in their nature originate from the sufferer therefore great public crimes as robberies forgeries and the like ought not to be spared from an apprehension of trouble or expense in carrying on the prosecution from false shame or misplaced compassion there are many offences such as nuisances neglect of public roads forestalling engrossing smuggling sabbathbreaking profaneness drunkenness prostitution the keeping of lewd or disorderly houses the writing publishing or exposing to sale lascivious books or pictures with some others the prosecution of which being of equal concern to the whole neighbourhood cannot be charged as a peculiar obligation upon any nevertheless there is great merit in the person who undertakes such prosecutions upon proper motives which amounts to the same thing the character of an informer is in this country undeservedly odious but where any public advantage is likely to be attained by information or other activity in promoting the execution of the laws a good man will despise a prejudice founded in no just reason     or will acquit himself of the imputation of interested designs by giving away his share of the penalty on the other hand prosecutions for the sake of the reward or for the gratification of private enmity where the offence produces no public mischief or where it arises from ignorance or inadvertency are reprobated under the general description of applying a rule of law to a purpose for which it was not intended under which description may be ranked an officious revival of the laws against popish priests and dissenting teachers chapter    gratitude examples of ingratitude check and discourage voluntary beneficence and in this the mischief of ingratitude consists nor is the mischief small for after all is done that can be done towards providing for the public happiness by prescribing rules of justice and enforcing the observation of them by penalties or compulsion much must be left to those offices of kindness which men remain at liberty to exert or withhold now not only the choice of the objects but the quantity and even the existence of this sort of kindness in the world depends in a great measure upon the return which it receives and this is a consideration of general importance a second reason for cultivating a grateful temper in ourselves is the following the same principle which is touched with the kindness of a human benefactor is capable of being affected by the divine goodness and of becoming under the influence of that affection a source of the purest and most exalted virtue the love of god is the sublimest gratitude it is a mistake therefore to imagine that this virtue is omitted in the christian scriptures for every precept which commands us to love god because he first     loved us presupposes the principle of gratitude and directs it to its proper object it is impossible to particularise the several expressions of gratitude inasmuch as they vary with the character and situation of the benefactor and with the opportunities of the person obliged which variety admits of no bounds it may be observed however that gratitude can never oblige a man to do what is wrong and what by consequence he is previously obliged not to do it is no ingratitude to refuse to do what we cannot reconcile to any apprehensions of our duty but it is ingratitude and hypocrisy together to pretend this reason when it is not the real one and the frequency of such pretences has brought this apology for noncompliance with the will of a benefactor into unmerited disgrace it has long been accounted a violation of delicacy and generosity to upbraid men with the favours they have received but it argues a total destitution of both these qualities as well as of moral probity to take advantage of that ascendency which the conferring of benefits justly creates to draw or drive those whom we have obliged into mean or dishonest compliances chapter    slander speaking is acting both in philosophical strictness and as to all moral purposes for if the mischief and motive of our conduct be the same the means which we use make no difference and this is in effect what our saviour declares matt xii    by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned by thy words as well that is as by thy actions the one shall be taken into the account as well as the other for     they both possess the same property of voluntarily producing good or evil slander may be distinguished into two kinds malicious slander and inconsiderate slander malicious slander is the relating of either truth or falsehood for the purpose of creating misery i acknowledge that the truth or falsehood of what is related varies the degree of guilt considerably and that slander in the ordinary acceptation of the term signifies the circulation of mischievous falsehoods but truth may be made instrumental to the success of malicious designs as well as falsehood and if the end be bad the means cannot be innocent i think the idea of slander ought to be confined to the production of gratuitous mischief when we have an end or interest of our own to serve if we attempt to compass it by falsehood it is fraud if by a publication of the truth it is not without some additional circumstance of breach of promise betraying of confidence or the like to be deemed criminal sometimes the pain is intended for the person to whom we are speaking at other times an enmity is to be gratified by the prejudice or disquiet of a third person to infuse suspicions to kindle or continue disputes to avert the favour and esteem of benefactors from their dependents to render some one whom we dislike contemptible or obnoxious in the public opinion are all offices of slander of which the guilt must be measured by the intensity and extent of the misery produced the disguises under which slander is conveyed whether in a whisper with injunctions of secrecy by way of caution or with affected reluctance are all so many aggravations of the offence as they indicate more deliberation and design inconsiderate slander is a different offence although the same mischief actually follow and although the mischief might have     been foreseen the not being conscious of that design which we have hitherto attributed to the slanderer makes the difference the guilt here consists in the want of that regard to the consequences of our conduct which a just affection for human happiness and concern for our duty would not have failed to have produced in us and it is no answer to this crimination to say that we entertained no evil design a servant may be a very bad servant and yet seldom or never design to act in opposition to his masters interest or will and his master may justly punish such servant for a thoughtlessness and neglect nearly as prejudicial as deliberate disobedience i accuse you not he may say of any express intention to hurt me but had not the fear of my displeasure the care of my interest and indeed all the qualities which constitute the merit of a good servant been wanting in you they would not only have excluded every direct purpose of giving me uneasiness but have been so far present to your thoughts as to have checked that unguarded licentiousness by which i have suffered so much and inspired you in its place with an habitual solicitude about the effects and tendency of what you did or said this very much resembles the case of all sins of inconsideration and amongst the foremost of these that of inconsiderate slander information communicated for the real purpose of warning or cautioning is not slander indiscriminate praise is the opposite of slander but it is the opposite extreme and however it may affect to be thought to be excess of candour is commonly the effusion of a frivolous understanding or proceeds from a settled contempt of all moral distinctions         part iii of relative duties which result from the constitution of the sexes the constitution of the sexes is the foundation of marriage collateral to the subject of marriage are fornication seduction adultery incest polygamy divorce consequential to marriage is the relation and reciprocal duty of parent and child we will treat of these subjects in the following order first of the public use of marriage institutions secondly of the subjects collateral to marriage in the order in which we have here proposed them thirdly of marriage itself and lastly of the relation and reciprocal duties of parents and children chapter   of the public use of marriage institutions the public use of marriage institutions consists in their promoting the following beneficial effects   the private comfort of individuals especially of the female sex it may be true that all are not interested in this reason nevertheless it is a reason to all for abstaining from any conduct which     tends in its general consequence to obstruct marriage for whatever promotes the happiness of the majority is binding upon the whole   the production of the greatest number of healthy children their better education and the making of due provision for their settlement in life   the peace of human society in cutting off a principal source of contention by assigning one or more women to one man and protecting his exclusive right by sanctions of morality and law   the better government of society by distributing the community into separate families and appointing over each the authority of a master of a family which has more actual influence than all civil authority put together   the same end in the additional security which the state receives for the good behaviour of its citizens from the solicitude they feel for the welfare of their children and from their being confined to permanent habitations   the encouragement of industry some ancient nations appear to have been more sensible of the importance of marriage institutions than we are the spartans obliged their citizens to marry by penalties and the romans encouraged theirs by the jus trium liberorum a man who had no child was entitled by the roman law only to one half of any legacy that should be left him that is at the most could only receive one half of the testators fortune chapter   fornication the first and great mischief and by consequence the guilt of     promiscuous concubinage consists in its tendency to diminish marriages and thereby to defeat the several beneficial purposes enumerated in the preceding chapter promiscuous concubinage discourages marriage by abating the chief temptation to it the male part of the species will not undertake the encumbrance expense and restraint of married life if they can gratify their passions at a cheaper price and they will undertake any thing rather than not gratify them the reader will learn to comprehend the magnitude of this mischief by attending to the importance and variety of the uses to which marriage is subservient and by recollecting withal that the malignity and moral quality of each crime is not to be estimated by the particular effect of one offence or of one persons offending but by the general tendency and consequence of crimes of the same nature the libertine may not be conscious that these irregularities hinder his own marriage from which he is deterred he may allege by different considerations much less does he perceive how his indulgences can hinder other men from marrying but what will he say would be the consequence if the same licentiousness were universal or what should hinder its becoming universal if it be innocent or allowable in him   fornication supposes prostitution and prostitution brings and leaves the victims of it to almost certain misery it is no small quantity of misery in the aggregate which between want disease and insult is suffered by those outcasts of human society who infest populous cities the whole of which is a general consequence of fornication and to the increase and continuance of which every act and instance of fornication contributes   fornication produces habits of ungovernable lewdness which introduce the more aggravated crimes of seduction adultery violation c likewise however it be accounted for the criminal commerce of the sexes corrupts and depraves the mind   0 and moral character more than any single species of vice whatsoever that ready perception of guilt that prompt and decisive resolution against it which constitutes a virtuous character is seldom found in persons addicted to these indulgences they prepare an easy admission for every sin that seeks it are in low life usually the first stage in mens progress to the most desperate villanies and in high life to that lamented dissoluteness of principle which manifests itself in a profligacy of public conduct and a contempt of the obligations of religion and of moral probity add to this that habits of libertinism incapacitate and indispose the mind for all intellectual moral and religious pleasures which is a great loss to any mans happiness   fornication perpetuates a disease which may be accounted one of the sorest maladies of human nature and the effects of which are said to visit the constitution of even distant generations the passion being natural proves that it was intended to be gratified but under what restrictions or whether without any must be collected from different considerations the christian scriptures condemn fornication absolutely and peremptorily out of the heart says our saviour proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornication thefts false witness blasphemies these are the things which defile a man these are christs own words and one word from him upon the subject is final it may be observed with what society fornication is classed with murders thefts false witness blasphemies i do not mean that these crimes are all equal because they are all mentioned together but it proves that they are all crimes the apostles are more full upon this topic one wellknown passage in the epistle to the hebrews may stand in the place of all others because admitting the authority by which the apostles of christ spake and wrote it is decisive marriage and the bed undefiled is honourable amongst all men but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge which     was a great deal to say at a time when it was not agreed even amongst philosophers themselves that fornication was a crime the scriptures give no sanction to those austerities which have been since imposed upon the world under the name of christs religion as the celibacy of the clergy the praise of perpetual virginity the prohibitio concubitûs cum gravidâ uxore but with a just knowledge of and regard to the condition and interest of the human species have provided in the marriage of one man with one woman an adequate gratification for the propensities of their nature and have restricted them to that gratification the avowed toleration and in some countries the licensing taxing and regulating of public brothels has appeared to the people an authorising of fornication and has contributed with other causes so far to vitiate the public opinion that there is no practice of which the immorality is so little thought of or acknowledged although there are few in which it can more plainly be made out the legislators who have patronised receptacles of prostitution ought to have foreseen this effect as well as considered that whatever facilitates fornication diminishes marriages and as to the usual apology for this relaxed discipline the danger of greater enormities if access to prostitutes were too strictly watched and prohibited it will be time enough to look to that when the laws and the magistrates have done their utmost the greatest vigilance of both will do no more than oppose some bounds and some difficulties to this intercourse and after all these pretended fears are without foundation in experience the men are in all respects the most virtuous in countries where the women are most chaste there is a species of cohabitation distinguishable no doubt from vagrant concubinage and which by reason of its resemblance to marriage may be thought to participate of the sanctity and innocence of that estate i mean the case of kept mistresses under the     favourable circumstance of mutual fidelity this case i have heard defended by some such apology as the following that the marriagerite being different in different countries and in the same country amongst different sects and with some scarce any thing and moreover not being prescribed or even mentioned in scripture can be accounted for only as of a form and ceremony of human invention that consequently if a man and woman betroth and confine themselves to each other their intercourse must be the same as to all moral purposes as if they were legally married for the addition or omission of that which is a mere form and ceremony can make no difference in the sight of god or in the actual nature of right and wrong to all which it may be replied   if the situation of the parties be the same thing as marriage why do they not marry   if the man choose to have it in his power to dismiss the woman at his pleasure or to retain her in a state of humiliation and dependence inconsistent with the rights which marriage would confer upon her it is not the same thing it is not at any rate the same thing to the children again as to the marriagerite being a mere form and that also variable the same may be said of signing and sealing of bonds wills deeds of conveyance and the like which yet make a great difference in the rights and obligations of the parties concerned in them and with respect to the rite not being appointed in scripture—the scriptures forbid fornication that is cohabitation without marriage leaving it to the law of each country to pronounce what is or what makes a marriage in like manner as they forbid thefts that is the taking away of anothers property leaving it to the municipal law to fix what makes the thing property or whose it is which also as well as marriage depend upon arbitrary and mutable forms     laying aside the injunctions of scripture the plain account of the question seems to be this it is immoral because it is pernicious that men and women should cohabit without undertaking certain irrevocable obligations and mutually conferring certain civil rights if therefore the law has annexed these rights and obligations to certain forms so that they cannot be secured or undertaken by any other means which is the case here for whatever the parties may promise to each other nothing but the marriageceremony can make their promise irrevocable it becomes in the same degree immoral that men and women should cohabit without the interposition of these forms if fornication be criminal all those incentives which lead to it are accessaries to the crime as lascivious conversation whether expressed in obscene or disguised under modest phrases also wanton songs pictures books the writing publishing and circulating of which whether out of frolic or for some pitiful profit is productive of so extensive a mischief from so mean a temptation that few crimes within the reach of private wickedness have more to answer for or less to plead in their excuse indecent conversation and by parity of reason all the rest are forbidden by saint paul eph iv    let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth and again col iii   put off filthy communication out of your mouth the invitation or voluntary admission of impure thoughts or the suffering them to get possession of the imagination falls within the same description and is condemned by christ matt v    whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath     committed adultery with her already in his heart christ by thus enjoining a regulation of the thoughts strikes at the root of the evil chapter   seduction the seducer practises the same stratagems to draw a womans person into his power that a swindler does to get possession of your goods or money yet the law of honour which abhors deceit applauds the address of a successful intrigue so much is this capricious rule guided by names and with such facility does it accommodate itself to the pleasures and conveniency of higher life seduction is seldom accomplished without fraud and the fraud is by so much more criminal than other frauds as the injury effected by it is greater continues longer and less admits reparation this injury is threefold to the woman to her family and to the public i the injury to the woman is made up of the pain she suffers from shame or the loss she sustains in her reputation and prospects of marriage and of the depravation of her moral principle   this pain must be extreme if we may judge of it from those barbarous endeavours to conceal their disgrace to which women under such circumstances sometimes have recourse comparing also this barbarity with their passionate fondness for their offspring in other cases nothing but an agony of mind the most insupportable can induce a woman to forget her nature and the pity which even a stranger would show to a helpless and imploring infant it is true that all are not urged to this extremity but if any are it affords an indication of how much all suffer from the same cause what shall we say to the authors of such mischief       the loss which a woman sustains by the ruin of her reputation almost exceeds computation every persons happiness depends in part upon the respect and reception which they meet with in the world and it is no inconsiderable mortification even to the firmest tempers to be rejected from the society of their equals or received there with neglect and disdain but this is not all nor the worst by a rule of life which it is not easy to blame and which it is impossible to alter a woman loses with her chastity the chance of marrying at all or in any manner equal to the hopes she had been accustomed to entertain now marriage whatever it be to a man is that from which every woman expects her chief happiness and this is still more true in low life of which condition the women are who are most exposed to solicitations of this sort add to this that where a womans maintenance depends upon her character as it does in a great measure with those who are to support themselves by service little sometimes is left to the forsaken sufferer but to starve for want of employment or to have recourse to prostitution for food and raiment   as a woman collects her virtue into this point the loss of her chastity is generally the destruction of her moral principle and this consequence is to be apprehended whether the criminal intercourse be discovered or not ii the injury to the family may be understood by the application of that infallible rule of doing to others what we would that others should do unto us let a father or a brother say for what consideration they would suffer this injury to a daughter or a sister and whether any or even a total loss of fortune could create equal affliction and distress and when they reflect upon this let them distinguish if they can between a robbery committed upon their property by fraud or forgery and the ruin of their happiness by the treachery of a seducer iii the public at large lose the benefit of the womans service in her proper place and destination as a wife and parent this to     the whole community may be little but it is often more than all the good which the seducer does to the community can recompense moreover prostitution is supplied by seduction and in proportion to the danger there is of the womans betaking herself after her first sacrifice to a life of public lewdness the seducer is answerable for the multiplied evils to which his crime gives birth upon the whole if we pursue the effects of seduction through the complicated misery which it occasions and if it be right to estimate crimes by the mischief they knowingly produce it will appear something more than mere invective to assert that not one half of the crimes for which men suffer death by the laws of england are so flagitious as this chapter   adultery a new sufferer is introduced the injured husband who receives a wound in his sensibility and affections the most painful and incurable that human nature knows in all other respects adultery on the part of the man who solicits the chastity of a married woman includes the crime of seduction and is attended with the same mischief the infidelity of the woman is aggravated by cruelty to her children who are generally involved in their parents shame and always made unhappy by their quarrel if it be said that these consequences are chargeable not so much upon the crime as the discovery we answer first that the crime     could not be discovered unless it were committed and that the commission is never secure from discovery and secondly that if we excuse adulterous connexions whenever they can hope to escape detection which is the conclusion to which this argument conducts us we leave the husband no other security for his wifes chastity than in her want of opportunity or temptation which would probably either deter men from marrying or render marriage a state of such jealousy and alarm to the husband as must end in the slavery and confinement of the wife the vow by which married persons mutually engage their fidelity is witnessed before god and accompanied with circumstances of solemnity and religion which approach to the nature of an oath the married offender therefore incurs a crime little short of perjury and the seduction of a married woman is little less than subornation of perjury—and this guilt is independent of the discovery all behaviour which is designed or which knowingly tends to captivate the affection of a married woman is a barbarous intrusion upon the peace and virtue of a family though it fall short of adultery the usual and only apology for adultery is the prior transgression of the other party there are degrees no doubt in this as in other crimes and so far as the bad effects of adultery are anticipated by the conduct of the husband or wife who offends first the guilt of the second offender is less but this falls very far short of a justification unless it could be shown that the obligation of the marriagevow depends upon the condition of reciprocal fidelity for which construction there appears no foundation either in expediency or in the terms of the promise or in the design of the legislature which prescribed the marriagerite moreover the rule contended for by this plea has a manifest tendency to multiply the offence but none to reclaim the offender     the way of considering the offence of one party as a provocation to the other and the other as only retaliating the injury by repeating the crime is a childish trifling with words thou shalt not commit adultery was an interdict delivered by god himself by the jewish law adultery was capital to both parties in the crime even he that committeth adultery with his neighbours wife the adulterer and adulteress shall surely be put to death—levit xx  0 which passages prove that the divine legislator placed a great difference between adultery and fornication and with this agree the christian scriptures for in almost all the catalogues they have left us of crimes and criminals they enumerate fornication adultery whoremongers adulterers matthew xv      cor vi   gal v   heb viii   by which mention of both they show that they did not consider them as the same but that the crime of adultery was in their apprehension distinct from and accumulated upon that of fornication the history of the woman taken in adultery recorded in the eighth chapter of st johns gospel has been thought by some to give countenance to that crime as christ told the woman neither do i condemn thee we must believe it is said that he deemed her conduct either not criminal or not a crime however of the heinous nature which we represent it to be a more attentive examination of the case will i think convince us that from it nothing can be concluded as to christs opinion concerning adultery either one way or the other the transaction is thus related early in the morning jesus came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst they say unto him master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act now moses in the law commanded that such should be stoned but what sayest thou     this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not so when they continued asking him he lift up himself and said unto them he that is without sin amongst you let him first cast a stone at her and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst when jesus had lift up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man   0 condemned thee she said unto him no man lord and he said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him to draw him that is into an exercise of judicial authority that they might have to accuse him before the roman governor of usurping or intermeddling with the civil government this was their design and christs behaviour throughout the whole affair proceeded from a knowledge of this design and a determination to defeat it he gives them at first a cold and sullen reception well suited to the insidious intention with which they came he stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not when they continued asking him when they teased him to speak he dismissed them with a rebuke which the impertinent malice of their errand as well as the sacred character of many of them deserved he that is without sin that is this sin among you let him first cast a stone at her this had its effect stung with the reproof and disappointed of their aim they stole away one by one and left jesus and the woman alone and then follows the conversation which is the part of the narrative most material to our present subject jesus said unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee she said no man lord and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more now when christ asked the woman hath no man condemned thee he certainly spoke and was understood by the woman to speak of a legal and judicial condemnation otherwise her answer no man lord was not true in every other sense of condemnation as blame censure reproof private judgement and the like many had condemned her all those indeed who brought her to jesus if then a judicial sentence was what christ meant by condemning in the question the common use of language requires us to suppose that he meant the same in his reply neither do i condemn thee ie i pretend to no judicial character or authority over thee it is no office or business of mine to pronounce or execute the sentence of the law when christ adds go and sin no more he in effect tells her that she had sinned already but as to the degree or quality of the sin or christs opinion concerning it nothing is declared or can be inferred either way adultery which was punished with death during the usurpation is now regarded by the law of england only as a civil injury for which the imperfect satisfaction that money can afford may be recovered by the husband chapter   incest in order to preserve chastity in families and between persons of different sexes brought up and living together in a state of unreserved intimacy it is necessary by every method possible to inculcate an abhorrence of incestuous conjunctions which abhorrence     can only be upholden by the absolute reprobation of all commerce of the sexes between near relations upon this principle the marriage as well as other cohabitations of brothers and sisters of lineal kindred and of all who usually live in the same family may be said to be forbidden by the law of nature restrictions which extend to remoter degrees of kindred than what this reason makes it necessary to prohibit from intermarriage are founded in the authority of the positive law which ordains them and can only be justified by their tendency to diffuse wealth to connect families or to promote some political advantage the levitical law which is received in this country and from which the rule of the roman law differs very little prohibits marriage between relations within three degrees of kindred computing the generations not from but through the common ancestor and accounting affinity the same as consanguinity the issue however of such marriages are not bastardised unless the parents be divorced during their lifetime the egyptians are said to have allowed of the marriage of brothers and sisters amongst the athenians a very singular regulation prevailed brothers and sisters of the halfblood if related by the fathers side might marry if by the mothers side they were prohibited from marrying the same custom also probably obtained in chaldea so early as the age in which abraham left it for he and sarah his wife stood in this relation to each other and yet indeed she is my sister she is the daughter of my father but not of my mother and she became my wife gen xx    chapter   polygamy     the equality in the number of males and females born into the world intimates the intention of god that one woman should be assigned to one man for if to one man be allowed an exclusive right to five or more women four or more men must be deprived of the exclusive possession of any which could never be the order intended it seems also a significant indication of the divine will that he at first created only one woman to one man had god intended polygamy for the species it is probable he would have begun with it especially as by giving to adam more wives than one the multiplication of the human race would have proceeded with a quicker progress polygamy not only violates the constitution of nature and the apparent design of the deity but produces to the parties themselves and to the public the following bad effects contests and jealousies amongst the wives of the same husband distracted affections or the loss of all affection in the husband himself a voluptuousness in the rich which dissolves the vigour of their intellectual as well as active faculties producing that indolence and imbecility both of mind and body which have long characterised the nations of the east the abasement of one half of the human species who in countries where polygamy obtains are     degraded into mere instruments of physical pleasure to the other half neglect of children and the manifold and sometimes unnatural mischiefs which arise from a scarcity of women to compensate for these evils polygamy does not offer a single advantage in the article of population which it has been thought to promote the community gain nothing for the question is not whether one man will have more children by five or more wives than by one but whether these five wives would not bear the same or a greater number of children to five separate husbands and as to the care of the children when produced and the sending of them into the world in situations in which they may be likely to form and bring up families of their own upon which the increase and succession of the human species in a great degree depend this is less provided for and less practicable where twenty or thirty children are to be supported by the attention and fortunes of one father than if they were divided into five or six families to each of which were assigned the industry and inheritance of two parents     whether simultaneous polygamy was permitted by the law of moses seems doubtful but whether permitted or not it was certainly practised by the jewish patriarchs both before that law and under it the permission if there were any might be like that of divorce for the hardness of their heart in condescension to their established indulgences rather than from the general rectitude or propriety of the thing itself the state of manners in judea had probably undergone a reformation in this respect before the time of christ for in the new testament we meet with no trace or mention of any such practice being tolerated for which reason and because it was likewise forbidden amongst the greeks and romans we cannot expect to find any express law upon the subject in the christian code the words of christ† matt xix   may be construed by an easy implication to prohibit polygamy for if whoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adultery he who marrieth another without putting away the first is no less guilty of adultery because the adultery does not consist in the repudiation of the first wife for however unjust or cruel that may be it is not adultery but in entering into a second marriage during the legal existence and obligation of the first the several passages in saint pauls writings which speak of marriage always suppose it to signify the union of one man with one woman upon this supposition he argues rom vii       know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband so then if while her husband     liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress when the same apostle permits marriage to his corinthian converts which for the present distress he judges to be inconvenient he restrains the permission to the marriage of one husband with one wife it is good for a man not to touch a woman nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband the manners of different countries have varied in nothing more than in their domestic constitutions less polished and more luxurious nations have either not perceived the bad effects of polygamy or if they did perceive them they who in such countries possessed the power of reforming the laws have been unwilling to resign their own gratifications polygamy is retained at this day among the turks and throughout every part of asia in which christianity is not professed in christian countries it is universally prohibited in sweden it is punished with death in england besides the nullity of the second marriage it subjects the offender to transportation or imprisonment and branding for the first offence and to capital punishment for the second and whatever may be said in behalf of polygamy when it is authorised by the law of the land the marriage of a second wife during the lifetime of the first in countries where such a second marriage is void must be ranked with the most dangerous and cruel of those frauds by which a woman is cheated out of her fortune her person and her happiness the ancient medes compelled their citizens in one canton to take seven wives in another each woman to receive five husbands according as war had made in one quarter of their country an extraordinary havoc among the men or the women had been carried away by an enemy from another this regulation so far as it was adapted to the proportion which subsisted between the number of males and females was founded in the reason upon which the most approved nations of europe proceed at present     caesar found amongst the inhabitants of this island a species of polygamy if it may be so called which was perfectly singular uxores says he habent deni duodenique inter se communes et maxime fratres cum fratribus parentesque cum liberis sed si qui sint ex his nati eorum habentur liberi quo primum virgo quaeque deducta est chapter   of divorce by divorce i mean the dissolution of the marriagecontract by the act and at the will of the husband this power was allowed to the husband among the jews the greeks and latter romans and is at this day exercised by the turks and persians the congruity of such a right with the law of nature is the question before us and in the first place it is manifestly inconsistent with the duty which the parents owe to their children which duty can never be so well fulfilled as by their cohabitation and united care it is also incompatible with the right which the mother possesses as well as the father to the gratitude of her children and the comfort of their society of both which she is almost necessarily deprived by her dismission from her husbands family where this objection does not interfere i know of no principle of the law of nature applicable to the question beside that of general expediency for if we say that arbitrary divorces are excluded by the terms of the marriagecontract it may be answered that the contract might be so framed as to admit of this condition if we argue with some moralists that the obligation of a contract naturally continues so long as the purpose which the     contracting parties had in view requires its continuance it will be difficult to show what purpose of the contract the care of children excepted should confine a man to a woman from whom he seeks to be loose if we contend with others that a contract cannot by the law of nature be dissolved unless the parties be replaced in the situation which each possessed before the contract was entered into we shall be called upon to prove this to be a universal or indispensable property of contracts i confess myself unable to assign any circumstance in the marriagecontract which essentially distinguishes it from other contracts or which proves that it contains what many have ascribed to it a natural incapacity of being dissolved by the consent of the parties at the option of one of them or either of them but if we trace the effects of such a rule upon the general happiness of married life we shall perceive reasons of expediency that abundantly justify the policy of those laws which refuse to the husband the power of divorce or restrain it to a few extreme and specific provocations and our principles teach us to pronounce that to be contrary to the law of nature which can be proved to be detrimental to the common happiness of the human species a lawgiver whose counsels are directed by views of general utility and obstructed by no local impediment would make the marriagecontract indissoluble during the joint lives of the parties for the sake of the following advantages i because this tends to preserve peace and concord between married persons by perpetuating their common interest and by inducing a necessity of mutual compliance there is great weight and substance in both these considerations an earlier termination of the union would produce a separate interest the wife would naturally look forward to the dissolution of the partnership and endeavour to draw to herself     a fund against the time when she was no longer to have access to the same resources this would beget peculation on one side and mistrust on the other evils which at present very little disturb the confidence of married life the second effect of making the union determinable only by death is not less beneficial it necessarily happens that adverse tempers habits and tastes oftentimes meet in marriage in which case each party must take pains to give up what offends and practise what may gratify the other a man and woman in love with each other do this insensibly but love is neither general nor durable and where that is wanting no lessons of duty no delicacy of sentiment will go half so far with the generality of mankind and womankind as this one intelligible reflection that they must each make the best of their bargain and that seeing they must either both be miserable or both share in the same happiness neither can find their own comfort but in promoting the pleasure of the other these compliances though at first extorted by necessity become in time easy and mutual and though less endearing than assiduities which take their rise from affection generally procure to the married pair a repose and satisfaction sufficient for their happiness ii because new objects of desire would be continually sought after if men could at will be released from their subsisting engagements suppose the husband to have once preferred his wife to all other women the duration of this preference cannot be trusted to possession makes a great difference and there is no other security against the invitations of novelty than the known impossibility of obtaining the object did the cause which brings the sexes together hold them together by the same force with which it first attracted them to each other or could the woman be restored to her personal integrity and to all the advantages of her virgin estate the power of divorce might be deposited in the hands of the husband with less danger of abuse or inconveniency but     constituted as mankind are and injured as the repudiated wife generally must be it is necessary to add a stability to the condition of married women more secure than the continuance of their husbands affection and to supply to both sides by a sense of duty and of obligation what satiety has impaired of passion and of personal attachment upon the whole the power of divorce is evidently and greatly to the disadvantage of the woman and the only question appears to be whether the real and permanent happiness of one half of the species should be surrendered to the caprice and voluptuousness of the other we have considered divorces as depending upon the will of the husband because that is the way in which they have actually obtained in many parts of the world but the same objections apply in a great degree to divorces by mutual consent especially when we consider the indelicate situation and small prospect of happiness which remains to the party who opposed his or her dissent to the liberty and desire of the other the law of nature admits of an exception in favour of the injured party in cases of adultery of obstinate desertion of attempts upon life of outrageous cruelty of incurable madness and perhaps of personal imbecility but by no means indulges the same privilege to mere dislike to opposition of humours and inclinations to contrariety of taste and temper to complaints of coldness neglect severity peevishness jealousy not that these reasons are trivial but because such objections may always be alleged and are impossible by testimony to be ascertained so that to allow implicit credit to them and to dissolve marriages whenever either party thought fit to pretend them would lead in its effect to all the licentiousness of arbitrary divorces miltons story is well known upon a quarrel with his wife he paid his addresses to another woman and set forth a public vindication of his conduct by attempting to prove that confirmed   0 dislike was as just a foundation for dissolving the marriagecontract as adultery to which position and to all the arguments by which it can be supported the above consideration affords a sufficient answer and if a married pair in actual and irreconcileable discord complain that their happiness would be better consulted by permitting them to determine a connexion which is become odious to both it may be told them that the same permission as a general rule would produce libertinism dissension and misery amongst thousands who are now virtuous and quiet and happy in their condition and it ought to satisfy them to reflect that when their happiness is sacrificed to the operation of an unrelenting rule it is sacrificed to the happiness of the community the scriptures seem to have drawn the obligation tighter than the law of nature left it whosoever saith christ shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery—matt xix   the law of moses for reasons of local expediency permitted the jewish husband to put away his wife but whether for every cause or for what causes appears to have been controverted amongst the interpreters of those times christ the precepts of whose religion were calculated for more general use and observation revokes this permission as given to the jews for the hardness of their hearts and promulges a law which was thenceforward to confine divorces to the single case of adultery in the wife and i see no sufficient reason to depart from the plain and strict meaning of christs words the rule was new it both surprised and offended his disciples yet christ added nothing to relax or explain it inferior causes may justify the separation of husband and wife although they will not authorise such a dissolution of the marriagecontract as would leave either party at liberty to marry again for it is that liberty in which the danger and mischief of divorces principally consist if the care of children does not require that     they should live together and it is become in the serious judgement of both necessary for their mutual happiness that they should separate let them separate by consent nevertheless this necessity can hardly exist without guilt and misconduct on one side or on both moreover cruelty ill usage extreme violence or moroseness of temper or other great and continued provocations make it lawful for the party aggrieved to withdraw from the society of the offender without his or her consent the law which imposes the marriagevow whereby the parties promise to keep to each other or in other words to live together must be understood to impose it with a silent reservation of these cases because the same law has constituted a judicial relief from the tyranny of the husband by the divorce à mensa et toro and by the provision which it makes for the separate maintenance of the injured wife st paul likewise distinguishes between a wifes merely separating herself from the family of her husband and her marrying again let not the wife depart from her husband but and if she do depart let her remain unmarried the law of this country in conformity to our saviours injunction confines the dissolution of the marriagecontract to the single case of adultery in the wife and a divorce even in that case can only be brought about by the operation of an act of parliament founded upon a previous sentence in the ecclesiastical court and a verdict against the adulterer at common law which proceedings taken together compose as complete an investigation of the complaint as a cause can receive it has lately been proposed to the legislature to annex a clause to these acts restraining the offending party from marrying with the companion of her crime who by the course of proceeding is always known and convicted for there is reason to fear that adulterous connexions are often formed with the prospect of bringing them to this conclusion at least when the seducer has once captivated the affection of a married woman he may avail     himself of this tempting argument to subdue her scruples and complete his victory and the legislature as the business is managed at present assists by its interposition the criminal design of the offenders and confers a privilege where it ought to inflict a punishment the proposal deserved an experiment but something more penal will i apprehend be found necessary to check the progress of this alarming depravity whether a law might not be framed directing the fortune of the adulteress to descend as in case of her natural death reserving however a certain proportion of the produce of it by way of annuity for her subsistence such annuity in no case to exceed a fixed sum and also so far suspending the estate in the hands of the heir as to preserve the inheritance to any children she might bear to a second marriage in case there was none to succeed in the place of their mother by the first whether i say such a law would not render female virtue in higher life less vincible as well as the seducers of that virtue less urgent in their suit we recommend to the deliberation of those who are willing to attempt the reformation of this important but most incorrigible class of the community a passion for splendor for expensive amusements and distinction is commonly found in that description of women who would become the objects of such a law not less inordinate than their other appetites a severity of the kind we propose applies immediately to that passion and there is no room for any complaint of injustice since the provisions above stated with others which might be contrived confine the punishment so far as it is possible to the person of the offender suffering the estate to remain to the heir or within the family of the ancestor from whom it came or to attend the appointments of his will sentences of the ecclesiastical courts which release the parties à vinculo matrimonii by reason of impuberty frigidity consanguinity within the prohibited degrees prior marriage or want of the requisite consent of parents and guardians are not dissolutions of     the marriagecontract but judicial declarations that there never was any marriage such impediment subsisting at the time as rendered the celebration of the marriagerite a mere nullity and the rite itself contains an exception of these impediments the man and woman to be married are charged if they know any impediment why they may not be lawfully joined together to confess it and assured that so many as are coupled together otherwise than gods word doth allow are not joined together by god neither is their matrimony lawful all which is intended by way of solemn notice to the parties that the vow they are about to make will bind their consciences and authorise their cohabitation only upon the supposition that no legal impediment exists chapter   marriage whether it hath grown out of some tradition of the divine appointment of marriage in the persons of our first parents or merely from a design to impress the obligation of the marriagecontract with a solemnity suited to its importance the marriagerite in almost all countries of the world has been made a religious ceremony although marriage in its own nature and abstracted from the rules and declarations which the jewish and christian scriptures deliver concerning it be properly a civil contract and nothing more with respect to one main article in matrimonial alliances a total alteration has taken place in the fashion of the world the wife     now brings money to her husband whereas anciently the husband paid money to the family of the wife as was the case among the jewish patriarchs the greeks and the old inhabitants of germany this alteration has proved of no small advantage to the female sex for their importance in point of fortune procures to them in modern times that assiduity and respect which are always wanted to compensate for the inferiority of their strength but which their personal attractions would not always secure our business is with marriage as it is established in this country and in treating thereof it will be necessary to state the terms of the marriage vow in order to discover   what duties this vow creates   what a situation of mind at the time is inconsistent with it   by what subsequent behaviour it is violated the husband promises on his part to love comfort honour and keep his wife the wife on hers to obey serve love honour and keep her husband in every variety of health fortune and condition and both stipulate to forsake all others and to keep only unto one another so long as they both shall live this promise is called the marriage vow is witnessed before god and the congregation accompanied with prayers to almighty god for his blessing upon it and attended with such circumstances of devotion and solemnity as place the obligation of it and the guilt of violating it nearly upon the same foundation with that of oaths the parties by this vow engage their personal fidelity expressly and specifically they engage likewise to consult and promote each others happiness the wife moreover promises obedience to her husband nature may have made and left the sexes of the human species nearly equal in their faculties and perfectly so in their     rights but to guard against those competitions which equality or a contested superiority is almost sure to produce the christian scriptures enjoin upon the wife that obedience which she here promises and in terms so peremptory and absolute that it seems to extend to every thing not criminal or not entirely inconsistent with the womans happiness let the wife says st paul be subject to her own husband in every thing the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit says the same apostle speaking of the duty of wives is in the sight of god of great price no words ever expressed the true merit of the female character so well as these the condition of human life will not permit us to say that no one can conscientiously marry who does not prefer the person at the altar to all other men or women in the world but we can have no difficulty in pronouncing whether we respect the end of the institution or the plain terms in which the contract is conceived that whoever is conscious at the time of his marriage of such a dislike to the woman he is about to marry or of such a subsisting attachment to some other woman that he cannot reasonably nor does in fact expect ever to entertain an affection for his future wife is guilty when he pronounces the marriage vow of a direct and deliberate prevarication and that too aggravated by the presence of those ideas of religion and of the supreme being which the place the ritual and the solemnity of the occasion cannot fail of bringing to his thoughts the same likewise of the woman this charge must be imputed to all who from mercenary motives marry the objects of their aversion and disgust and likewise to those who desert from any motive whatever the object of their affection and without being able to subdue that affection marry another the crime of falsehood is also incurred by the man who intends at the time of his marriage to commence renew or continue a personal commerce with any other woman and the parity of reason if a wife be capable of so much guilt extends to her     the marriagevow is violated i by adultery ii by any behaviour which knowingly renders the life of the other miserable as desertion neglect prodigality drunkenness peevishness penuriousness jealousy or any levity of conduct which administers occasion of jealousy a late regulation in the law of marriages in this country has made the consent of the father if he be living of the mother if she survive the father and remain unmarried or of guardians if both parents be dead necessary to the marriage of a person under twentyone years of age by the roman law the consent et avi et patris was required so long as they lived in france the consent of parents is necessary to the marriage of sons until they attain to thirty years of age of daughters until twentyfive in holland for sons till twentyfive for daughters till twenty and this distinction between the sexes appears to be well founded for a woman is usually as properly qualified for the domestic and interior duties of a wife or mother at eighteen as a man is for the world and the more arduous care of providing for a family at twentyone the constitution also of the human species indicates the same distinction chapter   of the duty of parents that virtue which confines its beneficence within the walls of a mans own house we have been accustomed to consider as little better than a more refined selfishness and yet it will be confessed that     the subject and matter of this class of duties are inferior to none in utility and importance and where it may be asked is virtue the most valuable but where it does the most good what duty is the most obligatory but that on which the most depends and where have we happiness and misery so much in our power or liable to be so affected by our conduct as in our own families it will also be acknowledged that the good order and happiness of the world are better upholden whilst each man applies himself to his own concerns and the care of his own family to which he is present than if every man from an excess of mistaken generosity should leave his own business to undertake his neighbours which he must always manage with less knowledge conveniency and success if therefore the low estimation of these virtues be well founded it must be owing not to their inferior importance but to some defect or impurity in the motive and indeed it cannot be denied that it is in the power of association so to unite our childrens interest with our own as that we shall often pursue both from the same motive place both in the same object and with as little sense of duty in one pursuit as in the other where this is the case the judgement above stated is not far from the truth and so often as we find a solicitous care of a mans own family in a total absence or extreme penury of every other virtue or interfering with other duties or directing its operation solely to the temporal happiness of the children placing that happiness in amusement and indulgence whilst they are young or in advancement of fortune when they grow up there is reason to believe that this is the case in this way the common opinion concerning these duties may be accounted for and defended if we look to the subject of them we perceive them to be indispensable if we regard the motive we find them often not very meritorious wherefore although a man seldom rises high in our esteem who has nothing to recommend him beside the care of his own family yet we always condemn the neglect of this duty with the utmost     severity both by reason of the manifest and immediate mischief which we see arising from this neglect and because it argues a want not only of parental affection but of those moral principles which ought to come in aid of that affection where it is wanting and if on the other hand our praise and esteem of these duties be not proportioned to the good they produce or to the indignation with which we resent the absence of them it is for this reason that virtue is the most valuable not where it produces the most good but where it is the most wanted which is not the case here because its place is often supplied by instincts or involuntary associations nevertheless the offices of a parent may be discharged from a consciousness of their obligation as well as other duties and a sense of this obligation is sometimes necessary to assist the stimulus of parental affection especially in stations of life in which the wants of a family cannot be supplied without the continual hard labour of the father and without his refraining from many indulgences and recreations which unmarried men of like condition are able to purchase where the parental affection is sufficiently strong or has fewer difficulties to surmount a principle of duty may still be wanted to direct and regulate its exertions for otherwise it is apt to spend and waste itself in a womanish fondness for the person of the child an improvident attention to his present ease and gratification a pernicious facility and compliance with his humours an excessive and superfluous care to provide the externals of happiness with little or no attention to the internal sources of virtue and satisfaction universally wherever a parents conduct is prompted or directed by a sense of duty there is so much virtue having premised thus much concerning the place which parental duties hold in the scale of human virtues we proceed to state and explain the duties themselves when moralists tell us that parents are bound to do all they can for their children they tell us more than is true for at that rate     every expense which might have been spared and every profit omitted which might have been made would be criminal the duty of parents has its limits like other duties and admits if not of perfect precision at least of rules definite enough for application these rules may be explained under the several heads of maintenance education and a reasonable provision for the childs happiness in respect of outward condition i maintenance the wants of children make it necessary that some person maintain them and as no one has a right to burthen others by his act it follows that the parents are bound to undertake this charge themselves beside this plain inference the affection of parents to their children if it be instinctive and the provision which nature has prepared in the person of the mother for the sustentation of the infant concerning the existence and design of which there can be no doubt are manifest indications of the divine will hence we learn the guilt of those who run away from their families or what is much the same in consequence of idleness or drunkenness throw them upon a parish or who leave them destitute at their death when by diligence and frugality they might have laid up a provision for their support also of those who refuse or neglect the care of their bastard offspring abandoning them to a condition in which they must either perish or become burthensome to others for the duty of maintenance like the reason upon which it is founded extends to bastards as well as to legitimate children the christian scriptures although they concern themselves little with maxims of prudence or oeconomy and much less authorise worldly mindedness or avarice have yet declared in explicit terms their judgement of the obligation of this duty if any provide not for his own especially for those of his own household he  00 hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel   tim v   he hath disgraced the christian profession and fallen short in a duty which even infidels acknowledge ii education education in the most extensive sense of the word may comprehend every preparation that is made in our youth for the sequel of our lives and in this sense i use it some such preparation is necessary for children of all conditions because without it they must be miserable and probably will be vicious when they grow up either from want of the means of subsistence or from want of rational and inoffensive occupation in civilised life every thing is effected by art and skill whence a person who is provided with neither and neither can be acquired without exercise and instruction will be useless and he that is useless will generally be at the same time mischievous to the community so that to send an uneducated child into the world is injurious to the rest of mankind it is little better than to turn out a mad dog or a wild beast into the streets in the inferior classes of the community this principle condemns the neglect of parents who do not inure their children betimes to labour and restraint by providing them with apprenticeships services or other regular employment but who suffer them to waste their youth in idleness and vagrancy or to betake themselves to some lazy trifling and precarious calling for the consequence of having thus tasted the sweets of natural liberty at an age when their passion and relish for it are at the highest is that they become incapable for the remainder of their lives of continued industry or of persevering attention to any thing spend their time in a miserable struggle between the importunity of want and the irksomeness of regular application and are prepared to embrace every expedient which presents a hope of supplying their necessities without confining them to the plough the loom the shop or the countinghouse  0  in the middle orders of society those parents are more reprehensible who neither qualify their children for a profession nor enable them to live without one and those in the highest who from indolence indulgence or avarice omit to procure their children those liberal attainments which are necessary to make them useful in the stations to which they are destined a man of fortune who permits his son to consume the season of education in hunting shooting or in frequenting horseraces assemblies or other unedifying if not vicious diversions defrauds the community of a benefactor and bequeaths them a nuisance some though not the same preparation for the sequel of their lives is necessary for youth of every description and therefore for bastards as well as for children of better expectations consequently they who leave the education of their bastards to chance contenting themselves with making provision for their subsistence desert half their duty iii a reasonable provision for the happiness of a child in respect of outward condition requires three things a situation suited to his habits and reasonable expectations a competent provision for the exigencies of that situation and a probable security for his virtue the first two articles will vary with the condition of the parent a situation somewhat approaching in rank and condition to the parents own or where that is not practicable similar to what other parents of like condition provide for their children bounds the reasonable as well as generally speaking the actual expectations of the child and therefore contains the extent of the parents obligation  0  hence a peasant satisfies his duty who sends out his children properly instructed for their occupation to husbandry or to any branch of manufacture clergymen lawyers physicians officers in the army or navy gentlemen possessing moderate fortunes of inheritance or exercising trade in a large or liberal way are required by the same rule to provide their sons with learned professions commissions in the army or navy places in public offices or reputable branches of merchandise providing a child with a situation includes a competent supply for the expenses of that situation until the profits of it enable the child to support himself noblemen and gentlemen of high rank and fortune may be bound to transmit an inheritance to the representatives of their family sufficient for their support without the aid of a trade or profession to which there is little hope that a youth who has been flattered with other expectations will apply himself with diligence or success in these parts of the world public opinion has assorted the members of the community into four or five general classes each class comprising a great variety of employments and professions the choice of which must be committed to the private discretion of the parent all that can be expected from parents as a duty and therefore the only rule which a moralist can deliver upon the  0  subject is that they endeavour to preserve their children in the class in which they are born that is to say in which others of similar expectations are accustomed to be placed and that they be careful to confine their hopes and habits of indulgence to objects which will continue to be attainable it is an illjudged thrift in some rich parents to bring up their sons to mean employments for the sake of saving the charge of a more expensive education for these sons when they become masters of their liberty and fortune will hardly continue in occupations by which they think themselves degraded and are seldom qualified for any thing better an attention in the first place to the exigencies of the childrens respective conditions in the world and a regard in the second place to their reasonable expectations always postponing the expectations to the exigencies when both cannot be satisfied ought to guide parents in the disposal of their fortunes after their death and these exigencies and expectations must be measured by the standard which custom has established for there is a certain appearance attendance establishment and mode of living which custom has annexed to the several ranks and orders of civil life and which compose what is called decency together with a certain  0  society and particular pleasures belonging to each class and a young person who is withheld from sharing in these for want of fortune can scarcely be said to have a fair chance for happiness the indignity and mortification of such a seclusion being what few tempers can bear or bear with contentment and as to the second consideration of what a child may reasonably expect from his parent he will expect what he sees all or most others in similar circumstances receive and we can hardly call expectations unreasonable which it is impossible to suppress by virtue of this rule a parent is justified in making a difference between his children according as they stand in greater or less need of the assistance of his fortune in consequence of the difference of their age or sex or of the situations in which they are placed or the various success which they have met with on account of the few lucrative employments which are left to the female sex and by consequence the little opportunity they have of adding to their income daughters ought to be the particular objects of a parents care and foresight and as an option of marriage from which they can reasonably expect happiness is not presented to every woman who deserves it especially in times in which a licentious celibacy is in fashion with the men a father should endeavour to enable his daughters to lead a single life with independence and decorum even though he subtract more for that purpose from the portions of his sons than is agreeable to modern usage or than they expect but when the exigencies of their several situations are provided for and not before a parent ought to admit the second consideration the satisfaction of his childrens expectations and upon that principle to prefer the eldest son to the rest and sons to daughters which constitutes the right and the whole right of primogeniture as well as the only reason for the preference of one sex to the other the preference indeed of the firstborn has  0  one public good effect that if the estate were divided equally amongst the sons it would probably make them all idle whereas by the present rule of descent it makes only one so which is the less evil of the two and it must further be observed on the part of the sons that if the rest of the community make it a rule to prefer sons to daughters an individual of that community ought to guide himself by the same rule upon principles of mere equality for as the son suffers by the rule in the fortune he may expect in marriage it is but reasonable that he should receive the advantage of it in his own inheritance indeed whatever the rule be as to the preference of one sex to the other marriage restores the equality and as money is generally more convertible to profit and more likely to promote industry in the hands of men than of women the custom of this country may properly be complied with when it does not interfere with the weightier reason explained in the last paragraph the point of the childrens actual expectations together with the expediency of subjecting the illicit commerce of the sexes to every discouragement which it can receive makes the difference between the claims of legitimate children and of bastards but neither reason will in any case justify the leaving of bastards to the world without provision education or profession or what is more cruel without the means of continuing in the situation to which the parent has introduced them which last is to leave them to inevitable misery after the first requisite namely a provision for the exigencies of his situation is satisfied a parent may diminish a childs portion in order to punish any flagrant crime or to punish contumacy and want of filial duty in instances not otherwise criminal for a child who is conscious of bad behaviour or of contempt of his parents will and happiness cannot reasonably expect the same instances of his munificence  0  a childs vices may be of that sort and his vicious habits so incorrigible as to afford much the same reason for believing that he will waste or misemploy the fortune put into his power as if he were mad or idiotish in which case a parent may treat him as a madman or an idiot that is may deem it sufficient to provide for his support by an annuity equal to his wants and innocent enjoyments and which he may be restrained from alienating this seems to be the only case in which a disinherison nearly absolute is justifiable let not a father hope to excuse an inofficious disposition of his fortune by alleging that every man may do what he will with his own all the truth which this expression contains is that this discretion is under no control of law and that his will however capricious will be valid this by no means absolves his conscience from the obligations of a parent or imports that he may neglect without injustice the several wants and expectations of his family in order to gratify a whim or pique or indulge a preference founded in no reasonable distinction of merit or situation although in his intercourse with his family and in the lesser endearments of domestic life a parent may not always resist his partiality to a favourite child which however should be both avoided and concealed as oftentimes productive of lasting jealousies and discontents yet when he sits down to make his will these tendernesses must give place to more manly deliberations a father of a family is bound to adjust his oeconomy with a view to these demands upon his fortune and until a sufficiency for these ends is acquired or in due time probably will be acquired for in human affairs probability ought to content us frugality and exertions of industry are duties he is also justified in the declining expensive liberality for to take from those who want in order to give to those who want adds nothing to the stock of public happiness thus far therefore and no farther the plea of children of  0  large families charity begins at home c is an excuse for parsimony and an answer to those who solicit our bounty beyond this point as the use of riches becomes less the desire of laying up should abate proportionably the truth is our children gain not so much as we imagine in the chance of this worlds happiness or even of its external prosperity by setting out in it with large capitals of those who have died rich a great part began with little and in respect of enjoyment there is no comparison between a fortune which a man acquires by wellapplied industry or by a series of successes in his business and one found in his possession or received from another a principal part of a parents duty is still behind viz the using of proper precautions and expedients in order to form and preserve his childrens virtue to us who believe that in one stage or other of our existence virtue will conduct to happiness and vice terminate in misery and who observe withal that mens virtues and vices are to a certain degree produced or affected by the management of their youth and the situations in which they are placed to all who attend to these reasons the obligation to consult a childs virtue will appear to differ in nothing from that by which the parent is bound to provide for his maintenance or fortune the childs interest is concerned in the one means of happiness as well as in the other and both means are equally and almost exclusively in the parents power for this purpose the first point to be endeavoured after is to impress upon children the idea of accountableness that is to accustom them to look forward to the consequences of their actions in another world which can only be brought about by the parents visibly acting with a view to these consequences themselves parents to do them justice are seldom sparing of lessons of virtue and religion in admonitions which cost little and which profit less whilst their example exhibits a continual contradiction of what they teach  0  a father for instance will with much solemnity and apparent earnestness warn his son against idleness excess in drinking debauchery and extravagance who himself loiters about all day without employment comes home every night drunk is made infamous in his neighbourhood by some profligate connexion and wastes the fortune which should support or remain a provision for his family in riot or luxury or ostentation or he will discourse gravely before his children of the obligation and importance of revealed religion whilst they see the most frivolous and oftentimes feigned excuses detain him from its reasonable and solemn ordinances or he will set before them perhaps the supreme and tremendous authority of almighty god that such a being ought not to be named or even thought upon without sentiments of profound awe and veneration this may be the lecture he delivers to his family one hour when the next if an occasion arise to excite his anger his mirth or his surprise they will hear him treat the name of the deity with the most irreverent profanation and sport with the terms and denunciations of the christian religion as if they were the language of some ridiculous and longexploded superstition now even a child is not to be imposed upon by such mockery he sees through the grimace of this counterfeited concern for virtue he discovers that his parent is acting a part and receives his admonitions as he would hear the same maxims from the mouth of a player and when once this opinion has taken possession of the childs mind it has a fatal effect upon the parents influence in all subjects even those in which he himself may be sincere and convinced whereas a silent but observable regard to the duties of religion in the parents own behaviour will take a sure and gradual hold of the childs disposition much beyond formal reproofs and chidings which being generally prompted by some present provocation discover more of anger than of principle and are always received with a temporary alienation and disgust  0  a good parents first care is to be virtuous himself his second to make his virtues as easy and engaging to those about him as their nature will admit virtue itself offends when coupled with forbidding manners and some virtues may be urged to such excess or brought forward so unseasonably as to discourage and repel those who observe and who are acted upon by them instead of exciting an inclination to imitate and adopt them young minds are particularly liable to these unfortunate impressions for instance if a fathers oeconomy degenerate into a minute and teasing parsimony it is odds but that the son who has suffered under it sets out a sworn enemy to all rules of order and frugality if a fathers piety be morose rigorous and tinged with melancholy perpetually breaking in upon the recreation of his family and surfeiting them with the language of religion on all occasions there is danger lest the son carry from home with him a settled prejudice against seriousness and religion as inconsistent with every plan of a pleasurable life and turn out when he mixes with the world a character of levity or dissoluteness something likewise may be done towards the correcting or improving of those early inclinations which children discover by disposing them into situations the least dangerous to their particular characters thus i would make choice of a retired life for young persons addicted to licentious pleasures of private stations for the proud and passionate of liberal professions and a townlife for the mercenary and sottish and not according to the general practice of parents send dissolute youths into the army penurious tempers to trade or make a crafty lad an attorney or flatter a vain and haughty temper with elevated names or situations or callings to which the fashion of the world has annexed precedency and distinction but in which his disposition without at all promoting his success will serve both to multiply and exasperate his disappointments in the same way that is with a view to the particular frame and tendency of the   0 pupils character i would make choice of a public or private education the reserved timid and indolent will have their faculties called forth and their nerves invigorated by a public education youths of strong spirits and passions will be safer in a private education at our public schools as far as i have observed more literature is acquired and more vice quick parts are cultivated slow ones are neglected under private tuition a moderate proficiency in juvenile learning is seldom exceeded but with more certainty attained chapter  0 the rights of parents the rights of parents result from their duties if it be the duty of a parent to educate his children to form them for a life of usefulness and virtue to provide for them situations needful for their subsistence and suited to their circumstances and to prepare them for those situations he has a right to such authority and in support of that authority to exercise such discipline as may be necessary for these purposes the law of nature acknowledges no other foundation of a parents right over his children besides his duty towards them i speak now of such rights as may be enforced by coercion this relation confers no property in their persons or natural dominion over them as is commonly supposed since it is in general necessary to determine the destination of children before they are capable of judging of their own happiness parents have a right to elect professions for them as the mother herself owes obedience to the father her authority must submit to his in a competition therefore of commands the father is to be obeyed in case of the death of either the authority as well as duty of both parents devolves upon the survivor     these rights always following the duty belong likewise to guardians and so much of them as is delegated by the parents or guardians belongs to tutors schoolmasters c from this principle that the rights of parents result from their duty it follows that parents have no natural right over the lives of their children as was absurdly allowed to roman fathers nor any to exercise unprofitable severities nor to command the commission of crimes for these rights can never be wanted for the purpose of a parents duty nor for the same reason have parents any right to sell their children into slavery upon which by the way we may observe that the children of slaves are not by the law of nature born slaves for as the masters right is derived to him through the parent it can never be greater than the parents own hence also it appears that parents not only pervert but exceed their just authority when they consult their own ambition interest or prejudice at the manifest expense of their childrens happiness of which abuse of parental power the following are instances the shutting up of daughters and younger sons in nunneries and monasteries in order to preserve entire the estate and dignity of the family or the using of any arts either of kindness or unkindness to induce them to make choice of this way of life themselves or in countries where the clergy are prohibited from marriage putting sons into the church for the same end who are never likely either to do or receive any good in it sufficient to compensate for this sacrifice the urging of children to marriages from which they are averse with the view of exalting or enriching the family or for the sake of connecting estates parties or interests or the opposing of a marriage in which the child would probably find his happiness from a motive of pride or avarice of family hostility or personal pique     chapter    the duty of children the duty of children may be considered i during childhood ii after they have attained to manhood but continue in their fathers family iii after they have attained to manhood and have left their fathers family i during childhood children must be supposed to have attained to some degree of discretion before they are capable of any duty there is an interval of eight or nine years between the dawning and the maturity of reason in which it is necessary to subject the inclination of children to many restraints and direct their application to many employments of the tendency and use of which they cannot judge for which cause the submission of children during this period must be ready and implicit with an exception however of any manifest crime which may be commanded them ii after they have attained to manhood but continue in their fathers family if children when they are grown up voluntarily continue members of their fathers family they are bound beside the general duty of gratitude to their parents to observe such regulations of the family as the father shall appoint contribute their labour to its support if required and confine themselves to such expenses as he shall allow the obligation would be the same if they were admitted into any other family or received support from any other hand iii after they have attained to manhood and have left their fathers family     in this state of the relation the duty to parents is simply the duty of gratitude not different in kind from that which we owe to any other benefactor in degree just so much exceeding other obligations by how much a parent has been a greater benefactor than any other friend the services and attentions by which filial gratitude may be testified can be comprised within no enumeration it will show itself in compliances with the will of the parents however contrary to the childs own taste or judgement provided it be neither criminal nor totally inconsistent with his happiness in a constant endeavour to promote their enjoyments prevent their wishes and soften their anxieties in small matters as well as in great in assisting them in their business in contributing to their support ease or better accommodation when their circumstances require it in affording them our company in preference to more amusing engagements in waiting upon their sickness or decrepitude in bearing with the infirmities of their health or temper with the peevishness and complaints the unfashionable negligent austere manners and offensive habits which often attend upon advanced years for where must old age find indulgence if it do not meet with it in the piety and partiality of children the most serious contentions between parents and their children are those commonly which relate to marriage or to the choice of a profession a parent has in no case a right to destroy his childs happiness if it be true therefore that there exist such personal and exclusive attachments between individuals of different sexes that the possession of a particular man or woman in marriage be really necessary for the childs happiness or if it be true that an aversion to a particular profession may be involuntary and unconquerable then it will follow that parents where this is the case ought not to urge their authority and that the child is not bound to obey it     the point is to discover how far in any particular instance this is the case whether the fondness of lovers ever continues with such intensity and so long that the success of their desires constitutes or the disappointment affects any considerable portion of their happiness compared with that of their whole life it is difficult to determine but there can be no difficulty in pronouncing that not one half of those attachments which young people conceive with so much haste and passion are of this sort i believe it also to be true that there are few aversions to a profession which resolution perseverance activity in going about the duty of it and above all despair of changing will not subdue yet there are some such wherefore a child who respects his parents judgement and is as he ought to be tender of their happiness owes at least so much deference to their will as to try fairly and faithfully in one case whether time and absence will not cool an affection which they disapprove and in the other whether a longer continuance in the profession which they have chosen for him may not reconcile him to it the whole depends upon the experiment being made on the childs part with sincerity and not merely with a design of compassing his purpose at last by means of a simulated and temporary compliance it is the nature of love and hatred and of all violent affections to delude the mind with a persuasion that we shall always continue to feel them as we feel them at present we cannot conceive that they will either change or cease experience of similar or greater changes in ourselves or a habit of giving credit to what our parents or tutors or books teach us may control this persuasion otherwise it renders youth very untractable for they see clearly and truly that it is impossible they should be happy under the circumstances proposed to them in their present state of mind after a sincere but ineffectual endeavour by the child to accommodate his inclination to his parents pleasure he ought not to suffer in his parents affection or in his fortunes the parent     when he has reasonable proof of this should acquiesce at all events the child is then at liberty to provide for his own happiness parents have no right to urge their children upon marriages to which they are averse nor ought in any shape to resent the childrens disobedience to such commands this is a different case from opposing a match of inclination because the childs misery is a much more probable consequence it being easier to live without a person that we love than with one whom we hate add to this that compulsion in marriage necessarily leads to prevarication as the reluctant party promises an affection which neither exists nor is expected to take place and parental like all human authority ceases at the point where obedience becomes criminal in the abovementioned and in all contests between parents and children it is the parents duty to represent to the child the consequences of his conduct and it will be found his best policy to represent them with fidelity it is usual for parents to exaggerate these descriptions beyond probability and by exaggeration to lose all credit with their children thus in a great measure defeating their own end parents are forbidden to interfere where a trust is reposed personally in the son and where consequently the son was expected and by virtue of that expectation is obliged to pursue his own judgement and not that of any other as is the case with judicial magistrates in the execution of their office with members of the legislature in their votes with electors where preference is to be given to certain prescribed qualifications the son may assist his own judgement by the advice of his father or of any one whom he chooses to consult but his own judgement whether it proceed upon knowledge or authority ought finally to determine his conduct the duty of children to their parents was thought worthy to be made the subject of one of the ten commandments and as such     is recognised by christ together with the rest of the moral precepts of the decalogue in various places of the gospel the same divine teachers sentiments concerning the relief of indigent parents appear sufficiently from that manly and deserved indignation with which he reprehended the wretched casuistry of the jewish expositors who under the name of a tradition had contrived a method of evading this duty by converting or pretending to convert to the treasury of the temple so much of their property as their distressed parent might be entitled by their law to demand agreeably to this law of nature and christianity children are by the law of england bound to support as well their immediate parents as their grandfather and grandmother or remoter ancestors who stand in need of support obedience to parents is enjoined by st paul to the ephesians children obey your parents in the lord for this is right and to the colossians children obey your parents in all things for this is wellpleasing unto the lord by the jewish law disobedience to parents was in some extreme cases capital deut xxi        book iv duties to ourselves this division of the subject is retained merely for the sake of method by which the writer and the reader are equally assisted to the subject itself it imports nothing for the obligation of all duties being fundamentally the same it matters little under what class or title any of them are considered in strictness there are few duties or crimes which terminate in a mans self and so far as others are affected by their operation they have been treated of in some article of the preceding book we have reserved however to this head the rights of selfdefence also the consideration of drunkenness and suicide as offences against that care of our faculties and preservation of our persons which we account duties and call duties to ourselves chapter   the rights of selfdefence it has been asserted that in a state of nature we might lawfully defend the most insignificant right provided it were a perfect determinate right by any extremities which the obstinacy of the aggressor rendered necessary of this i doubt because i doubt whether the general rule be worth sustaining at such an expense and because apart from the general consequence of yielding to the attempt it cannot be contended to be for the augmentation of human happiness that one man should lose his life or a limb rather than another a pennyworth of his property nevertheless     perfect rights can only be distinguished by their value and it is impossible to ascertain the value at which the liberty of using extreme violence begins the person attacked must balance as well as he can between the general consequence of yielding and the particular effect of resistance however this right if it exist in a state of nature is suspended by the establishment of civil society because thereby other remedies are provided against attacks upon our property and because it is necessary to the peace and safety of the community that the prevention punishment and redress of injuries be adjusted by public laws moreover as the individual is assisted in the recovery of his right or of a compensation for his right by the public strength it is no less equitable than expedient that he should submit to public arbitration the kind as well as the measure of the satisfaction which he is to obtain there is one case in which all extremities are justifiable namely when our life is assaulted and it becomes necessary for our preservation to kill the assailant this is evident in a state of nature unless it can be shown that we are bound to prefer the aggressors life to our own that is to say to love our enemy better than ourselves which can never be a debt of justice nor any where appears to be a duty of charity nor is the case altered by our living in civil society because by the supposition the laws of society cannot interpose to protect us nor by the nature of the case compel restitution this liberty is restrained to cases in which no other probable means of preserving our life remain as flight calling for assistance disarming the adversary c the rule holds whether the danger proceed from a voluntary attack as by an enemy robber or assassin or from an involuntary one as by a madman or person sinking in the water and dragging us after him or where two persons are reduced to a situation in which one or both of them must perish as in a shipwreck where two seize upon a plank which will support only one although to say the truth these extreme cases which happen     seldom and hardly when they do happen admit of moral agency are scarcely worth mentioning much less discussing at length the instance which approaches the nearest to the preservation of life and which seems to justify the same extremities is the defence of chastity in all other cases it appears to me the safest to consider the taking away of life as authorized by the law of the land and the person who takes it away as in the situation of a minister or executioner of the law in which view homicide in england is justifiable   to prevent the commission of a crime which when committed would be punishable with death thus it is lawful to shoot a highwayman or one attempting to break into a house by night but not so if the attempt be made in the daytime which particular distinction by a consent of legislation that is remarkable obtained also in the jewish law as well as in the laws both of greece and rome   in necessary endeavours to carry the law into execution as in suppressing riots apprehending malefactors preventing escapes c i do not know that the law holds forth its authority to any cases besides those which fall within one or other of the above descriptions or that after the exception of immediate danger to life or chastity the destruction of a human being can be innocent without that authority the rights of war are not here taken into the account chapter   drunkenness drunkenness is either actual or habitual just as it is one thing to be drunk and another to be a drunkard what we shall deliver upon the subject must principally be understood of a habit of intemperance although part of the guilt and danger described may be   0 applicable to casual excesses and all of it in a certain degree forasmuch as every habit is only a repetition of single instances the mischief of drunkenness from which we are to compute the guilt of it consists in the following bad effects   it betrays most constitutions either to extravagances of anger or sins of lewdness   it disqualifies men for the duties of their station both by the temporary disorder of their faculties and at length by a constant incapacity and stupefaction   it is attended with expenses which can often be ill spared   it is sure to occasion uneasiness to the family of the drunkard   it shortens life to these consequences of drunkenness must be added the peculiar danger and mischief of the example drunkenness is a social festive vice apt beyond any vice that can be mentioned to draw in others by the example the drinker collects his circle the circle naturally spreads of those who are drawn within it many become the corrupters and centres of sets and circles of their own every one countenancing and perhaps emulating the rest till a whole neighbourhood be infected from the contagion of a single example this account is confirmed by what we often observe of drunkenness that it is a local vice found to prevail in certain countries in certain districts of a country or in particular towns without any reason to be given for the fashion but that it had been introduced by some popular examples with this observation upon the spreading quality of drunkenness let us connect a remark which belongs to the several evil effects above recited the consequences of a vice like the symptoms of a disease though they be all enumerated in the description seldom all meet in the same subject in the instance under consideration the age and temperature of one drunkard may have little to fear from inflammations of lust or anger the fortune of a second may not be injured by the     expense a third may have no family to be disquieted by his irregularities and a fourth may possess a constitution fortified against the poison of strong liquors but if as we always ought to do we comprehend within the consequences of our conduct the mischief and tendency of the example the above circumstances however fortunate for the individual will be found to vary the guilt of his intemperance less probably than he supposes the moralist may expostulate with him thus although the waste of time and of money be of small importance to you it may be of the utmost to some one or other whom your society corrupts repeated or longcontinued excesses which hurt not your health may be fatal to your companion although you have neither wife nor child nor parent to lament your absence from home or expect your return to it with terror other families in which husbands and fathers have been invited to share in your ebriety or encouraged to imitate it may justly lay their misery or ruin at your door this will hold good whether the person seduced be seduced immediately by you or the vice be propagated from you to him through several intermediate examples all these considerations it is necessary to assemble to judge truly of a vice which usually meets with milder names and more indulgence than it deserves i omit those outrages upon one another and upon the peace and safety of the neighbourhood in which drunken revels often end and also those deleterious and maniacal effects which strong liquors produce upon particular constitutions because in general propositions concerning drunkenness no consequences should be included but what are constant enough to be generally expected drunkenness is repeatedly forbidden by saint paul be not drunk with wine wherein is excess let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness be not deceived neither fornicators nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god eph v    rom xiii      cor vi    0     the same apostle likewise condemns drunkenness as peculiarly inconsistent with the christian profession they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober   thess v     we are not concerned with the argument the words amount to a prohibition of drunkenness and the authority is conclusive it is a question of some importance how far drunkenness is an excuse for the crimes which the drunken person commits in the solution of this question we will first suppose the drunken person to be altogether deprived of moral agency that is to say of all reflection and foresight in this condition it is evident that he is no more capable of guilt than a madman although like him he may be extremely mischievous the only guilt with which he is chargeable was incurred at the time when he voluntarily brought himself into this situation and as every man is responsible for the consequences which he foresaw or might have foreseen and for no other this guilt will be in proportion to the probability of such consequences ensuing from which principle results the following rule viz that the guilt of any action in a drunken man bears the same proportion to the guilt of the like action in a sober man that the probability of its being the consequence of drunkenness bears to absolute certainty by virtue of this rule those vices which are the known effects of drunkenness either in general or upon particular constitutions are in all or in men of such constitutions nearly as criminal as if committed with all their faculties and senses about them if the privation of reason be only partial the guilt will be of a mixed nature for so much of his selfgovernment as the drunkard retains he is as responsible then as at any other time he is entitled to no abatement beyond the strict proportion in which his moral faculties are impaired now i call the guilt of the crime if a sober man had committed it the whole guilt a person in the condition     we describe incurs part of this at the instant of perpetration and by bringing himself into such a condition he incurred that fraction of the remaining part which the danger of this consequence was of an integral certainty for the sake of illustration we are at liberty to suppose that a man loses half his moral faculties by drunkenness this leaving him but half his responsibility he incurs when he commits the action half of the whole guilt we will also suppose that it was known beforehand that it was an even chance or half a certainty that this crime would follow his getting drunk this makes him chargeable with half of the remainder so that altogether he is responsible in three fourths of the guilt which a sober man would have incurred by the same action i do not mean that any real case can be reduced to numbers or the calculation be ever made with arithmetical precision but these are the principles and this the rule by which our general admeasurement of the guilt of such offences should be regulated the appetite for intoxicating liquors appears to me to be almost always acquired one proof of which is that it is apt to return only at particular times and places as after dinner in the evening on the marketday at the markettown in such a company at such a tavern and this may be the reason that if a habit of drunkenness be ever overcome it is upon some change of place situation company or profession a man sunk deep in a habit of drunkenness will upon such occasions as these when he finds himself loosened from the associations which held him fast sometimes make a plunge and get out in a matter of so great importance it is well worth while where it is in any degree practicable to change our habitation and society for the sake of the experiment habits of drunkenness commonly take their rise either from a fondness for and connexion with some company or some companion already addicted to this practice which affords an almost irresistible invitation to take a share in the indulgences which those     about us are enjoying with so much apparent relish and delight or from want of regular employment which is sure to let in many superfluous cravings and customs and often this amongst the rest or lastly from grief or fatigue both which strongly solicit that relief which inebriating liquors administer and also furnish a specious excuse for complying with the inclination but the habit when once set in is continued by different motives from those to which it owes its origin persons addicted to excessive drinking suffer in the intervals of sobriety and near the return of their accustomed indulgence a faintness and oppression circa praecordia which it exceeds the ordinary patience of human nature to endure this is usually relieved for a short time by a repetition of the same excess and to this relief as to the removal of every longcontinued pain they who have once experienced it are urged almost beyond the power of resistance this is not all as the liquor loses its stimulus the dose must be increased to reach the same pitch of elevation or ease which increase proportionably accelerates the progress of all the maladies that drunkenness brings on whoever reflects upon the violence of the craving in the advanced stages of the habit and the fatal termination to which the gratification of it leads will the moment he perceives in himself the first symptoms of a growing inclination to intemperance collect his resolution to this point or what perhaps he will find his best security arm himself with some peremptory rule as to the times and quantity of his indulgences i own myself a friend to the laying down of rules to ourselves of this sort and rigidly abiding by them they may be exclaimed against as stiff but they are often salutary indefinite resolutions of abstemiousness are apt to yield to extraordinary occasions and extraordinary occasions to occur perpetually whereas the stricter the rule is the more tenacious we grow of it and many a man will abstain rather than break his rule who would not easily be brought to exercise the same mortification from     higher motives not to mention that when our rule is once known we are provided with an answer to every importunity there is a difference no doubt between convivial intemperance and that solitary sottishness which waits neither for company nor invitation but the one i am afraid commonly ends in the other and this last in the basest degradation to which the faculties and dignity of human nature can be reduced chapter   suicide there is no subject in morality in which the consideration of general consequences is more necessary than in this of suicide particular and extreme cases of suicide may be imagined and may arise of which it would be difficult to assign the particular mischief or from that consideration alone to demonstrate the guilt and these cases have been the chief occasion of confusion and doubtfulness in the question albeit this is no more than what is sometimes true of the most acknowledged vices i could propose many possible cases even of murder which if they were detached from the general rule and governed by their own particular consequences alone it would be no easy undertaking to prove criminal the true question in this argument is no other than this may every man who chooses to destroy his life innocently do so limit and distinguish the subject as you can it will come at last to this question for shall we say that we are then at liberty to commit suicide when we find our continuance in life become useless to mankind any one who pleases may make himself useless and melancholy minds are prone to think themselves useless when they really are not so suppose a law were promulgated allowing each private     person to destroy every man he met whose longer continuance in the world he judged to be useless who would not condemn the latitude of such a rule who does not perceive that it amounts to a permission to commit murder at pleasure a similar rule regulating the rights over our own lives would be capable of the same extension beside which no one is useless for the purpose of this plea but he who has lost every capacity and opportunity of being useful together with the possibility of recovering any degree of either which is a state of such complete destitution and despair as cannot i believe be predicated of any man living or rather shall we say that to depart voluntarily out of life is lawful for those alone who leave none to lament their death if this consideration is to be taken into the account at all the subject of debate will be not whether there are any to sorrow for us but whether their sorrow for our death will exceed that which we should suffer by continuing to live now this is a comparison of things so indeterminate in their nature capable of so different a judgement and concerning which the judgement will differ so much according to the state of the spirits or the pressure of any present anxiety that it would vary little in hypochondriacal constitutions from an unqualified licence to commit suicide whenever the distresses which men felt or fancied rose high enough to overcome the pain and dread of death men are never tempted to destroy themselves but when under the oppression of some grievous uneasiness the restrictions of the rule therefore ought to apply to these cases but what effect can we look for from a rule which proposes to weigh our pain against that of another the misery that is felt against that which is only conceived and in so corrupt a balance as the partys own distempered imagination in like manner whatever other rule you assign it will ultimately bring us to an indiscriminate toleration of suicide in all cases in which there is danger of its being committed it remains     therefore to inquire what would be the effect of such a toleration evidently the loss of many lives to the community of which some might be useful or important the affliction of many families and the consternation of all for mankind must live in continual alarm for the fate of their friends and dearest relations when the restraints of religion and morality are withdrawn when every disgust which is powerful enough to tempt men to suicide shall be deemed sufficient to justify it and when the follies and vices as well as the inevitable calamities of human life so often make existence a burthen a second consideration and perfectly distinct from the former is this by continuing in the world and in the exercise of those virtues which remain within our power we retain the opportunity of meliorating our condition in a future state this argument it is true does not in strictness prove suicide to be a crime but if it supply a motive to dissuade us from committing it it amounts to much the same thing now there is no condition in human life which is not capable of some virtue active or passive even piety and resignation under the sufferings to which we are called testify a trust and acquiescence in the divine counsels more acceptable perhaps than the most prostrate devotion afford an edifying example to all who observe them and may hope for a recompense among the most arduous of human virtues these qualities are always in the power of the miserable indeed of none but the miserable the two considerations above stated belong to all cases of suicide whatever beside which general reasons each case will be aggravated by its own proper and particular consequences by the duties that are deserted by the claims that are defrauded by the loss affliction or disgrace which our death or the manner of it causes our family kindred or friends by the occasion we give to many to suspect the sincerity of our moral and religious professions and together with ours those of all others by the reproach we draw     upon our order calling or sect in a word by a great variety of evil consequences attending upon peculiar situations with some or other of which every actual case of suicide is chargeable i refrain from the common topics of deserting our post throwing up our trust rushing uncalled into the presence of our maker with some others of the same sort not because they are common for that rather affords a presumption in their favour but because i do not perceive in them much argument to which an answer may not easily be given hitherto we have pursued upon the subject the light of nature alone taking however into the account the expectation of a future existence without which our reasoning upon this as indeed all reasoning upon moral questions is vain we proceed to inquire whether any thing is to be met with in scripture which may add to the probability of the conclusions we have been endeavouring to support and here i acknowledge that there is to be found neither any express determination of the question nor sufficient evidence to prove that the case of suicide was in the contemplation of the law which prohibited murder any inference therefore which we deduce from scripture can be sustained only by construction and implication that is to say although they who were authorised to instruct mankind have not decided a question which never so far as appears to us came before them yet i think they have left enough to constitute a presumption how they would have decided it had it been proposed or thought of what occurs to this purpose is contained in the following observations   human life is spoken of as a term assigned or prescribed to us let us run with patience the race that is set before us—i have finished my course—that i may finish my course with joy—ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of god ye might receive the promise—these expressions appear to me     inconsistent with the opinion that we are at liberty to determine the duration of our lives for ourselves if this were the case with what propriety could life be called a race that is set before us or which is the same thing our course that is the course set out or appointed to us the remaining quotation is equally strong that after ye have done the will of god ye might receive the promise the most natural meaning that can be given to the words after ye have done the will of god is after ye have discharged the duties of life so long as god is pleased to continue you in it according to which interpretation the text militates strongly against suicide and they who reject this paraphrase will please to propose a better   there is not one quality which christ and his apostles inculcate upon their followers so often or so earnestly as that of patience under affliction now this virtue would have been in a great measure superseded and the exhortations to it might have been spared if the disciples of his religion had been at liberty to quit the world as soon as they grew weary of the ill usage which they received in it when the evils of life pressed sore they were to look forward to a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory they were to receive them as chastenings of the lord as intimations of his care and love by these and the like reflections they were to support and improve themselves under their sufferings but not a hint has any where escaped of seeking relief in a voluntary death the following text in particular strongly combats all impatience of distress of which the greatest is that which prompts to acts of suicide consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds i would offer my comment upon this passage in these two queries first whether a christian convert who had been impelled by the continuance and urgency of his sufferings to destroy his own life would not have been thought by the author of this text to have been weary to have fainted in his mind to have fallen off from   0 that example which is here proposed to the meditation of christians in distress and yet secondly whether such an act would not have been attended with all the circumstances of mitigation which can excuse or extenuate suicide at this day   the conduct of the apostles and of the christians of the apostolic age affords no obscure indication of their sentiments upon this point they lived we are sure in a confirmed persuasion of the existence as well as of the happiness of a future state they experienced in this world every extremity of external injury and distress to die was gain the change which death brought with it was in their expectation infinitely beneficial yet it never that we can find entered into the intention of one of them to hasten this change by an act of suicide from which it is difficult to say what motive could have so universally withheld them except an apprehension of some unlawfulness in the expedient having stated what we have been able to collect in opposition to the lawfulness of suicide by way of direct proof it seems unnecessary to open a separate controversy with all the arguments which are made use of to defend it which would only lead us into a repetition of what has been offered already the following argument however being somewhat more artificial and imposing than the rest as well as distinct from the general consideration of the subject cannot so properly be passed over if we deny to the individual a right over his own life it seems impossible it is said to reconcile with the law of nature that right which the state claims and exercises over the lives of its subjects when it ordains or inflicts capital punishments for this right like all other just authority in the state can only be derived from the compact and virtual consent of the citizens which compose the state and it seems selfevident if any principle in morality be so that no one by his consent can transfer to another a right which he does not possess himself it will be equally difficult to account for the power of the state to commit     its subjects to the dangers of war and to expose their lives without scruple in the field of battle especially in offensive hostilities in which the privileges of selfdefence cannot be pleaded with any appearance of truth and still more difficult to explain how in such or in any circumstances prodigality of life can be a virtue if the preservation of it be a duty of our nature this whole reasoning sets out from one error namely that the state acquires its right over the life of the subject from the subjects own consent as a part of what originally and personally belonged to himself and which he has made over to his governors the truth is the state derives this right neither from the consent of the subject nor through the medium of that consent but as i may say immediately from the donation of the deity finding that such a power in the sovereign of the community is expedient if not necessary for the community itself it is justly presumed to be the will of god that the sovereign should possess and exercise it it is this presumption which constitutes the right it is the same indeed which constitutes every other and if there were the like reasons to authorise the presumption in the case of private persons suicide would be as justifiable as war or capital executions but until it can be shown that the power over human life may be converted to the same advantage in the hands of individuals over their own as in those of the state over the lives of its subjects and that it may be intrusted with equal safety to both there is no room for arguing from the existence of such a right in the latter to the toleration of it in the former         book v duties towards god chapter   division of these duties in one sense every duty is a duty towards god since it is his will which makes it a duty but there are some duties of which god is the object as well as the author and these are peculiarly and in a more appropriated sense called duties towards god that silent piety which consists in a habit of tracing out the creators wisdom and goodness in the objects around us or in the history of his dispensations of referring the blessings we enjoy to his bounty and of resorting in our distresses to his succour may possibly be more acceptable to the deity than any visible expressions of devotion whatever yet these latter which although they may be excelled are not superseded by the former compose the only part of the subject which admits of direction or disquisition from a moralist our duty towards god so far as it is external is divided into worship and reverence god is the immediate object of both and the difference between them is that the one consists in action the other in forbearance when we go to church on the lords day led thither by a sense of duty towards god we perform an act of worship when from the same motive we rest in a journey upon that day we discharge a duty of reverence divine worship is made up of adoration thanksgiving and prayer but as what we have to offer concerning the two former     may be observed of prayer we shall make that the title of the following chapters and the direct subject of our consideration chapter   of the duty and of the efficacy of prayer so far as the same appear from the light of nature when one man desires to obtain any thing of another he betakes himself to entreaty and this may be observed of mankind in all ages and countries of the world now what is universal may be called natural and it seems probable that god as our supreme governor should expect that towards himself which by a natural impulse or by the irresistible order of our constitution he has prompted us to pay to every other being on whom we depend the same may be said of thanksgiving prayer likewise is necessary to keep up in the minds of mankind a sense of gods agency in the universe and of their own dependency upon him yet after all the duty of prayer depends upon its efficacy for i confess myself unable to conceive how any man can pray or be obliged to pray who expects nothing from his prayers but who is persuaded at the time he utters his request that it cannot possibly produce the smallest impression upon the being to whom it is addressed or advantage to himself now the efficacy of prayer imports that we obtain something in consequence of praying which we should not have received without prayer against all expectation of which the following objection has been often and seriously alleged if it be most agreeable to perfect wisdom and justice that we should receive what we desire god as perfectly wise and just     will give it to us without asking if it be not agreeable to these attributes of his nature our entreaties cannot move him to give it us and it were impious to expect that they should in fewer words thus if what we request be fit for us we shall have it without praying if it be not fit for us we cannot obtain it by praying this objection admits but of one answer namely that it may be agreeable to perfect wisdom to grant that to our prayers which it would not have been agreeable to the same wisdom to have given us without praying for but what virtue you will ask is there in prayer which should make a favour consistent with wisdom which would not have been so without it to this question which contains the whole difficulty attending the subject the following possibilities are offered in reply   a favour granted to prayer may be more apt on that very account to produce good effects upon the person obliged it may hold in the divine bounty what experience has raised into a proverb in the collation of human benefits that what is obtained without asking is oftentimes received without gratitude   it may be consistent with the wisdom of the deity to withhold his favours till they be asked for as an expedient to encourage devotion in his rational creation in order thereby to keep up and circulate a knowledge and sense of their dependency upon him   prayer has a natural tendency to amend the petitioner himself and thus to bring him within the rules which the wisdom of the deity has prescribed to the dispensation of his favours if these or any other assignable suppositions serve to remove the apparent repugnancy between the success of prayer and the character of the deity it is enough for the question with the petitioner is not from which out of many motives god may grant his petition or in what particular manner he is moved by the supplications of his creatures but whether it be consistent with his nature to be moved at all and whether there be any conceivable motive     which may dispose the divine will to grant the petitioner what he wants in consequence of his praying for it it is sufficient for the petitioner that he gain his end it is not necessary to devotion perhaps not very consistent with it that the circuit of causes by which his prayers prevail should be known to the petitioner much less that they should be present to his imagination at the time all that is necessary is that there be no impossibility apprehended in the matter thus much must be conceded to the objection that prayer cannot reasonably be offered to god with all the same views with which we oftentimes address our entreaties to men views which are not commonly or easily separated from it viz to inform them of our wants and desires to tease them out by importunity to work upon their indolence or compassion in order to persuade them to do what they ought to have done before or ought not to do at all but suppose there existed a prince who was known by his subjects to act of his own accord always and invariably for the best the situation of a petitioner who solicited a favour or pardon from such a prince would sufficiently resemble ours and the question with him as with us would be whether the character of the prince being considered there remained any chance that he should obtain from him by prayer what he would not have received without it i do not conceive that the character of such a prince would necessarily exclude the effect of his subjects prayers for when that prince reflected that the earnestness and humility of the supplication had generated in the suppliant a frame of mind upon which the pardon or favour asked would produce a permanent and active sense of gratitude that the granting of it to prayer would put others upon praying to him and by that means preserve the love and submission of his subjects upon which love and submission their own happiness as well as his glory depended that beside that the memory of the particular kindness would be heightened and prolonged by the anxiety with which it had been sued for prayer     had in other respects so disposed and prepared the mind of the petitioner as to render capable of future services him who before was unqualified for any might not that prince i say although he proceeded upon no other considerations than the strict rectitude and expediency of the measure grant a favour or pardon to this man which he did not grant to another who was too proud too lazy or too busy too indifferent whether he received it or not or too insensible of the sovereigns absolute power to give or to withhold it ever to ask for it or even to the philosopher who from an opinion of the fruitlessness of all addresses to a prince of the character which he had formed to himself refused in his own example and discouraged in others all outward returns of gratitude acknowledgements of duty or application to the sovereigns mercy or bounty the disuse of which seeing affections do not long subsist which are never expressed was followed by a decay of loyalty and zeal amongst his subjects and threatened to end in a forgetfulness of his rights and a contempt of his authority these together with other assignable considerations and some perhaps inscrutable and even inconceivable by the persons upon whom his will was to be exercised might pass in the mind of the prince and move his counsels whilst nothing in the mean time dwelt in the petitioners thoughts but a sense of his own grief and wants of the power and goodness from which alone he was to look for relief and of his obligation to endeavour by future obedience to render that person propitious to his happiness in whose hands and at the disposal of whose mercy he found himself to be the objection to prayer supposes that a perfectly wise being must necessarily be inexorable but where is the proof that inexorability is any part of perfect wisdom especially of that wisdom which is explained to consist in bringing about the most beneficial ends by the wisest means the objection likewise assumes another principle which is attended with considerable difficulty and obscurity namely that     upon every occasion there is one and only one mode of acting for the best and that the divine will is necessarily determined and confined to that mode both which positions presume a knowledge of universal nature much beyond what we are capable of attaining indeed when we apply to the divine nature such expressions as these god must always do what is right god cannot from the moral perfection and necessity of his nature act otherwise than for the best we ought to apply them with much indeterminateness and reserve or rather we ought to confess that there is something in the subject out of the reach of our apprehension for in our apprehension to be under a necessity of acting according to any rule is inconsistent with free agency and it makes no difference which we can understand whether the necessity be internal or external or that the rule is the rule of perfect rectitude but efficacy is ascribed to prayer without the proof we are told which can alone in such a subject produce conviction—the confirmation of experience concerning the appeal to experience i shall content myself with this remark that if prayer were suffered to disturb the order of second causes appointed in the universe too much or to produce its effects with the same regularity that they do it would introduce a change into human affairs which in some important respects would be evidently for the worse who for example would labour if his necessities could be supplied with equal certainty by prayer how few would contain within any bounds of moderation those passions and pleasures which at present are checked only by disease or the dread of it if prayer would infallibly restore health in short if the efficacy of prayer were so constant and observable as to be relied upon beforehand it is easy to foresee that the conduct of mankind would in proportion to that reliance become careless and disorderly it is possible in the nature of things that our prayers may in many instances be efficacious and yet our experience of their efficacy be dubious and     obscure therefore if the light of nature instruct us by any other arguments to hope for effect from prayer still more if the scriptures authorise these hopes by promises of acceptance it seems not a sufficient reason for calling in question the reality of such effects that our observations of them are ambiguous especially since it appears probable that this very ambiguity is necessary to the happiness and safety of human life but some whose objections do not exclude all prayer are offended with the mode of prayer in use amongst us and with many of the subjects which are almost universally introduced into public worship and recommended to private devotion to pray for particular favours by name is to dictate it has been said to divine wisdom and goodness to intercede for others especially for whole nations and empires is still worse it is to presume that we possess such an interest with the deity as to be able by our applications to bend the most important of his counsels and that the happiness of others and even the prosperity of communities is to depend upon this interest and upon our choice now how unequal soever our knowledge of the divine oeconomy may be to the solution of this difficulty which requires perhaps a comprehension of the entire plan and of all the ends of gods moral government to explain satisfactorily we can understand one thing concerning it that it is after all nothing more than the making of one man the instrument of happiness and misery to another which is perfectly of a piece with the course and order that obtain and which we must believe were intended to obtain in human affairs why may we not be assisted by the prayers of other men who are beholden for our support to their labour why may not our happiness be made in some cases to depend upon the intercession as it certainly does in many upon the good offices of our neighbours the happiness and misery of great numbers we see oftentimes at the disposal of one mans choice or liable to be much affected by his conduct   0 what greater difficulty is there in supposing that the prayers of an individual may avert a calamity from multitudes or be accepted to the benefit of whole communities chapter   of the duty and efficacy of prayer as represented in scripture the reader will have observed that the reflections stated in the preceding chapter whatever truth and weight they may be allowed to contain rise many of them no higher than to negative arguments in favour of the propriety of addressing prayer to god to prove that the efficacy of prayers is not inconsistent with the attributes of the deity does not prove that prayers are actually efficacious and in the want of that unequivocal testimony which experience alone could afford to this point but which we do not possess and have seen good reason why we are not to expect the light of nature leaves us to controverted probabilities drawn from the impulse by which mankind have been almost universally prompted to devotion and from some beneficial purposes which it is conceived may be better answered by the audience of prayer than by any other mode of communicating the same blessings the revelations which we deem authentic completely supply this defect of natural religion they require prayer to god as a duty and they contain positive assurance of its efficacy and acceptance we could have no reasonable motive for the exercise of prayer without believing that it may avail to the relief of our wants this belief can only be founded either in a sensible experience of the effect of prayer or in promises of acceptance signified by divine authority our knowledge would have come to us in the former way less capable indeed of doubt but subjected to the abuses and     inconveniences briefly described above in the latter way that is by authorised significations of gods general disposition to hear and answer the devout supplications of his creatures we are encouraged to pray but not to place such a dependence upon prayer as might relax other obligations or confound the order of events and of human expectations the scriptures not only affirm the propriety of prayer in general but furnish precepts or examples which justify some topics and some modes of prayer that have been thought exceptionable and as the whole subject rests so much upon the foundation of scripture i shall put down at length texts applicable to the five following heads to the duty and efficacy of prayer in general of prayer for particular favours by name for public national blessings of intercession for others of the repetition of unsuccessful prayers   texts enjoining prayer in general ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find—if ye being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him—watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all those things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man—serving the lord rejoicing in hope patient in tribulation continuing instant in prayer—be careful for nothing but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god—i will therefore that men pray every where lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting—pray without ceasing matt vii      luke xxi    rom xii    philipp iv     thess v      tim ii   add to these that christs reproof of the ostentation and prolixity of pharisaical prayers and his recommendation to his disciples of retirement and simplicity in theirs together with his dictating a particular form of prayer all presuppose prayer to be an acceptable and availing service   examples of prayer for particular favours by name for this thing to wit some bodily infirmity which he calls a thorn given     him in the flesh i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me—night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face and perfect that which is lacking in your faith   cor xii     thess iii  0   directions to pray for national or public blessings pray for the peace

besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me luke xviii   matt xxvi      cor xii   chapter   of private prayer family prayer and public worship concerning these three descriptions of devotion it is first of all to be observed that each has its separate and peculiar use and therefore that the exercise of one species of worship however regular it be does not supersede or dispense with the obligation of either of the other two i private prayer is recommended for the sake of the following advantages private wants cannot always be made the subject of public prayer but whatever reason there is for praying at all there is the same for making the sore and grief of each mans own heart the business of his application to god this must be the office of private exercises of devotion being imperfectly if at all practicable in any other private prayer is generally more devout and earnest than the share we are capable of taking in joint acts of worship because it affords leisure and opportunity for the circumstantial recollection     of those personal wants by the remembrance and ideas of which the warmth and earnestness of prayer are chiefly excited private prayer in proportion as it is usually accompanied with more actual thought and reflection of the petitioners own has a greater tendency than other modes of devotion to revive and fasten upon the mind the general impressions of religion solitude powerfully assists this effect when a man finds himself alone in communication with his creator his imagination becomes filled with a conflux of awful ideas concerning the universal agency and invisible presence of that being concerning what is likely to become of himself and of the superlative importance of providing for the happiness of his future existence by endeavours to please him who is the arbiter of his destiny reflections which whenever they gain admittance for a season overwhelm all others and leave when they depart a solemnity upon the thoughts that will seldom fail in some degree to affect the conduct of life private prayer thus recommended by its own propriety and by advantages not attainable in any form of religious communion receives a superior sanction from the authority and example of christ when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut the door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly—and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray matt vi   xiv    ii family prayer the peculiar use of family piety consists in its influence upon servants and the young members of a family who want sufficient seriousness and reflection to retire of their own accord to the exercise of private devotion and whose attention you cannot easily command in public worship the example also and authority of a father and master act in this way with the greatest force for his private prayers to which his children and servants are not witnesses act not at all upon them as examples and his attendance     upon public worship they will readily impute to fashion to a care to preserve appearances to a concern for decency and character and to many motives besides a sense of duty to god add to this that forms of public worship in proportion as they are more comprehensive are always less interesting than family prayers and that the ardour of devotion is better supported and the sympathy more easily propagated through a small assembly connected by the affections of domestic society than in the presence of a mixed congregation iii public worship if the worship of god be a duty of religion public worship is a necessary institution forasmuch as without it the greater part of mankind would exercise no religious worship at all these assemblies afford also at the same time opportunities for moral and religious instruction to those who otherwise would receive none in all protestant and in most christian countries the elements of natural religion and the important parts of the evangelic history are familiar to the lowest of the people this competent degree and general diffusion of religious knowledge amongst all orders of christians which will appear a great thing when compared with the intellectual condition of barbarous nations can fairly i think be ascribed to no other cause than the regular establishment of assemblies for divine worship in which either portions of scripture are recited and explained or the principles of christian erudition are so constantly taught in sermons incorporated with liturgies or expressed in extempore prayer as to imprint by the very repetition some knowledge and memory of these subjects upon the most unqualified and careless hearer the two reasons above stated bind all the members of a community to uphold public worship by their presence and example although the helps and opportunities which it affords may not be necessary to the devotion or edification of all and to some may be useless for it is easily foreseen how soon religious assemblies would     fall into contempt and disuse if that class of mankind who are above seeking instruction in them and want not that their own piety should be assisted by either forms or society in devotion were to withdraw their attendance especially when it is considered that all who please are at liberty to rank themselves of this class this argument meets the only serious apology that can be made for the absenting of ourselves from public worship surely some will say i may be excused from going to church so long as i pray at home and have no reason to doubt that my prayers are as acceptable and efficacious in my closet as in a cathedral still less can i think myself obliged to sit out a tedious sermon in order to hear what is known already what is better learnt from books or suggested by meditation they whose qualifications and habits best supply to themselves all the effect of public ordinances will be the last to prefer this excuse when they advert to the general consequence of setting up such an exemption as well as when they consider the turn which is sure to be given in the neighbourhood to their absence from public worship you stay from church to employ the sabbath at home in exercises and studies suited to its proper business your next neighbour stays from church to spend the seventh day less religiously than he passed any of the six in a sleepy stupid rest or at some rendezvous of drunkenness and debauchery and yet thinks that he is only imitating you because you both agree in not going to church the same consideration should overrule many small scruples concerning the rigorous propriety of some things which may be contained in the forms or admitted into the administration of the public worship of our communion for it seems impossible that even two or three should be gathered together in any act of social worship if each one require from the rest an implicit submission to his objections and if no man will attend upon a religious service which in any point contradicts his opinion of truth or falls short of his ideas of perfection     beside the direct necessity of public worship to the greater part of every christian community supposing worship at all to be a christian duty there are other valuable advantages growing out of the use of religious assemblies without being designed in the institution or thought of by the individuals who compose them   joining in prayer and praises to their common creator and governor has a sensible tendency to unite mankind together and to cherish and enlarge the generous affections so many pathetic reflections are awakened by every exercise of social devotion that most men i believe carry away from public worship a better temper towards the rest of mankind than they brought with them sprung from the same extraction preparing together for the period of all worldly distinctions reminded of their mutual infirmities and common dependency imploring and receiving support and supplies from the same great source of power and bounty having all one interest to secure one lord to serve one judgement the supreme object to all of their hopes and fears to look towards it is hardly possible in this position to behold mankind as strangers competitors or enemies or not to regard them as children of the same family assembled before their common parent and with some portion of the tenderness which belongs to the most endearing of our domestic relations it is not to be expected that any single effect of this kind should be considerable or lasting but the frequent return of such sentiments as the presence of a devout congregation naturally suggests will gradually melt down the ruggedness of many unkind passions and may generate in time a permanent and productive benevolence   assemblies for the purpose of divine worship placing men under impressions by which they are taught to consider their relation to the deity and to contemplate those around them with a view to that relation force upon their thoughts the natural equality of the human species and thereby promote humility and     condescension in the highest orders of the community and inspire the lowest with a sense of their rights the distinctions of civil life are almost always insisted upon too much and urged too far whatever therefore conduces to restore the level by qualifying the dispositions which grow out of great elevation or depression of rank improves the character on both sides now things are made to appear little by being placed beside what is great in which manner superiorities that occupy the whole field of imagination will vanish or shrink to their proper diminutiveness when compared with the distance by which even the highest of men are removed from the supreme being and this comparison is naturally introduced by all acts of joint worship if ever the poor man holds up his head it is at church if ever the rich man views him with respect it is there and both will be the better and the public profited the oftener they meet in a situation in which the consciousness of dignity in the one is tempered and mitigated and the spirit of the other erected and confirmed we recommend nothing adverse to subordinations which are established and necessary but then it should be remembered that subordination itself is an evil being an evil to the subordinate who are the majority and therefore ought not to be carried a tittle beyond what the greater good the peaceable government of the community requires the public worship of christians is a duty of divine appointment where two or three says christ are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them this invitation will want nothing of the force of a command with those who respect the person and authority from which it proceeds again in the epistle to the hebrews not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is† which reproof seems as     applicable to the desertion of our public worship at this day as to the forsaking the religious assemblies of christians in the age of the apostle independently of these passages of scripture a disciple of christianity will hardly think himself at liberty to dispute a practice set on foot by the inspired preachers of his religion coeval with its institution and retained by every sect into which it has been since divided chapter   of forms of prayer in public worship liturgies or preconcerted forms of public devotion being neither enjoined in scripture nor forbidden there can be no good reason for either receiving or rejecting them but that of expediency which expediency is to be gathered from a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages attending upon this mode of worship with those which usually accompany extemporary prayer the advantages of a liturgy are these i that it prevents absurd extravagant or impious addresses to god which in an order of men so numerous as the sacerdotal the folly and enthusiasm of many must always be in danger of producing where the conduct of the public worship is intrusted without restraint or assistance to the discretion and abilities of the officiating minister ii that it prevents the confusion of extemporary prayer in which the congregation being ignorant of each petition before they hear it and having little or no time to join in it after they have heard it are confounded between their attention to the minister and to their own devotion the devotion of the hearer is necessarily suspended until a petition be concluded and before he can assent to it or properly adopt it that is before he can address   0 the same request to god for himself and from himself his attention is called off to keep pace with what succeeds add to this that the mind of the hearer is held in continual expectation and detained from its proper business by the very novelty with which it is gratified a congregation may be pleased and affected with the prayers and devotion of their minister without joining in them in like manner as an audience oftentimes are with the representation of devotion upon the stage who nevertheless come away without being conscious of having exercised any act of devotion themselves joint prayer which amongst all denominations of christians is the declared design of coming together is prayer in which all join and not that which one alone in the congregation conceives and delivers and of which the rest are merely hearers this objection seems fundamental and holds even where the ministers office is discharged with every possible advantage and accomplishment the labouring recollection and embarrassed or tumultuous delivery of many extempore speakers form an additional objection to this mode of public worship for these imperfections are very general and give great pain to the serious part of a congregation as well as afford a profane diversion to the levity of the other part these advantages of a liturgy are connected with two principal inconveniences first that forms of prayer composed in one age become unfit for another by the unavoidable change of language circumstances and opinions secondly that the perpetual repetition of the same form of words produces weariness and inattentiveness in the congregation however both these inconveniences are in their nature vincible occasional revisions of a liturgy may obviate the first and devotion will supply a remedy for the second or they may both subsist in a considerable degree and yet be outweighed by the objections which are inseparable from extemporary prayer the lords prayer is a precedent as well as a pattern for forms of prayer our lord appears if not to have prescribed at least to     have authorised the use of fixed forms when he complied with the request of the disciple who said unto him lord teach us to pray as john also taught his disciples luke xi   the properties required in a public liturgy are that it be compendious that it express just conceptions of the divine attributes that it recite such wants as a congregation are likely to feel and no other and that it contain as few controverted propositions as possible i that it be compendious it were no difficult task to contract the liturgies of most churches into half their present compass and yet retain every distinct petition as well as the substance of every sentiment which can be found in them but brevity may be studied too much the composer of a liturgy must not sit down to his work with the hope that the devotion of the congregation will be uniformly sustained throughout or that every part will be attended to by every hearer if this could be depended upon a very short service would be sufficient for every purpose that can be answered or designed by social worship but seeing the attention of most men is apt to wander and return at intervals and by starts he will admit a certain degree of amplification and repetition of diversity of expression upon the same subject and variety of phrase and form with little addition to the sense to the end that the attention which has been slumbering or absent during one part of the service may be excited and recalled by another and the assembly kept together until it may reasonably be presumed that the most heedless and inadvertent have performed some act of devotion and the most desultory attention been caught by some part or other of the public service on the other hand the too great length of churchservices is more unfavourable to piety than almost any fault of composition can be it begets in many an early and unconquerable dislike to the public worship of their country or communion     they come to church seldom and enter the doors when they do come under the apprehension of a tedious attendance which they prepare for at first or soon after relieve by composing themselves to a drowsy forgetfulness of the place and duty or by sending abroad their thoughts in search of more amusing occupation although there may be some few of a disposition not to be wearied with religious exercises yet where a ritual is prolix and the celebration of divine service long no effect is in general to be looked for but that indolence will find in it an excuse and piety be disconcerted by impatience the length and repetitions complained of in our liturgy are not so much the fault of the compilers as the effect of uniting into one service what was originally but with very little regard to the conveniency of the people distributed into three notwithstanding that dread of innovations in religion which seems to have become the panic of the age few i should suppose would be displeased with such omissions abridgements or change in the arrangement as the combination of separate services must necessarily require even supposing each to have been faultless in itself if together with these alterations the epistles and gospels and collects which precede them were composed and selected with more regard to unity of subject and design and the psalms and lessons either left to the choice of the minister or better accommodated to the capacity of the audience and the edification of modern life the church of england would be in possession of a liturgy in which those who assent to her doctrines would have little to blame and the most dissatisfied must acknowledge many beauties the style throughout is excellent calm without coldness and though every where sedate oftentimes affecting the pauses in the service are disposed at proper intervals the transitions from one office of devotion to another from confession to prayer from prayer to     thanksgiving from thanksgiving to hearing of the word are contrived like scenes in the drama to supply the mind with a succession of diversified engagements as much variety is introduced also in the form of praying as this kind of composition seems capable of admitting the prayer at one time is continued at another broken by responses or cast into short alternate ejaculations and sometimes the congregation is called upon to take its share in the service by being left to complete a sentence which the minister had begun the enumeration of human wants and sufferings in the litany is almost complete a christian petitioner can have few things to ask of god or to deprecate which he will not find there expressed and for the most part with inimitable tenderness and simplicity ii that it express just conceptions of the divine attributes this is an article in which no care can be too great the popular notions of god are formed in a great measure from the accounts which the people receive of his nature and character in their religious assemblies an error here becomes the error of multitudes and as it is a subject in which almost every opinion leads the way to some practical consequence the purity or depravation of public manners will be affected amongst other causes by the truth or corruption of the public forms of worship iii that it recite such wants as the congregation are likely to feel and no other of forms of prayer which offend not egregiously against truth and decency that has the most merit which is best calculated to keep alive the devotion of the assembly it were to be wished therefore that every part of a liturgy were personally applicable to every individual in the congregation and that nothing were introduced to interrupt the passion or damp the flame which it is not easy to rekindle upon this principle the state prayers in our liturgy should be fewer and shorter whatever may be pretended     the congregation do not feel that concern in the subject of these prayers which must be felt ere ever prayers be made to god with earnestness the state style likewise seems unseasonably introduced into these prayers as ill according with that annihilation of human greatness of which every act that carries the mind to god presents the idea iv that it contain as few controverted propositions as possible we allow to each church the truth of its peculiar tenets and all the importance which zeal can ascribe to them we dispute not here the right or the expediency of framing creeds or of imposing subscriptions but why should every position which a church maintains be woven with so much industry into her forms of public worship some are offended and some are excluded this is an evil of itself at least to them and what advantage or satisfaction can be derived to the rest from the separation of their brethren it is difficult to imagine unless it were a duty to publish our system of polemic divinity under the name of making confession of our faith every time we worship god or a sin to agree in religious exercises with those from whom we differ in some religious opinions indeed where one man thinks it his duty constantly to worship a being whom another cannot with the assent of his conscience permit himself to worship at all there seems to be no place for comprehension or any expedient left but a quiet secession all other differences may be compromised by silence if sects and schisms be an evil they are as much to be avoided by one side as the other if sectaries are blamed for taking unnecessary offence established churches are no less culpable for unnecessarily giving it they are bound at least to produce a command or a reason of equivalent utility for shutting out any from their communion by mixing with divine worship doctrines which whether true or false are unconnected in their nature with devotion     chapter   of the use of sabbatical institutions an assembly cannot be collected unless the time of assembling be fixed and known beforehand and if the design of the assembly require that it be holden frequently it is easiest that it should return at stated intervals this produces a necessity of appropriating set seasons to the social offices of religion it is also highly convenient that the same seasons be observed throughout the country that all may be employed or all at leisure together for if the recess from worldly occupation be not general one mans business will perpetually interfere with another mans devotion the buyer will be calling at the shop when the seller is gone to church this part therefore of the religious distinction of seasons namely a general intermission of labour and business during times previously set apart for the exercise of public worship is founded in the reasons which make public worship itself a duty but the celebration of divine service never occupies the whole day what remains therefore of sunday beside the part of it employed at church must be considered as a mere rest from the ordinary occupations of civil life and he who would defend the institution as it is required by law to be observed in christian countries unless he can produce a command for a christian sabbath must point out the uses of it in that view first then that interval of relaxation which sunday affords to the laborious part of mankind contributes greatly to the comfort and satisfaction of their lives both as it refreshes them for the time and as it relieves their six days labour by the prospect of a day of rest always approaching which could not be said of casual indulgences of leisure and rest even were they more frequent than there     is reason to expect they would be if left to the discretion or humanity of interested taskmasters to this difference it may be added that holidays which come seldom and unexpected are unprovided when they do come with any duty or employment and the manner of spending them being regulated by no public decency or established usage they are commonly consumed in rude if not criminal pastimes in stupid sloth or brutish intemperance whoever considers how much sabbatical institutions conduce in this respect to the happiness and civilization of the labouring classes of mankind and reflects how great a majority of the human species these classes compose will acknowledge the utility whatever he may believe of the origin of this distinction and will consequently perceive it to be every mans duty to uphold the observation of sunday when once established let the establishment have proceeded from whom or from what authority it will nor is there any thing lost to the community by the intermission of public industry one day in the week for in countries tolerably advanced in population and the arts of civil life there is always enough of human labour and to spare the difficulty is not so much to procure as to employ it the addition of the seventh days labour to that of the other six would have no other effect than to reduce the price the labourer himself who deserved and suffered most by the change would gain nothing   sunday by suspending many public diversions and the ordinary rotation of employment leaves to men of all ranks and professions sufficient leisure and not more than what is sufficient both for the external offices of christianity and the retired but equally necessary duties of religious meditation and inquiry it is true that many do not convert their leisure to this purpose but it is of moment and is all which a public constitution can effect that to every one be allowed the opportunity   they whose humanity embraces the whole sensitive creation will esteem it no inconsiderable recommendation of a weekly     return of public rest that it affords a respite to the toil of brutes nor can we omit to recount this among the uses which the divine founder of the jewish sabbath expressly appointed a law of the institution we admit that none of these reasons show why sunday should be preferred to any other day in the week or one day in seven to one day in six or eight but these points which in their nature are of arbitrary determination being established to our hands our obligation applies to the subsisting establishment so long as we confess that some such institution is necessary and are neither able nor attempt to substitute any other in its place chapter   of the scripture account of sabbatical institutions the subject so far as it makes any part of christian morality is contained in two questions i whether the command by which the jewish sabbath was instituted extends to christians ii whether any new command was delivered by christ or any other day substituted in the place of the jewish sabbath by the authority or example of his apostles in treating of the first question it will be necessary to collect the accounts which are preserved of the institution in the jewish history for the seeing these accounts together and in one point of view will be the best preparation for the discussing or judging of any arguments on one side or the other in the second chapter of genesis the historian having concluded his account of the six days creation proceeds thus and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he     rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made after this we hear no more of the sabbath or of the seventh day as in any manner distinguished from the other six until the history brings us down to the sojourning of the jews in the wilderness when the following remarkable passage occurs upon the complaint of the people for want of food god was pleased to provide for their relief by a miraculous supply of manna which was found every morning upon the ground about the camp and they gathered it every morning every man according to his eating and when the sun waxed hot it melted and it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread two omers for one man and all the rulers of the congregation came and told moses and he said unto them this is that which the lord hath said tomorrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the lord bake that which ye will bake today and seethe that ye will seethe and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning and they laid it up till the morning as moses bade and it did not stink as it had done before when some of them left it till the morning neither was there any worm therein and moses said eat that today for today is a sabbath unto the lord today ye shall not find it in the field six days ye shall gather it but on the seventh day which is the sabbath in it there shall be none and it came to pass that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather and they found none and the lord said unto moses how long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws see for that the lord hath given you the sabbath therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days abide ye every man in his place let no man go out of his place on the seventh day so the people rested on the seventh day exodus xvi not long after this the sabbath as is well known was established with great solemnity in the fourth commandment     now in my opinion the transaction in the wilderness above recited was the first actual institution of the sabbath for if the sabbath had been instituted at the time of the creation as the words in genesis may seem at first sight to import and if it had been observed all along from that time to the departure of the jews out of egypt a period of about two thousand five hundred years it appears unaccountable that no mention of it no occasion of even the obscurest allusion to it should occur either in the general history of the world before the call of abraham which contains we admit only a few memoirs of its early ages and those extremely abridged or which is more to be wondered at in that of the lives of the first three jewish patriarchs which in many parts of the account is sufficiently circumstantial and domestic nor is there in the passage above quoted from the sixteenth chapter of exodus any intimation that the sabbath when appointed to be observed was only the revival of an ancient institution which had been neglected forgotten or suspended nor is any such neglect imputed either to the inhabitants of the old world or to any part of the family of noah nor lastly is any permission recorded to dispense with the institution during the captivity of the jews in egypt or on any other public emergency the passage in the second chapter of genesis which creates the whole controversy upon the subject is not inconsistent with this opinion for as the seventh day was erected into a sabbath on account of gods resting upon that day from the work of the creation it was natural enough in the historian when he had related the history of the creation and of gods ceasing from it on the seventh day to add and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that on it he had rested from all his work which god created and made although the blessing and sanctification ie the religious distinction and appropriation of that day were not actually made till many ages afterwards the words do not assert that god then blessed and sanctified the seventh day but that he   0 blessed and sanctified it for that reason and if any ask why the sabbath or sanctification of the seventh day was then mentioned if it was not then appointed the answer is at hand the order of connexion and not of time introduced the mention of the sabbath in the history of the subject which it was ordained to commemorate this interpretation is strongly supported by a passage in the prophet ezekiel where the sabbath is plainly spoken of as given and what else can that mean but as first instituted in the wilderness wherefore i caused them to go forth out of the land of egypt and brought them into the wilderness and i gave them my statutes and showed them my judgements which if a man do he shall even live in them moreover also i gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them that they might know that i am the lord that sanctify them ezek xx  0       nehemiah also recounts the promulgation of the sabbatical law amongst the transactions in the wilderness which supplies another considerable argument in aid of our opinion moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar and in the night by a pillar of fire to give them light in the way wherein they should go thou camest down also upon mount sinai and spakest with them from heaven and gavest them right judgements and true laws good statutes and commandments and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath and commandedst them precepts statutes and laws by the hand of moses thy servant and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock nehem ix        if it be inquired what duties were appointed for the jewish sabbath and under what penalties and in what manner it was observed amongst the ancient jews we find that by the fourth commandment a strict cessation from work was enjoined not only upon jews by birth or religious profession but upon all who resided within the limits of the jewish state that the same was to be permitted to their slaves and their cattle that this rest was not to be violated under pain of death whosoever doeth any work in the sabbathday he shall surely be put to death exod xxxi    beside which the seventh day was to be solemnised by double sacrifices in the temple and on the sabbathday two lambs of the first year without spot and two tenthdeals of flour for a meatoffering mingled with oil and the drinkoffering thereof this is the burntoffering of every sabbath beside the continual burntoffering and his drinkoffering numb xxviii    0 also holy convocations which mean we presume assemblies for the purpose of public worship or religious instruction were directed to be holden on the sabbathday the seventh day is a sabbath of rest an holy convocation levit xxiii   and accordingly we read that the sabbath was in fact observed amongst the jews by a scrupulous abstinence from every thing which by any possible construction could be deemed labour as from dressing meat from travelling beyond a sabbathdays journey or about a single mile in the maccabean wars they suffered a thousand of their number to be slain rather than do any thing in their own defence on the sabbathday in the final siege of jerusalem after they had so far overcome their scruples as to defend their persons when attacked they refused any operation on the sabbathday by which they might have interrupted the enemy in filling up the trench after the establishment of synagogues of the origin of which we have no account it was the custom to assemble in them on the sabbathday for the purpose of hearing the law rehearsed and explained and for the exercise it is probable     of public devotion for moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him being read in the synagogues every sabbathday the seventh day is saturday and agreeably to the jewish way of computing the day the sabbath held from six oclock on the friday evening to six oclock on saturday evening these observations being premised we approach the main question whether the command by which the jewish sabbath was instituted extend to us if the divine command was actually delivered at the creation it was addressed no doubt to the whole human species alike and continues unless repealed by some subsequent revelation binding upon all who come to the knowledge of it if the command was published for the first time in the wilderness then it was immediately directed to the jewish people alone and something farther either in the subject or circumstances of the command will be necessary to show that it was designed for any other it is on this account that the question concerning the date of the institution was first to be considered the former opinion precludes all debate about the extent of the obligation the latter admits and primâ facie induces a belief that the sabbath ought to be considered as part of the peculiar law of the jewish policy which belief receives great confirmation from the following arguments the sabbath is described as a sign between god and the people of israel—wherefore the children of israel shall keep the sabbath to observe the sabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual covenant it is a sign between me and the children of israel for ever exodus xxxi       again and i gave them my statutes and showed them my judgements which if a man do he shall even live in them moreover also i gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them that they might know that i am the lord that sanctify them ezek xx    now it does not seem easy to understand how the sabbath could be a sign between god and the people of     israel unless the observance of it was peculiar to that people and designed to be so the distinction of the sabbath is in its nature as much a positive ceremonial institution as that of many other seasons which were appointed by the levitical law to be kept holy and to be observed by a strict rest as the first and seventh days of unleavened bread the feast of pentecost the feast of tabernacles and in the twentythird chapter of exodus the sabbath and these are recited together if the command by which the sabbath was instituted be binding upon christians it must be binding as to the day the duties and the penalty in none of which it is received the observance of the sabbath was not one of the articles enjoined by the apostles in the fifteenth chapter of acts upon them which from among the gentiles were turned unto god st paul evidently appears to have considered the sabbath as part of the jewish ritual and not obligatory upon christians as such let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of an holy day or of the new moon or of the sabbath days which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ col ii       i am aware of only two objections which can be opposed to the force of these arguments one is that the reason assigned in the fourth commandment for hallowing the seventh day namely because god rested on the seventh day from the work of the creation is a reason which pertains to all mankind the other that the command which enjoins the observance of the sabbath is inserted in the decalogue of which all the other precepts and prohibitions are of moral and universal obligation upon the first objection it may be remarked that although in exodus the commandment is founded upon gods rest from the creation in deuteronomy the commandment is repeated with     a reference to a different event six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter nor thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thine ox nor thine ass nor any of thy cattle nor the stranger that is within thy gates that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou and remember that thou wast a servant in the land of egypt and that the lord thy god brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretchedout arm therefore the lord thy god commanded thee to keep the sabbathday it is farther observable that gods rest from the creation is proposed as the reason of the institution even where the institution itself is spoken of as peculiar to the jews wherefore the children of israel shall keep the sabbath to observe the sabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual covenant it is a sign between me and the children of israel for ever for in six days the lord made heaven and earth and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed the truth is these different reasons were assigned to account for different circumstances in the command if a jew inquired why the seventh day was sanctified rather than the sixth or eighth his law told him because god rested on the seventh day from the creation if he asked why was the same rest indulged to slaves his law bade him remember that he also was a slave in the land of egypt and that the lord his god brought him out thence in this view the two reasons are perfectly compatible with each other and with a third end of the institution its being a sign between god and the people of israel but in this view they determine nothing concerning the extent of the obligation if the reason by its proper energy had constituted a natural obligation or if it had been mentioned with a view to the extent of the obligation we should submit to the conclusion that all were comprehended by the command who are concerned in the reason but the sabbatic rest being a duty     which results from the ordination and authority of a positive law the reason can be alleged no farther than as it explains the design of the legislator and if it appear to be recited with an intentional application to one part of the law it explains his design upon no other if it be mentioned merely to account for the choice of the day it does not explain his design as to the extent of the obligation with respect to the second objection that inasmuch as the other nine commandments are confessedly of moral and universal obligation it may reasonably be presumed that this is of the same we answer that this argument will have less weight when it is considered that the distinction between positive and natural duties like other distinctions of modern ethics was unknown to the simplicity of ancient language and that there are various passages in scripture in which duties of a political or ceremonial or positive nature and confessedly of partial obligation are enumerated and without any mark of discrimination along with others which are natural and universal of this the following is an incontestable example but if a man be just and do that which is lawful and right and hath not eaten upon the mountains nor hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of israel neither hath defiled his neighbours wife neither hath come near to a menstruous woman and hath not oppressed any but hath restored to the debtor his pledge hath spoiled none by violence hath given his bread to the hungry and hath covered the naked with a garment he that hath not given upon usury neither hath taken any increase that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity hath executed true judgement between man and man hath walked in my statutes and hath kept my judgements to deal truly he is just he shall surely live saith the lord god ezekiel xviii  –  the same thing may be observed of the apostolic decree recorded in the fifteenth chapter of the acts it seemed good to the holy ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burthen than these necessary things that ye abstain from     meats offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication from which if ye keep yourselves ye shall do well ii if the law by which the sabbath was instituted was a law only to the jews it becomes an important question with the christian inquirer whether the founder of his religion delivered any new command upon the subject or if that should not appear to be the case whether any day was appropriated to the service of religion by the authority or example of his apostles the practice of holding religious assemblies upon the first day of the week was so early and universal in the christian church that it carries with it considerable proof of having originated from some precept of christ or of his apostles though none such be now extant it was upon the first day of the week that the disciples were assembled when christ appeared to them for the first time after his resurrection then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst of them john xx    this for any thing that appears in the account might as to the day have been accidental but in the   th verse of the same chapter we read that after eight days that is on the first day of the week following again the disciples were within which second meeting upon the same day of the week looks like an appointment and design to meet on that particular day in the twentieth chapter of the acts of the apostles we find the same custom in a christian church at a great distance from jerusalem and we came unto them to troas in five days where we abode seven days and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread paul preached unto them acts xx     the manner in which the historian mentions the disciples coming together to break bread on the first day of the week shows i think that the practice by this time was familiar and established st paul     to the corinthians writes thus concerning the collection for the saints as i have given order to the churches of galatia even so do ye upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as god hath prospered him that there be no gathering when i come   cor xvi     which direction affords a probable proof that the first day of the week was already amongst the christians both of corinth and galatia distinguished from the rest by some religious application or other at the time that st john wrote the book of his revelation the first day of the week had obtained the name of the lords day—i was in the spirit says he on the lords day rev i  0 which name and st johns use of it sufficiently denote the appropriation of this day to the service of religion and that this appropriation was perfectly known to the churches of asia i make no doubt that by the lords day was meant the first day of the week for we find no footsteps of any distinction of days which could entitle any other to that appellation the subsequent history of christianity corresponds with the accounts delivered on this subject in scripture it will be remembered that we are contending by these proofs for no other duty upon the first day of the week than that of holding and frequenting religious assemblies a cessation upon that day from labour beyond the time of attendance upon public worship is not intimated in any passage of the new testament nor did christ or his apostles deliver that we know of any command to their disciples for a discontinuance upon that day of the common offices of their professions a reserve which none will see reason to wonder at or to blame as a defect in the institution who consider that in the primitive condition of christianity the observance of a new sabbath would have been useless or inconvenient or impracticable during christs personal ministry his religion was preached to the jews alone they already had a sabbath which as citizens and subjects of that oeconomy they were obliged to keep     and did keep it was not therefore probable that christ would enjoin another day of rest in conjunction with this when the new religion came forth into the gentile world converts to it were for the most part made from those classes of society who have not their time and labour at their own disposal and it was scarcely to be expected that unbelieving masters and magistrates and they who directed the employment of others would permit their slaves and labourers to rest from their work every seventh day or that civil government indeed would have submitted to the loss of a seventh part of the public industry and that too in addition to the numerous festivals which the national religions indulged to the people at least this would have been an encumbrance which might have greatly retarded the reception of christianity in the world in reality the institution of a weekly sabbath is so connected with the functions of civil life and requires so much of the concurrence of civil law in its regulation and support that it cannot perhaps properly be made the ordinance of any religion till that religion be received as the religion of the state the opinion that christ and his apostles meant to retain the duties of the jewish sabbath shifting only the day from the seventh to the first seems to prevail without sufficient proof nor does any evidence remain in scripture of what however is not improbable that the first day of the week was thus distinguished in commemoration of our lords resurrection the conclusion from the whole inquiry for it is our business to follow the arguments to whatever probability they conduct us is this the assembling upon the first day of the week for the purpose of public worship and religious instruction is a law of christianity of divine appointment the resting on that day from our employments longer than we are detained from them by attendance upon these assemblies is to christians an ordinance of human institution binding nevertheless upon the conscience of every individual of     a country in which a weekly sabbath is established for the sake of the beneficial purposes which the public and regular observance of it promotes and recommended perhaps in some degree to the divine approbation by the resemblance it bears to what god was pleased to make a solemn part of the law which he delivered to the people of israel and by its subserviency to many of the same uses chapter   by what acts and omissions the duty of the christian sabbath is violated since the obligation upon christians to comply with the religious observance of sunday arises from the public uses of the institution and the authority of the apostolic practice the manner of observing it ought to be that which best fulfils these uses and conforms the nearest to this practice the uses proposed by the institution are   to facilitate attendance upon public worship   to meliorate the condition of the laborious classes of mankind by regular and seasonable returns of rest   by a general suspension of business and amusement to invite and enable persons of every description to apply their time and thoughts to subjects appertaining to their salvation with the primitive christians the peculiar and probably for some time the only distinction of the first day of the week was the holding of religious assemblies upon that day we learn however from the testimony of a very early writer amongst them that they also reserved the day for religious meditations—unusquisque nostrûm saith irenaeus sabbatizat spiritualiter meditatione legis gaudens opificium dei admirans   0 wherefore the duty of the day is violated  st by all such employments or engagements as though differing from our ordinary occupation hinder our attendance upon public worship or take up so much of our time as not to leave a sufficient part of the day at leisure for religious reflection as the going of journeys the paying or receiving of visits which engage the whole day or employing the time at home in writing letters settling accounts or in applying ourselves to studies or the reading of books which bear no relation to the business of religion  dly by unnecessary encroachments on the rest and liberty which sunday ought to bring to the inferior orders of the community as by keeping servants on that day confined and busied in preparations for the superfluous elegancies of our table or dress  dly by such recreations as are customarily forborne out of respect to the day as hunting shooting fishing public diversions frequenting taverns playing at cards or dice if it be asked as it often has been wherein consists the difference between walking out with your staff or with your gun between spending the evening at home or in a tavern between passing the sunday afternoon at a game of cards or in conversation not more edifying nor always so inoffensive—to these and to the same question under a variety of forms and in a multitude of similar examples we return the following answer that the religious observance of sunday if it ought to be retained at all must be upholden by some public and visible distinctions that draw the line of distinction where you will many actions which are situated on the confines of the line will differ very little and yet lie on the opposite sides of it that every trespass upon that reserve which public decency has established breaks down the fence by which the day is separated to the service of religion that it is unsafe to trifle with scruples and habits that have a beneficial tendency although founded merely in custom that these liberties however intended     will certainly be considered by those who observe them not only as disrespectful to the day and institution but as proceeding from a secret contempt of the christian faith that consequently they diminish a reverence for religion in others so far as the authority of our opinion or the efficacy of our example reaches or rather so far as either will serve for an excuse of negligence to those who are glad of any that as to cards and dice which put in their claim to be considered among the harmless occupations of a vacant hour it may be observed that few find any difficulty in refraining from play on sunday except they who sit down to it with the views and eagerness of gamesters that gaming is seldom innocent that the anxiety and perturbations however which it excites are inconsistent with the tranquillity and frame of temper in which the duties and thoughts of religion should always both find and leave us and lastly we shall remark that the example of other countries where the same or greater licence is allowed affords no apology for irregularities in our own because a practice which is tolerated by public usage neither receives the same construction nor gives the same offence as where it is censured and prohibited chapter   of reverencing the deity in many persons a seriousness and sense of awe overspread the imagination whenever the idea of the supreme being is presented to their thoughts this effect which forms a considerable security against vice is the consequence not so much of reflection as of habit which habit being generated by the external expressions of reverence which we use ourselves or observe in others may be destroyed by causes opposite to these and especially by that     familiar levity with which some learn to speak of the deity of his attributes providence revelations or worship god hath been pleased no matter for what reason although probably for this to forbid the vain mention of his name thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain now the mention is vain when it is useless and it is useless when it is neither likely nor intended to serve any good purpose as when it flows from the lips idle and unmeaning or is applied on occasions inconsistent with any consideration of religion and devotion to express our anger our earnestness our courage or our mirth or indeed when it is used at all except in acts of religion or in serious and seasonable discourse upon religious subjects the prohibition of the third commandment is recognised by christ in his sermon upon the mount which sermon adverts to none but the moral parts of the jewish law i say unto you swear not at all but let your communication be yea yea nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil the jews probably interpreted the prohibition as restrained to the name jehovah the name which the deity had appointed and appropriated to himself exod vi   the words of christ extend the prohibition beyond the name of god to every thing associated with the idea swear not neither by heaven for it is gods throne nor by the earth for it is his footstool neither by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king matt v    the offence of profane swearing is aggravated by the consideration that in it duty and decency are sacrificed to the slenderest of temptations suppose the habit either from affectation or by negligence and inadvertency to be already formed it must always remain within the power of the most ordinary resolution to correct it and it cannot one would think cost a great deal to relinquish the pleasure and honour which it confers a concern for duty is in fact never strong when the exertion requisite to vanquish a habit     founded in no antecedent propensity is thought too much or too painful a contempt of positive duties or rather of those duties for which the reason is not so plain as the command indicates a disposition upon which the authority of revelation has obtained little influence this remark is applicable to the offence of profane swearing and describes perhaps pretty exactly the general character of those who are most addicted to it mockery and ridicule when exercised upon the scriptures or even upon the places persons and forms set apart for the ministration of religion fall within the meaning of the law which forbids the profanation of gods name especially as that law is extended by christs interpretation they are moreover inconsistent with a religious frame of mind for as no one ever either feels himself disposed to pleasantry or capable of being diverted with the pleasantry of others upon matters in which he is deeply interested so a mind intent upon the acquisition of heaven rejects with indignation every attempt to entertain it with jests calculated to degrade or deride subjects which it never recollects but with seriousness and anxiety nothing but stupidity or the most frivolous dissipation of thought can make even the inconsiderate forget the supreme importance of every thing which relates to the expectation of a future existence whilst the infidel mocks at the superstitions of the vulgar insults over their credulous fears their childish errors or fantastic rites it does not occur to him to observe that the most preposterous device by which the weakest devotee ever believed he was securing the happiness of a future life is more rational than unconcern about it upon this subject nothing is so absurd as indifference—no folly so contemptible as thoughtlessness and levity finally the knowledge of what is due to the solemnity of those interests concerning which revelation professes to inform and     direct us may teach even those who are least inclined to respect the prejudices of mankind to observe a decorum in the style and conduct of religious disquisitions with the neglect of which many adversaries of christianity are justly chargeable serious arguments are fair on all sides christianity is but ill defended by refusing audience or toleration to the objections of unbelievers but whilst we would have freedom of inquiry restrained by no laws but those of decency we are entitled to demand on behalf of a religion which holds forth to mankind assurances of immortality that its credit be assailed by no other weapons than those of sober discussion and legitimate reasoning that the truth or falsehood of christianity be never made a topic of raillery a theme for the exercise of wit or eloquence or a subject of contention for literary fame and victory that the cause be tried upon its merits that all applications to the fancy passions or prejudices of the reader all attempts to preoccupy ensnare or perplex his judgement by any art influence or impression whatsoever extrinsic to the proper grounds and evidence upon which his assent ought to proceed be rejected from a question which involves in its determination the hopes the virtue and the repose of millions that the controversy be managed on both sides with sincerity that is that nothing be produced in the writings of either contrary to or beyond the writers own knowledge and persuasion that objections and difficulties be proposed from no other motive than an honest and serious desire to obtain satisfaction or to communicate information which may promote the discovery and progress of truth that in conformity with this design every thing be stated with integrity with method precision and simplicity and above all that whatever is published in opposition to received and confessedly beneficial persuasions be set forth under a form which is likely to invite inquiry and to meet examination if with these moderate and equitable conditions be compared the manner in which hostilities have     been waged against the christian religion not only the votaries of the prevailing faith but every man who looks forward with anxiety to the destination of his being will see much to blame and to complain of by one unbeliever all the follies which have adhered in a long course of dark and superstitious ages to the popular creed are assumed as so many doctrines of christ and his apostles for the purpose of subverting the whole system by the absurdities which it is thus represented to contain by another the ignorance and vices of the sacerdotal order their mutual dissensions and persecutions their usurpations and encroachments upon the intellectual liberty and civil rights of mankind have been displayed with no small triumph and invective not so much to guard the christian laity against a repetition of the same injuries which is the only proper use to be made of the most flagrant examples of the past as to prepare the way for an insinuation that the religion itself is nothing but a profitable fable imposed upon the fears and credulity of the multitude and upheld by the frauds and influence of an interested and crafty priesthood and yet how remotely is the character of the clergy connected with the truth of christianity what after all do the most disgraceful pages of ecclesiastical history prove but that the passions of our common nature are not altered or excluded by distinctions of name and that the characters of men are formed much more by the temptations than the duties of their profession a third finds delight in collecting and repeating accounts of wars and massacres of tumults and insurrections excited in almost every age of the christian aera by religious zeal as though the vices of christians were parts of christianity intolerance and extirpation precepts of the gospel or as if its spirit could be judged of from the counsels of princes the intrigues of statesmen the pretences of malice and ambition or the unauthorised cruelties of some gloomy and virulent superstition by a fourth the succession and variety of popular religions the vicissitudes with which sects     and tenets have flourished and decayed the zeal with which they were once supported the negligence with which they are now remembered the little share which reason and argument appear to have had in framing the creed or regulating the religious conduct of the multitude the indifference and submission with which the religion of the state is generally received by the common people the caprice and vehemence with which it is sometimes opposed the phrensy with which men have been brought to contend for opinions and ceremonies of which they knew neither the proof the meaning nor the original lastly the equal and undoubting confidence with which we hear the doctrines of christ or of confucius the law of moses or of mahomet the bible the koran or the shaster maintained or anathematized taught or abjured revered or derided according as we live on this or on that side of a river keep within or step over the boundaries of a state or even in the same country and by the same people so often as the event of a battle or the issue of a negotiation delivers them to the dominion of a new master—points i say of this sort are exhibited to the public attention as so many arguments against the truth of the christian religion—and with success for these topics being brought together and set off with some aggravation of circumstances and with a vivacity of style and description familiar enough to the writings and conversation of freethinkers insensibly lead the imagination into a habit of classing christianity with the delusions that have taken possession by turns of the public belief and of regarding it as what the scoffers of our faith represent it to be the superstition of the day but is this to deal honestly by the subject or with the world may not the same things be said may not the same prejudices be excited by these representations whether christianity be true or false or by whatever proofs its truth be attested may not truth as well as falsehood be taken upon credit may not a religion be founded upon evidence accessible and     satisfactory to every mind competent to the inquiry which yet by the greatest part of its professors is received upon authority but if the matter of those objections be reprehensible as calculated to produce an effect upon the reader beyond what their real weight and place in the argument deserve still more shall we discover of management and disingenuousness in the form under which they are dispersed among the public infidelity is served up in every shape that is likely to allure surprise or beguile the imagination in a fable a tale a novel a poem in interspersed and broken hints remote and oblique surmises in books of travels of philosophy of natural history in a word in any form rather than the right one that of a professed and regular disquisition and because the coarse buffoonery and broad laugh of the old and rude adversaries of the christian faith would offend the taste perhaps rather than the virtue of this cultivated age a graver irony a more skilful and delicate banter is substituted in their place an eloquent historian beside his more direct and therefore fairer attacks upon the credibility of evangelic story has contrived to weave into his narration one continued sneer upon the cause of christianity and upon the writings and characters of its ancient patrons the knowledge which this author possesses of the frame and conduct of the human mind must have led him to observe that such attacks do their execution without inquiry who can refute a sneer who can compute the number much less one by one scrutinize the justice of those disparaging insinuations which crowd the pages of this elaborate history what reader suspends his curiosity or calls off his attention from the principal narrative to examine references to search into the foundation or to weigh the reason propriety and force of every transient sarcasm and sly allusion by which the christian testimony is depreciated and traduced and by which nevertheless he may find his persuasion afterwards unsettled and perplexed     but the enemies of christianity have pursued her with poisoned arrows obscenity itself is made the vehicle of infidelity the awful doctrines if we be not permitted to call them the sacred truths of our religion together with all the adjuncts and appendages of its worship and external profession have been sometimes impudently profaned by an unnatural conjunction with impure and lascivious images the fondness for ridicule is almost universal and ridicule to many minds is never so irresistible as when seasoned with obscenity and employed upon religion but in proportion as these noxious principles take hold of the imagination they infatuate the judgement for trains of ludicrous and unchaste associations adhering to every sentiment and mention of religion render the mind indisposed to receive either conviction from its evidence or impressions from its authority and this effect being exerted upon the sensitive part of our frame is altogether independent of argument proof or reason is as formidable to a true religion as to a false one to a wellgrounded faith as to a chimerical mythology or fabulous tradition neither let it be observed is the crime or danger less because impure ideas are exhibited under a veil in covert and chastised language seriousness is not constraint of thought nor levity freedom every mind which wishes the advancement of truth and knowledge in the most important of all human researches must abhor this licentiousness as violating no less the laws of reasoning than the rights of decency there is but one description of men to whose principles it ought to be tolerable i mean that class of reasoners who can see little in christianity even supposing it to be true to such adversaries we address this reflection had jesus christ delivered no other declaration than the following—the hour is coming in the which all that are in the grave shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto     the resurrection of damnation—he had pronounced a message of inestimable importance and well worthy of that splendid apparatus of prophecy and miracles with which his mission was introduced and attested a message in which the wisest of mankind would rejoice to find an answer to their doubts and rest to their inquiries it is idle to say that a future state had been discovered already it had been discovered as the copernican system was—it was one guess among many he alone discovers who proves and no man can prove this point but the teacher who testifies by miracles that his doctrine comes from god   0     book vi elements of political knowledge chapter   of the origin of civil government government at first was either patriarchal or military that of a parent over his family or of a commander over his fellowwarriors i paternal authority and the order of domestic life supplied the foundation of civil government did mankind spring out of the earth mature and independent it would be found perhaps impossible to introduce subjection and subordination among them but the condition of human infancy prepares men for society by combining individuals into small communities and by placing them from the beginning under direction and control a family contains the rudiments of an empire the authority of one over many and the disposition to govern and to be governed are in this way incidental to the very nature and coeval no doubt with the existence of the human species moreover the constitution of families not only assists the formation of civil government by the dispositions which it generates but also furnishes the first steps of the process by which empires have been actually reared a parent would retain a considerable part of his authority after his children were grown up and had formed families of their own the obedience of which they remembered not the beginning would be considered as natural     and would scarcely during the parents life be entirely or abruptly withdrawn here then we see the second stage in the progress of dominion the first was that of a parent over his young children this that of an ancestor presiding over his adult descendants although the original progenitor was the centre of union to his posterity yet it is not probable that the association would be immediately or altogether dissolved by his death connected by habits of intercourse and affection and by some common rights necessities and interests they would consider themselves as allied to each other in a nearer degree than to the rest of the species almost all would be sensible of an inclination to continue in the society in which they had been brought up and experiencing as they soon would do many inconveniences from the absence of that authority which their common ancestor exercised especially in deciding their disputes and directing their operations in matters in which it was necessary to act in conjunction they might be induced to supply his place by a formal choice of a successor or rather might willingly and almost imperceptibly transfer their obedience to some one of the family who by his age or services or by the part he possessed in the direction of their affairs during the lifetime of the parent had already taught them to respect his advice or to attend to his commands or lastly the prospect of these inconveniences might prompt the first ancestor to appoint a successor and his posterity from the same motive united with an habitual deference to the ancestors authority might receive the appointment with submission here then we have a tribe or clan incorporated under one chief such communities might be increased by considerable numbers and fulfil the purposes of civil union without any other or more regular convention constitution or form of government than what we have described every branch which was slipped off from the primitive stock and removed to a distance from it would in like manner take root and grow into a separate clan two or three of these clans were frequently we may suppose united into     one marriage conquest mutual defence common distress or more accidental coalitions might produce this effect ii a second source of personal authority and which might easily extend or sometimes perhaps supersede the patriarchal is that which results from military arrangement in wars either of aggression or defence manifest necessity would prompt those who fought on the same side to array themselves under one leader and although their leader was advanced to this eminence for the purpose only and during the operations of a single expedition yet his authority would not always terminate with the reasons for which it was conferred a warrior who had led forth his tribe against their enemies with repeated success would procure to himself even in the deliberations of peace a powerful and permanent influence if this advantage were added to the authority of the patriarchal chief or favoured by any previous distinction of ancestry it would be no difficult undertaking for the person who possessed it to obtain the almost absolute direction of the affairs of the community especially if he was careful to associate to himself proper auxiliaries and content to practise the obvious art of gratifying or removing those who opposed his pretensions but although we may be able to comprehend how by his personal abilities or fortune one man may obtain the rule over many yet it seems more difficult to explain how empire became hereditary or in what manner sovereign power which is never acquired without great merit or management learns to descend in a succession which has no dependence upon any qualities either of understanding or activity the causes which have introduced hereditary dominion into so general a reception in the world are principally the following the influence of association which communicates to the son a portion of the same respect which was wont to be paid to the virtues or station of the father the mutual jealousy of other competitors the greater envy with which all behold the exaltation of an equal than the continuance of an acknowledged     superiority a reigning prince leaving behind him many adherents who can preserve their own importance only by supporting the succession of his children add to these reasons that elections to the supreme power having upon trial produced destructive contentions many states would take a refuge from a return of the same calamities in a rule of succession and no rule presents itself so obvious certain and intelligible as consanguinity of birth the ancient state of society in most countries and the modern condition of some uncivilized parts of the world exhibit that appearance which this account of the origin of civil government would lead us to expect the earliest histories of palestine greece italy gaul britain inform us that these countries were occupied by many small independent nations not much perhaps unlike those which are found at present amongst the savage inhabitants of north america and upon the coast of africa these nations i consider as the amplifications of so many single families or as derived from the junction of two or three families whom society in war or the approach of some common danger had united suppose a country to have been first peopled by shipwreck on its coasts or by emigrants or exiles from a neighbouring country the new settlers having no enemy to provide against and occupied with the care of their personal subsistence would think little of digesting a system of laws of contriving a form of government or indeed of any political union whatever but each settler would remain at the head of his own family and each family would include all of every age and generation who were descended from him so many of these families as were holden together after the death of the original ancestor by the reasons and in the method above recited would wax as the individuals were multiplied into tribes clans hordes or nations similar to those into which the ancient inhabitants of many countries are known to have been divided and which are still found wherever the state of society and manners is immature and uncultivated     nor need we be surprised at the early existence in the world of some vast empires or at the rapidity with which they advanced to their greatness from comparatively small and obscure originals whilst the inhabitants of so many countries were broken into numerous communities unconnected and oftentimes contending with each other before experience had taught these little states to see their own danger in their neighbours ruin or had instructed them in the necessity of resisting the aggrandisement of an aspiring power by alliances and timely preparations in this condition of civil policy a particular tribe which by any means had gotten the start of the rest in strength or discipline and happened to fall under the conduct of an ambitious chief by directing their first attempts to the part where success was most secure and by assuming as they went along those whom they conquered into a share of their future enterprises might soon gather a force which would infallibly overbear any opposition that the scattered power and unprovided state of such enemies could make to the progress of their victories lastly our theory affords a presumption that the earliest governments were monarchies because the government of families and of armies from which according to our account civil government derived its institution and probably its form is universally monarchical chapter   how subjection to civil government is maintained could we view our own species from a distance or regard mankind with the same sort of observation with which we read the natural history or remark the manners of any other animal there is nothing in     the human character which would more surprise us than the almost universal subjugation of strength to weakness than to see many millions of robust men in the complete use and exercise of their personal faculties and without any defect of courage waiting upon the will of a child a woman a driveller or a lunatic and although when we suppose a vast empire in absolute subjection to one person and that one depressed beneath the level of his species by infirmities or vice we suppose perhaps an extreme case yet in all cases even in the most popular forms of civil government the physical strength resides in the governed in what manner opinion thus prevails over strength or how power which naturally belongs to superior force is maintained in opposition to it in other words by what motives the many are induced to submit to the few becomes an inquiry which lies at the root of almost every political speculation it removes indeed but does not resolve the difficulty to say that civil governments are nowadays almost universally upholden by standing armies for the question still returns how are these armies themselves kept in subjection or made to obey the commands and carry on the designs of the prince or state which employs them now although we should look in vain for any single reason which will account for the general submission of mankind to civil government yet it may not be difficult to assign for every class and character in the community considerations powerful enough to dissuade each from any attempts to resist established authority every man has his motive though not the same in this as in other instances the conduct is similar but the principles which produce it extremely various there are three distinctions of character into which the subjects of a state may be divided into those who obey from prejudice those who obey from reason and those who obey from selfinterest i they who obey from prejudice are determined by an opinion of right in their governors which opinion is founded upon     prescription in monarchies and aristocracies which are hereditary the prescription operates in favour of particular families in republics and elective offices in favour of particular forms of government or constitutions nor is it to be wondered at that mankind should reverence authority founded in prescription when they observe that it is prescription which confers the title to almost every thing else the whole course and all the habits of civil life favour this prejudice upon what other foundation stands any mans right to his estate the right of primogeniture the succession of kindred the descent of property the inheritance of honours the demand of tithes tolls rents or services from the estates of others the right of way the powers of office and magistracy the privileges of nobility the immunities of the clergy upon what are they all founded in the apprehension at least of the multitude but upon prescription to what else when the claims are contested is the appeal made it is natural to transfer the same principle to the affairs of government and to regard those exertions of power which have been long exercised and acquiesced in as so many rights in the sovereign and to consider obedience to his commands within certain accustomed limits as enjoined by that rule of conscience which requires us to render to every man his due in hereditary monarchies the prescriptive title is corroborated and its influence considerably augmented by an accession of religious sentiments and by that sacredness which men are wont to ascribe to the persons of princes princes themselves have not failed to take advantage of this disposition by claiming a superior dignity as it were of nature or a peculiar delegation from the supreme being for this purpose were introduced the titles of sacred majesty of gods anointed representative vicegerent together with the ceremonies of investitures and coronations which are calculated not so much to recognise the authority of sovereigns as to consecrate their persons where a fabulous religion     permitted it the public veneration has been challenged by bolder pretensions the roman emperors usurped the titles and arrogated the worship of gods the mythology of the heroic ages and of many barbarous nations was easily converted to this purpose some princes like the heroes of homer and the founder of the roman name derived their birth from the gods others with numa pretended a secret communication with some divine being and others again like the incas of peru and the ancient saxon kings extracted their descent from the deities of their country the lama of thibet at this day is held forth to his subjects not as the offspring or successor of a divine race of princes but as the immortal god himself the object at once of civil obedience and religious adoration this instance is singular and may be accounted the farthest point to which the abuse of human credulity has ever been carried but in all these instances the purpose was the same—to engage the reverence of mankind by an application to their religious principles the reader will be careful to observe that in this article we denominate every opinion whether true or false a prejudice which is not founded upon argument in the mind of the person who entertains it ii they who obey from reason that is to say from conscience as instructed by reasonings and conclusions of their own are determined by the consideration of the necessity of some government or other the certain mischief of civil commotions and the danger of resettling the government of their country better or at all if once subverted or disturbed iii they who obey from selfinterest are kept in order by want of leisure by a succession of private cares pleasures and engagements by contentment or a sense of the ease plenty and safety which they enjoy or lastly and principally by fear foreseeing that they would bring themselves by resistance into a worse situation     than their present inasmuch as the strength of government each discontented subject reflects is greater than his own and he knows not that others would join him this last consideration has often been called opinion of power this account of the principles by which mankind are retained in their obedience to civil government may suggest the following cautions   let civil governors learn hence to respect their subjects let them be admonished that the physical strength resides in the governed that this strength wants only to be felt and roused to lay prostrate the most ancient and confirmed dominion that civil authority is founded in opinion that general opinion therefore ought always to be treated with deference and managed with delicacy and circumspection   opinion of right always following the custom being for the most part founded in nothing else and lending one principal support to government every innovation in the constitution or in other words in the custom of governing diminishes the stability of government hence some absurdities are to be retained and many small inconveniences endured in every country rather than that the usage should be violated or the course of public affairs diverted from their old and smooth channel even names are not indifferent when the multitude are to be dealt with there is a charm in sounds it was upon this principle that several statesmen of those times advised cromwell to assume the title of king together with the ancient style and insignia of royalty the minds of many they contended would be brought to acquiesce in the authority of a king who suspected the office and were offended with the administration of a protector novelty reminded them of usurpation the adversaries of this design opposed the measure from the same persuasion of the efficacy of names and forms jealous lest the veneration paid to these should add an influence to the new settlement which might ensnare the liberty of the commonwealth   0   government may be too secure the greatest tyrants have been those whose titles were the most unquestioned whenever therefore the opinion of right becomes too predominant and superstitious it is abated by breaking the custom thus the revolution broke the custom of succession and thereby moderated both in the prince and in the people those lofty notions of hereditary right which in the one were become a continual incentive to tyranny and disposed the other to invite servitude by undue compliances and dangerous concessions   as ignorance of union and want of communication appear amongst the principal preservatives of civil authority it behoves every state to keep its subjects in this want and ignorance not only by vigilance in guarding against actual confederacies and combinations but by a timely care to prevent great collections of men of any separate party or religion or of like occupation or profession or in any way connected by a participation of interest or passion from being assembled in the same vicinity a protestant establishment in this country may have little to fear from its popish subjects scattered as they are throughout the kingdom and intermixed with the protestant inhabitants which yet might think them a formidable body if they were gathered together into one county the most frequent and desperate riots are those which break out amongst men of the same profession as weavers miners sailors this circumstance makes a mutiny of soldiers more to be dreaded than any other insurrection hence also one danger of an overgrown metropolis and of those great cities and crowded districts into which the inhabitants of trading countries are commonly collected the worst effect of popular tumults consists in this that they discover to the insurgents the secret of their own strength teach them to depend upon it against a future occasion and both produce and diffuse sentiments of confidence in one another and assurances of mutual support leagues thus formed and strengthened may     overawe or overset the power of any state and the danger is greater in proportion as from the propinquity of habitation and intercourse of employment the passions and counsels of a party can be circulated with ease and rapidity it is by these means and in such situations that the minds of men are so affected and prepared that the most dreadful uproars often arise from the slightest provocations when the train is laid a spark will produce the explosion chapter   the duty of submission to civil government explained the subject of this chapter is sufficiently distinguished from the subject of the last as the motives which actually produce civil obedience may be and often are very different from the reasons which make that obedience a duty in order to prove civil obedience to be a moral duty and an obligation upon the conscience it hath been usual with many political writers at the head of whom we find the venerable name of locke to state a compact between the citizen and the state as the ground and cause of the relation between them which compact binding the parties for the same general reason that private contracts do resolves the duty of submission to civil government into the universal obligation of fidelity in the performance of promises this compact is twofold first an express compact by the primitive founders of the state who are supposed to have convened for the declared purpose of settling the terms of their political union and a future constitution of government the whole body is supposed in the first place to have unanimously consented to be bound by the resolutions of the     majority that majority in the next place to have fixed certain fundamental regulations and then to have constituted either in one person or in an assembly the rule of succession or appointment being at the same time determined a standing legislature to whom under these preestablished restrictions the government of the state was thenceforward committed and whose laws the several members of the convention were by their first undertaking thus personally engaged to obey this transaction is sometimes called the social compact and these supposed original regulations compose what are meant by the constitution the fundamental laws of the constitution and form on one side the inherent indefeasible prerogative of the crown and on the other the unalienable inprescriptible birthright of the subject secondly a tacit or implied compact by all succeeding members of the state who by accepting its protection consent to be bound by its laws in like manner as whoever voluntarily enters into a private society is understood without any other or more explicit stipulation to promise a conformity with the rules and obedience to the government of that society as the known conditions upon which he is admitted to a participation of its privileges this account of the subject although specious and patronized by names the most respectable appears to labour under the following objections that it is founded upon a supposition false in fact and leading to dangerous conclusions no social compact similar to what is here described was ever made or entered into in reality no such original convention of the people was ever actually holden or in any country could be holden antecedent to the existence of civil government in that country it is to suppose it possible to call savages out of caves and deserts to deliberate and vote upon topics which the experience and studies and refinements of civil life alone suggest therefore no government in the universe began from this original some imitation of a     social compact may have taken place at a revolution the present age has been witness to a transaction which bears the nearest resemblance to this political idea of any of which history has preserved the account or memory i refer to the establishment of the united states of north america we saw the people assembled to elect deputies for the avowed purpose of framing the constitution of a new empire we saw this deputation of the people deliberating and resolving upon a form of government erecting a permanent legislature distributing the functions of sovereignty establishing and promulgating a code of fundamental ordinances which were to be considered by succeeding generations not merely as laws and acts of the state but as the very terms and conditions of the confederation as binding not only upon the subjects and magistrates of the state but as limitations of power which were to control and regulate the future legislature yet even here much was presupposed in settling the constitution many important parts were presumed to be already settled the qualifications of the constituents who were admitted to vote in the election of members of congress as well as the mode of electing the representatives were taken from the old forms of government that was wanting from which every social union should set off and which alone makes the resolutions of the society the act of the individual—the unconstrained consent of all to be bound by the decision of the majority and yet without this previous consent the revolt and the regulations which followed it were compulsory upon dissentients but the original compact we are told is not proposed as a fact but as a fiction which furnishes a commodious explication of the mutual rights and duties of sovereigns and subjects in answer to this representation of the matter we observe that the original compact if it be not a fact is nothing can confer no actual authority upon laws or magistrates nor afford any foundation to rights which are supposed to be real and existing but the truth is     that in the books and in the apprehension of those who deduce our civil rights and obligations à pactis the original convention is appealed to and treated of as a reality whenever the disciples of this system speak of the constitution of the fundamental articles of the constitution of laws being constitutional or unconstitutional of inherent unalienable inextinguishable rights either in the prince or in the people or indeed of any laws usages or civil rights as transcending the authority of the subsisting legislature or possessing a force and sanction superior to what belong to the modern acts and edicts of the legislature they secretly refer us to what passed at the original convention they would teach us to believe that certain rules and ordinances were established by the people at the same time that they settled the charter of government and the powers as well as the form of the future legislature that this legislature consequently deriving its commission and existence from the consent and act of the primitive assembly of which indeed it is only the standing deputation continues subject in the exercise of its offices and as to the extent of its power to the rules reservations and limitations which the same assembly then made and prescribed to it as the first members of the state were bound by express stipulation to obey the government which they had erected so the succeeding inhabitants of the same country are understood to promise allegiance to the constitution and government they find established by accepting its protection claiming its privileges and acquiescing in its laws more especially by the purchase or inheritance of lands to the possession of which allegiance to the state is annexed as the very service and condition of the tenure smoothly as this train of argument proceeds little of it will endure examination the native subjects of modern states are not conscious of any stipulation with the sovereigns of ever exercising an election whether they will be bound or not by the acts of the legislature of     any alternative being proposed to their choice of a promise either required or given nor do they apprehend that the validity or authority of the law depends at all upon their recognition or consent in all stipulations whether they be expressed or implied private or public formal or constructive the parties stipulating must both possess the liberty of assent and refusal and also be conscious of this liberty which cannot with truth be affirmed of the subjects of civil government as government is now or ever was actually administered this is a defect which no arguments can excuse or supply all presumptions of consent without this consciousness or in opposition to it are vain and erroneous still less is it possible to reconcile with any idea of stipulation the practice in which all european nations agree of founding allegiance upon the circumstance of nativity that is of claiming and treating as subjects all those who are born within the confines of their dominions although removed to another country in their youth or infancy in this instance certainly the state does not presume a compact also if the subject be bound only by his own consent and if the voluntary abiding in the country be the proof and intimation of that consent by what arguments should we defend the right which sovereigns universally assume of prohibiting when they please the departure of their subjects out of the realm again when it is contended that the taking and holding possession of land amounts to an acknowledgement of the sovereign and a virtual promise of allegiance to his laws it is necessary to the validity of the argument to prove that the inhabitants who first composed and constituted the state collectively possessed a right to the soil of the country—a right to parcel it out to whom they pleased and to annex to the donation what conditions they thought fit how came they by this right an agreement amongst themselves would not confer it that could only adjust what already belonged to them a society of men vote themselves to be the     owners of a region of the world—does that vote unaccompanied especially with any culture enclosure or proper act of occupation make it theirs does it entitle them to exclude others from it or to dictate the conditions upon which it shall be enjoyed yet this original collective right and ownership is the foundation for all the reasoning by which the duty of allegiance is inferred from the possession of land the theory of government which affirms the existence and the obligation of a social compact would after all merit little discussion and however groundless and unnecessary should receive no opposition from us did it not appear to lead to conclusions unfavourable to the improvement and to the peace of human society  st upon the supposition that government was first erected by and that it derives all its just authority from resolutions entered into by a convention of the people it is capable of being presumed that many points were settled by that convention anterior to the establishment of the subsisting legislature and which the legislature consequently has no right to alter or interfere with these points are called the fundamentals of the constitution and as it is impossible to determine how many or what they are the suggesting of any such serves extremely to embarrass the deliberations of the legislature and affords a dangerous pretence for disputing the authority of the laws it was this sort of reasoning so far as reasoning of any kind was employed in the question that produced in this nation the doubt which so much agitated the minds of men in the reign of the second charles whether an act of parliament could of right alter or limit the succession of the crown  dly if it be by virtue of a compact that the subject owes obedience to civil government it will follow that he ought to abide by the form of government which he finds established be it ever so absurd or inconvenient he is bound by his bargain it is not permitted to any man to retreat from his engagement merely because     he finds the performance disadvantageous or because he has an opportunity of entering into a better this law of contracts is universal and to call the relation between the sovereign and the subjects a contract yet not to apply to it the rules or allow of the effects of a contract is an arbitrary use of names and an unsteadiness in reasoning which can teach nothing resistance to the encroachments of the supreme magistrate may be justified upon this principle recourse to arms for the purpose of bringing about an amendment of the constitution never can no form of government contains a provision for its own dissolution and few governors will consent to the extinction or even to any abridgement of their own power it does not therefore appear how despotic governments can ever in consistency with the obligation of the subject be changed or mitigated despotism is the constitution of many states and whilst a despotic prince exacts from his subjects the most rigorous servitude according to this account he is only holding them to their agreement a people may vindicate by force the rights which the constitution has left them but every attempt to narrow the prerogative of the crown by new limitations and in opposition to the will of the reigning prince whatever opportunities may invite or success follow it must be condemned as an infraction of the compact between the sovereign and the subject  dly every violation of the compact on the part of the governor releases the subject from his allegiance and dissolves the government i do not perceive how we can avoid this consequence if we found the duty of allegiance upon compact and confess any analogy between the social compact and other contracts in private contracts the violation and nonperformance of the conditions by one of the parties vacates the obligation of the other now the terms and articles of the social compact being nowhere extant or expressed the rights and offices of the administrator of an empire being so many and various the imaginary and controverted line of his prerogative being so liable to be overstepped in one part or other of it the position that every such transgression amounts to a forfeiture of the government and consequently authorises the people to withdraw their obedience and provide for themselves by a new settlement would endanger the stability of every political fabric in the world and has in fact always supplied the disaffected with a topic of seditious declamation if occasions have arisen in which this plea has been resorted to with justice and success they have been occasions in which a revolution was defensible upon other and plainer principles the plea itself is at all times captious and unsafe     wherefore rejecting the intervention of a compact as unfounded in its principle and dangerous in the application we assign for the only ground of the subjects obligation the will of god as collected from expediency the steps by which the argument proceeds are few and direct it is the will of god that the happiness of human life be promoted—this is the first step and the foundation not only of this but of every moral conclusion civil society conduces to that end—this is the second proposition civil societies cannot be upholden unless in each the interest of the whole society be binding upon every part and member of it—this is the third step and conducts us to the conclusion namely that so long as the interest of the whole society requires it that is so long as the established government cannot be resisted or changed without public inconveniency it is the will of god which will universally determines our duty that the established government be obeyed—and no longer this principle being admitted the justice of every particular case of resistance is reduced to a computation of the quantity of the     danger and grievance on the one side and of the probability and expense of redressing it on the other but who shall judge this we answer every man for himself in contentions between the sovereign and the subject the parties acknowledge no common arbitrator and it would be absurd to refer the decision to those whose conduct has provoked the question and whose own interest authority and fate are immediately concerned in it the danger of error and abuse is no objection to the rule of expediency because every other rule is liable to the same or greater and every rule that can be propounded upon the subject like all rules indeed which appeal to or bind the conscience must in the application depend upon private judgement it may be observed however that it ought equally to be accounted the exercise of a mans own private judgement whether he be determined by reasonings and conclusions of his own or submit to be directed by the advice of others provided he be free to choose his guide we proceed to point out some easy but important inferences which result from the substitution of public expediency into the place of all implied compacts promises or conventions whatsoever i it may be as much a duty at one time to resist government as it is at another to obey it to wit whenever more advantage will in our opinion accrue to the community from resistance than mischief ii the lawfulness of resistance or the lawfulness of a revolt does not depend alone upon the grievance which is sustained or feared but also upon the probable expense and event of the contest they who concerted the revolution in england were justifiable in their counsels because from the apparent disposition of the nation and the strength and character of the parties engaged the measure was likely to be brought about with little mischief or bloodshed whereas it might have been a question  00 with many friends of their country whether the injuries then endured and threatened would have authorised the renewal of a doubtful civil war iii irregularity in the first foundation of a state or subsequent violence fraud or injustice in getting possession of the supreme power are not sufficient reasons for resistance after the government is once peaceably settled no subject of the british empire conceives himself engaged to vindicate the justice of the norman claim or conquest or apprehends that his duty in any manner depends upon that controversy so likewise if the house of lancaster or even the posterity of cromwell had been at this day seated upon the throne of england we should have been as little concerned to inquire how the founder of the family came there no civil contests are so futile although none have been so furious and sanguinary as those which are excited by a disputed succession iv not every invasion of the subjects rights or liberty or of the constitution not every breach of promise or of oath not every stretch of prerogative abuse of power or neglect of duty by the chief magistrate or by the whole or any branch of  0  the legislative body justifies resistance unless these crimes draw after them public consequences of sufficient magnitude to outweigh the evils of civil disturbance nevertheless every violation of the constitution ought to be watched with jealousy and resented as such beyond what the quantity of estimable damage would require or warrant because a known and settled usage of governing affords the only security against the enormities of uncontrolled dominion and because this security is weakened by every encroachment which is made without opposition or opposed without effect v no usage law or authority whatsoever is so binding that it need or ought to be continued when it may be changed with advantage to the community the family of the prince the order of succession the prerogative of the crown the form and parts of the legislature together with the respective powers office duration and mutual dependency of the several parts are all only so many laws mutable like other laws whenever expediency requires either by the ordinary act of the legislature or if the occasion deserve it by the interposition of the people these points are wont to be approached with a kind of awe they are represented to the mind as principles of the constitution settled by our ancestors and being settled to be no more committed to innovation or debate as foundations never to be stirred as the terms and conditions of the social compact to which every citizen of the state has engaged his fidelity by virtue of a promise which he cannot now recall such reasons have no place in our system to us if there be any good reason for treating these with more deference and respect than other laws it is either the advantage of the present constitution of government which reason must be of different force in different countries or because in all countries it is of importance that the form and usage of governing be acknowledged and understood as well by the governors as by the governed and because the seldomer it is changed the more perfectly it will be known by both sides vi as all civil obligation is resolved into expediency what it may be asked is the difference between the obligation of an englishman and a frenchman or why since the obligation of both appears to be founded in the same reason is a frenchman bound in conscience to bear any thing from his king which an englishman would not be bound to bear their conditions may differ but their rights according to this account should seem to be equal and yet we are accustomed to speak of the rights as well as of the happiness of a free people compared with what belong to the subjects of absolute monarchies how you will say can this comparison be explained unless we refer to a difference in the compacts by which they are respectively bound this is a fair question and the answer  0  to it will afford a farther illustration of our principles we admit then that there are many things which a frenchman is bound in conscience as well as by coercion to endure at the hands of his prince to which an englishman would not be obliged to submit but we assert that it is for these two reasons alone first because the same act of the prince is not the same grievance where it is agreeable to the constitution and where it infringes it secondly because redress in the two cases is not equally attainable resistance cannot be attempted with equal hopes of success or with the same prospect of receiving support from others where the people are reconciled to their sufferings as where they are alarmed by innovation in this way and no otherwise the subjects of different states possess different civil rights the duty of obedience is defined by different boundaries and the point of justifiable resistance placed at different parts of the scale of suffering all which is sufficiently intelligible without a social compact vii the interest of the whole society is binding upon every part of it no rule short of this will provide for the stability of civil government or for the peace and safety of social life wherefore as individual members of the state are not permitted to pursue their private emolument to the prejudice of the community so is it equally a consequence of this rule that no particular colony province town or district can justly concert measures for their separate interest which shall appear at the same time to diminish the sum of public prosperity i do not mean that it is necessary to the justice of a measure that it profit each and every part of the community for as the happiness of the whole may be increased whilst that of some parts is diminished it is possible that the conduct of one part of an empire may be detrimental to some other part and yet just provided one part gain more in happiness than the other part loses so that the common weal be augmented by the change but what i affirm is that those counsels can never be  0  reconciled with the obligations resulting from civil union which cause the whole happiness of the society to be impaired for the conveniency of a part this conclusion is applicable to the question of right between great britain and her revolted colonies had i been an american i should not have thought it enough to have had it even demonstrated that a separation from the parentstate would produce effects beneficial to america my relation to that state imposed upon me a farther inquiry namely whether the whole happiness of the empire was likely to be promoted by such a measure not indeed the happiness of every part that was not necessary nor to be expected—but whether what great britain would lose by the separation was likely to be compensated to the joint stock of happiness by the advantages which america would receive from it the contested claims of sovereign states and their remote dependencies may be submitted to the adjudication of this rule with mutual safety a public advantage is measured by the advantage which each individual receives and by the number of those who receive it a public evil is compounded of the same proportions whilst therefore a colony is small or a province thinly inhabited if a competition of interests arise between the original country and their acquired dominions the former ought to be preferred because it is fit that if one must necessarily be sacrificed the less give place to the greater but when by an increase of population the interest of the provinces begins to bear a considerable proportion to the entire interest of the community it is possible that they may suffer so much by their subjection that not only theirs but the whole happiness of the empire may be obstructed by their union the rule and principle of the calculation being still the same the result is different and this difference begets a new situation which entitles the subordinate parts of the states to more equal terms of confederation and if these be refused to independency  0  chapter   of the duty of civil obedience as stated in the christian scriptures we affirm that as to the extent of our civil rights and obligations christianity hath left us where she found us that she hath neither altered nor ascertained it that the new testament contains not one passage which fairly interpreted affords either argument or objection applicable to any conclusions upon the subject that are deduced from the law and religion of nature the only passages which have been seriously alleged in the controversy or which it is necessary for us to state and examine are the two following the one extracted from st pauls epistle to the romans the other from the first general epistle of st peter romans xiii  –  let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation for rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil wilt thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same for he is the minister of god to thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the minister of god a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil wherefore ye must needs be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake for for this cause pay ye tribute also for they are gods ministers attending continually upon this very thing render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom honour  0    peter ii   –   submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lords sake whether it be to the king as supreme or unto governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well for so is the will of god that with welldoing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men as free and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but as the servants of god to comprehend the proper import of these instructions let the reader reflect that upon the subject of civil obedience there are two questions the first whether to obey government be a moral duty and obligation upon the conscience at all the second how far and to what cases that obedience ought to extend that these two questions are so distinguishable in the imagination that it is possible to treat of the one without any thought of the other and lastly that if expressions which relate to one of these questions be transferred and applied to the other it is with great danger of giving them a signification very different from the authors meaning this distinction is not only possible but natural if i met with a person who appeared to entertain doubts whether civil obedience were a moral duty which ought to be voluntarily discharged or whether it were not a mere submission to force like that which we yield to a robber who holds a pistol to our breast i should represent to him the use and offices of civil government the end and the necessity of civil subjection or if i preferred a different theory i should explain to him the social compact urge him with the obligation and the equity of his implied promise and tacit consent to be governed by the laws of the state from which he received protection or i should argue perhaps that nature herself dictated the law of subordination when she planted within us an inclination to associate with our species and framed us with capacities so various and unequal from whatever principle i set out i should labour to  0  infer from it this conclusion that obedience to the state is to be numbered amongst the relative duties of human life for the transgression of which we shall be accountable at the tribunal of divine justice whether the magistrate be able to punish us for it or not and being arrived at this conclusion i should stop having delivered the conclusion itself and throughout the whole argument expressed the obedience which i inculcated in the most general and unqualified terms all reservations and restrictions being superfluous and foreign to the doubts i was employed to remove if in a short time afterwards i should be accosted by the same person with complaints of public grievances of exorbitant taxes of acts of cruelty and oppression of tyrannical encroachments upon the ancient or stipulated rights of the people and should be consulted whether it were lawful to revolt or justifiable to join in an attempt to shake off the yoke by open resistance i should certainly consider myself as having a case and question before me very different from the former i should now define and discriminate i should reply that if public expediency be the foundation it is also the measure of civil obedience that the obligation of subjects and sovereigns is reciprocal that the duty of allegiance whether it be founded in utility or compact is neither unlimited nor unconditional that peace may be purchased too dearly that patience becomes culpable pusillanimity when it serves only to encourage our rulers to increase the weight of our burthen or to bind it the faster that the submission which surrenders the liberty of a nation and entails slavery upon future generations is enjoined by no law of rational morality finally i should instruct the inquirer to compare the peril and expense of his enterprise with the effects it was expected to produce and to make choice of the alternative by which not his own present relief or profit but the whole and permanent interest of the state was likely to be best promoted if any one who had been present at both these conversations should  0  upbraid me with change or inconsistency of opinion should retort upon me the passive doctrine which i before taught the large and absolute terms in which i then delivered lessons of obedience and submission i should account myself unfairly dealt with i should reply that the only difference which the language of the two conversations presented was that i added now many exceptions and limitations which were omitted or unthought of then that this difference arose naturally from the two occasions such exceptions being as necessary to the subject of our present conference as they would have been superfluous and unseasonable in the former now the difference in these two conversations is precisely the distinction to be taken in interpreting those passages of scripture concerning which we are debating they inculcate the duty they do not describe the extent of it they enforce the obligation by the proper sanctions of christianity without intending either to enlarge or contract without considering indeed the limits by which it is bounden this is also the method in which the same apostles enjoin the duty of servants to their masters of children to their parents of wives to their husbands servants be subject to your masters—children obey your parents in all things—wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands the same concise and absolute form of expression occurs in all these precepts the same silence as to any exceptions or distinctions yet no one doubts that the commands of masters parents and husbands are often so immoderate unjust and inconsistent with other obligations that they both may and ought to be resisted in letters or dissertations written professedly upon separate articles of morality we might with more reason have looked for a precise delineation of our duty and some degree of modern accuracy in the rules which were laid down for our direction but in those short collections of practical maxims which compose the conclusion or some small portion of a doctrinal or perhaps controversial epistle we  0  cannot be surprised to find the author more solicitous to impress the duty than curious to enumerate exceptions the consideration of this distinction is alone sufficient to vindicate these passages of scripture from any explanation which may be put upon them in favour of an unlimited passive obedience but if we be permitted to assume a supposition which many commentators proceed upon as a certainty that the first christians privately cherished an opinion that their conversion to christianity entitled them to new immunities to an exemption as of right however they might give way to necessity from the authority of the roman sovereign we are furnished with a still more apt and satisfactory interpretation of the apostles words the two passages apply with great propriety to the refutation of this error they teach the christian convert to obey the magistrate for the lords sake not only for wrath but for conscience sake that there is no power but of god that the powers that be even the present rulers of the roman empire though heathens and usurpers seeing they are in possession of the actual and necessary authority of civil government are ordained of god and consequently entitled to receive obedience from those who profess themselves the peculiar servants of god in a greater certainly not in a less degree than from any others they briefly describe the office of civil governors the punishment of evildoers and the praise of them that do well from which description of the use of government they justly infer the duty of subjection which duty being as extensive as the reason upon which it is founded belongs to christians no less than to the heathen members of the community if it be admitted that the two apostles wrote with a view to this particular question it will be confessed that their words cannot be transferred to a question totally different from this with any certainty of carrying along with us their authority and intention there exists no resemblance between the case of a primitive convert who disputed the  0  jurisdiction of the roman government over a disciple of christianity and his who acknowledging the general authority of the state over all its subjects doubts whether that authority be not in some important branch of it so ill constituted or abused as to warrant the endeavours of the people to bring about a reformation by force nor can we judge what reply the apostles would have made to this second question if it had been proposed to them from any thing they have delivered upon the first any more than in the two consultations above described it could be known beforehand what i would say in the latter from the answer which i gave to the former the only defect in this account is that neither the scriptures nor any subsequent history of the early ages of the church furnish any direct attestation of the existence of such disaffected sentiments amongst the primitive converts they supply indeed some circumstances which render probable the opinion that extravagant notions of the political rights of the christian state were at that time entertained by many proselytes to the religion from the question proposed to christ is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar it may be presumed that doubts had been started in the jewish schools concerning the obligation or even the lawfulness of submission to the roman yoke the accounts delivered by josephus of various insurrections of the jews of that and the following age excited by this principle or upon this pretence confirm the presumption now as the christians were at first chiefly taken from the jews confounded with them by the rest of the world and from the affinity of the two religions apt to intermix the doctrines of both it is not to be wondered at that a tenet so flattering to the selfimportance of those who embraced it should have been communicated to the new institution again the teachers of christianity amongst the privileges which their religion conferred upon its professors were wont to extol the liberty into which they were called—in which christ had made them free this liberty   0 which was intended of a deliverance from the various servitude in which they had heretofore lived to the domination of sinful passions to the superstition of the gentile idolatry or the encumbered ritual of the jewish dispensation might by some be interpreted to signify an emancipation from all restraint which was imposed by an authority merely human at least they might be represented by their enemies as maintaining notions of this dangerous tendency to some error or calumny of this kind the words of st peter seem to allude for so is the will of god that with welldoing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men as free and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness ie sedition but as the servants of god after all if any one think this conjecture too feebly supported by testimony to be relied upon in the interpretation of scripture he will then revert to the considerations alleged in the preceding part of this chapter after so copious an account of what we apprehend to be the general design and doctrine of these muchagitated passages little need be added in explanation of particular clauses st paul has said whosoever resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god this phrase the ordinance of god is by many so interpreted as to authorise the most exalted and superstitious ideas of the regal character but surely such interpreters have sacrificed truth to adulation for in the first place the expression as used by st paul is just as applicable to one kind of government and to one kind of succession as to another—to the elective magistrates of a pure republic as to an absolute hereditary monarch in the next place it is not affirmed of the supreme magistrate exclusively that he is the ordinance of god the title whatever it imports belongs to every inferior officer of the state as much as to the highest the divine right of kings is like the divine right of other magistrates—the law of the land or even actual and quiet possession of their office—a right ratified we humbly presume by the divine approbation so     long as obedience to their authority appears to be necessary or conducive to the common welfare princes are ordained of god by virtue only of that general decree by which he assents and adds the sanction of his will to every law of society which promotes his own purpose the communication of human happiness according to which idea of their origin and constitution and without any repugnancy to the words of st paul they are by st peter denominated the ordinance of man chapter   of civil liberty civil liberty is the not being restrained by any law but what conduces in a greater degree to the public welfare to do what we will is natural liberty to do what we will consistently with the interest of the community to which we belong is civil liberty that is to say the only liberty to be desired in a state of civil society i should wish no doubt to be allowed to act in every instance as i pleased but i reflect that the rest also of mankind would then do the same in which state of universal independence and selfdirection i should meet with so many checks and obstacles to my own will from the interference and opposition of other mens that not only my happiness but my liberty would be less than whilst the whole community were subject to the dominion of equal laws the boasted liberty of a state of nature exists only in a state of solitude in every kind and degree of union and intercourse with his species it is possible that the liberty of the individual may be augmented by the very laws which restrain it because he may gain more from the limitation of other mens freedom than he suffers by     the diminution of his own natural liberty is the right of common upon a waste civil liberty is the safe exclusive unmolested enjoyment of a cultivated enclosure the definition of civil liberty above laid down imports that the laws of a free people impose no restraints upon the private will of the subject which do not conduce in a greater degree to the public happiness by which it is intimated  st that restraint itself is an evil  dly that this evil ought to be overbalanced by some public advantage  dly that the proof of this advantage lies upon the legislature  thly that a law being found to produce no sensible good effects is a sufficient reason for repealing it as adverse and injurious to the rights of a free citizen without demanding specific evidence of its bad effects this maxim might be remembered with advantage in a revision of many laws of this country especially of the gamelaws of the poorlaws so far as they lay restrictions upon the poor themselves of the laws against papists and dissenters and amongst people enamoured to excess and jealous of their liberty it seems a matter of surprise that this principle has been so imperfectly attended to the degree of actual liberty always bearing according to this account of it a reversed proportion to the number and severity of the restrictions which are either useless or the utility of which does not outweigh the evil of the restraint it follows that every nation possesses some no nation perfect liberty that this liberty may be enjoyed under every form of government that it may be impaired indeed or increased but that it is neither gained nor lost nor recovered by any single regulation change or event whatever that consequently those popular phrases which speak of a free people of a nation of slaves which call one revolution the aera of liberty or another the loss of it with many expressions of a like absolute form are intelligible only in a comparative sense hence also we are enabled to apprehend the distinction between personal and civil liberty a citizen of the freest republic in     the world may be imprisoned for his crimes and though his personal freedom be restrained by bolts and fetters so long as his confinement is the effect of a beneficial public law his civil liberty is not invaded if this instance appear dubious the following will be plainer a passenger from the levant who upon his return to england should be conveyed to a lazaretto by an order of quarantine with whatever impatience he might desire his enlargement and though he saw a guard placed at the door to oppose his escape or even ready to destroy his life if he attempted it would hardly accuse government of encroaching upon his civil freedom nay might perhaps be all the while congratulating himself that he had at length set his foot again in a land of liberty the manifest expediency of the measure not only justifies it but reconciles the most odious confinement with the perfect possession and the loftiest notions of civil liberty and if this be true of the coercion of a prison that it is compatible with a state of civil freedom it cannot with reason be disputed of those more moderate constraints which the ordinary operation of government imposes upon the will of the individual it is not the rigour but the inexpediency of laws and acts of authority which makes them tyrannical there is another idea of civil liberty which though neither so simple nor so accurate as the former agrees better with the signification which the usage of common discourse as well as the example of many respectable writers upon the subject has affixed to the term this idea places liberty in security making it to consist not merely in an actual exemption from the constraint of useless and noxious laws and acts of dominion but in being free from the danger of having such hereafter imposed or exercised thus speaking of the political state of modern europe we are accustomed to say of sweden that she hath lost her liberty by the revolution which lately took place in that country and yet we are assured that the people continue to be governed by the same laws as before or by others which are wiser milder and more equitable what then have they     lost they have lost the power and functions of their diet the constitution of their states and orders whose deliberations and concurrence were required in the formation and establishment of every public law and thereby have parted with the security which they possessed against any attempts of the crown to harass its subjects by oppressive and useless exertions of prerogative the loss of this security we denominate the loss of liberty they have changed not their laws but their legislature not their enjoyment but their safety not their present burthens but their prospects of future grievances and this we pronounce a change from the condition of freemen to that of slaves in like manner in our own country the act of parliament in the reign of henry the eighth which gave to the kings proclamation the force of law has properly been called a complete and formal surrender of the liberty of the nation and would have been so although no proclamation were issued in pursuance of these new powers or none but what was recommended by the highest wisdom and utility the security was gone were it probable that the welfare and accommodation of the people would be as studiously and as providently consulted in the edicts of a despotic prince as by the resolutions of a popular assembly then would an absolute form of government be no less free than the purest democracy the different degree of care and knowledge of the public interest which may reasonably be expected from the different form and composition of the legislature constitutes the distinction in respect of liberty as well between these two extremes as between all the intermediate modifications of civil government the definitions which have been framed of civil liberty and which have become the subject of much unnecessary altercation are most of them adapted to this idea thus one political writer makes the very essence of the subjects liberty to consist in his being governed by no laws but those to which he hath actually consented another is satisfied with an indirect and virtual consent another     again places civil liberty in the separation of the legislative and executive offices of government another in the being governed by law that is by known preconstituted inflexible rules of action and adjudication a fifth in the exclusive right of the people to tax themselves by their own representatives a sixth in the freedom and purity of elections of representatives a seventh in the control which the democratic party of the constitution possesses over the military establishment concerning which and some other similar accounts of civil liberty it may be observed that they all labour under one inaccuracy viz that they describe not so much liberty itself as the safeguards and preservatives of liberty for example a mans being governed by no laws but those to which he has given his consent were it practicable is no otherwise necessary to the enjoyment of civil liberty than as it affords a probable security against the dictation of laws imposing superfluous restrictions upon his private will this remark is applicable to the rest the diversity of these definitions will not surprise us when we consider that there is no contrariety or opposition amongst them whatever for by how many different provisions and precautions civil liberty is fenced and protected so many different accounts of liberty itself all sufficiently consistent with truth and with each other may according to this mode of explaining the term be framed and adopted truth cannot be offended by a definition but propriety may in which view those definitions of liberty ought to be rejected which by making that essential to civil freedom which is unattainable in experience inflame expectations that can never be gratified and disturb the public content with complaints which no wisdom or benevolence of government can remove it will not be thought extraordinary that an idea which occurs so much oftener as the subject of panegyric and careless declamation than of just reasoning or correct knowledge should be attended with uncertainty and confusion or that it should be found     impossible to contrive a definition which may include the numerous unsettled and evervarying significations which the term is made to stand for and at the same time accord with the condition and experience of social life of the two ideas that have been stated of civil liberty whichever we assume and whatever reasoning we found upon them concerning its extent nature value and preservation this is the conclusion—that that people government and constitution is the freest which makes the best provision for the enacting of expedient and salutary laws chapter   of different forms of government as a series of appeals must be finite there necessarily exists in every government a power from which the constitution has provided no appeal and which power for that reason may be termed absolute omnipotent uncontrollable arbitrary despotic and is alike so in all countries the person or assembly in whom this power resides is called the sovereign or the supreme power of the state since to the same power universally appertains the office of establishing public laws it is called also the legislature of the state a government receives its denomination from the form of the legislature which form is likewise what we commonly mean by the constitution of a country political writers enumerate three principal forms of government which however are to be regarded rather as the simple forms by some combination and intermixture of which all actual governments are composed than as anywhere existing in a pure and elementary state these forms are     i despotism or absolute monarchy where the legislature is in a single person ii an aristocracy where the legislature is in a select assembly the members of which either fill up by election the vacancies in their own body or succeed to their places in it by inheritance property tenure of certain lands or in respect of some personal right or qualification iii a republic or democracy where the people at large either collectively or by representation constitute the legislature the separate advantages of monarchy are unity of counsel activity decision secrecy despatch the military strength and energy which result from these qualities of government the exclusion of popular and aristocratical contentions the preventing by a known rule of succession of all competition for the supreme power and thereby repressing the hopes intrigues and dangerous ambition of aspiring citizens the mischiefs or rather the dangers of monarchy are tyranny expense exaction military domination unnecessary wars waged to gratify the passions of an individual risk of the character of the reigning prince ignorance in the governors of the interests and accommodation of the people and a consequent deficiency of salutary regulations want of constancy and uniformity in the rules of government and proceeding from thence insecurity of person and property the separate advantage of an aristocracy consists in the wisdom which may be expected from experience and education—a permanent council naturally possesses experience and the members who succeed to their places in it by inheritance will probably be trained and educated with a view to the stations which they are destined by their birth to occupy the mischiefs of an aristocracy are dissensions in the ruling orders of the state which from the want of a common superior are     liable to proceed to the most desperate extremities oppression of the lower orders by the privileges of the higher and by laws partial to the separate interest of the lawmakers the advantages of a republic are liberty or exemption from needless restrictions equal laws regulations adapted to the wants and circumstances of the people public spirit frugality averseness to war the opportunities which democratic assemblies afford to men of every description of producing their abilities and counsels to public observation and the exciting thereby and calling forth to the service of the commonwealth the faculties of its best citizens the evils of a republic are dissension tumults faction the attempts of powerful citizens to possess themselves of the empire the confusion rage and clamour which are the inevitable consequences of assembling multitudes and of propounding questions of state to the discussion of the people the delay and disclosure of public counsels and designs and the imbecility of measures retarded by the necessity of obtaining the consent of numbers lastly the oppression of the provinces which are not admitted to a participation in the legislative power a mixed government is composed by the combination of two or more of the simple forms of government above described—and in whatever proportion each form enters into the constitution of a government in the same proportion may both the advantages and evils which we have attributed to that form be expected that is those are the uses to be maintained and cultivated in each part of the constitution and these are the dangers to be provided against in each thus if secrecy and despatch be truly enumerated amongst the separate excellencies of regal government then a mixed government which retains monarchy in one part of its constitution should be careful that the other estates of the empire do not by an officious and inquisitive interference with the executive functions which are or ought to be reserved to the administration     of the prince interpose delays or divulge what it is expedient to conceal on the other hand if profusion exaction military domination and needless wars be justly accounted natural properties of monarchy in its simple unqualified form then are these the objects to which in a mixed government the aristocratic and popular part of the constitution ought to direct their vigilance the dangers against which they should raise and fortify their barriers these are departments of sovereignty over which a power of inspection and control ought to be deposited with the people the same observation may be repeated of all the other advantages and inconveniences which have been ascribed to the several simple forms of government and affords a rule whereby to direct the construction improvements and administration of mixed governments—subjected however to this remark that a quality sometimes results from the conjunction of two simple forms of government which belongs not to the separate existence of either thus corruption which has no place in an absolute monarchy and little in a pure republic is sure to gain admission into a constitution which divides the supreme power between an executive magistrate and a popular council an hereditary monarchy is universally to be preferred to an elective monarchy the confession of every writer on the subject of civil government the experience of ages the example of poland and of the papal dominions seem to place this amongst the few indubitable maxims which the science of politics admits of a crown is too splendid a prize to be conferred upon merit the passions or interests of the electors exclude all consideration of the qualities of the competitors the same observation holds concerning the appointments to any office which is attended with a great share of power or emolument nothing is gained by a popular choice worth the dissensions tumults and interruption of regular industry with which it is inseparably attended add to this that a king who owes   0 his elevation to the event of a contest or to any other cause than a fixed rule of succession will be apt to regard one part of his subjects as the associates of his fortune and the other as conquered foes nor should it be forgotten amongst the advantages of an hereditary monarchy that as plans of national improvement and reform are seldom brought to maturity by the exertions of a single reign a nation cannot attain to the degree of happiness and prosperity to which it is capable of being carried unless an uniformity of counsels a consistency of public measures and designs be continued through a succession of ages this benefit may be expected with greater probability where the supreme power descends in the same race and where each prince succeeds in some sort to the aim pursuits and disposition of his ancestor than if the crown at every change devolve upon a stranger whose first care will commonly be to pull down what his predecessor had built up and to substitute systems of administration which must in their turn give way to the more favourite novelties of the next successor aristocracies are of two kinds first where the power of the nobility belongs to them in their collective capacity alone that is where although the government reside in an assembly of the order yet the members of that assembly separately and individually possess no authority or privilege beyond the rest of the community—this describes the constitution of venice secondly where the nobles are severally invested with great personal power and immunities and where the power of the senate is little more than the aggregated power of the individuals who compose it—this is the constitution of poland of these two forms of government the first is more tolerable than the last for although the members of a senate should many or even all of them be profligate enough to abuse the authority of their stations in the prosecution of private designs yet not being all under a temptation to the same injustice not having all the same end to gain it would still be difficult to     obtain the consent of a majority to any specific act of oppression which the iniquity of an individual might prompt him to propose or if the will were the same the power is more confined one tyrant whether the tyranny reside in a single person or a senate cannot exercise oppression at so many places at the same time as it may be carried on by the dominion of a numerous nobility over their respective vassals and dependants of all species of domination this is the most odious the freedom and satisfaction of private life are more constrained and harassed by it than by the most vexatious law or even by the lawless will of an arbitrary monarch from whose knowledge and from whose injustice the greatest part of his subjects are removed by their distance or concealed by their obscurity europe exhibits more than one modern example where the people aggrieved by the exactions or provoked by the enormities of their immediate superiors have joined with the reigning prince in the overthrow of the aristocracy deliberately exchanging their condition for the miseries of despotism about the middle of the last century the commons of denmark weary of the oppressions which they had long suffered from the nobles and exasperated by some recent insults presented themselves at the foot of the throne with a formal offer of their consent to establish unlimited dominion in the king the revolution in sweden still more lately brought about with the acquiescence not to say the assistance of the people owed its success to the same cause namely to the prospect of deliverance that it afforded from the tyranny which their nobles exercised under the old constitution in england the people beheld the depression of the barons under the house of tudor with satisfaction although they saw the crown acquiring thereby a power which no limitations that the constitution had then provided were likely to confine the lesson to be drawn from such events is this that a mixed government which admits a patrician     order into its constitution ought to circumscribe the personal privileges of the nobility especially claims of hereditary jurisdiction and local authority with a jealousy equal to the solicitude with which it wishes its own preservation for nothing so alienates the minds of the people from the government under which they live by a perpetual sense of annoyance and inconveniency or so prepares them for the practices of an enterprising prince or a factious demagogue as the abuse which almost always accompanies the existence of separate immunities amongst the inferior but by no means inconsiderable advantages of a democratic constitution or of a constitution in which the people partake of the power of legislation the following should not be neglected i the direction which it gives to the education studies and pursuits of the superior orders of the community the share which this has in forming the public manners and national character is very important in countries in which the gentry are excluded from all concern in the government scarcely any thing is left which leads to advancement but the profession of arms they who do not addict themselves to this profession and miserable must that country be which constantly employs the military service of a great proportion of any order of its subjects are commonly lost by the mere want of object and destination that is they either fall without reserve into the more sottish habits of animal gratification or entirely devote themselves to the attainment of those futile arts and decorations which compose the business and recommendations of a court on the other hand where the whole or any effective portion of civil power is possessed by a popular assembly more serious pursuits will be encouraged purer morals and a more intellectual character will engage the public esteem those faculties which qualify men for deliberation and debate and which are the fruit of sober habits of early and longcontinued application     will be roused and animated by the reward which of all others most readily awakens the ambition of the human mind—political dignity and importance ii popular elections procure to the common people courtesy from their superiors that contemptuous and overbearing insolence with which the lower orders of the community are wont to be treated by the higher is greatly mitigated where the people have something to give the assiduity with which their favour is sought upon these occasions serves to generate settled habits of condescension and respect and as human life is more embittered by affronts than injuries whatever contributes to procure mildness and civility of manners towards those who are most liable to suffer from a contrary behaviour corrects with the pride in a great measure the evil of inequality and deserves to be accounted among the most generous institutions of social life iii the satisfactions which the people in free governments derive from the knowledge and agitation of political subjects such as the proceedings and debates of the senate the conduct and characters of ministers the revolutions intrigues and contentions of parties and in general from the discussion of public measures questions and occurrences subjects of this sort excite just enough of interest and emotion to afford a moderate engagement to the thoughts without rising to any painful degree of anxiety or ever leaving a fixed operation upon the spirits—and what is this but the end and aim of all those amusements which compose so much of the business of life and of the value of riches for my part and i believe it to be the case with most men who are arrived at the middle age and occupy the middle classes of life had i all the money which i pay in taxes to government at liberty to lay out upon amusement and diversion i know not whether i could make choice of any in which i could find greater pleasure than what i receive from expecting hearing and relating public news reading     parliamentary debates and proceedings canvassing the political arguments projects predictions and intelligence which are conveyed by various channels to every corner of the kingdom these topics exciting universal curiosity and being such as almost every man is ready to form and prepared to deliver his opinion about greatly promote and i think improve conversation they render it more rational and more innocent they supply a substitute for drinking gaming scandal and obscenity now the secrecy the jealousy the solitude and precipitation of despotic governments exclude all this but the loss you say is trifling i know that it is possible to render even the mention of it ridiculous by representing it as the idle employment of the most insignificant part of the nation the folly of villagestatesmen and coffeehouse politicians but i allow nothing to be a trifle which ministers to the harmless gratification of multitudes nor any order of men to be insignificant whose number bears a respectable proportion to the sum of the whole community we have been accustomed to an opinion that a republican form of government suits only with the affairs of a small state which opinion is founded in the consideration that unless the people in every district of the empire be admitted to a share in the national representation the government is not as to them a republic that elections where the constituents are numerous and dispersed through a wide extent of country are conducted with difficulty or rather indeed managed by the intrigues and combinations of a few who are situated near the place of election each voter considering his single suffrage as too minute a portion of the general interest to deserve his care or attendance much less to be worth any opposition to influence and application that whilst we contract the representation within a compass small enough to admit of orderly debate the interest of the constituent becomes too small of the representative too great it is difficult also to     maintain any connexion between them he who represents two hundred thousand is necessarily a stranger to the greatest part of those who elect him and when his interest amongst them ceases to depend upon an acquaintance with their persons and character or a care or knowledge of their affairs when such a representative finds the treasures and honours of a great empire at the disposal of a few and himself one of the few there is little reason to hope that he will not prefer to his public duty those temptations of personal aggrandisement which his situation offers and which the price of his vote will always purchase all appeal to the people is precluded by the impossibility of collecting a sufficient proportion of their force and numbers the factions and the unanimity of the senate are equally dangerous add to these considerations that in a democratic constitution the mechanism is too complicated and the motions too slow for the operations of a great empire whose defence and government require execution and despatch in proportion to the magnitude extent and variety of its concerns there is weight no doubt in these reasons but much of the objection seems to be done away by the contrivance of a federal republic which distributing the country into districts of a commodious extent and leaving to each district its internal legislation reserves to a convention of the states the adjustment of their relative claims the levying direction and government of the common force of the confederacy the requisition of subsidies for the support of this force the making of peace and war the entering into treaties the regulation of foreign commerce the equalisation of duties upon imports so as to prevent the defrauding the revenue of one province by smuggling articles of taxation from the borders of another and likewise so as to guard against undue partialities in the encouragement of trade to what limits such a republic might without inconveniency enlarge its dominions by assuming neighbouring provinces into the confederation or how far     it is capable of uniting the liberty of a small commonwealth with the safety of a powerful empire or whether amongst coordinate powers dissensions and jealousies would not be likely to arise which for want of a common superior might proceed to fatal extremities are questions upon which the records of mankind do not authorise us to decide with tolerable certainty the experiment is about to be tried in america upon a large scale chapter   of the british constitution by the constitution of a country is meant so much of its law as relates to the designation and form of the legislature the rights and functions of the several parts of the legislative body the construction office and jurisdiction of courts of justice the constitution is one principal division section or title of the code of public laws distinguished from the rest only by the superior importance of the subject of which it treats therefore the terms constitutional and unconstitutional mean legal and illegal the distinction and the ideas which these terms denote are founded in the same authority with the law of the land upon any other subject and to be ascertained by the same inquiries in england the system of public jurisprudence is made up of acts of parliament of decisions of courts of law and of immemorial usages consequently these are the principles of which the english constitution itself consists the sources from which all our knowledge of its nature and limitations is to be deduced and the authorities to which all appeal ought to be made and by which every constitutional doubt and question can alone be decided this plain and intelligible definition is the more necessary to be preserved in our thoughts as some writers upon the subject absurdly confound what is constitutional with what is expedient     pronouncing forthwith a measure to be unconstitutional which they adjudge in any respect to be detrimental or dangerous whilst others again ascribe a kind of transcendent authority or mysterious sanctity to the constitution as if it were founded in some higher original than that which gives force and obligation to the ordinary laws and statutes of the realm or were inviolable on any other account than its intrinsic utility an act of parliament in england can never be unconstitutional in the strict and proper acceptation of the term in a lower sense it may viz when it militates with the spirit contradicts the analogy or defeats the provision of other laws made to regulate the form of government even that flagitious abuse of their trust by which a parliament of henry the eighth conferred upon the kings proclamation the authority of law was unconstitutional only in this latter sense most of those who treat of the british constitution consider it as a scheme of government formally planned and contrived by our ancestors in some certain aera of our national history and as set up in pursuance of such regular plan and design something of this sort is secretly supposed or referred to in the expressions of those who speak of the principles of the constitution of bringing back the constitution to its first principles of restoring it to its original purity or primitive model now this appears to me an erroneous conception of the subject no such plan was ever formed consequently no such first principles original model or standard exist i mean there never was a date or point of time in our history when the government of england was to be set up anew and when it was referred to any single person or assembly or committee to frame a charter for the future government of the country or when a constitution so prepared and digested was by common consent received and established in the time of the civil wars or rather between the death of charles the first and the restoration of his son many such projects were published but none     were carried into execution the great charter and the bill of rights were wise and strenuous efforts to obtain security against certain abuses of regal power by which the subject had been formerly aggrieved but these were either of them much too partial modifications of the constitution to give it a new original the constitution of england like that of most countries of europe hath grown out of occasion and emergency from the fluctuating policy of different ages from the contentions successes interests and opportunities of different orders and parties of men in the community it resembles one of those old mansions which instead of being built all at once after a regular plan and according to the rules of architecture at present established has been reared in different ages of the art has been altered from time to time and has been continually receiving additions and repairs suited to the taste fortune or conveniency of its successive proprietors in such a building we look in vain for the elegance and proportion for the just order and correspondence of parts which we expect in a modern edifice and which external symmetry after all contributes much more perhaps to the amusement of the beholder than the accommodation of the inhabitant in the british and possibly in all other constitutions there exists a wide difference between the actual state of the government and the theory the one results from the other but still they are different when we contemplate the theory of the british government we see the king invested with the most absolute personal impunity with a power of rejecting laws which have been resolved upon by both houses of parliament of conferring by his charter upon any set or succession of men he pleases the privilege of sending representatives into one house of parliament as by his immediate appointment he can place whom he will in the other what is this a foreigner might ask but a more circuitous despotism yet when we turn our attention from the legal extent to the actual     exercise of royal authority in england we see these formidable prerogatives dwindled into mere ceremonies and in their stead a sure and commanding influence of which the constitution it seems is totally ignorant growing out of that enormous patronage which the increased territory and opulence of the empire have placed in the disposal of the executive magistrate upon questions of reform the habit of reflection to be encouraged is a sober comparison of the constitution under which we live—not with models of speculative perfection but with the actual chance of obtaining a better this turn of thought will generate a political disposition equally removed from that puerile admiration of present establishments which sees no fault and can endure no change and that distempered sensibility which is alive only to perceptions of inconveniency and is too impatient to be delivered from the uneasiness which it feels to compute either the peril or expense of the remedy political innovations commonly produce many effects beside those that are intended the direct consequence is often the least important incidental remote and unthoughtof evil or advantages frequently exceed the good that is designed or the mischief that is foreseen it is from the silent and unobserved operation from the obscure progress of causes set at work for different purposes that the greatest revolutions take their rise when elizabeth and her immediate successor applied themselves to the encouragement and regulation of trade by many wise laws they knew not that together with wealth and industry they were diffusing a consciousness of strength and independency which would not long endure under the forms of a mixed government the dominion of arbitrary princes when it was debated whether the mutiny act the law by which the army is governed and maintained should be temporary or perpetual little else probably occurred to the advocates of an annual bill than the expediency of retaining a control over the most dangerous prerogative of the   0 crown—the direction and command of a standing army whereas in its effect this single reservation has altered the whole frame and quality of the british constitution for since in consequence of the military system which prevails in neighbouring and rival nations as well as on account of the internal exigencies of government a standing army has become essential to the safety and administration of the empire it enables parliament by discontinuing this necessary provision so to enforce its resolutions upon any other subject as to render the kings dissent to a law which has received the approbation of both houses too dangerous an experiment any longer to be advised a contest between the king and parliament cannot now be persevered in without a dissolution of the government lastly when the constitution conferred upon the crown the nomination to all employments in the public service the authors of this arrangement were led to it by the obvious propriety of leaving to a master the choice of his servants and by the manifest inconveniency of engaging the national council upon every vacancy in those personal contests which attend elections to places of honour and emolument our ancestors did not observe that this disposition added an influence to the regal office which as the number and value of public employments increased would supersede in a great measure the forms and change the character of the ancient constitution they knew not what the experience and reflection of modern ages have discovered that patronage universally is power that he who possesses in a sufficient degree the means of gratifying the desires of mankind after wealth and distinction by whatever checks and forms his authority may be limited or disguised will direct the management of public affairs whatever be the mechanism of the political engine he will guide the motion these instances are adduced in order to illustrate the proposition which we laid down that in politics the most important and permanent effects have for the most part been incidental     and unforeseen and this proposition we inculcate for the sake of the caution which teaches that changes ought not to be adventured upon without a comprehensive discernment of the consequences—without a knowledge as well of the remote tendency as of the immediate design the courage of a statesman should resemble that of a commander who however regardless of personal danger never forgets that with his own he commits the lives and fortunes of a multitude and who does not consider it as any proof of zeal or valour to stake the safety of other men upon the success of a perilous or desperate enterprise there is one end of civil government peculiar to a good constitution namely the happiness of its subjects there is another end essential to a good government but common to it with many bad ones—its own preservation observing that the best form of government would be defective which did not provide for its own permanency in our political reasonings we consider all such provisions as expedient and are content to accept as a sufficient ground for a measure or law that it is necessary or conducive to the preservation of the constitution yet in truth such provisions are absolutely expedient and such an excuse final only whilst the constitution is worth preserving that is until it can be exchanged for a better i premise this distinction because many things in the english as in every constitution are to be vindicated and accounted for solely from their tendency to maintain the government in its present state and the several parts of it in possession of the powers which the constitution has assigned to them and because i would wish it to be remarked that such a consideration is always subordinate to another—the value and usefulness of the constitution itself the government of england which has been sometimes called a mixed government sometimes a limited monarchy is formed by a combination of the three regular species of government the     monarchy residing in the king the aristocracy in the house of lords and the republic being represented by the house of commons the perfection intended by such a scheme of government is to unite the advantages of the several simple forms and to exclude the inconveniencies to what degree this purpose is attained or attainable in the british constitution wherein it is lost sight of or neglected and by what means it may in any part be promoted with better success the reader will be enabled to judge by a separate recollection of these advantages and inconveniencies as enumerated in the preceding chapter and a distinct application of each to the political condition of this country we will present our remarks upon the subject in a brief account of the expedients by which the british constitution provides  st for the interest of its subjects  dly for its own preservation the contrivances for the first of these purposes are the following in order to promote the establishment of salutary public laws every citizen of the state is capable of becoming a member of the senate and every senator possesses the right of propounding to the deliberation of the legislature whatever law he pleases every district of the empire enjoys the privilege of choosing representatives informed of the interests and circumstances and desires of their constituents and entitled by their situation to communicate that information to the national council the meanest subject has some one whom he can call upon to bring forward his complaints and requests to public attention by annexing the right of voting for members of the house of commons to different qualifications in different places each order and profession of men in the community become virtually represented that is men of all orders and professions statesmen courtiers countrygentlemen lawyers merchants manufacturers soldiers sailors interested in the prosperity and experienced in     the occupation of their respective professions obtain seats in parliament the elections at the same time are so connected with the influence of landed property as to afford a certainty that a considerable number of men of great estates will be returned to parliament and are also so modified that men the most eminent and successful in their respective professions are the most likely by their riches or the weight of their stations to prevail in these competitions the number fortune and quality of the members the variety of interests and characters amongst them above all the temporary duration of their power and the change of men which every new election produces are so many securities to the public as well against the subjection of their judgements to any external dictation as against the formation of a junto in their own body sufficiently powerful to govern their decisions the representatives are so intermixed with the constituents and the constituents with the rest of the people that they cannot without a partiality too flagrant to be endured impose any burthen upon the subject in which they do not share themselves nor scarcely can they adopt an advantageous regulation in which their own interests will not participate of the advantage the proceedings and debates of parliament and the parliamentary conduct of each representative are known by the people at large the representative is so far dependent upon the constituent and political importance upon public favour that a member of parliament cannot more effectually recommend himself to eminence and advancement in the state than by contriving and patronising laws of public utility when intelligence of the condition wants and occasions of the people is thus collected from every quarter when such a variety of invention and so many understandings are set at work upon     the subject it may be presumed that the most eligible expedient remedy or improvement will occur to some one or other and when a wise counsel or beneficial regulation is once suggested it may be expected from the disposition of an assembly so constituted as the british house of commons is that it cannot fail of receiving the approbation of a majority to prevent those destructive contentions for the supreme power which are sure to take place where the members of the state do not live under an acknowledged head and a known rule of succession to preserve the people in tranquillity at home by a speedy and vigorous execution of the laws to protect their interest abroad by strength and energy in military operations by those advantages of decision secrecy and despatch which belong to the resolutions of monarchical councils—for these purposes the constitution has committed the executive government to the administration and limited authority of an hereditary king in the defence of the empire in the maintenance of its power dignity and privileges with foreign nations in the advancement of its trade by treaties and conventions and in the providing for the general administration of municipal justice by a proper choice and appointment of magistrates the inclination of the king and of the people usually coincides in this part therefore of the regal office the constitution entrusts the prerogative with ample powers the dangers principally to be apprehended from regal government relate to the two articles taxation and punishment in every form of government from which the people are excluded it is the interest of the governors to get as much and of the governed to give as little as they can the power also of punishment in the hands of an arbitrary prince oftentimes becomes an engine of extortion jealousy and revenge wisely therefore hath the british constitution guarded the safety of the people in these two points by the most studious precautions     upon that of taxation every law which by the remotest construction may be deemed to levy money upon the property of the subject must originate that is must first be proposed and assented to in the house of commons by which regulation accompanying the weight which that assembly possesses in all its functions the levying of taxes is almost exclusively reserved to the popular part of the constitution who it is presumed will not tax themselves nor their fellowsubjects without being first convinced of the necessity of the aids which they grant the application also of the public supplies is watched with the same circumspection as the assessment many taxes are annual the produce of others is mortgaged or appropriated to specific services the expenditure of all of them is accounted for in the house of commons as computations of the charge of the purpose for which they are wanted are previously submitted to the same tribunal in the infliction of punishment the power of the crown and of the magistrate appointed by the crown is confined by the most precise limitations the guilt of the offender must be pronounced by twelve men of his own order indifferently chosen out of the county where the offence was committed the punishment or the limits to which the punishment may be extended are ascertained and affixed to the crime by laws which know not the person of the criminal and whereas arbitrary or clandestine confinement is the injury most to be dreaded from the strong hand of the executive government because it deprives the prisoner at once of protection and defence and delivers him into the power and to the malicious or interested designs of his enemies the constitution has provided against this danger with double solicitude the ancient writ of habeas corpus the habeascorpus act of charles the second and the practice and determinations of our sovereign courts of justice     founded upon these laws afford a complete remedy for every conceivable case of illegal imprisonment treason being that charge under colour of which the destruction of an obnoxious individual is often sought and government being at all times more immediately a party in the prosecution the law beside the general care with which it watches over the safety of the accused in this case sensible of the unequal contest in which the subject is engaged has assisted his defence with extraordinary indulgences by two statutes enacted since the revolution every person indicted for high treason shall have a copy of his indictment a list of the witnesses to be produced and of the jury impanneled delivered to him ten days before the trial he is also permitted to make his defence by counsel—privileges which are not allowed to the prisoner in a trial for any other crime and what is of more importance to the party than all the rest the testimony     of two witnesses at the least is required to convict a person of treason whereas one positive witness is sufficient in almost every other species of accusation we proceed in the second place to inquire in what manner the constitution has provided for its own preservation that is in what manner each part of the legislature is secured in the exercise of the powers assigned to it from the encroachments of the other parts this security is sometimes called the balance of the constitution and the political equilibrium which this phrase denotes consists in two contrivances—a balance of power and a balance of interest by a balance of power is meant that there is no power possessed by one part of the legislature the abuse or excess of which is not checked by some antagonist power residing in another part thus the power of the two houses of parliament to frame laws is checked by the kings negative that if laws subversive of regal government should obtain the consent of parliament the reigning prince by interposing his prerogative may save the necessary rights and authority of his station on the other hand the arbitrary application of this negative is checked by the privilege which parliament possesses of refusing supplies of money to the exigencies of the kings administration the constitutional maxim that the king can do no wrong is balanced by another maxim not less constitutional that the illegal commands of the king do not justify those who assist or concur in carrying them into execution and by a second rule subsidiary to this that the acts of the crown acquire not a legal force until authenticated by the subscription of some of its great officers the wisdom of this contrivance is worthy of observation as the king could not be punished without a civil war the constitution exempts his person from trial or account but lest this impunity should encourage a licentious exercise of dominion various obstacles are opposed to the private will of the sovereign when directed to illegal objects the pleasure of the crown must be     announced with certain solemnities and attested by certain officers of state in some cases the royal order must be signified by a secretary of state in others it must pass under the privy seal and in many under the great seal and when the kings command is regularly published no mischief can be achieved by it without the ministry and compliance of those to whom it is directed now all who either concur in an illegal order by authenticating its publication with their seal or subscription or who in any manner assist in carrying it into execution subject themselves to prosecution and punishment for the part they have taken and are not permitted to plead or produce the command of the king in justification of their obedience but farther the power of the crown to direct the military force of the kingdom is balanced by the annual necessity of resorting to parliament for the maintenance and government of that force the power of the king to declare war is checked by the privilege of the house of commons to grant or withhold the supplies by which the war must be carried on the kings choice of his ministers is controlled by the obligation he is under of appointing those men to offices in the state who are found capable of managing the affairs of his government with the two houses of parliament which consideration imposes such a necessity upon the crown as hath in a great measure subdued the influence of     favouritism insomuch that it is become no uncommon spectacle in this country to see men promoted by the king to the highest offices and richest preferments which he has in his power to bestow who have been distinguished by their opposition to his personal inclinations by the balance of interest which accompanies and gives efficacy to the balance of power is meant this—that the respective interests of the three estates of the empire are so disposed and adjusted that whichever of the three shall attempt any encroachment the other two will unite in resisting it if the king should endeavour to extend his authority by contracting the power and privileges of the commons the house of lords would see their own dignity endangered by every advance which the crown made to independency upon the resolutions of parliament the admission of arbitrary power is no less formidable to the grandeur of the aristocracy than it is fatal to the liberty of the republic that is it would reduce the nobility from the hereditary share they possess in the national councils in which their real greatness consists to the being made a part of the empty pageantry of a despotic court on the other hand if the house of commons should intrench upon the distinct province or usurp the established prerogative of the crown the house of lords would receive an instant alarm from every new stretch of popular power in every contest in which the king may be engaged with the representative body in defence of his established share of authority he will find a sure ally in the collective power of the nobility an attachment to the monarchy from which they derive their own distinction the allurements of a court in the habits and with the sentiments of which they have been brought up their hatred of equality and of all levelling pretensions which may ultimately affect the privileges or even the existence of their order in short every principle and every prejudice which are wont to actuate human conduct will determine their choice to the side and   0 support of the crown lastly if the nobles themselves should attempt to revive the superiorities which their ancestors exercised under the feudal constitution the king and the people would alike remember how the one had been insulted and the other enslaved by that barbarous tyranny they would forget the natural opposition of their views and inclinations when they saw themselves threatened with the return of a domination which was odious and intolerable to both the reader will have observed that in describing the british constitution little notice has been taken of the house of lords the proper use and design of this part of the constitution are the following first to enable the king by his right of bestowing the peerage to reward the servants of the public in a manner most grateful to them and at a small expense to the nation secondly to fortify the power and to secure the stability of regal government by an order of men naturally allied to its interests and thirdly to answer a purpose which though of superior importance to the other two does not occur so readily to our observation namely to stem the progress of popular fury large bodies of men are subject to sudden phrensies opinions are sometimes circulated amongst a multitude without proof or examination acquiring confidence and reputation merely by being repeated from one to another and passions founded upon these opinions diffusing themselves with a rapidity which can neither be accounted for nor resisted may agitate a country with the most violent commotions now the only way to stop the fermentation is to divide the mass that is to erect different orders in the community with separate prejudices and interests and this may occasionally become the use of an     hereditary nobility invested with a share of legislation averse to those prejudices which actuate the minds of the vulgar accustomed to condemn the clamour of the populace disdaining to receive laws and opinions from their inferiors in rank they will oppose resolutions which are founded in the folly and violence of the lower part of the community were the voice of the people always dictated by reflection did every man or even one man in a hundred think for himself or actually consider the measure he was about to approve or censure or even were the common people tolerably steadfast in the judgement which they formed i should hold the interference of a superior order not only superfluous but wrong for when every thing is allowed to difference of rank and education which the actual state of these advantages deserves that after all is most likely to be right and expedient which appears to be so to the separate judgement and decision of a great majority of the nation at least that in general is right for them which is agreeable to their fixed opinions and desires but when we observe what is urged as the public opinion to be in truth the opinion only or perhaps the feigned profession of a few crafty leaders that the numbers who join in the cry serve only to swell and multiply the sound without any accession of judgement or exercise of understanding and that oftentimes the wisest counsels have been thus overborne by tumult and uproar—we may conceive occasions to arise in which the commonwealth may be saved by the reluctance of the nobility to adopt the caprices or to yield to the vehemence of the common people in expecting this advantage from an order of nobles we do not suppose the nobility to be more unprejudiced than others we only suppose that their prejudices will be different from and may occasionally counteract those of others if the personal privileges of the peerage which are usually so many injuries to the rest of the community be restrained i see little inconveniency in the increase of its number for it is only     dividing the same quantity of power amongst more hands which is rather favourable to public freedom than otherwise the admission of a small number of ecclesiastics into the house of lords is but an equitable compensation to the clergy for the exclusion of their order from the house of commons they are a set of men considerable by their number and property as well as by their influence and the duties of their station yet whilst every other profession has those amongst the national representatives who being conversant in the same occupation are able to state and naturally disposed to support the rights and interests of the class and calling to which they belong the clergy alone are deprived of this advantage which hardship is made up to them by introducing the prelacy into parliament and if bishops from gratitude or expectation be more obsequious to the will of the crown than those who possess great temporal inheritances they are properly inserted into that part of the constitution from which much or frequent resistance to the measures of government is not expected i acknowledge that i perceive no sufficient reason for exempting the persons of members of either house of parliament from arrest for debt the counsels or suffrage of a single senator especially of one who in the management of his own affairs may justly be suspected of a want of prudence or honesty can seldom be so necessary to those of the public as to justify a departure from that wholesome policy by which the laws of a commercial state punish and stigmatize insolvency but whatever reason may be pleaded for their personal immunity when this privilege of parliament is extended to domestics and retainers or when it is permitted to impede or delay the course of judicial proceedings it becomes an absurd sacrifice of equal justice to imaginary dignity there is nothing in the british constitution so remarkable as the irregularity of the popular representation the house of commons consists of five hundred and fiftyeight members     of whom two hundred are elected by seven thousand constituents so that a majority of these seven thousand without any reasonable title to superior weight or influence in the state may under certain circumstances decide a question against the opinion of as many millions or to place the same object in another point of view if my estate be situated in one county of the kingdom i possess the tenthousandth part of a single representative if in another the thousandth if in a particular district i may be one in twenty who choose two representatives if in a still more favoured spot i may enjoy the right of appointing two myself if i have been born or dwell or have served an apprenticeship in one town i am represented in the national assembly by two deputies in the choice of whom i exercise an actual and sensible share of power if accident has thrown my birth or habitation or service into another town i have no representative at all nor more power or concern in the election of those who make the laws by which i am governed than if i was a subject of the grand signior—and this partiality subsists without any pretence whatever of merit or of propriety to justify the preference of one place to another or thirdly to describe the state of national representation as it exists in reality it may be affirmed i believe with truth that about one half of the house of commons obtain their seats in that assembly by the election of the people the other half by purchase or by the nomination of single proprietors of great estates this is a flagrant incongruity in the constitution but it is one of those objections which strike most forcibly at first sight the effect of all reasoning upon the subject is to diminish the first impression on which account it deserves the more attentive examination that we may be assured before we adventure upon a reformation that the magnitude of the evil justifies the danger of the experiment in a few remarks that follow we would be understood in the first place to decline all conference with those who wish to alter the form of     government of these kingdoms the reformers with whom we have to do are they who whilst they change this part of the system would retain the rest if any englishman expect more happiness to his country under a republic he may very consistently recommend a newmodelling of elections to parliament because if the king and house of lords were laid aside the present disproportionate representation would produce nothing but a confused and illdigested oligarchy in like manner we waive a controversy with those writers who insist upon representation as a natural right we consider it so far only as a right at all as it conduces to public utility that is as it contributes to the establishment of good laws or as it secures to the people the just administration of these laws these effects depend upon the disposition and abilities of the national counsellors wherefore if men the most likely by their qualifications to know and to promote the public interest be actually returned to parliament it signifies little who return them if the properest persons be elected what matters it by whom they are elected at least no prudent statesman would subvert longestablished or even settled rules of representation without a prospect of procuring wiser or better representatives this then being well observed let us before we seek to obtain any thing more consider duly what we already have we have a house of commons composed of five hundred and fiftyeight members in which number are found the most considerable landholders and merchants of the kingdom the heads of the army the navy and the law the occupiers of great offices in the state     together with many private individuals eminent by their knowledge eloquence or activity now if the country be not safe in such hands in whose may it confide its interests if such a number of such men be liable to the influence of corrupt motives what assembly of men will be secure from the same danger does any new scheme of representation promise to collect together more wisdom or to produce firmer integrity in this view of the subject and attending not to ideas of order and proportion of which many minds are much enamoured but to effects alone we may discover just excuses for those parts of the present representation which appear to a hasty observer most exceptionable and absurd it should be remembered as a maxim extremely applicable to this subject that no order or assembly of men whatever can long maintain their place and authority in a mixed government of which the members do not individually possess a respectable share of personal importance now whatever may be the defects of the present arrangement it infallibly secures a great weight of property to the house of commons by rendering many seats in that house accessible to men of large fortunes and to such men alone by which means those characters are engaged in the defence of the separate rights and interests of this branch of the legislature that are best able to support its claims the constitution of most of the small boroughs especially the burgage tenure contributes though undesignedly to the same effect for the appointment of the representatives we find commonly annexed to certain great inheritances elections purely popular are in this respect uncertain in times of tranquillity the natural ascendancy of wealth will prevail but when the minds of men are inflamed by political dissensions this influence often yields to more impetuous motives the variety of tenures and qualifications upon which the right of voting is founded appears to me a recommendation of the mode which now subsists as it tends to introduce into parliament a corresponding mixture of characters and professions     it has been long observed that conspicuous abilities are most frequently found with the representatives of small boroughs and this is nothing more than what the laws of human conduct might teach us to expect when such boroughs are set to sale those men are likely to become purchasers who are enabled by their talents to make the best of their bargain when a seat is not sold but given by the opulent proprietor of a burgage tenure the patron finds his own interest consulted by the reputation and abilities of the member whom he nominates if certain of the nobility hold the appointment of some part of the house of commons it serves to maintain that alliance between the two branches of the legislature which no good citizen would wish to see dissevered it helps to keep the government of the country in the house of commons in which it would not perhaps long continue to reside if so powerful and wealthy a part of the nation as the peerage compose were excluded from all share and interest in its constitution if there be a few boroughs so circumstanced as to lie at the disposal of the crown whilst the number of such is known and small they may be tolerated with little danger for where would be the impropriety or the inconveniency if the king at once should nominate a limited number of his servants to seats in parliament or what is the same thing if seats in parliament were annexed to the possession of certain of the most efficient and responsible offices in the state the present representation after all these deductions and under the confusion in which it confessedly lies is still in such a degree popular or rather the representatives are so connected with the mass of the community by a society of interests and passions that the will of the people when it is determined permanent and general almost always at length prevails upon the whole in the several plans which have been suggested of an equal or a reformed representation it will be difficult to discover any proposal that has a tendency to throw more of the     business of the nation into the house of commons or to collect a set of men more fit to transact that business or in general more interested in the national happiness and prosperity one consequence however may be expected from these projects namely less flexibility to the influence of the crown and since the diminution of this influence is the declared and perhaps the sole design of the various schemes that have been produced whether for regulating the elections contracting the duration or for purifying the constitution of parliament by the exclusion of placemen and pensioners it is obvious to remark that the more apt and natural as well as the more safe and quiet way of attaining the same end would be by a direct reduction of the patronage of the crown which might be effected to a certain extent without hazarding farther consequences superfluous and exorbitant emoluments of office may not only be suppressed for the present but provisions of law be devised which should for the future restrain within certain limits the number and value of the offices in the donation of the king but whilst we dispute concerning different schemes of reformation all directed to the same end a previous doubt occurs in the debate whether the end itself be good or safe—whether the influence so loudly complained of can be destroyed or even much diminished without danger to the state whilst the zeal of some men beholds this influence with a jealousy which nothing but its entire abolition can appease many wise and virtuous politicians deem a considerable portion of it to be as necessary a part of the british constitution as any other ingredient in the composition to be that indeed which gives cohesion and solidity to the whole were the measures of government say they opposed from nothing but principle government ought to have nothing but the rectitude of its measures to support them but since opposition springs from other motives government must possess an influence to counteract these motives to produce not a bias of the passions but     a neutrality—it must have some weight to cast into the scale to set the balance even it is the nature of power always to press upon the boundaries which confine it licentiousness faction envy impatience of control or inferiority the secret pleasure of mortifying the great or the hope of dispossessing them a constant willingness to question and thwart whatever is dictated or even proposed by another a disposition common to all bodies of men to extend the claims and authority of their orders above all that love of power and of showing it which resides more or less in every human breast and which in popular assemblies is inflamed like every other passion by communication and encouragement these motives added to private designs and resentments cherished also by popular acclamation and operating upon the great share of power already possessed by the house of commons might induce a majority or at least a large party of men in that assembly to unite in endeavouring to draw to themselves the whole government of the state or at least so to obstruct the conduct of public affairs by a wanton and perverse opposition as to render it impossible for the wisest statesman to carry forwards the business of the nation with success or satisfaction some passages of our national history afford grounds for these apprehensions before the accession of james the first or at least during the reigns of his three immediate predecessors the government of england was a government by force that is the king carried his measures in parliament by intimidation a sense of personal danger kept the members of the house of commons in subjection a conjunction of fortunate causes delivered at last the parliament and nation from slavery that overbearing system which had declined in the hands of james expired early in the reign of his son after the restoration there succeeded in its place and since the revolution has been methodically pursued the more successful expedient of influence now we remember what passed between the     loss of terror and the establishment of influence the transactions of that interval whatever we may think of their occasion or effect no friend of regal government would wish to see revived but the affairs of this kingdom afford a more recent attestation to the same doctrine in the british colonies of north america the late assemblies possessed much of the power and constitution of our house of commons the king and government of great britain held no patronage in the country which could create attachment and influence sufficient to counteract that restless arrogating spirit which in popular assemblies when left to itself will never brook an authority that checks and interferes with its own to this cause excited perhaps by some unseasonable provocations we may attribute as to their true and proper original we will not say the misfortunes but the changes that have taken place in the british empire the admonition which such examples suggest will have its weight with those who are content with the general frame of the english constitution and who consider stability amongst the first perfections of any government we protest however against any construction by which what is here said shall be attempted to be applied to the justification of bribery or of any clandestine reward or solicitation whatever the very secrecy of such negotiations confesses or begets a consciousness of guilt which when the mind is once taught to endure without uneasiness the character is prepared for every compliance and there is the greater danger in these corrupt practices as the extent of their operation is unlimited and unknown our apology relates solely to that influence which results from the acceptance or expectation of public preferments nor does the influence which we defend require any sacrifice of personal probity in political above all other subjects the arguments or rather the conjectures on each side of the question are often so equally poised that the wisest judgements may be held in suspense these i call subjects of   0 indifference but again when the subject is not indifferent in itself it will appear such to a great part of those to whom it is proposed for want of information or reflection or experience or of capacity to collect and weigh the reasons by which either side is supported these are subjects of apparent indifference this indifference occurs still more frequently in personal contests in which we do not often discover any reason of public utility for the preference of one competitor to another these cases compose the province of influence that is the decision in these cases will inevitably be determined by influence of some sort or other the only doubt is what influence shall be admitted if you remove the influence of the crown it is only to make way for influence from a different quarter if motives of expectation and gratitude be withdrawn other motives will succeed in their place acting probably in an opposite direction but equally irrelative and external to the proper merits of the question there exist as we have seen passions in the human heart which will always make a strong party against the executive power of a mixed government according as the disposition of parliament is friendly or adverse to the recommendation of the crown in matters which are really or apparently indifferent as indifference hath been now explained the business of the empire will be transacted with ease and convenience or embarrassed with endless contention and difficulty nor is it a conclusion founded in justice or warranted by experience that because men are induced by views of interest to yield their consent to measures concerning which their judgement decides nothing they may be brought by the same influence to act in deliberate opposition to knowledge and duty whoever reviews the operations of government in this country since the revolution will find few even of the most questionable measures of administration about which the bestinstructed judgement might not have doubted at the time but of which we may affirm with certainty they were indifferent to the greatest part of those who concurred in     them from the success or the facility with which they who dealt out the patronage of the crown carried measures like these ought we to conclude that a similar application of honours and emoluments would procure the consent of parliaments to counsels evidently detrimental to the common welfare is there not on the contrary more reason to fear that the prerogative if deprived of influence would not be long able to support itself for when we reflect upon the power of the house of commons to extort a compliance with its resolutions from the other parts of the legislature or to put to death the constitution by a refusal of the annual grants of money to the support of the necessary functions of government—when we reflect also what motives there are which in the vicissitudes of political interests and passions may one day arm and point this power against the executive magistrate when we attend to these considerations we shall be led perhaps to acknowledge that there is not more of paradox than of truth in that important but muchdecried apophthegm that an independent parliament is incompatible with the existence of the monarchy chapter   of the administration of justice the first maxim of a free state is that the laws be made by one set of men and administered by another in other words that the legislative and judicial characters be kept separate when these offices are united in the same person or assembly particular laws are made for particular cases springing oftentimes from partial motives and directed to private ends whilst they are kept separate general laws are made by one body of men without foreseeing whom they may affect and when made must be applied by the other let them affect whom they will     for the sake of illustration let it be supposed in this country either that parliaments being laid aside the courts of westminsterhall made their own laws or that the two houses of parliament with the king at their head tried and decided causes at their bar it is evident in the first place that the decisions of such a judicature would be so many laws and in the second place that when the parties and the interests to be affected by the law were known the inclinations of the lawmakers would inevitably attach on one side or the other and that where there were neither any fixed rules to regulate their determinations nor any superior power to control their proceedings these inclinations would interfere with the integrity of public justice the consequence of which must be that the subjects of such a constitution would live either without any constant laws that is without any known preestablished rules of adjudication whatever or under laws made for particular persons and partaking of the contradictions and iniquity of the motives to which they owed their origin which dangers by the division of the legislative and judicial functions are in this country effectually provided against parliament knows not the individuals upon whom its acts will operate it has no cases or parties before it no private designs to serve consequently its resolutions will be suggested by the consideration of universal effects and tendencies which always produces impartial and commonly advantageous regulations when laws are made courts of justice whatever be the disposition of the judges must abide by them for the legislative being necessarily the supreme power of the state the judicial and every other power is accountable to that and it cannot be doubted that the persons who possess the sovereign authority of government will be tenacious of the laws which they themselves prescribe and sufficiently jealous of the assumption of dispensing and legislative power by any others     this fundamental rule of civil jurisprudence is violated in the case of acts of attainder or confiscation in bills of pains and penalties and in all ex post facto laws whatever in which parliament exercises the double office of legislature and judge and whoever either understands the value of the rule itself or collects the history of those instances in which it has been invaded will be induced i believe to acknowledge that it had been wiser and safer never to have departed from it he will confess at least that nothing but the most manifest and immediate peril of the commonwealth will justify a repetition of these dangerous examples if the laws in being do not punish an offender let him go unpunished let the legislature admonished of the defect of the laws provide against the commission of future crimes of the same sort the escape of one delinquent can never produce so much harm to the community as may arise from the infraction of a rule upon which the purity of public justice and the existence of civil liberty essentially depend the next security for the impartial administration of justice especially in decisions to which government is a party is the independency of the judges as protection against every illegal attack upon the rights of the subject by the servants of the crown is to be sought for from these tribunals the judges of the land become not unfrequently the arbitrators between the king and the people on which account they ought to be independent of either or what is the same thing equally dependent upon both that is if they be appointed by the one they should be removable only by the other this was the policy which dictated that memorable improvement in our constitution by which the judges who before the revolution held their offices during the pleasure of the king can now be deprived of them only by an address from both houses of parliament as the most regular solemn and authentic way by which the dissatisfaction of the people can be expressed to make this independency of the judges complete the public salaries of their office     ought not only to be certain both in amount and continuance but so liberal as to secure their integrity from the temptation of secret bribes which liberality will answer also the farther purpose of preserving their jurisdiction from contempt and their characters from suspicion as well as of rendering the office worthy of the ambition of men of eminence in their profession a third precaution to be observed in the formation of courts of justice is that the number of the judges be small for beside that the violence and tumult inseparable from large assemblies are inconsistent with the patience method and attention requisite in judicial investigations beside that all passions and prejudices act with augmented force upon a collected multitude beside these objections judges when they are numerous divide the shame of an unjust determination they shelter themselves under one anothers example each man thinks his own character hid in the crowd for which reason the judges ought always to be so few as that the conduct of each may be conspicuous to public observation that each may be responsible in his separate and particular reputation for the decisions in which he concurs the truth of the above remark has been exemplified in this country in the effects of that wise regulation which transferred the trial of parliamentary elections from the house of commons at large to a select committee of that house composed of thirteen members this alteration simply by reducing the number of the judges and in consequence of that reduction exposing the judicial conduct of each to public animadversion has given to a judicature which had been long swayed by interest and solicitation the solemnity and virtue of the most upright tribunals i should prefer an even to an odd number of judges and four to almost any other number for in this number beside that it sufficiently consults the idea of separate responsibility nothing can be decided but by a majority of three to one and when we consider that every decision establishes a perpetual     precedent we shall allow that it ought to proceed from an authority not less than this if the court be equally divided nothing is done things remain as they were with some inconveniency indeed to the parties but without the danger to the public of a hasty precedent a fourth requisite in the constitution of a court of justice and equivalent to many checks upon the discretion of judges is that its proceedings be carried on in public apertis floribus not only before a promiscuous concourse of bystanders but in the audience of the whole profession of the law the opinion of the bar concerning what passes will be impartial and will commonly guide that of the public the most corrupt judge will fear to indulge his dishonest wishes in the presence of such an assembly he must encounter what few can support the censure of his equals and companions together with the indignation and reproaches of his country something is also gained to the public by appointing two or three courts of concurrent jurisdiction that it may remain in the option of the suitor to which he will resort by this means a tribunal which may happen to be occupied by ignorant or suspected judges will be deserted for others that possess more of the confidence of the nation but lastly if several courts coordinate to and independent of each other subsist together in the country it seems necessary that the appeals from all of them should meet and terminate in the same judicature in order that one supreme tribunal by whose final sentence all others are bound and concluded may superintend and preside over the rest this constitution is necessary for two purposes to preserve an uniformity in the decisions of inferior courts and to maintain to each the proper limits of its jurisdiction without a common superior different courts might establish contradictory rules of adjudication and the contradiction be final and without remedy the same question might receive opposite determinations     according as it was brought before one court or another and the determination in each be ultimate and irreversible a common appellant jurisdiction prevents or puts an end to this confusion for when the judgements upon appeals are consistent which may be expected whilst it is the same court which is at last resorted to the different courts from which the appeals are brought will be reduced to a like consistency with one another moreover if questions arise between courts independent of each other concerning the extent and boundaries of their respective jurisdiction as each will be desirous of enlarging its own an authority which both acknowledge can alone adjust the controversy such a power therefore must reside somewhere lest the rights and repose of the country be distracted by the endless opposition and mutual encroachments of its courts of justice there are two kinds of judicature the one where the office of the judge is permanent in the same person and consequently where the judge is appointed and known long before the trial the other where the judge is determined by lot at the time of the trial and for that turn only the one may be called a fixed the other a casual judicature from the former may be expected those qualifications which are preferred and sought for in the choice of judges and that knowledge and readiness which result from experience in the office but then as the judge is known beforehand he is accessible to the parties there exists a possibility of secret management and undue practices or in contests between the crown and the subject the judge appointed by the crown may be suspected of partiality to his patron or of entertaining inclinations favourable to the authority from which he derives his own the advantage attending the second kind of judicature is indifferency the defect the want of that legal science which produces uniformity and justice in legal decisions the construction of english courts of law in which causes are tried by a jury with the assistance of a judge     combines the two species with peculiar success this admirable contrivance unites the wisdom of a fixed with the integrity of a casual judicature and avoids in a great measure the inconveniencies of both the judge imparts to the jury the benefit of his erudition and experience the jury by their disinterestedness check any corrupt partialities which previous application may have produced in the judge if the determination were left to the judge the party might suffer under the superior interest of his adversary if it were left to an uninstructed jury his rights would be in still greater danger from the ignorance of those who were to decide upon them the present wise admixture of chance and choice in the constitution of the court in which his cause is tried guards him equally against the fear of injury from either of these causes in proportion to the acknowledged excellency of this mode of trial every deviation from it ought to be watched with vigilance and admitted by the legislature with caution and reluctance summary convictions before justices of the peace especially for offences against the game laws courts of conscience extending the jurisdiction of courts of equity urging too far the distinction between questions of law and matters of fact—are all so many infringements upon this great charter of public safety nevertheless the trial by jury is sometimes found inadequate to the administration of equal justice this imperfection takes place chiefly in disputes in which some popular passion or prejudice intervenes as where a particular order of men advance claims upon the rest of the community which is the case of the clergy contending for tithes or where an order of men are obnoxious by their profession as are officers of the revenue bailiffs bailiffs followers and other low ministers of the law or where one of the parties has an interest in common with the general interest of the jurors and that of the other is opposed to it as in contests between landlords and tenants between lords of manors and the holders of estates     under them or lastly where the minds of men are inflamed by political dissensions or religious hatred these prejudices act most powerfully upon the common people of which order juries are made up the force and danger of them are also increased by the very circumstance of taking juries out of the county in which the subject of dispute arises in the neighbourhood of the parties the cause is often prejudged and these secret decisions of the mind proceed commonly more upon sentiments of favour or hatred—upon some opinion concerning the sect family profession character connexions or circumstances of the parties—than upon any knowledge or discussion of the proper merits of the question more exact justice would in many instances be rendered to the suitors if the determination were left entirely to the judges provided we could depend upon the same purity of conduct when the power of these magistrates was enlarged which they have long manifested in the exercise of a mixed and restrained authority but this is an experiment too big with public danger to be hazarded the effects however of some local prejudices might be safely obviated by a law empowering the court in which the action is brought to send the cause to trial in a distant county the expenses attending the change of place always falling upon the party who applied for it there is a second division of courts of justice which presents a new alternative of difficulties either one two or a few sovereign courts may be erected in the metropolis for the whole kingdom to resort to or courts of local jurisdiction may be fixed in various provinces and districts of the empire great though opposite inconveniencies attend each arrangement if the court be remote and solemn it becomes by these very qualities expensive and dilatory the expense is unavoidably increased when witnesses parties and agents must be brought to attend from distant parts of the country and where the whole judicial business of a large nation is     collected into a few superior tribunals it will be found impossible even if the prolixity of forms which retard the progress of causes were removed to give a prompt hearing to every complaint or an immediate answer to any on the other hand if to remedy these evils and to render the administration of justice cheap and speedy domestic and summary tribunals be erected in each neighbourhood the advantage of such courts will be accompanied with all the dangers of ignorance and partiality and with the certain mischief of confusion and contrariety in their decisions the law of england by its circuit or itinerary courts contains a provision for the distribution of private justice in a great measure relieved from both these objections as the presiding magistrate comes into the county a stranger to its prejudices rivalships and connexions he brings with him none of those attachments and regards which are so apt to pervert the course of justice when the parties and the judges inhabit the same neighbourhood again as this magistrate is usually one of the judges of the supreme tribunals of the kingdom and has passed his life in the study and administration of the laws he possesses it may be presumed those professional qualifications which befit the dignity and importance of his station lastly as both he and the advocates who accompany him in his circuit are employed in the business of those superior courts to which also their proceedings are amenable they will naturally conduct themselves by the rules of adjudication which they have applied or learned there and by this means maintain what constitutes a principal perfection of civil government one law of the land in every part and district of the empire next to the constitution of courts of justice we are naturally led to consider the maxims which ought to guide their proceedings and upon this subject the chief inquiry will be how far and for what reasons it is expedient to adhere to former determinations or whether it be necessary for judges to attend to any other   0 consideration than the apparent and particular equity of the case before them now although to assert that precedents established by one set of judges ought to be incontrovertible by their successors in the same jurisdiction or by those who exercise a higher would be to attribute to the sentence of those judges all the authority we ascribe to the most solemn acts of the legislature yet the general security of private rights and of civil life requires that such precedents especially if they have been confirmed by repeated adjudications should not be overthrown without a detection of manifest error or without some imputation of dishonesty upon the court by whose judgement the question was first decided and this deference to prior decisions is founded upon two reasons first that the discretion of judges may be bound down by positive rules and secondly that the subject upon every occasion in which his legal interest is concerned may know beforehand how to act and what to expect to set judges free from any obligation to conform themselves to the decisions of their predecessors would be to lay open a latitude of judging with which no description of men can safely be intrusted it would be to allow space for the exercise of those concealed partialities which since they cannot by any human policy be excluded ought to be confined by boundaries and landmarks it is in vain to allege that the superintendency of parliament is always at hand to control and punish abuses of judicial discretion by what rules can parliament proceed how shall they pronounce a decision to be wrong where there exists no acknowledged measure or standard of what is right which in a multitude of instances would be the case if prior determinations were no longer to be appealed to diminishing the danger of partiality is one thing gained by adhering to precedents but not the principal thing the subject of every system of laws must expect that decision in his own case which he knows that others have received in cases similar to his if     he expect not this he can expect nothing there exists no other rule or principle of reasoning by which he can foretell or even conjecture the event of a judicial contest to remove therefore the grounds of this expectation by rejecting the force and authority of precedents is to entail upon the subject the worst property of slavery—to have no assurance of his rights or knowledge of his duty the quiet also of the country as well as the confidence and satisfaction of each mans mind requires uniformity in judicial proceedings nothing quells a spirit of litigation like despair of success therefore nothing so completely puts an end to lawsuits as a rigid adherence to known rules of adjudication whilst the event is uncertain which it ever must be whilst it is uncertain whether former determinations upon the same subject will be followed or not lawsuits will be endless and innumerable men will commonly engage in them either from the hope of prevailing in their claims which the smallest chance is sufficient to encourage or with the design of intimidating their adversaries by the terrors of a dubious litigation when justice is rendered to the parties only half the business of a court of justice is done the more important part of its office remains—to put an end for the future to every fear and quarrel and expense upon the same point and so to regulate its proceedings that not only a doubt once decided may be stirred no more but that the whole train of lawsuits which issue from one uncertainty may die with the parentquestion now this advantage can be attained only by considering each decision as a direction to succeeding judges and it should be observed that every departure from former determinations especially if they have been often repeated or long submitted to shakes the stability of all legal title it is not fixing a point anew it is leaving every thing unfixed for by the same stretch of power by which the present race of judges take upon them to contradict the judgement of their predecessors those who try the question next may set aside theirs     from an adherence however to precedents by which so much is gained to the public two consequences arise which are often lamented the hardship of particular determinations and the intricacy of the law as a science to the first of these complaints we must apply this reflection that uniformity is of more importance than equity in proportion as a general uncertainty would be a greater evil than particular injustice the second is attended with no greater inconveniency than that of erecting the practice of the law into a separate profession which this reason we allow makes necessary for if we attribute so much authority to precedents it is expedient that they be known in every cause both to the advocates and to the judge this knowledge cannot be general since it is the fruit oftentimes of laborious research or demands a memory stored with longcollected erudition to a mind revolving upon the subject of human jurisprudence there frequently occurs this question why since the maxims of natural justice are few and evident do there arise so many doubts and controversies in their application or in other words how comes it to pass that although the principles of the law of nature be simple and for the most part sufficiently obvious there should exist nevertheless in every system of municipal laws and in the actual administration of relative justice numerous uncertainties and acknowledged difficulty whence it may be asked so much room for litigation and so many subsisting disputes if the rules of human duty be neither obscure nor dubious if a system of morality containing both the precepts of revelation and the deductions of reason may be comprised within the compass of one moderate volume and the moralist be able as he pretends to describe the     rights and obligations of mankind in all the different relations they may hold to one another what need of those codes of positive and particular institutions of those tomes of statutes and reports which require the employment of a long life even to peruse and this question is immediately connected with the argument which has been discussed in the preceding paragraph for unless there be found some greater uncertainty in the law of nature or what may be called natural equity when it comes to be applied to real cases and to actual adjudication than what appears in the rules and principles of the science as delivered in the writings of those who treat of the subject it were better that the determination of every cause should be left to the conscience of the judge unfettered by precedents and authorities since the very purpose for which these are introduced is to give a certainty to judicial proceedings which such proceedings would want without them now to account for the existence of so many sources of litigation notwithstanding the clearness and perfection of natural justice it should be observed in the first place that treatises of morality always suppose facts to be ascertained and not only so but the intention likewise of the parties to be known and laid bare for example when we pronounce that promises ought to be fulfilled in that sense in which the promiser apprehended at the time of making the promise the other party received and understood it the apprehension of one side and the expectation of the other must be discovered before this rule can be reduced to practice or applied to the determination of any actual dispute wherefore the discussion of facts which the moralist supposes to be settled the discovery of intentions which he presumes to be known still remain to exercise the inquiry of courts of justice and as these facts and intentions are often to be inferred or rather conjectured from obscure indications from suspicious testimony or from a comparison of opposite and contending probabilities they afford a neverfailing supply of doubt     and litigation for which reason as hath been observed in a former part of this work the science of morality is to be considered rather as a direction to the parties who are conscious of their own thoughts and motives and designs to which consciousness the teacher of morality constantly appeals than as a guide to the judge or to any third person whose arbitration must proceed upon rules of evidence and maxims of credibility with which the moralist has no concern secondly there exist a multitude of cases in which the law of nature that is the law of public expediency prescribes nothing except that some certain rule be adhered to and that the rule actually established be preserved it either being indifferent what rule obtains or out of many rules no one being so much more advantageous than the rest as to recompense the inconveniency of an alteration in all such cases the law of nature sends us to the law of the land she directs that either some fixed rule be introduced by an act of the legislature or that the rule which accident or custom or common consent hath already established be steadily maintained thus in the descent of lands or the inheritance of personals from intestate proprietors whether the kindred of the grandmother or of the greatgrandmother shall be preferred in the succession whether the degrees of consanguinity shall be computed through the common ancestor or from him whether the widow shall take a third or a moiety of her husbands fortune whether sons shall be preferred to daughters or the elder to the younger whether the distinction of age shall be regarded amongst sisters as well as between brothers in these and in a great variety of questions which the same subject supplies the law of nature determines nothing the only answer she returns to our inquiries is that some certain and general rule be laid down by public authority be obeyed when laid down and that the quiet of the country be not disturbed nor the expectation of heirs frustrated by capricious innovations this silence or     neutrality of the law of nature which we have exemplified in the case of intestacy holds concerning a great part of the questions that relate to the right or acquisition of property recourse then must necessarily be had to statutes or precedents or usage to fix what the law of nature has left loose the interpretation of these statutes the search after precedents the investigation of customs compose therefore an unavoidable and at the same time a large and intricate portion of forensic business positive constitutions or judicial authorities are in like manner wanted to give precision to many things which are in their nature indeterminate the age of legal discretion at what time of life a person shall be deemed competent to the performance of any act which may bind his property whether at twenty or twentyone or earlier or later or at some point of time between these years can only be ascertained by a positive rule of the society to which the party belongs the line has not been drawn by nature the human understanding advancing to maturity by insensible degrees and its progress varying in different individuals yet it is necessary for the sake of mutual security that a precise age be fixed and that what is fixed be known to all it is on these occasions that the intervention of law supplies the inconstancy of nature again there are other things which are perfectly arbitrary and capable of no certainty but what is given to them by positive regulation it is fit that a limited time should be assigned to defendants to plead to the complaints alleged against them and also that the default of pleading within a certain time should be taken for a confession of the charge but to how many days or months that term should be extended though necessary to be known with certainty cannot be known at all by any information which the law of nature affords and the same remark seems applicable to almost all those rules of proceeding which constitute what is called the practice of the court as they cannot be traced out by reasoning they must be settled by authority     thirdly in contracts whether express or implied which involve a great number of conditions as in those which are entered into between masters and servants principals and agents many also of merchandise or for works of art in some likewise which relate to the negotiation of money or bills or to the acceptance of credit or security the original design and expectation of the parties was that both sides should be guided by the course and custom of the country in transactions of the same sort consequently when these contracts come to be disputed natural justice can only refer to that custom but as such customs are not always sufficiently uniform or notorious but often to be collected from the production and comparison of instances and accounts repugnant to one another and each custom being only that after all which amongst a variety of usages seems to predominate we have here also ample room for doubt and contest fourthly as the law of nature founded in the very construction of human society which is formed to endure through a series of perishing generations requires that the just engagements a man enters into should continue in force beyond his own life it follows that the private rights of persons frequently depend upon what has been transacted in times remote from the present by their ancestors or predecessors by those under whom they claim or to whose obligations they have succeeded thus the questions which usually arise between lords of manors and their tenants between the king and those who claim royal franchises or between them and the persons affected by these franchises depend upon the terms of the original grant in like manner every dispute concerning tithes in which an exemption or composition is pleaded depends upon the agreement which took place between the predecessor of the claimant and the ancient owner of the land the appeal to these grants and agreements is dictated by natural equity as well as by the municipal law but concerning the existence or the conditions     of such old covenants doubts will perpetually occur to which the law of nature affords no solution the loss or decay of records the perishableness of living memory the corruption and carelessness of tradition all conspire to multiply uncertainties upon this head what cannot be produced or proved must be left to loose and fallible presumption under the same head may be included another topic of altercation—the tracing out of boundaries which time or neglect or unity of possession or mixture of occupation has confounded or obliterated to which should be added a difficulty which often presents itself in disputes concerning rights of way both public and private and of those easements which one man claims in another mans property namely that of distinguishing after a lapse of years the use of an indulgence from the exercise of a right fifthly the quantity or extent of an injury even when the cause and author of it are known is often dubious and undefined if the injury consist in the loss of some specific right the value of the right measures the amount of the injury but what a man may have suffered in his person from an assault in his reputation by slander or in the comfort of his life by the seduction of a wife or daughter or what sum of money shall be deemed a reparation for damages such as these cannot be ascertained by any rules which the law of nature supplies the law of nature commands that reparation be made and adds to her command that when the aggressor and the sufferer disagree the damage be assessed by authorised and indifferent arbitrators here then recourse must be had to courts of law not only with the permission but in some measure by the direction of natural justice sixthly when controversies arise in the interpretation of written laws they for the most part arise upon some contingency which the composer of the law did not foresee or think of in the adjudication of such cases this dilemma presents itself if the laws be     permitted to operate only upon the cases which were actually contemplated by the lawmakers they will always be found defective if they be extended to every case to which the reasoning and spirit and expediency of the provision seem to belong without any farther evidence of the intention of the legislature we shall allow to the judges a liberty of applying the law which will fall very little short of the power of making it if a literal construction be adhered to the law will often fail of its end if a loose and vague exposition be admitted the law might as well have never been enacted for this licence will bring back into the subject all the discretion and uncertainty which it was the design of the legislature to take away courts of justice are and always must be embarrassed by these opposite difficulties and as it never can be known beforehand in what degree either consideration may prevail in the mind of the judge there remains an unavoidable cause of doubt and a place for contention seventhly the deliberations of courts of justice upon every new question are encumbered with additional difficulties in consequence of the authority which the judgement of the court possesses as a precedent to future judicatures which authority appertains not only to the conclusions the court delivers but to the principles and arguments upon which they are built the view of this effect makes it necessary for a judge to look beyond the case before him and beside the attention he owes to the truth and justice of the cause between the parties to reflect whether the principles and maxims and reasoning which he adopts and authorises can be applied with safety to all cases which admit of a comparison with the present the decision of the cause were the effects of the decision to stop there might be easy but the consequence of establishing the principle which such a decision assumes may be difficult though of the utmost importance to be foreseen and regulated     finally after all the certainty and rest that can be given to points of law either by the interposition of the legislature or the authority of precedents one principal source of disputation and into which indeed the greater part of legal controversies may be resolved will remain still namely the competition of opposite analogies when a point of law has been once adjudged neither that question nor any which completely and in all its circumstances corresponds with that can be brought a second time into dispute but questions arise which resemble this only indirectly and in part in certain views and circumstances and which may seem to bear an equal or a greater affinity to other adjudged cases questions which can be brought within any fixed rule only by analogy and which hold a relation by analogy to different rules it is by the urging of the different analogies that the contention of the bar is carried on and it is in the comparison adjustment and reconciliation of them with one another in the discerning of such distinctions and in the framing of such a determination as may either save the various rules alleged in the cause or if that be impossible may give up the weaker analogy to the stronger that the sagacity and wisdom of the court are seen and exercised amongst a thousand instances of this we may cite one of general notoriety in the contest that has lately been agitated concerning literary property the personal industry which an author expends upon the composition of his work bears so near a resemblance to that by which every other kind of property is earned or deserved or acquired or rather there exists such a correspondency between what is created by the study of a mans mind and the production of his labour in any other way of applying it that he seems entitled to the same exclusive assignable and perpetual right in both and that right to the same protection of law this was the analogy contended for on one side on the other hand a book as to the authors right in it appears similar to an invention of art as a machine an engine   0 a medicine and since the law permits these to be copied or imitated except where an exclusive use or sale is reserved to the inventor by patent the same liberty should be allowed in the publication and sale of books this was the analogy maintained by the advocates of an open trade and the competition of these opposite analogies constituted the difficulty of the case as far as the same was argued or adjudged upon principles of common law one example may serve to illustrate our meaning but whoever takes up a volume of reports will find most of the arguments it contains capable of the same analysis although the analogies it must be confessed are sometimes so entangled as not to be easily unravelled or even perceived doubtful and obscure points of law are not however nearly so numerous as they are apprehended to be out of the multitude of causes which in the course of each year are brought to trial in the metropolis or upon the circuits there are few in which any point is reserved for the judgement of superior courts yet these few contain all the doubts with which the law is chargeable for as to the rest the uncertainty as hath been shown above is not in the law but in the means of human information there are two peculiarities in the judicial constitution of this country which do not carry with them that evidence of their propriety which recommends almost every other part of the system the first of these is the rule which requires that juries be unanimous in their verdicts to expect that twelve men taken by lot out of a promiscuous multitude should agree in their opinion upon points confessedly dubious and upon which oftentimes the wisest judgements might be holden in suspense or to suppose that any real     unanimity or change of opinion in the dissenting jurors could be procured by confining them until they all consented to the same verdict bespeaks more of the conceit of a barbarous age than of the policy which could dictate such an institution as that of juries nevertheless the effects of this rule are not so detrimental as the rule itself is unreasonable—in criminal prosecutions it operates considerably in favour of the prisoner for if a juror find it necessary to surrender to the obstinacy of others he will much more readily resign his opinion on the side of mercy than of condemnation in civil suits it adds weight to the direction of the judge for when a conference with one another does not seem likely to produce in the jury the agreement that is necessary they will naturally close their disputes by a common submission to the opinion delivered from the bench however there seems to be less of the concurrence of separate judgements in the same conclusion consequently less assurance that the conclusion is founded in reasons of apparent truth and justice than if the decision were left to a plurality or to some certain majority of voices the second circumstance in our constitution which however it may succeed in practice does not seem to have been suggested by any intelligible fitness in the nature of the thing is the choice that is made of the house of lords as a court of appeal from every civil court of judicature in the kingdom and the last also and highest appeal to which the subject can resort there appears to be nothing in the constitution of that assembly in the education habits character or professions of the members who compose it in the mode of their appointment or the right by which they succeed to their places in it that should qualify them for this arduous office except perhaps that the elevation of their rank and fortune affords a security against the offer and influence of small bribes officers of the army and navy courtiers ecclesiastics young men who have just attained the age of twentyone and who have passed     their youth in the dissipation and pursuits which commonly accompany the possession or inheritance of great fortunes countrygentlemen occupied in the management of their estates or in the care of their domestic concerns and family interests the greater part of the assembly born to their station that is placed in it by chance most of the rest advanced to the peerage for services and from motives utterly unconnected with legal erudition—these men compose the tribunal to which the constitution entrusts the interpretation of her laws and the ultimate decision of every dispute between her subjects these are the men assigned to review judgements of law pronounced by sages of the profession who have spent their lives in the study and practice of the jurisprudence of their country such is the order which our ancestors have established the effect only proves the truth of this maxim—that when a single institution is extremely dissonant from other parts of the system to which it belongs it will always find some way of reconciling itself to the analogy which governs and pervades the rest by constantly placing in the house of lords some of the most eminent and experienced lawyers in the kingdom by calling to their aid the advice of the judges when any abstract question of law awaits their determination by the almost implicit and undisputed deference which the uninformed part of the house find it necessary to pay to the learning of their colleagues the appeal to the house of lords becomes in fact an appeal to the collected wisdom of our supreme courts of justice receiving indeed solemnity but little perhaps of direction from the presence of the assembly in which it is heard and determined these however even if real are minute imperfections a politician who should sit down to delineate a plan for the dispensation of public justice guarded against all access to influence and corruption and bringing together the separate advantages of knowledge and impartiality would find when he had done that he     had been transcribing the judicial constitution of england and it may teach the most discontented amongst us to acquiesce in the government of his country to reflect that the pure and wise and equal administration of the laws forms the first end and blessing of social union and that this blessing is enjoyed by him in a perfection which he will seek in vain in any other nation of the world chapter   of crimes and punishments the proper end of human punishment is not the satisfaction of justice but the prevention of crimes by the satisfaction of justice i mean the retribution of so much pain for so much guilt which is the dispensation we expect at the hand of god and which we are accustomed to consider as the order of things that perfect justice dictates and requires in what sense or whether with truth in any sense justice may be said to demand the punishment of offenders i do not now inquire but i assert that this demand is not the motive or occasion of human punishment what would it be to the magistrate that offences went altogether unpunished if the impunity of the offenders were followed by no danger or prejudice to the commonwealth the fear lest the escape of the criminal should encourage him or others by his example to repeat the same crime or to commit different crimes is the sole consideration which authorises the infliction of punishment by human laws now that whatever it be which is the cause and end of the punishment ought undoubtedly to regulate the measure of its severity but this cause appears to be founded not in the guilt of the offender but in the necessity of preventing the repetition of the offence and hence results the reason that crimes are not by any government punished in     proportion to their guilt nor in all cases ought to be so but in proportion to the difficulty and the necessity of preventing them thus the stealing of goods privately out of a shop may not in its moral quality be more criminal than the stealing of them out of a house yet being equally necessary and more difficult to be prevented the law in certain circumstances denounces against it a severer punishment the crime must be prevented by some means or other and consequently whatever means appear necessary to this end whether they be proportionable to the guilt of the criminal or not are adopted rightly because they are adopted upon the principle which alone justifies the infliction of punishment at all from the same consideration it also follows that punishment ought not to be employed much less rendered severe when the crime can be prevented by any other means punishment is an evil to which the magistrate resorts only from its being necessary to the prevention of a greater this necessity does not exist when the end may be attained that is when the public may be defended from the effects of the crime by any other expedient the sanguinary laws which have been made against counterfeiting or diminishing the gold coin of the kingdom might be just until the method of detecting the fraud by weighing the money was introduced into general usage since that precaution was practised these laws have slept and an execution under them at this day would be deemed a measure of unjustifiable severity the same principle accounts for a circumstance which has been often censured as an absurdity in the penal laws of this and of most modern nations namely that breaches of trust are either not punished at all or punished with less rigour than other frauds wherefore is it some have asked that a violation of confidence which increases the guilt should mitigate the penalty this lenity or rather forbearance of the laws is founded in the most reasonable distinction a due circumspection in the choice of the persons whom they trust caution in limiting the extent of that trust or the requiring of sufficient security for the faithful discharge     of it will commonly guard men from injuries of this description and the law will not interpose its sanctions to protect negligence and credulity or to supply the place of domestic care and prudence to be convinced that the law proceeds entirely upon this consideration we have only to observe that where the confidence is unavoidable—where no practicable vigilance could watch the offender as in the case of theft committed by a servant in the shop or dwellinghouse of his master or upon property to which he must necessarily have access—the sentence of the law is not less severe and its execution commonly more certain and rigorous than if no trust at all had intervened it is in pursuance of the same principle which pervades indeed the whole system of penal jurisprudence that the facility with which any species of crimes is perpetrated has been generally deemed a reason for aggravating the punishment thus sheepstealing horsestealing the stealing of cloth from tenters or bleachinggrounds by our laws subject the offenders to sentence of death not that these crimes are in their nature more heinous than many simple felonies which are punished by imprisonment or transportation but because the property being more exposed requires the terror of capital punishment to protect it this severity would be absurd and unjust if the guilt of the offender were the immediate cause and measure of the punishment but is a consistent and regular consequence of the supposition that the right of punishment results from the necessity of preventing the crime for if this be the end proposed the severity of the punishment must be increased in proportion to the expediency and the difficulty of attaining this end that is in a proportion compounded of the mischief of the crime and of the ease with which it is executed the difficulty of discovery is a circumstance to be included in the same consideration it constitutes indeed with respect to the crime the facility of which we speak by how much therefore the detection of     an offender is more rare and uncertain by so much the more severe must be the punishment when he is detected thus the writing of incendiary letters though in itself a pernicious and alarming injury calls for a more condign and exemplary punishment by the very obscurity with which the crime is committed from the justice of god we are taught to look for a gradation of punishment exactly proportioned to the guilt of the offender when therefore in assigning the degrees of human punishment we introduce considerations distinct from that guilt and a proportion so varied by external circumstances that equal crimes frequently undergo unequal punishments or the less crime the greater it is natural to demand the reason why a different measure of punishment should be expected from god and observed by man why that rule which befits the absolute and perfect justice of the deity should not be the rule which ought to be pursued and imitated by human laws the solution of this difficulty must be sought for in those peculiar attributes of the divine nature which distinguish the dispensations of supreme wisdom from the proceedings of human judicature a being whose knowledge penetrates every concealment from the operation of whose will no art or flight can escape and in whose hands punishment is sure such a being may conduct the moral government of his creation in the best and wisest manner by pronouncing a law that every crime shall finally receive a punishment proportioned to the guilt which it contains abstracted from any foreign consideration whatever and may testify his veracity to the spectators of his judgements by carrying this law into strict execution but when the care of the public safety is intrusted to men whose authority over their fellowcreatures is limited by defects of power and knowledge from whose utmost vigilance and sagacity the greatest offenders often lie hid whose wisest precautions and speediest pursuit may be eluded by artifice or concealment a different necessity a new rule of proceeding     results from the very imperfection of their faculties in their hands the uncertainty of punishment must be compensated by the severity the ease with which crimes are committed or concealed must be counteracted by additional penalties and increased terrors the very end for which human government is established requires that its regulations be adapted to the suppression of crimes this end whatever it may do in the plans of infinite wisdom does not in the designation of temporal penalties always coincide with the proportionate punishment of guilt there are two methods of administering penal justice the first method assigns capital punishment to few offences and inflicts it invariably the second method assigns capital punishment to many kinds of offences but inflicts it only upon a few examples of each kind the latter of which two methods has been long adopted in this country where of those who receive sentence of death scarcely one in ten is executed and the preference of this to the former method seems to be founded in the consideration that the selection of proper objects for capital punishment principally depends upon circumstances which however easy to perceive in each particular case after the crime is committed it is impossible to enumerate or define beforehand or to ascertain however with that exactness which is requisite in legal descriptions hence although it be necessary to fix by precise rules of law the boundary on one side that is the limit to which the punishment may be extended and also that nothing less than the authority of the whole legislature be suffered to determine that boundary and assign these rules yet the mitigation of punishment the exercise of lenity may without danger be intrusted to the executive magistrate whose discretion will operate upon those numerous unforeseen mutable and indefinite circumstances both of the crime and the criminal which constitute or qualify the malignity of each offence without     the power of relaxation lodged in a living authority either some offenders would escape capital punishment whom the public safety required to suffer or some would undergo this punishment where it was neither deserved nor necessary for if judgement of death were reserved for one or two species of crimes only which would probably be the case if that judgement was intended to be executed without exception crimes might occur of the most dangerous example and accompanied with circumstances of heinous aggravation which did not fall within any description of offences that the laws had made capital and which consequently could not receive the punishment their own malignity and the public safety required what is worse it would be known beforehand that such crimes might be committed without danger to the offenders life on the other hand if to reach these possible cases the whole class of offences to which they belong be subjected to pains of death and no power of remitting this severity remain any where the execution of the laws will become more sanguinary than the public compassion would endure or than is necessary to the general security the law of england is constructed upon a different and a better policy by the number of statutes creating capital offences it sweeps into the net every crime which under any possible circumstances may merit the punishment of death but when the execution of this sentence comes to be deliberated upon a small proportion of each class are singled out the general character or the peculiar aggravations of whose crimes render them fit examples of public justice by this expedient few actually suffer death whilst the dread and danger of it hang over the crimes of many the tenderness of the law cannot be taken advantage of the life of the subject is spared as far as the necessity of restraint and intimidation permits yet no one will adventure upon the commission of any enormous crime from a knowledge that the laws have not provided for its punishment the wisdom and humanity     of this design furnish a just excuse for the multiplicity of capital offences which the laws of england are accused of creating beyond those of other countries the charge of cruelty is answered by observing that these laws were never meant to be carried into indiscriminate execution that the legislature when it establishes its last and highest sanctions trusts to the benignity of the crown to relax their severity as often as circumstances appear to palliate the offence or even as often as those circumstances of aggravation are wanting which rendered this rigorous interposition necessary upon this plan it is enough to vindicate the lenity of the laws that some instances are to be found in each class of capital crimes which require the restraint of capital punishment and that this restraint could not be applied without subjecting the whole class to the same condemnation there is however one species of crimes the making of which capital can hardly i think be defended even upon the comprehensive principle just now stated—i mean that of privately stealing from the person as every degree of force is excluded by the description of the crime it will be difficult to assign an example where either the amount or circumstances of the theft place it upon a level with those dangerous attempts to which the punishment of death should be confined it will be still more difficult to show that without gross and culpable negligence on the part of the sufferer such examples can ever become so frequent as to make it necessary to constitute a class of capital offences of very wide and large extent the prerogative of pardon is properly reserved to the chief magistrate the power of suspending the laws is a privilege of too high a nature to be committed to many hands or to those of any inferior officer in the state the king also can best collect the advice by which his resolutions should be governed and is at the same time removed at the greatest distance from the influence of private   0 motives but let this power be deposited where it will the exercise of it ought to be regarded not as a favour to be yielded to solicitation granted to friendship or least of all to be made subservient to the conciliating or gratifying of political attachments but as a judicial act as a deliberation to be conducted with the same character of impartiality with the same exact and diligent attention to the proper merits and circumstances of the case as that which the judge upon the bench was expected to maintain and show in the trial of the prisoners guilt the questions whether the prisoner be guilty and whether being guilty he ought to be executed are equally questions of public justice the adjudication of the latter question is as much a function of magistracy as the trial of the former the public welfare is interested in both the conviction of an offender should depend upon nothing but the proof of his guilt nor the execution of the sentence upon any thing beside the quality and circumstances of his crime it is necessary to the good order of society and to the reputation and authority of government that this be known and believed to be the case in each part of the proceeding which reflections show that the admission of extrinsic or oblique considerations in dispensing the power of pardon is a crime in the authors and advisers of such unmerited partiality of the same nature with that of corruption in a judge aggravations which ought to guide the magistrate in the selection of objects of condign punishment are principally these three—repetition cruelty combination the first two it is manifest add to every reason upon which the justice or the necessity of rigorous measures can be founded and with respect to the last circumstance it may be observed that when thieves and robbers are once collected into gangs their violence becomes more formidable the confederates more desperate and the difficulty of defending the public against their depredations much greater than in the case of solitary adventurers which several considerations     compose a distinction that is properly adverted to in deciding upon the fate of convicted malefactors in crimes however which are perpetrated by a multitude or by a gang it is proper to separate in the punishment the ringleader from his followers the principal from his accomplices and even the person who struck the blow broke the lock or first entered the house from those who joined him in the felony not so much on account of any distinction in the guilt of the offenders as for the sake of casting an obstacle in the way of such confederacies by rendering it difficult for the confederates to settle who shall begin the attack or to find a man amongst their number willing to expose himself to greater danger than his associates this is another instance in which the punishment which expediency directs does not pursue the exact proportion of the crime injuries effected by terror and violence are those which it is the first and chief concern of legal government to repress because their extent is unlimited because no private precaution can protect the subject against them because they endanger life and safety as well as property and lastly because they render the condition of society wretched by a sense of personal insecurity these reasons do not apply to frauds which circumspection may prevent which must wait for opportunity which can proceed only to certain limits and by the apprehension of which although the business of life be incommoded life itself is not made miserable the appearance of this distinction has led some humane writers to express a wish that capital punishments might be confined to crimes of violence in estimating the comparative malignancy of crimes of violence regard is to be had not only to the proper and intended mischief of the crime but to the fright occasioned by the attack to the general alarm excited by it in others and to the consequences which may attend future attempts of the same kind thus in affixing the punishment of burglary or of breaking into dwellinghouses by night     we are to consider not only the peril to which the most valuable property is exposed by this crime and which may be called the direct mischief of it but the danger also of murder in case of resistance or for the sake of preventing discovery and the universal dread with which the silent and defenceless hours of rest and sleep must be disturbed were attempts of this sort to become frequent and which dread alone even without the mischief which is the object of it is not only a public evil but almost of all evils the most insupportable these circumstances place a difference between the breaking into a dwellinghouse by day and by night which difference obtains in the punishment of the offence by the law of moses and is probably to be found in the judicial codes of most countries from the earliest ages to the present of frauds or of injuries which are effected without force the most noxious kinds are—forgeries counterfeiting or diminishing of the coin and the stealing of letters in the course of their conveyance inasmuch as these practices tend to deprive the public of accommodations which not only improve the conveniencies of social life but are essential to the prosperity and even the existence of commerce of these crimes it may be said that although they seem to affect property alone the mischief of their operation does not terminate there for let it be supposed that the remissness or lenity of the laws should in any country suffer offences of this sort to grow into such a frequency as to render the use of money the circulation of bills or the public conveyance of letters no longer safe or practicable what would follow but that every species of trade and of activity must decline under these discouragements the sources of subsistence fail by which the inhabitants of the country are supported the country itself where the intercourse of civil life was so endangered and defective be deserted and that beside the distress and poverty which the loss of employment would produce to the industrious and valuable part of the existing community a     rapid depopulation must take place each generation becoming less numerous than the last till solitude and barrenness overspread the land until a desolation similar to what obtains in many countries of asia which were once the most civilised and frequented parts of the world succeed in the place of crowded cities of cultivated fields of happy and well peopled regions when therefore we carry forwards our views to the more distant but not less certain consequences of these crimes we perceive that though no living creature be destroyed by them yet human life is diminished that an offence the particular consequence of which deprives only an individual of a small portion of his property and which even in its general tendency seems to do nothing more than obstruct the enjoyment of certain public conveniencies may nevertheless by its ultimate effects conclude in the laying waste of human existence this observation will enable those who regard the divine rule of life for life and blood for blood as the only authorised and justifiable measure of capital punishment to perceive with respect to the effects and quality of the actions a greater resemblance than they suppose to exist between certain atrocious frauds and those crimes which attack personal safety in the case of forgeries there appears a substantial difference between the forging of bills of exchange or of securities which are circulated and of which the circulation and currency are found to serve and facilitate valuable purposes of commerce and the forging of bonds leases mortgages or of instruments which are not commonly transferred from one hand to another because in the former case credit is necessarily given to the signature and without that credit the negotiation of such property could not be carried on nor the public utility sought from it be attained in the other case all possibility of deceit might be precluded by a direct communication between the parties or by due care in the choice of their agents with little interruption to business and without     destroying or much encumbering the uses for which these instruments are calculated this distinction i apprehend to be not only real but precise enough to afford a line of division between forgeries which as the law now stands are almost universally capital and punished with undistinguishing severity perjury is another crime of the same class and magnitude and when we consider what reliance is necessarily placed upon oaths that all judicial decisions proceed upon testimony that consequently there is not a right that a man possesses of which false witnesses may not deprive him that reputation property and life itself lie open to the attempts of perjury that it may often be committed without a possibility of contradiction or discovery that the success and prevalency of this vice tend to introduce the most grievous and fatal injustice into the administration of human affairs or such a distrust of testimony as must create universal embarrassment and confusion when we reflect upon these mischiefs we shall be brought probably to agree with the opinion of those who contend that perjury in its punishment especially that which is attempted in solemn evidence and in the face of a court of justice should be placed upon a level with the most flagitious frauds the obtaining of money by secret threats whether we regard the difficulty with which the crime is traced out the odious imputations to which it may lead or the profligate conspiracies that are sometimes formed to carry it into execution deserves to be reckoned amongst the worst species of robbery the frequency of capital executions in this country owes its necessity to three causes—much liberty great cities and the want of a punishment short of death possessing a sufficient degree of terror and if the taking away of the life of malefactors be more rare in other countries than in ours the reason will be found in some difference in these articles the liberties of a free people and     still more the jealousy with which these liberties are watched and by which they are preserved permit not those precautions and restraints that inspection scrutiny and control which are exercised with success in arbitrary governments for example neither the spirit of the laws nor of the people will suffer the detention or confinement of suspected persons without proofs of their guilt which it is often impossible to obtain nor will they allow that masters of families be obliged to record and render up a description of the strangers or inmates whom they entertain nor that an account be demanded at the pleasure of the magistrate of each mans time employment and means of subsistence nor securities to be required when these accounts appear unsatisfactory or dubious nor men to be apprehended upon the mere suggestion of idleness or vagrancy nor to be confined to certain districts nor the inhabitants of each district to be made responsible for one anothers behaviour nor passports to be exacted from all persons entering or leaving the kingdom least of all will they tolerate the appearance of an armed force or of military law or suffer the streets and public roads to be guarded and patrolled by soldiers or lastly intrust the police with such discretionary powers as may make sure of the guilty however they involve the innocent these expedients although arbitrary and rigorous are many of them effectual and in proportion as they render the commission or concealment of crimes more difficult they subtract from the necessity of severe punishment great cities multiply crimes by presenting easier opportunities and more incentives to libertinism which in low life is commonly the introductory stage to other enormities by collecting thieves and robbers into the same neighbourhood which enables them to form communications and confederacies that increase their art and courage as well as strength and wickedness but principally by the refuge they afford to villainy in the means of concealment and of subsisting in secrecy which crowded towns     supply to men of every description these temptations and facilities can only be counteracted by adding to the number of capital punishments but a third cause which increases the frequency of capital executions in england is a defect of the laws in not being provided with any other punishment than that of death sufficiently terrible to keep offenders in awe transportation which is the sentence second in the order of severity appears to me to answer the purpose of example very imperfectly not only because exile is in reality a slight punishment to those who have neither property nor friends nor reputation nor regular means of subsistence at home and because their situation becomes little worse by their crime than it was before they committed it but because the punishment whatever it be is unobserved and unknown a transported convict may suffer under his sentence but his sufferings are removed from the view of his countrymen his misery is unseen his condition strikes no terror into the minds of those for whose warning and admonition it was intended this chasm in the scale of punishment produces also two farther imperfections in the administration of penal justice the first is that the same punishment is extended to crimes of very different character and malignancy the second that punishments separated by a great interval are assigned to crimes hardly distinguishable in their guilt and mischief the end of punishment is twofold—amendment and example in the first of these the reformation of criminals little has ever been effected and little i fear is practicable from every species of punishment that has hitherto been devised from imprisonment and exile from pain and infamy malefactors return more hardened in their crimes and more instructed if there be any thing that shakes the soul of a confirmed villain it is the expectation of approaching death the horrors of this situation may cause such a wrench in the mortal organs as to give them a holding turn and i think it     probable that many of those who are executed would if they were delivered at the point of death retain such a remembrance of their sensations as might preserve them unless urged by extreme want from relapsing into their former crimes but this is an experiment that from its nature cannot be repeated often of the reforming punishments which have not yet been tried none promises so much success as that of solitary imprisonment or the confinement of criminals in separate apartments this improvement augments the terror of the punishment secludes the criminal from the society of his fellowprisoners in which society the worse are sure to corrupt the better weans him from the knowledge of his companions and from the love of that turbulent precarious life in which his vices had engaged him is calculated to raise up in him reflections on the folly of his choice and to dispose his mind to such bitter and continued penitence as may produce a lasting alteration in the principles of his conduct as aversion to labour is the cause from which half of the vices of low life deduce their origin and continuance punishments ought to be contrived with a view to the conquering of this disposition two opposite expedients have been recommended for this purpose the one solitary confinement with hard labour the other solitary confinement with nothing to do both expedients seek the same end—to reconcile the idle to a life of industry the former hopes to effect this by making labour habitual the latter by making idleness insupportable and the preference of one method to the other depends upon the question whether a man is more likely to betake himself of his own accord to work who has been accustomed to employment or who has been distressed by the want of it when gaols are once provided for the separate confinement of prisoners which both proposals require the choice between them may soon be determined by experience if labour be exacted i would leave the whole or a portion of the earnings to the     prisoners use and i would debar him from any other provision or supply that his subsistence however coarse and penurious may be proportioned to his diligence and that he may taste the advantage of industry together with the toil i would go farther i would measure the confinement not by the duration of time but by quantity of work in order both to excite industry and to render it more voluntary but the principal difficulty remains still namely how to dispose of criminals after their enlargement by a rule of life which is perhaps too invariably and indiscriminately adhered to no one will receive a man or woman out of a gaol into any service or employment whatever this is the common misfortune of public punishments that they preclude the offender from all honest means of future support it seems incumbent upon the state to secure a maintenance to those who are willing to work for it and yet it is absolutely necessary to divide criminals as far asunder from one another as possible whether male prisoners might not after the term of their confinement was expired be distributed in the country detained within certain limits and employed upon the public roads and females be remitted to the overseers of country parishes to be there furnished with dwellings and with the materials and implements of occupation—whether by these or by what other methods it may be possible to effect the two purposes of employment and dispersion well merits the attention of all who are anxious to perfect the internal regulation of their country torture is applied either to obtain confessions of guilt or to exasperate or prolong the pains of death no bodily punishment however excruciating or longcontinued receives the name of torture unless it be designed to kill the criminal by a more lingering     death or to extort from him the discovery of some secret which is supposed to lie concealed in his breast the question by torture appears to be equivocal in its effects for since extremity of pain and not any consciousness of remorse in the mind produces those effects an innocent man may sink under the torment as well as he who is guilty the latter has as much to fear from yielding as the former the instant and almost irresistible desire of relief may draw from one sufferer false accusations of himself or others as it may sometimes extract the truth out of another this ambiguity renders the use of torture as a means of procuring information in criminal proceedings liable to the risk of grievous and irreparable injustice for which reason though recommended by ancient and general example it has been properly exploded from the mild and cautious system of penal jurisprudence established in this country barbarous spectacles of human agony are justly found fault with as tending to harden and deprave the public feelings and to destroy that sympathy with which the sufferings of our fellowcreatures ought always to be seen or if no effect of this kind follow from them they counteract in some measure their own design by sinking mens abhorrence of the crime in their commiseration of the criminal but if a mode of execution could be devised which would augment the horror of the punishment without offending or impairing the public sensibility by cruel or unseemly exhibitions of death it might add something to the efficacy of the example and by being reserved for a few atrocious crimes might also enlarge the scale of punishment an addition to which seems wanting for as the matter remains at present you hang a malefactor for a simple robbery and can do no more to the villain who has poisoned his father somewhat of the sort we have been describing was the proposal not long since suggested of casting murderers into a den of wild beasts where they would perish in a manner dreadful to the imagination yet concealed from the view   0 infamous punishments are mismanaged in this country with respect both to the crimes and the criminals in the first place they ought to be confined to offences which are holden in undisputed and universal detestation to condemn to the pillory the author or editor of a libel against the state who has rendered himself the favourite of a party if not of the people by the very act for which he stands there is to gratify the offender and to expose the laws to mockery and insult in the second place the delinquents who receive this sentence are for the most part such as have long ceased either to value reputation or to fear shame of whose happiness and of whose enjoyments character makes no part thus the low ministers of libertinism the keepers of bawdy or disorderly houses are threatened in vain with a punishment that affects a sense which they have not that applies solely to the imagination to the virtue and the pride of human nature the pillory or any other infamous distinction might be employed rightly and with effect in the punishment of some offences of higher life as of frauds and peculation in office of collusions and connivances by which the public treasury is defrauded of breaches of trust of perjury and subornation of perjury of the clandestine and forbidden sale of places of flagrant abuses of authority or neglect of duty and lastly of corruption in the exercise of confidential or judicial offices in all which the more elevated was the station of the criminal the more signal and conspicuous would be the triumph of justice the certainty of punishment is of more consequence than the severity criminals do not so much flatter themselves with the lenity of the sentence as with the hope of escaping they are not so apt to compare what they gain by the crime with what they may suffer from the punishment as to encourage themselves with the chance of concealment or flight for which reason a vigilant magistracy an accurate police a proper distribution of force and intelligence together with due rewards for the discovery and     apprehension of malefactors and an undeviating impartiality in carrying the laws into execution contribute more to the restraint and suppression of crimes than any violent exacerbations of punishment and for the same reason of all contrivances directed to this end those perhaps are most effectual which facilitate the conviction of criminals the offence of counterfeiting the coin could not be checked by all the terrors and the utmost severity of law whilst the act of coining was necessary to be established by specific proof the statute which made possession of the implements of coining capital that is which constituted that possession complete evidence of the offenders guilt was the first thing that gave force and efficacy to the denunciations of law upon this subject the statute of james the first relative to the murder of bastard children which ordains that the concealment of the birth should be deemed incontestable proof of the charge though a harsh law was in like manner with the former well calculated to put a stop to the crime it is upon the principle of this observation that i apprehend much harm to have been done to the community by the overstrained scrupulousness or weak timidity of juries which demands often such proof of a prisoners guilt as the nature and secrecy of his crime scarce possibly admit of and which holds it the part of a safe conscience not to condemn any man whilst there exists the minutest possibility of his innocence any story they may happen to have heard or read whether real or feigned in which courts of justice have been misled by presumptions of guilt is enough in their minds to found an acquittal upon where positive proof is wanting i do not mean that juries should indulge conjectures should magnify suspicions into proofs or even that they should weigh probabilities in gold scales but when the preponderation of evidence is so manifest as to persuade every private understanding of the prisoners guilt when it furnishes the degree of credibility upon which men decide and act in all other doubts and which     experience hath shown that they may decide and act upon with sufficient safety to reject such proof from an insinuation of uncertainty that belongs to all human affairs and from a general dread lest the charge of innocent blood should lie at their doors is a conduct which however natural to a mind studious of its own quiet is authorised by no considerations of rectitude or utility it counteracts the care and damps the activity of government it holds out public encouragement to villainy by confessing the impossibility of bringing villains to justice and that species of encouragement which as hath been just now observed the minds of such men are most apt to entertain and dwell upon there are two popular maxims which seem to have a considerable influence in producing the injudicious acquittals of which we complain one is that circumstantial evidence falls short of positive proof this assertion in the unqualified sense in which it is applied is not true a concurrence of wellauthenticated circumstances composes a stronger ground of assurance than positive testimony unconfirmed by circumstances usually affords circumstances cannot lie the conclusion also which results from them though deduced by only probable inference is commonly more to be relied upon than the veracity of an unsupported solitary witness the danger of being deceived is less the actual instances of deception are fewer in the one case than the other what is called positive proof in criminal matters as where a man swears to the person of the prisoner and that he actually saw him commit the crime with which he is charged may be founded in the mistake or perjury of a single witness such mistakes and such perjuries are not without many examples whereas to impose upon a court of justice a chain of circumstantial evidence in support of a fabricated accusation requires such a number of false witnesses as seldom meet together an union also of skill and wickedness which     is still more rare and after all this species of proof lies much more open to discussion and is more likely if false to be contradicted or to betray itself by some unforeseen inconsistency than that direct proof which being confined within the knowledge of a single person which appealing to or standing connected with no external or collateral circumstances is incapable by its very simplicity of being confronted with opposite probabilities the other maxim which deserves a similar examination is this that it is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent man should suffer if by saying it is better be meant that it is more for the public advantage the proposition i think cannot be maintained the security of civil life which is essential to the value and the enjoyment of every blessing it contains and the interruption of which is followed by universal misery and confusion is protected chiefly by the dread of punishment the misfortune of an individual for such may the sufferings or even the death of an innocent person be called when they are occasioned by no evil intention cannot be placed in competition with this object i do not contend that the life or safety of the meanest subject ought in any case to be knowingly sacrificed no principle of judicature no end of punishment can ever require that but when certain rules of adjudication must be persued when certain degrees of credibility must be accepted in order to reach the crimes with which the public are infested courts of justice should not be deterred from the application of these rules by every suspicion of danger or by the mere possibility of confounding the innocent with the guilty they ought rather to reflect that he who falls by a mistaken sentence may be considered as falling for his country whilst he suffers under the operation of those rules by the general effect and tendency of which the welfare of the community is maintained and upholden     chapter  0 of religious establishments and of toleration a religious establishment is no part of christianity it is only the means of inculcating it amongst the jews the rights and offices the order family and succession of the priesthood were marked out by the authority which declared the law itself these therefore were parts of the jewish religion as well as the means of transmitting it not so with the new institution it cannot be proved that any form of churchgovernment was laid down in the christian as it had been in the jewish scriptures with a view of fixing a constitution for succeeding ages and which constitution consequently the disciples of christianity would every where and at all times by the very law of their religion be obliged to adopt certainly no command for this purpose was delivered by christ himself and if it be shown that the apostles ordained bishops and presbyters amongst their first converts it must be remembered that deacons also and deaconesses were appointed by them with functions very dissimilar to any which obtain in the church at present the truth seems to have been that such offices were at first erected in the christian church as the good order the instruction and the exigencies of the society at that time required without any intention at least without any declared design of regulating the appointment authority or the distinction of christian ministers under future circumstances this reserve if we may so call it in the christian legislator is sufficiently accounted for by two considerations first that no precise constitution could be framed which would suit with the condition of christianity in its primitive state and with that which it was to assume when it should be advanced into a national religion secondly that a particular designation of office or authority amongst the ministers of the new religion     might have so interfered with the arrangements of civil policy as to have formed in some countries a considerable obstacle to the progress and reception of the religion itself the authority therefore of a churchestablishment is founded in its utility and whenever upon this principle we deliberate concerning the form propriety or comparative excellency of different establishments the single view under which we ought to consider any of them is that of a scheme of instruction the single end we ought to propose by them is the preservation and communication of religious knowledge every other idea and every other end that have been mixed with this as the making of the church an engine or even an ally of the state converting it into the means of strengthening or diffusing influence or regarding it as a support of regal in opposition to popular forms of government have served only to debase the institution and to introduce into it numerous corruptions and abuses the notion of a religious establishment comprehends three things a clergy or an order of men secluded from other professions to attend upon the offices of religion a legal provision for the maintenance of the clergy and the confining of that provision to the teachers of a particular sect of christianity if any one of these three things be wanting if there be no clergy as amongst the quakers or if the clergy have no other provision than what they derive from the voluntary contribution of their hearers or if the provision which the laws assign to the support of religion be extended to various sects and denominations of christians there exists no national religion or established church according to the sense which these terms are usually made to convey he therefore who would defend ecclesiastical establishments must show the separate utility of these three essential parts of their constitution   the question first in order upon the subject as well as the most fundamental in its importance is whether the knowledge and     profession of christianity can be maintained in a country without a class of men set apart by public authority to the study and teaching of religion and to the conducting of public worship and for these purposes secluded from other employments i add this last circumstance because in it consists as i take it the substance of the controversy now it must be remembered that christianity is an historical religion founded in facts which are related to have passed upon discourses which were holden and letters which were written in a remote age and distant country of the world as well as under a state of life and manners and during the prevalency of opinions customs and institutions very unlike any which are found amongst mankind at present moreover this religion having been first published in the country of judea and being built upon the more ancient religion of the jews is necessarily and intimately connected with the sacred writings with the history and polity of that singular people to which must be added that the records of both revelations are preserved in languages which have long ceased to be spoken in any part of the world books which come down to us from times so remote and under so many causes of unavoidable obscurity cannot it is evident be understood without study and preparation the languages must be learned the various writings which these volumes contain must be carefully compared with one another and with themselves what remains of contemporary authors or of authors connected with the age the country or the subject of our scriptures must be perused and consulted in order to interpret doubtful forms of speech and to explain allusions which refer to objects or usages that no longer exist above all the modes of expression the habits of reasoning and argumentation which were then in use and to which the discourses even of inspired teachers were necessarily adapted must be sufficiently known and can only be known at all by a due acquaintance with ancient literature and lastly to establish the     genuineness and integrity of the canonical scriptures themselves a series of testimony recognising the notoriety and reception of these books must be deduced from times near to those of their first publication down the succession of ages through which they have been transmitted to us the qualifications necessary for such researches demand it is confessed a degree of leisure and a kind of education inconsistent with the exercise of any other profession but how few are there amongst the clergy from whom any thing of this sort can be expected how small a proportion of their number who seem likely either to augment the fund of sacred literature or even to collect what is already known to this objection it may be replied that we sow many seeds to raise one flower in order to produce a few capable of improving and continuing the stock of christian erudition leisure and opportunity must be afforded to great numbers original knowledge of this kind can never be universal but it is of the utmost importance and it is enough that there be at all times found some qualified for such inquiries and in whose concurring and independent conclusions upon each subject the rest of the christian community may safely confide whereas without an order of clergy educated for the purpose and led to the prosecution of these studies by the habits the leisure and the object of their vocation it may well be questioned whether the learning itself would not have been lost by which the records of our faith are interpreted and defended we contend therefore that an order of clergy is necessary to perpetuate the evidences of revelation and to interpret the obscurity of those ancient writings in which the religion is contained but besides this which forms no doubt one design of their institution the more ordinary offices of public teaching and of conducting public worship call for qualifications not usually to be met with amidst the employments of civil life it has been acknowledged by some who cannot be suspected of making unnecessary concessions in     favour of establishments to be barely possible that a person who was never educated for the office should acquit himself with decency as a public teacher of religion and that surely must be a very defective policy which trusts to possibilities for success when provision is to be made for regular and general instruction little objection to this argument can be drawn from the example of the quakers who it may be said furnish an experimental proof that the worship and profession of christianity may be upholden without a separate clergy these sectaries every where subsist in conjunction with a regular establishment they have access to the writings they profit by the labours of the clergy in common with other christians they participate in that general diffusion of religious knowledge which the constant teaching of a more regular ministry keeps up in the country with such aids and under such circumstances the defects of a plan may not be much felt although the plan itself be altogether unfit for general imitation   if then an order of clergy be necessary if it be necessary also to seclude them from the employments and profits of other professions it is evident they ought to be enabled to derive a maintenance from their own now this maintenance must either depend upon the voluntary contributions of their hearers or arise from revenues assigned by authority of law to the scheme of voluntary contribution there exists this insurmountable objection that few would ultimately contribute any thing at all however the zeal of a sect or the novelty of a change might support such an experiment for a while no reliance could be placed upon it as a general and permanent provision it is at all times a bad constitution which presents temptations of interest in opposition to the duties of religion or which makes the offices of religion expensive to those who attend upon them or which allows pretences of conscience to be an excuse for not sharing in a public burthen if by declining to frequent religious assemblies men could save their money at the     same time that they indulged their indolence and their disinclination to exercises of seriousness and reflection or if by dissenting from the national religion they could be excused from contributing to the support of the ministers of religion it is to be feared that many would take advantage of the option which was thus imprudently left open to them and that this liberty might finally operate to the decay of virtue and an irrecoverable forgetfulness of all religion in the country is there not too much reason to fear that if it were referred to the discretion of each neighbourhood whether they would maintain amongst them a teacher of religion or not many districts would remain unprovided with any that with the difficulties which encumber every measure requiring the cooperation of numbers and where each individual of the number has an interest secretly pleading against the success of the measure itself associations for the support of christian worship and instruction would neither be numerous nor long continued the devout and pious might lament in vain the want or the distance of a religious assembly they could not form or maintain one without the concurrence of neighbours who felt neither their zeal nor their liberality from the difficulty with which congregations would be established and upheld upon the voluntary plan let us carry our thoughts to the condition of those who are to officiate in them preaching in time would become a mode of begging with what sincerity or with what dignity can a preacher dispense the truths of christianity whose thoughts are perpetually solicited to the reflection how he may increase his subscription his eloquence if he possess any resembles rather the exhibition of a player who is computing the profits of his theatre than the simplicity of a man who feeling himself the awful expectations of religion is seeking to bring others to such a sense and understanding of their duty as may save their souls moreover a little experience of the disposition of the  00 common people will in every country inform us that it is one thing to edify them in christian knowledge and another to gratify their taste for vehement impassioned oratory that he not only whose success but whose subsistence depends upon collecting and pleasing a crowd must resort to other arts than the acquirement and communication of sober and profitable instruction for a preacher to be thus at the mercy of his audience to be obliged to adapt his doctrines to the pleasure of a capricious multitude to be continually affecting a style and manner neither natural to him nor agreeable to his judgement to live in constant bondage to tyrannical and insolent directors are circumstances so mortifying not only to the pride of the human heart but to the virtuous love of independency that they are rarely submitted to without a sacrifice of principle and a depravation of character—at least it may be pronounced that a ministry so degraded would soon fall into the lowest hands for it would be found impossible to engage men of worth and ability in so precarious and humiliating a profession if in deference then to these reasons it be admitted that a legal provision for the clergy compulsory upon those who contribute to it is expedient the next question will be whether this provision should be confined to one sect of christianity or extended indifferently to all now it should be observed that this question never can offer itself where the people are agreed in their religious opinions and that it never ought to arise where a system may be framed of doctrines and worship wide enough to comprehend their disagreement and which might satisfy all by uniting all in the articles of their common faith and in a mode of divine worship that omits every subject of controversy or offence where such a comprehension is practicable the comprehending religion ought to be made that of the state but if this be despaired of if religious opinions exist not only so various but so contradictory as to render it impossible to reconcile them to each other or to any one confession of faith  0  rule of discipline or form of worship if consequently separate congregations and different sects must unavoidably continue in the country under such circumstances whether the laws ought to establish one sect in preference to the rest that is whether they ought to confer the provision assigned to the maintenance of religion upon the teachers of one system of doctrines alone becomes a question of necessary discussion and of great importance and whatever we may determine concerning speculative rights and abstract proprieties when we set about the framing of an ecclesiastical constitution adapted to real life and to the actual state of religion in the country we shall find this question very nearly related to and principally indeed dependent upon another namely in what way or by whom ought the ministers of religion to be appointed if the species of patronage be retained to which we are accustomed in this country and which allows private individuals to nominate teachers of religion for districts and congregations to which they are absolute strangers without some test proposed to the persons nominated the utmost discordancy of religious opinions might arise between the several teachers and their respective congregations a popish patron might appoint a priest to say mass to a congregation of protestants an episcopal clergyman be sent to officiate in a parish of presbyterians or a presbyterian divine to inveigh against the errors of popery before an audience of papists the requisition then of subscription or any other test by which the national religion is guarded may be considered merely as a restriction upon the exercise of private patronage the laws speak to the private patron thus of those whom we have previously pronounced to be fitly qualified to teach religion we allow you to select one but we do not allow you to decide what religion shall be established in a particular district of the country for which decision you are no wise fitted by any qualifications which as a private patron you may happen to possess if it be  0  necessary that the point be determined for the inhabitants by any other will than their own it is surely better that it should be determined by a deliberate resolution of the legislature than by the casual inclination of an individual by whom the right is purchased or to whom it devolves as a mere secular inheritance wheresoever therefore this constitution of patronage is adopted a national religion or the legal preference of one particular religion to all others must almost necessarily accompany it but secondly let it be supposed that the appointment of the minister of religion was in every parish left to the choice of the parishioners might not this choice we ask be safely exercised without its being limited to the teachers of any particular sect the effect of such a liberty must be that a papist or a presbyterian a methodist a moravian or an anabaptist would successively gain possession of the pulpit according as a majority of the party happened at each election to prevail now with what violence the conflict would upon every vacancy be renewed what bitter animosities would be revived or rather be constantly fed and kept alive in the neighbourhood with what unconquerable aversion the teacher and his religion would be received by the defeated party may be foreseen by those who reflect with how much passion every dispute is carried on in which the name of religion can be made to mix itself much more where the cause itself is concerned so immediately as it would be in this or thirdly if the state appoint the ministers of religion this constitution will differ little from the establishment of a national religion for the state will undoubtedly appoint those and those alone whose religious opinions or rather whose religious denominations agree with its own unless it be thought that any thing would be gained to religious liberty by transferring the choice of the national religion from the legislature of the country to the magistrate who administers the executive government the only plan which seems to render the legal maintenance of a clergy  0  practicable without the legal preference of one sect of christians to others is that of an experiment which is said to be attempted or designed in some of the new states of north america the nature of the plan is thus described a tax is levied upon the inhabitants for the general support of religion the collector of the tax goes round with a register in his hand in which are inserted at the head of so many distinct columns the names of the several religious sects that are professed in the country the person who is called upon for the assessment as soon as he has paid his quota subscribes his name and the sum in which of the columns he pleases and the amount of what is collected in each column is paid over to the minister of that denomination in this scheme it is not left to the option of the subject whether he will contribute or how much he shall contribute to the maintenance of a christian ministry it is only referred to his choice to determine by what sect his contribution shall be received the above arrangement is undoubtedly the best that has been proposed upon this principle it bears the appearance of liberality and justice it may contain some solid advantages nevertheless it labours under inconveniences which will be found i think upon trial to overbalance all its recommendations it is scarcely compatible with that which is the first requisite in an ecclesiastical establishment—the division of the country into parishes of a commodious extent if the parishes be small and ministers of every denomination be stationed in each which the plan seems to suppose the expense of their maintenance will become too burthensome a charge for the country to support if to reduce the expense the districts be enlarged the place of assembling will oftentimes be too far removed from the residence of the persons who ought to resort to it again the making the pecuniary success of the different teachers of religion to depend on the number and wealth of their respective followers would naturally generate strifes and indecent jealousies amongst them as well  0  as produce a polemical and proselyting spirit founded in or mixed with views of private gain which would both deprave the principles of the clergy and distract the country with endless contentions the argument then by which ecclesiastical establishments are defended proceeds by these steps the knowledge and profession of christianity cannot be upholden without a clergy a clergy cannot be supported without a legal provision a legal provision for the clergy cannot be constituted without the preference of one sect of christians to the rest and the conclusion will be conveniently satisfactory in the degree in which the truth of these several propositions can be made out if it be deemed expedient to establish a national religion that is to say one sect in preference to all others some test by which the teachers of that sect may be distinguished from the teachers of different sects appears to be an indispensable consequence the existence of such an establishment supposes it the very notion of a national religion includes that of a test but this necessity which is real hath according to the fashion of human affairs furnished to almost every church a pretence for extending multiplying and continuing such tests beyond what the occasion justified for though some purposes of order and tranquillity may be answered by the establishment of creeds and confessions yet they are at all times attended with serious inconveniences they check inquiry they violate liberty they ensnare the consciences of the clergy by holding out temptations to prevarication however they may express the persuasion or be accommodated to the controversies or to the fears of the age in which they are composed in process of time and by reason of the changes which are wont to take place in the judgement of mankind upon religious subjects they come at length to contradict the actual opinions of the church whose doctrines they profess to  0  contain and they often perpetuate the proscription of sects and tenets from which any danger has long ceased to be apprehended it may not follow from these objections that tests and subscriptions ought to be abolished but it follows that they ought to be made as simple and easy as possible that they should be adapted from time to time to the varying sentiments and circumstances of the church in which they are received and that they should at no time advance one step farther than some subsisting necessity requires if for instance promises of conformity to the rites liturgy and offices of the church be sufficient to prevent confusion and disorder in the celebration of divine worship then such promises ought to be accepted in the place of stricter subscriptions if articles of peace as they are called that is engagements not to preach certain doctrines nor to revive certain controversies would exclude indecent altercations amongst the national clergy as well as secure to the public teaching of religion as much of uniformity and quiet as is necessary to edification then confessions of faith ought to be converted into articles of peace in a word it ought to be holden a sufficient reason for relaxing the terms of subscription or for dropping any or all of the articles to be subscribed that no present necessity requires the strictness which is complained of or that it should be extended to so many points of doctrine the division of the country into districts and the stationing in each district a teacher of religion forms the substantial part of every church establishment the varieties that have been introduced into the government and discipline of different churches are of inferior importance when compared with this in which they all agree of these oeconomical questions none seems more material than that which has been long agitated in the reformed churches of christendom whether a parity amongst the clergy or a distinction of orders in the ministry be more conducive to the general ends of the institution in favour of that system which the laws of this  0  country have preferred we may allege the following reasons that it secures tranquillity and subordination amongst the clergy themselves that it corresponds with the gradations of rank in civil life and provides for the edification of each rank by stationing in each an order of clergy of their own class and quality and lastly that the same fund produces more effect both as an allurement to men of talents to enter into the church and as a stimulus to the industry of those who are already in it when distributed into prizes of different value than when divided into equal shares after the state has once established a particular system of faith as a national religion a question will soon occur concerning the treatment and toleration of those who dissent from it this question is properly preceded by another concerning the right which the civil magistrate possesses to interfere in matters of religion at all for although this right be acknowledged whilst he is employed solely in providing means of public instruction it will probably be disputed indeed it ever has been when he proceeds to inflict penalties to impose restraints or incapacities on the account of religious distinctions they who admit no other just original of civil government than what is founded in some stipulation with its subjects are at liberty to contend that the concerns of religion were excepted out of the social compact that in an affair which can only be transacted between god and a mans own conscience no commission or authority was ever delegated to the civil magistrate or could indeed be transferred from the person himself to any other we however who have rejected this theory because we cannot discover any actual contract between the state and the people and because we cannot allow any arbitrary fiction to be made the foundation of real rights and of real obligations find ourselves precluded from this distinction the reasoning which deduces the authority of civil government from the will of god and which collects that will from public expediency alone binds us  0  to the unreserved conclusion that the jurisdiction of the magistrate is limited by no consideration but that of general utility in plainer terms that whatever be the subject to be regulated it is lawful for him to interfere whenever his interference in its general tendency appears to be conducive to the common interest there is nothing in the nature of religion as such which exempts it from the authority of the legislator when the safety or welfare of the community requires his interposition it has been said indeed that religion pertaining to the interests of a life to come lies beyond the province of civil government the office of which is confined to the affairs of this life but in reply to this objection it may be observed that when the laws interfere even in religion they interfere only with temporals their effects terminate their power operates only upon those rights and interests which confessedly belong to their disposal the acts of the legislature the edicts of the prince the sentence of the judge cannot affect my salvation nor do they without the most absurd arrogance pretend to any such power but they may deprive me of liberty of property and even of life itself on account of my religion and however i may complain of the injustice of the sentence by which i am condemned i cannot allege that the magistrate has transgressed the boundaries of his jurisdiction because the property the liberty and the life of the subject may be taken away by the authority of the laws for any reason which in the judgement of the legislature renders such a measure necessary to the common welfare moreover as the precepts of religion may regulate all the offices of life or may be so construed as to extend to all the exemption of religion from the control of human laws might afford a plea which would exclude civil government from every authority over the conduct of its subjects religious liberty is like civil liberty not an immunity from restraint but the being restrained by no law but what in a greater degree conduces to the public welfare  0  still it is right to obey god rather than man nothing that we have said encroaches upon the truth of this sacred and undisputed maxim the right of the magistrate to ordain and the obligation of the subject to obey in matters of religion may be very different and will be so as often as they flow from opposite apprehensions of the divine will in affairs that are properly of a civil nature in the things that are caesars this difference seldom happens the law authorises the act which it enjoins revelation being either silent upon the subject or referring to the laws of the country or requiring only that men act by some fixed rule and that this rule be established by competent authority but when human laws interpose their direction in matters of religion by dictating for example the object or the mode of divine worship by prohibiting the profession of some articles of faith and by exacting that of others they are liable to clash with what private persons believe to be already settled by precepts of revelation or to contradict what god himself they think hath declared to be true in this case on whichever side the mistake lies or whatever plea the state may allege to justify its edict the subject can have none to excuse his compliance the same consideration also points out the distinction as to the authority of the state between temporals and spirituals the magistrate is not to be obeyed in temporals more than in spirituals where a repugnancy is perceived between his commands and any credited manifestations of the divine will but such repugnancies are much less likely to arise in one case than the other when we grant that it is lawful for the magistrate to interfere in religion as often as his interference appears to him to conduce in its general tendency to the public happiness it may be argued from this concession that since salvation is the highest interest of mankind and since consequently to advance that is to promote the public happiness in the best way and in the greatest degree in  0  which it can be promoted it follows that it is not only the right but the duty of every magistrate invested with supreme power to enforce upon his subjects the reception of that religion which he deems most acceptable to god and to enforce it by such methods as may appear most effectual for the end proposed a popish king for example who should believe that salvation is not attainable out of the precincts of the romish church would derive a right from our principles not to say that he would be bound by them to employ the power with which the constitution intrusted him and which power in absolute monarchies commands the lives and fortunes of every subject of the empire in reducing his people within that communion we confess that this consequence is inferred from the principles we have laid down concerning the foundation of civil authority not without the resemblance of a regular deduction we confess also that it is a conclusion which it behoves us to dispose of because if it really follow from our theory of government the theory itself ought to be given up now it will be remembered that the terms of our proposition are these that it is lawful for the magistrate to interfere in the affairs of religion whenever his interference appears to him to conduce by its general tendency to the public happiness the clause of general tendency when this rule comes to be applied will be found a very significant part of the direction it obliges the magistrate to reflect not only whether the religion which he wishes to propagate amongst his subjects be that which will best secure their eternal welfare not only whether the methods he employs be likely to effectuate the establishment of that religion but also upon this farther question whether the kind of interference which he is about to exercise if it were adopted as a common maxim amongst states and princes or received as a general rule for the conduct of government in matters of religion would upon the whole and in the mass of instances in which his example might be imitated conduce   0 to the fartherance of human salvation if the magistrate for example should think that although the application of his power might in the instance concerning which he deliberates advance the true religion and together with it the happiness of his people yet that the same engine in other hands who might assume the right to use it with the like pretensions of reason and authority that he himself alleges would more frequently shut out truth and obstruct the means of salvation he would be bound by this opinion still admitting public utility to be the supreme rule of his conduct to refrain from expedients which whatever particular effects he may expect from them are in their general operation dangerous or hurtful if there be any difficulty in the subject it arises from that which is the cause of every difficulty in morals—the competition of particular and general consequences or what is the same thing the submission of one general rule to another rule which is still more general bearing then in mind that it is the general tendency of the measure or in other words the effects which would arise from the measure being generally adopted that fixes upon it the character of rectitude or injustice we proceed to inquire what is the degree and the sort of interference of secular laws in matters of religion which are likely to be beneficial to the public happiness there are two maxims which will in a great measure regulate our conclusions upon this head the first is that any form of christianity is better than no religion at all the second that of different systems of faith that is the best which is the truest the first of these positions will hardly be disputed when we reflect that every sect and modification of christianity holds out the happiness and misery of another life as depending chiefly upon the practice of virtue or of vice in this and that the distinctions of virtue and vice are nearly the same in all a person who acts under the impression of these hopes and fears though combined with many errors and superstitions is     more likely to advance both the public happiness and his own than one who is destitute of all expectation of a future account the latter proposition is founded in the consideration that the principal importance of religion consists in its influence upon the fate and condition of a future existence this influence belongs only to that religion which comes from god a political religion may be framed which shall embrace the purposes and describe the duties of political society perfectly well but if it be not delivered by god what assurance does it afford that the decisions of the divine judgement will have any regard to the rules which it contains by a man who acts with a view to a future judgement the authority of a religion is the first thing inquired after a religion which wants authority with him wants every thing since then this authority appertains not to the religion which is most commodious—to the religion which is most sublime and efficacious—to the religion which suits best with the form or seems most calculated to uphold the power and stability of civil government—but only to that religion which comes from god we are justified in pronouncing the true religion by its very truth and independently of all considerations of tendencies aptnesses or any other internal qualities whatever to be universally the best from the first proposition follows this inference that when the state enables its subjects to learn some form of christianity by distributing teachers of a religious system throughout the country and by providing for the maintenance of these teachers at the public expense that is in fewer terms when the laws establish a national religion they exercise a power and an interference which are likely in their general tendency to promote the interest of mankind for even supposing the species of christianity which the laws patronise to be erroneous and corrupt yet when the option lies between this religion and no religion at all which would be the consequence of leaving the people without any public means of     instruction or any regular celebration of the offices of christianity our proposition teaches us that the former alternative is constantly to be preferred but after the right of the magistrate to establish a particular religion has been upon this principle admitted a doubt sometimes presents itself whether the religion which he ought to establish be that which he himself professes or that which he observes to prevail amongst the majority of the people now when we consider this question with a view to the formation of a general rule upon the subject which view alone can furnish a just solution of the doubt it must be assumed to be an equal chance whether of the two religions contains more of truth—that of the magistrate or that of the people the chance then that is left to truth being equal upon both suppositions the remaining consideration will be from which arrangement more efficacy can be expected—from an order of men appointed to teach the people their own religion or to convert them to another in my opinion the advantage lies on the side of the former scheme and this opinion if it be assented to makes it the duty of the magistrate in the choice of the religion which he establishes to consult the faith of the nation rather than his own the case also of dissenters must be determined by the principles just now stated toleration is of two kinds—the allowing to dissenters the unmolested profession and exercise of their religion but with an exclusion from offices of trust and emolument in the state which is a partial toleration and the admitting them without distinction to all the civil privileges and capacities of other citizens which is a complete toleration the expediency of toleration and consequently the right of every citizen to demand it as far as relates to liberty of conscience and the claim of being protected in the free and safe profession of his religion is deducible from the second of those propositions which we have delivered as the     grounds of our conclusions upon the subject that proposition asserts truth and truth in the abstract to be the supreme perfection of every religion the advancement consequently and discovery of truth is that end to which all regulations concerning religion ought principally to be adapted now every species of intolerance which enjoins suppression and silence and every species of persecution which enforces such injunctions is adverse to the progress of truth forasmuch as it causes that to be fixed by one set of men at one time which is much better and with much more probability of success left to the independent and progressive inquiry of separate individuals truth results from discussion and from controversy is investigated by the labours and researches of private persons whatever therefore prohibits these obstructs that industry and that liberty which it is the common interest of mankind to promote in religion as in other subjects truth if left to itself will almost always obtain the ascendancy if different religions be professed in the same country and the minds of men remain unfettered and unawed by intimidations of law that religion which is founded in maxims of reason and credibility will gradually gain over the other to it i do not mean that men will formally renounce their ancient religion but that they will adopt into it the more rational doctrines the improvements and discoveries of the neighbouring sect by which means the worse religion without the ceremony of a reformation will insensibly assimilate itself to the better if popery for instance and protestantism were permitted to dwell quietly together papists might not become protestants for the name is commonly the last thing that is changed but they would become more enlightened and     informed they would by little and little incorporate into their creed many of the tenets of protestantism as well as imbibe a portion of its spirit and moderation the justice and expediency of toleration we found primarily in its conduciveness to truth and in the superior value of truth to that of any other quality which a religion can possess this is the principal argument but there are some auxiliary considerations too important to be omitted the confining of the subject to the religion of the state is a needless violation of natural liberty and is an instance in which constraint is always grievous persecution produces no sincere conviction nor any real change of opinion on the contrary it vitiates the public morals by driving men to prevarication and commonly ends in a general though secret infidelity by imposing under the name of revealed religion systems of doctrine which men cannot believe and dare not examine finally it disgraces the character and wounds the reputation of christianity itself by making it the author of oppression cruelty and bloodshed under the idea of religious toleration i include the toleration of all books of serious argumentation but i deem it no infringement of religious liberty to restrain the circulation of ridicule invective and mockery upon religious subjects because this species of writing applies solely to the passions weakens the judgement and contaminates the imagination of its readers has no tendency whatever to assist either the investigation or the impression of truth on the contrary whilst it stays not to distinguish between the authority of different religions it destroys alike the influence of all concerning the admission of dissenters from the established religion to offices and employments in the public service which is necessary to render toleration complete doubts have been entertained with some appearance of reason it is possible that such religious opinions may be holden as are utterly incompatible with the necessary functions of civil government and which opinions     consequently disqualify those who maintain them from exercising any share in its administration there have been enthusiasts who held that christianity has abolished all distinction of property and that she enjoins upon her followers a community of goods with what tolerable propriety could one of this sect be appointed a judge or a magistrate whose office it is to decide upon questions of private right and to protect men in the exclusive enjoyment of their property it would be equally absurd to intrust a military command to a quaker who believes it to be contrary to the gospel to take up arms this is possible therefore it cannot be laid down as an universal truth that religion is not in its nature a cause which will justify exclusion from public employments when we examine however the sects of christianity which actually prevail in the world we must confess that with the single exception of refusing to bear arms we find no tenet in any of them which incapacitates men for the service of the state it has indeed been asserted that discordancy of religions even supposing each religion to be free from any errors that affect the safety or the conduct of government is enough to render men unfit to act together in public stations but upon what argument or upon what experience is this assertion founded i perceive no reason why men of different religious persuasions may not sit upon the same bench deliberate in the same council or fight in the same ranks as well as men of various or opposite opinions upon any controverted topic of natural philosophy history or ethics there are two cases in which testlaws are wont to be applied and in which if in any they may be defended one is where two or more religions are contending for establishment and where there appears no way of putting an end to the contest but by giving to one religion such a decided superiority in the legislature and government of the country as to secure it against danger from any other i own that i should assent to this precaution with many     scruples if the dissenters from the establishment become a majority of the people the establishment itself ought to be altered or qualified if there exist amongst the different sects of the country such a parity of numbers interest and power as to render the preference of one sect to the rest and the choice of that sect a matter of hazardous success and of doubtful election some plan similar to that which is meditated in north america and which we have described in a preceding part of the present chapter though encumbered with great difficulties may perhaps suit better with this divided state of public opinion than any constitution of a national church whatever in all other situations the establishment will be strong enough to maintain itself however if a test be applicable with justice upon this principle at all it ought to be applied in regal governments to the chief magistrate himself whose power might otherwise overthrow or change the established religion of the country in opposition to the will and sentiments of the people the second case of exclusion and in which i think the measure is more easily vindicated is that of a country in which some disaffection to the subsisting government happens to be connected with certain religious distinctions the state undoubtedly has a right to refuse its power and its confidence to those who seek its destruction wherefore if the generality of any religious sect entertain dispositions hostile to the constitution and if government have no other way of knowing its enemies than by the religion which they profess the professors of that religion may justly be excluded from offices of trust and authority but even here it should be observed that it is not against the religion that government shuts its doors but against those political principles which however independent they may be of any article of religious faith the members of that communion are found in fact to hold nor would the legislator make religious tenets the test of mens     inclinations towards the state if he could discover any other that was equally certain and notorious thus if the members of the romish church for the most part adhere to the interests or maintain the right of a foreign pretender to the crown of these kingdoms and if there be no way of distinguishing those who do from those who do not retain such dangerous prejudices government is well warranted in fencing out the whole sect from situations of trust and power but even in this example it is not to popery that the laws object but to popery as the mark of jacobitism an equivocal indeed and fallacious mark but the best and perhaps the only one that can be devised but then it should be remembered that as the connexion between popery and jacobitism which is the sole cause of suspicion and the sole justification of those severe and jealous laws which have been enacted against the professors of that religion was accidental in its origin so probably it will be temporary in its duration and that these restrictions ought not to continue one day longer than some visible danger renders them necessary to the preservation of public tranquillity after all it may be asked why should not the legislator direct his test against the political principles themselves which he wishes to exclude rather than encounter them through the medium of religious tenets the only crime and the only danger of which consist in their presumed alliance with the former why for example should a man be required to renounce transubstantiation before he be admitted to an office in the state when it might seem to be sufficient that he abjure the pretender there are but two answers that can be given to the objection which this question contains first that it is not opinions which the laws fear so much as inclinations and that political inclinations are not so easily detected by the affirmation or denial of any abstract proposition in politics as by the discovery of the religious creed with which they are wont to be united secondly that when men renounce their religion     they commonly quit all connexion with the members of the church which they have left that church no longer expecting assistance or friendship from them whereas particular persons might insinuate themselves into offices of trust and authority by subscribing political assertions and yet retain their predilection for the interests of the religious sect to which they continued to belong by which means government would sometimes find though it could not accuse the individual whom it had received into its service of disaffection to the civil establishment yet that through him it had communicated the aid and influence of a powerful station to a party who were hostile to the constitution these answers however we propose rather than defend the measure certainly cannot be defended at all except where the suspected union between certain obnoxious principles in politics and certain tenets in religion is nearly universal in which case it makes little difference to the subscriber whether the test be religious or political and the state is somewhat better secured by the one than the other the result of our examination of those general tendencies by which every interference of civil government in matters of religion ought to be tried is this that a comprehensive national religion guarded by a few articles of peace and conformity together with a legal provision for the clergy of that religion and with a complete toleration of all dissenters from the established church without any other limitation or exception than what arises from the conjunction of dangerous political dispositions with certain religious tenets appears to be not only the most just and liberal but the wisest and safest system which a state can adopt inasmuch as it unites the several perfections which a religious constitution ought to aim at liberty of conscience with means of instruction the progress of truth with the peace of society the right of private judgement with the care of the public safety     chapter    of population and provision and of agriculture and commerce as subservient thereto the final view of all rational politics is to produce the greatest quantity of happiness in a given tract of country the riches strength and glory of nations the topics which history celebrates and which alone almost engage the praises and possess the admiration of mankind have no value farther than as they contribute to this end when they interfere with it they are evils and not the less real for the splendour that surrounds them secondly although we speak of communities as of sentient beings although we ascribe to them happiness and misery desires interests and passions nothing really exists or feels but individuals the happiness of a people is made up of the happiness of single persons and the quantity of happiness can only be augmented by increasing the number of the percipients or the pleasure of their perceptions thirdly notwithstanding that diversity of condition especially different degrees of plenty freedom and security greatly vary the quantity of happiness enjoyed by the same number of individuals and notwithstanding that extreme cases may be found of human beings so galled by the rigours of slavery that the increase of numbers is only the amplification of misery yet within certain limits and within those limits to which civil life is diversified under the temperate governments that obtain in europe it may be affirmed i think with certainty that the quantity of happiness produced in any given district so far depends upon the number of inhabitants that in comparing adjoining periods in the same country the collective   0 happiness will be nearly in the exact proportion of the numbers that is twice the number of inhabitants will produce double the quantity of happiness in distant periods and different countries under great changes or great dissimilitude of civil condition although the proportion of enjoyment may fall much short of that of the numbers yet still any considerable excess of numbers will usually carry with it a preponderation of happiness that at least it may and ought to be assumed in all political deliberations that a larger portion of happiness is enjoyed amongst ten persons possessing the means of healthy subsistence than can be produced by five persons under every advantage of power affluence and luxury from these principles it follows that the quantity of happiness in a given district although it is possible it may be increased the number of inhabitants remaining the same is chiefly and most naturally affected by alteration of the numbers that consequently the decay of population is the greatest evil that a state can suffer and the improvement of it the object which ought in all countries to be aimed at in preference to every other political purpose whatsoever the importance of population and the superiority of it to every other national advantage are points necessary to be inculcated and to be understood inasmuch as false estimates or fantastic notions of national grandeur are perpetually drawing the attention of statesmen and legislators from the care of this which is at all times the true and absolute interest of a country for which reason we have stated these points with unusual formality we will confess however that a competition can seldom arise between the advancement of population and any measure of sober utility because in the ordinary progress of human affairs whatever in any way contributes to make a people happier tends to render them more numerous in the fecundity of the human as of every other species of animals nature has provided for an indefinite multiplication     mankind have increased to their present number from a single pair the offspring of early marriages in the ordinary course of procreation do more than replace the parents in countries and under circumstances very favourable to subsistence the population has been doubled in the space of twenty years the havoc occasioned by wars earthquakes famine or pestilence is usually repaired in a short time these indications sufficiently demonstrate the tendency of nature in the human species to a continual increase of its numbers it becomes therefore a question that may reasonably be propounded what are the causes which confine or check the natural progress of this multiplication and the answer which first presents itself to the thoughts of the inquirer is that the population of a country must stop when the country can maintain no more that is when the inhabitants are already so numerous as to exhaust all the provision which the soil can be made to produce this however though an insuperable bar will seldom be found to be that which actually checks the progress of population in any country of the world because the number of the people have seldom in any country arrived at this limit or even approached to it the fertility of the ground in temperate regions is capable of being improved by cultivation to an extent which is unknown much however beyond the state of improvement in any country in europe in our own which holds almost the first place in the knowledge and encouragement of agriculture let it only be supposed that every field in england of the same original quality with those in the neighbourhood of the metropolis and consequently capable of the same fertility were by a like management made to yield an equal produce and it may be asserted i believe with truth that the quantity of human provision raised in the island would be increased fivefold the two principles therefore upon which population seems primarily to depend the fecundity of the species and the capacity of the soil would in most perhaps in all countries     enable it to proceed much farther than it has yet advanced the number of marriageable women who in each country remain unmarried afford a computation how much the agency of nature in the diffusion of human life is cramped and contracted and the quantity of waste neglected or mismanaged surface—together with a comparison like the preceding of the crops raised from the soil in the neighbourhood of populous cities and under a perfect state of cultivation with those which lands of equal or superior quality yield in different situations—will show in what proportion the indigenous productions of the earth are capable of being farther augmented the fundamental proposition upon the subject of population which must guide every endeavour to improve it and from which every conclusion concerning it may be deduced is this wherever the commerce between the sexes is regulated by marriage and a provision for that mode of subsistence to which each class of the community is accustomed can be procured with ease and certainty there the number of the people will increase and the rapidity as well as the extent of the increase will be proportioned to the degree in which these causes exist this proposition we will draw out into the several principles which it contains i first the proposition asserts the necessity of confining the intercourse of the sexes to the marriageunion it is only in the marriageunion that this intercourse is sufficiently prolific beside which family establishments alone are fitted to perpetuate a succession of generations the offspring of a vague and promiscuous concubinage are not only few and liable to perish by neglect but are seldom prepared for or introduced into situations suited to the raising of families of their own hence the advantages of marriages now nature in the constitution of the sexes has provided a stimulus which will infallibly secure the frequency of marriages with     all their beneficial effects upon the state of population provided the male part of the species be prohibited from irregular gratifications this impulse which is sufficient to surmount almost every impediment to marriage will operate in proportion to the difficulty expense danger or infamy the sense of guilt or the fear of punishment which attend licentious indulgences wherefore in countries in which subsistence is become scarce it behoves the state to watch over the public morals with increased solicitude for nothing but the instinct of nature under the restraint of chastity will induce men to undertake the labour or consent to the sacrifice of personal liberty and indulgence which the support of a family in such circumstances requires ii the second requisite which our proposition states as necessary to the success of population is the ease and certainty with which a provision can be procured for that mode of subsistence to which each class of the community is accustomed it is not enough that mens natural wants be supplied that a provision adequate to the real exigencies of human life be attainable habitual superfluities become actual wants opinion and fashion convert articles of ornament and luxury into necessaries of life and it must not be expected from men in general at least in the present relaxed state of morals and discipline that they will enter into marriages which degrade their condition reduce their mode of living deprive them of the accommodations to which they have been accustomed or even of those ornaments or appendages of rank and station which they have been taught to regard as belonging to their birth or class or profession or place in society the same consideration namely a view to their accustomed mode of life which is so apparent in the superior order of the people has no less influence upon those ranks which compose the mass of the community the kind and quality of food and liquor the species of habitation furniture and clothing to which the common people of each country are     habituated must be attainable with ease and certainty before marriages will be sufficiently early and general to carry the progress of population to its just extent it is in vain to allege that a more simple diet ruder habitations or coarser apparel would be sufficient for the purposes of life and health or even of physical ease and pleasure men will not marry with this encouragement for instance when the common people of a country are accustomed to eat a large proportion of animal food to drink wine spirits or beer to wear shoes and stockings to dwell in stone houses they will not marry to live in clay cottages upon roots and milk with no other clothing than skins or what is necessary to defend the trunk of the body from the effects of cold although these last may be all that the sustentation of life and health requires or that even contribute much to animal comfort and enjoyment the ease then and certainty with which the means can be procured not barely of subsistence but of that mode of subsisting which custom hath in each country established form the point upon which the state and progress of population chiefly depend now there are three causes which evidently regulate this point the mode itself of subsisting which prevails in the country the quantity of provision suited to that mode of subsistence which is either raised in the country or imported into it and lastly the distribution of that provision these three causes merit distinct consideration i the mode of living which actually obtains in a country in china where the inhabitants frequent the sea shore or the banks of large rivers and subsist in a great measure upon fish the population is described to be excessive this peculiarity arises not probably from any civil advantages any care or policy any particular constitution or superior wisdom of government but simply from hence that the species of food to which custom hath reconciled the desires and inclinations of the inhabitants is that which of all     others is procured in the greatest abundance with the most ease and stands in need of the least preparation the natives of indostan being confined by the laws of their religion to the use of vegetable food and requiring little except rice which the country produces in plentiful crops and food in warm climates composing the only want of life these countries are populous under all the injuries of a despotic and the agitations of an unsettled government if any revolution or what would be called perhaps refinement of manners should generate in these people a taste for the flesh of animals similar to what prevails amongst the arabian hordes should introduce flocks and herds into grounds which are now covered with corn should teach them to account a certain portion of this species of food amongst the necessaries of life the population from this single change would suffer in a few years a great diminution and this diminution would follow in spite of every effort of the laws or even of any improvement that might take place in their civil condition in ireland the simplicity of living alone maintains a considerable degree of population under great defects of police industry and commerce under this head and from a view of these considerations may be understood the true evil and proper danger of luxury luxury as it supplies employment and promotes industry assists population but then there is another consequence attending it which counteracts and often overbalances these advantages when by introducing more superfluities into general reception luxury has rendered the usual accommodations of life more expensive artificial and elaborate the difficulty of maintaining a family conformably with the established mode of living becomes greater and what each man has to spare from his personal consumption proportionably less the effect of which is that marriages grow less frequent agreeably to the maxim above laid down and which must be remembered as the foundation of all our reasoning upon the     subject that men will not marry to sink their place or condition in society or to forego those indulgences which their own habits or what they observe amongst their equals have rendered necessary to their satisfaction this principle is applicable to every article of diet and dress to houses furniture attendance and this effect will be felt in every class of the community for instance the custom of wearing broadcloth and fine linen repays the shepherd and flaxgrower feeds the manufacturer enriches the merchant gives not only support but existence to multitudes of families hitherto therefore the effects are beneficial and were these the only effects such elegancies or if you please to call them so such luxuries could not be too universal but here follows the mischief when once fashion hath annexed the use of these articles of dress to any certain class the middling ranks for example of the community each individual of that rank finds them to be necessaries of life that is finds himself obliged to comply with the example of his equals and to maintain that appearance which the custom of society requires this obligation creates such a demand upon his income and adds so much to the cost and burden of a family as to put it out of his power to marry with the prospect of continuing his habits or of maintaining his place and situation in the world we see in this description the cause which induces men to waste their lives in a barren celibacy and this cause which impairs the very source of population is justly placed to the account of luxury it appears then that luxury considered with a view to population acts by two opposite effects and it seems probable that there exists a point in the scale to which luxury may ascend or to which the wants of mankind may be multiplied with advantage to the community and beyond which the prejudicial consequences begin to preponderate the determination of this point though it assume the form of an arithmetical problem depends upon circumstances too numerous intricate and undefined to admit of     a precise solution however from what has been observed concerning the tendency of luxury to diminish marriages in which tendency the evil of it resides the following general conclusions may be established  st that of different kinds of luxury those are the most innocent which afford employment to the greatest number of artists and manufacturers or those in other words in which the price of the work bears the greatest proportion to that of the raw material thus luxury in dress or furniture is universally preferable to luxury in eating because the articles which constitute the one are more the production of human art and industry than those which supply the other  dly that it is the diffusion rather than the degree of luxury which is to be dreaded as a national evil the mischief of luxury consists as we have seen in the obstruction which it forms to marriage now it is only a small part of the people that the higher ranks in any country compose for which reason the facility or the difficulty of supporting the expense of their station and the consequent increase or diminution of marriages among them will influence the state of population but little so long as the prevalency of luxury is confined to a few of elevated rank much of the benefit is felt and little of the inconveniency but when the imitation of the same manners descends as it always will do into the mass of the people when it advances the requisites of living beyond what it adds to mens abilities to purchase them then it is that luxury checks the formation of families in a degree that ought to alarm the public fears  dly that the condition most favourable to population is that of a laborious frugal people ministering to the demands of an opulent luxurious nation because this situation whilst it leaves them every advantage of luxury exempts them from the evils which naturally accompany its admission into any country     ii next to the mode of living we are to consider the quantity of provision suited to that mode which is either raised in the country or imported into it for this is the order in which we assigned the causes of population and undertook to treat of them now if we measure the quantity of provision by the number of human bodies it will support in due health and vigour this quantity the extent and quality of the soil from which it is raised being given will depend greatly upon the kind for instance a piece of ground capable of supplying animal food sufficient for the subsistence of ten persons would sustain at least the double of that number with grain roots and milk the first resource of savage life is in the flesh of wild animals hence the numbers amongst savage nations compared with the tract of country which they occupy are universally small because this species of provision is of all others supplied in the slenderest proportion the next step was the invention of pasturage or the rearing of flocks and herds of tame animals this alteration added to the stock of provision much but the last and principal improvement was to follow namely tillage or the artificial production of corn esculent plants and roots this discovery whilst it changed the quality of human food augmented the quantity in a vast proportion so far as the state of population is governed and limited by the quantity of provision perhaps there is no single cause that affects it so powerfully as the kind and quality of food which chance or usage hath introduced into a country in england notwithstanding the produce of the soil has been of late considerably increased by the enclosure of wastes and the adoption in many places of a more successful husbandry yet we do not observe a corresponding addition to the number of inhabitants the reason of which appears to me to be the more general consumption of animal food amongst us many ranks of people whose ordinary diet was in the last century prepared almost entirely from milk roots and vegetables now require every day a considerable     portion of the flesh of animals hence a great part of the richest lands of the country are converted to pasturage much also of the breadcorn which went directly to the nourishment of human bodies now only contributes to it by fattening the flesh of sheep and oxen the mass and volume of provisions are hereby diminished and what is gained in the melioration of the soil is lost in the quality of the produce this consideration teaches us that tillage as an object of national care and encouragement is universally preferable to pasturage because the kind of provision which it yields goes much farther in the sustentation of human life tillage is also recommended by this additional advantage that it affords employment to a much more numerous peasantry indeed pasturage seems to be the art of a nation either imperfectly civilized as are many of the tribes which cultivate it in the internal parts of asia or of a nation like spain declining from its summit by luxury and inactivity the kind and quality of provision together with the extent and capacity of the soil from which it is raised being the same the quantity procured will principally depend upon two circumstances—the ability of the occupier and the encouragement which he receives the greatest misfortune of a country is an indigent tenantry whatever be the native advantages of the soil or even the skill and industry of the occupier the want of a sufficient capital confines every plan as well as cripples and weakens every operation of husbandry this evil is felt where agriculture is accounted a servile or mean employment where farms are extremely subdivided and badly furnished with habitations where leases are unknown or are of short or precarious duration with respect to the encouragement of husbandry in this as in every other employment the true reward of industry is in the price and sale of the produce the exclusive right to the produce is the only incitement which acts constantly and universally the only spring which keeps   0 human labour in motion all therefore that the laws can do is to secure this right to the occupier of the ground that is to constitute such a system of tenure that the full and entire advantage of every improvement go to the benefit of the improver that every man work for himself and not for another and that no one share in the profit who does not assist in the production by the occupier i here mean not so much the person who performs the work as him who procures the labour and directs the management and i consider the whole profit as received by the occupier when the occupier is benefited by the whole value of what is produced which is the case with the tenant who pays a fixed rent for the use of land no less than with the proprietor who holds it as his own the one has the same interest in the produce and in the advantage of every improvement as the other likewise the proprietor though he grant out his estate to farm may be considered as the occupier insomuch as he regulates the occupation by the choice superintendency and encouragement of his tenants by the disposition of his lands by erecting buildings providing accommodations by prescribing conditions or supplying implements and materials of improvement and is entitled by the rule of public expediency above mentioned to receive in the advance of his rent a share of the benefit which arises from the increased produce of his estate the violation of this fundamental maxim of agrarian policy constitutes the chief objection to the holding of lands by the state by the king by corporate bodies by private persons in right of their offices or benefices the inconveniency to the public arises not so much from the unalienable quality of lands thus holden in perpetuity as from hence that proprietors of this description seldom contribute much either of attention or expense to the cultivation of their estates yet claim by the rent a share in the profit of every improvement that is made upon them this complaint can only be obviated by long leases at a fixed rent which convey a large     portion of the interest to those who actually conduct the cultivation the same objection is applicable to the holding of lands by foreign proprietors and in some degree to estates of too great extent being placed in the same hands iii beside the production of provision there remains to be considered the distribution it is in vain that provisions abound in the country unless i be able to obtain a share of them this reflection belongs to every individual the plenty of provision produced the quantity of the public stock affords subsistence to individuals and encouragement to the formation of families only in proportion as it is distributed that is in proportion as these individuals are allowed to draw from it a supply of their own wants the distribution therefore becomes of equal consequence to population with the production now there is but one principle of distribution that can ever become universal namely the principle of exchange or in other words that every man have something to give in return for what he wants bounty however it may come in aid of another principle however it may occasionally qualify the rigour or supply the imperfection of an established rule of distribution can never itself become that rule or principle because men will not work to give the produce of their labour away moreover the only equivalents that can be offered in exchange for provision are power and labour all property is power what we call property in land is the power to use it and to exclude others from the use money is the representative of power because it is convertible into power the value of it consists in its faculty of procuring power over things and persons but power which results from civil conventions and of this kind is what we call a mans fortune or estate is necessarily confined to a few and is withal soon exhausted whereas the capacity of labour is every mans natural possession and composes a constant and renewing fund the hire therefore or produce of personal industry is that which the bulk of every community must bring to     market in exchange for the means of subsistence in other words employment must in every country be the medium of distribution and the source of supply to individuals but when we consider the production and distribution of provision as distinct from and independent of each other when supposing the same quantity to be produced we inquire in what way or according to what rule it may be distributed we are led to a conception of the subject not at all agreeable to truth and reality for in truth and reality though provision must be produced before it be distributed yet the production depends in a great measure upon the distribution the quantity of provision raised out of the ground so far as the raising of it requires human art or labour will evidently be regulated by the demand the demand or in other words the price and sale being that which alone rewards the care or excites the diligence of the husbandman but the sale of provision depends upon the number not of those who want but of those who have something to offer in return for what they want not of those who would consume but of those who can buy that is upon the number of those who have the fruits of some other kind of industry to tender in exchange for what they stand in need of from the production of the soil we see therefore the connexion between population and employment employment affects population directly as it affords the only medium of distribution by which individuals can obtain from the common stock a supply for the wants of their families it affects population indirectly as it augments the stock itself of provision in the only way by which the production of it can be effectually encouraged—by furnishing purchasers no man can purchase without an equivalent and that equivalent by the generality of the people must in every country be derived from employment and upon this basis is founded the public benefit of trade that is to say its subserviency to population in which its only real utility     consists of that industry and of those arts and branches of trade which are employed in the production conveyance and preparation of any principal species of human food as of the business of the husbandman the butcher baker brewer cornmerchant c we acknowledge the necessity likewise of those manufactures which furnish us with warm clothing convenient habitations domestic utensils as of the weaver tailor smith carpenter c we perceive in climates however like ours removed at a distance from the sun the conduciveness to population by their rendering human life more healthy vigorous and comfortable but not one half of the occupations which compose the trade of europe fall within either of these descriptions perhaps twothirds of the manufacturers in england are employed upon articles of confessed luxury ornament or splendour in the superfluous embellishment of some articles which are useful in their kind or upon others which have no conceivable use or value but what is founded in caprice or fashion what can be less necessary or less connected with the sustentation of human life than the whole produce of the silk lace and plate manufactory yet what multitudes labour in the different branches of these arts what can be imagined more capricious than the fondness for tobacco and snuff yet how many various occupations and how many thousands in each are set at work in administering to this frivolous gratification concerning trades of this kind and this kind comprehends more than half of the trades that are exercised it may fairly be asked how since they add nothing to the stock of provision do they tend to increase the number of the people we are taught to say of trade that it maintains multitudes but by what means does it maintain them when it produces nothing upon which the support of human life depends in like manner with respect to foreign commerce of that merchandise which brings the necessaries of life into a country which imports for example corn or cattle or cloth or fuel we allow the     tendency to advance population because it increases the stock of provision by which the people are subsisted but this effect of foreign commerce is so little seen in our own country that i believe it may be affirmed of great britain what bishop berkley said of a neighbouring island that if it were encompassed with a wall of brass fifty cubits high the country might maintain the same number of inhabitants that find subsistence in it at present and that every necessary and even every real comfort and accommodation of human life might be supplied in as great abundance as they now are here therefore as before we may fairly ask by what operation it is that foreign commerce which brings into the country no one article of human subsistence promotes the multiplication of human life the answer of this inquiry will be contained in the discussion of another viz since the soil will maintain many more than it can employ what must be done supposing the country to be full with the remainder of the inhabitants they who by the rules of partition and some such must be established in every country are entitled to the land and they who by their labour upon the soil acquire a right in its produce will not part with their property for nothing or rather they will no longer raise from the soil what they can neither use themselves nor exchange for what they want or lastly if these were willing to distribute what they could spare of the provision which the ground yielded to others who had no share or concern in the property or cultivation of it yet still the most enormous mischiefs would ensue from great numbers remaining unemployed the idleness of one half of the community would overwhelm the whole with confusion and disorder one only way presents itself of removing the difficulty which this question states and which is simply this that they whose work is not wanted nor can be employed in the raising of provision out of the ground     convert their hands and ingenuity to the fabrication of articles which may gratify and requite those who are so employed or who by the division of lands in the country are entitled to the exclusive possession of certain parts of them by this contrivance all things proceed well the occupier of the ground raises from it the utmost that he can procure because he is repaid for what he can spare by something else which he wants or with which he is pleased the artist or manufacturer though he have neither any property in the soil nor any concern in its cultivation is regularly supplied with the produce because he gives in exchange for what he stands in need of something upon which the receiver places an equal value and the community is kept quiet while both sides are engaged in their respective occupations it appears then that the business of one half of mankind is to set the other half at work that is to provide articles which by tempting the desires may stimulate the industry and call forth the activity of those upon the exertion of whose industry and the application of whose faculties the production of human provision depends a certain portion only of human labour is or can be productive the rest is instrumental—both equally necessary though the one have no other object than to excite the other it appears also that it signifies nothing as to the main purpose of trade how superfluous the articles which it furnishes are whether the want of them be real or imaginary whether it be founded in nature or in opinion in fashion habit or emulation it is enough that they be actually desired and sought after flourishing cities are raised and supported by trading in tobacco populous towns subsist by the manufactory of ribands a watch may be a very unnecessary appendage to the dress of a peasant yet if the peasant will till the ground in order to obtain a watch the true design of trade is answered and the watchmaker while he polishes the case or files the wheels of his machine is contributing to the production of     corn as effectually though not so directly as if he handled the spade or held the plough the use of tobacco has been mentioned already not only as an acknowledged superfluity but as affording a remarkable example of the caprice of human appetite yet if the fisherman will ply his nets or the mariner fetch rice from foreign countries in order to procure to himself this indulgence the market is supplied with two important articles of provision by the instrumentality of a merchandise which has no other apparent use than the gratification of a vitiated palate but it may come to pass that the husbandman landowner or whoever he be that is entitled to the produce of the soil will no longer exchange it for what the manufacturer has to offer he is already supplied to the extent of his desires for instance he wants no more cloth he will no longer therefore give the weaver corn in return for the produce of his looms but he would readily give it for tea or for wine when the weaver finds this to be the case he has nothing to do but to send his cloth abroad in exchange for tea or for wine which he may barter for that provision which the offer of his cloth will no longer procure the circulation is thus revived and the benefit of the discovery is that whereas the number of weavers who could find subsistence from their employment was before limited by the consumption of cloth in the country that number is now augmented in proportion to the demand for tea and wine this is the principle of foreign commerce in the magnitude and complexity of the machine the principle of motion is sometimes lost or unobserved but it is always simple and the same to whatever extent it may be diversified and enlarged in its operation the effect of trade upon agriculture the process of which we have been endeavouring to describe is visible in the neighbourhood of trading towns and in those districts which carry on a communication with the markets of trading towns the husbandmen are busy and skilful the peasantry laborious the land is managed     to the best advantage and double the quantity of corn or herbage articles which are ultimately converted into human provision raised from it of what the same soil yields in remoter and more neglected parts of the country wherever a thriving manufactory finds means to establish itself a new vegetation springs up around it i believe it is true that agriculture never arrives at any considerable much less at its highest degree of perfection where it is not connected with trade that is where the demand for the produce is not increased by the consumption of trading cities let it be remembered then that agriculture is the immediate source of human provision that trade conduces to the production of provision only as it promotes agriculture that the whole system of commerce vast and various as it is hath no other public importance than its subserviency to this end we return to the proposition we laid down that employment universally promotes population from this proposition it follows that the comparative utility of different branches of national commerce is measured by the number which each branch employs upon which principle a scale may easily be constructed which shall assign to the several kinds and divisions of foreign trade their respective degrees of public importance in this scale the first place belongs to the exchange of wrought goods for raw materials as of broadcloth for raw silk cutlery for wool clocks or watches for iron flax or furs because this traffic provides a market for the labour that has already been expended at the same time that it supplies materials for new industry population always flourishes where this species of commerce obtains to any considerable degree it is the cause of employment or the certain indication as it takes off the manufactures of the country it promotes employment as it brings in raw materials it supposes the existence of manufactories in the country and a demand for the article when manufactured the second place is due to that commerce which     barters one species of wrought goods for another as stuffs for calicoes fustians for cambrics leather for paper or wrought goods for articles which require no farther preparation as for wine oil tea sugar c this also assists employment because when the country is stocked with one kind of manufacture it renews the demand by converting it into another but it is inferior to the former as it promotes this end by one side only of the bargain—by what it carries out the last the lowest and most disadvantageous species of commerce is the exportation of raw materials in return for wrought goods as when wool is sent abroad to purchase velvets hides or peltry to procure shoes hats or linen cloth this trade is unfavourable to population because it leaves no room or demand for employment either in what it takes out of the country or in what it brings into it its operation on both sides is noxious by its exports it diminishes the very subject upon which the industry of the inhabitants ought to be exercised by its imports it lessens the encouragement of that industry in the same proportion that it supplies the consumption of the country with the produce of foreign labour of different branches of manufactory those are in their nature the most beneficial in which the price of the wrought article exceeds in the highest proportion that of the raw material for this excess measures the quantity of employment or in other words the number of manufacturers which each branch sustains the produce of the ground is never the most advantageous article of foreign commerce under a perfect state of public oeconomy the soil of the country should be applied solely to the raising of provisions for the inhabitants and its trade be supplied by their industry a nation will never reach its proper extent of population so long as its principal commerce consists in the exportation of corn or cattle or even of wine oil tobacco madder indigo timber because these last articles take up that surface which ought to be covered with the materials of human subsistence     it must be here however noticed that we have all along considered the inhabitants of a country as maintained by the produce of the country and that what we have said is applicable with strictness to this supposition alone the reasoning nevertheless may easily be adapted to a different case for when provision is not produced but imported what has been affirmed concerning provision will be in a great measure true of that article whether it be money produce or labour which is exchanged for provision thus when the dutch raise madder and exchange it for corn or when the people of america plant tobacco and send it to europe for cloth the cultivation of madder and tobacco becomes as necessary to the subsistence of the inhabitants and by consequence will affect the state of population in these countries as sensibly as the actual production of food or the manufactory of raiment in like manner when the same inhabitants of holland earn money by the carriage of the produce of one country to another and with that money purchase the provision from abroad which their own land is not extensive enough to supply the increase or decline of this carrying trade will influence the numbers of the people no less than similar changes would do in the cultivation of the soil the few principles already established will enable us to describe the effects upon population which may be expected from the following important articles of national conduct and oeconomy i emigration emigration may be either the overflowing of a country or the desertion as the increase of the species is indefinite and the number of inhabitants which any given tract or surface can support finite it is evident that great numbers may be constantly leaving a country and yet the country remain constantly full or whatever be the cause which invincibly limits the population of a country when the number of the people has arrived at that limit the progress of generation beside continuing the succession will supply multitudes for foreign emigration in   0 these two cases emigration neither indicates any political decay nor in truth diminishes the number of the people nor ought to be prohibited or discouraged but emigrants may relinquish their country from a sense of insecurity oppression annoyance and inconveniency neither again here is it emigration which wastes the people but the evils that occasion it it would be in vain if it were practicable to confine the inhabitants at home for the same causes which drive them out of the country would prevent their multiplication if they remained in it lastly men may be tempted to change their situation by the allurement of a better climate of a more refined or luxurious manner of living by the prospect of wealth or sometimes by the mere nominal advantage of higher wages and prices this class of emigrants with whom alone the laws can interfere with effect will never i think be numerous with the generality of a people the attachment of mankind to their homes and country the irksomeness of seeing new habitations and of living amongst strangers will outweigh so long as men possess the necessaries of life in safety or at least so long as they can obtain a provision for that mode of subsistence which the class of citizens to which they belong are accustomed to enjoy all the inducements that the advantages of a foreign land can offer there appear therefore to be few cases in which emigration can be prohibited with advantage to the state it appears also that emigration is an equivocal symptom which will probably accompany the decline of the political body but which may likewise attend a condition of perfect health and vigour ii colonisation the only view under which our subject will permit us to consider colonisation is in its tendency to augment the population of the parent state suppose a fertile but empty island to lie within the reach of a country in which arts and manufactures are already established suppose a colony sent out from such a country to take possession of the island and to live there     under the protection and authority of their native government the new settlers will naturally convert their labour to the cultivation of the vacant soil and with the produce of that soil will draw a supply of manufactures from their countrymen at home whilst the inhabitants continue few and lands cheap and fresh the colonists will find it easier and more profitable to raise corn or rear cattle and with corn and cattle to purchase woollen cloth for instance or linen than to spin or weave these articles for themselves the mothercountry meanwhile derives from this connexion an increase both of provision and employment it promotes at once the two great requisites upon which the facility of subsistence and by consequence the state of population depend—production and distribution and this in a manner the most direct and beneficial no situation can be imagined more favourable to population than that of a country which works up goods for others whilst these others are cultivating new tracts of land for them for as in a genial climate and from a fresh soil the labour of one man will raise provision enough for ten it is manifest that where all are employed in agriculture much the greater part of the produce will be spared from the consumption and that three out of four at least of those who are maintained by it will reside in the country which receives the redundancy when the new country does not remit provision to the old one the advantage is less but still the exportation of wrought goods by whatever return they are paid for advances population in that secondary way in which those trades promote it that are not employed in the production of provision whatever prejudice therefore some late events have excited against schemes of colonisation the system itself is founded in apparent national utility and what is more upon principles favourable to the common interest of human nature for it does not appear by what other method newly discovered and unfrequented countries can be peopled or during the infancy of their establishment be protected or     supplied the error which we of this nation at present lament seems to have consisted not so much in the original formation of colonies as in the subsequent management in imposing restrictions too rigorous or in continuing them too long in not perceiving the point of time when the irresistible order and progress of human affairs demand a change of laws and policy iii money where money abounds the people are generally numerous yet gold and silver neither feed nor clothe mankind nor are they in all countries converted into provision by purchasing the necessaries of life at foreign markets nor do they in any country compose those articles of personal or domestic ornament which certain orders of the community have learnt to regard as necessaries of life and without the means of procuring which they will not enter into familyestablishments at least this property of the precious metals obtains in a very small degree the effect of money upon the number of the people though visible to observation is not explained without some difficulty to understand this connexion properly we must return to the proposition with which we concluded our reasoning upon the subject that population is chiefly promoted by employment now of employment money is partly the indication and partly the cause the only way in which money regularly and spontaneously flows into a country is in return for the goods that are sent out of it or the work that is performed by it and the only way in which money is retained in a country is by the countrys supplying in a great measure its own consumption of manufactures consequently the quantity of money found in a country denotes the amount of labour and employment but still employment not money is the cause of population the accumulation of money being merely a collateral effect of the same cause or a circumstance which accompanies the existence and measures the operation of that cause and this is true of money only whilst it is acquired by the industry of the inhabitants the     treasures which belong to a country by the possession of mines or by the exaction of tribute from foreign dependencies afford no conclusion concerning the state of population the influx from these sources may be immense and yet the country remain poor and illpeopled of which we see an egregious example in the condition of spain since the acquisition of its southamerican dominions but secondly money may become also a real and an operative cause of population by acting as a stimulus to industry and by facilitating the means of subsistence the ease of subsistence and the encouragement of industry depend neither upon the price of labour nor upon the price of provision but upon the proportion which one bears to the other now the influx of money into a country naturally tends to advance this proportion that is every fresh accession of money raises the price of labour before it raises the price of provision when money is brought from abroad the persons be they who they will into whose hands it first arrives do not buy up provision with it but apply it to the purchase and payment of labour if the state receives it the state dispenses what it receives amongst soldiers sailors artificers engineers shipwrights workmen if private persons bring home treasures of gold and silver they usually expend them in the building of houses the improvement of estates the purchase of furniture dress equipage in articles of luxury or splendor if the merchant be enriched by returns of his foreign commerce he applies his increased capital to the enlargement of his business at home the money ere long comes to market for provision but it comes thither through the hands of the manufacturer the artist the husbandman and labourer its effect therefore upon the price of art and labour will precede its effect upon the price of provision and during the interval between one effect and the other the means of subsistence will be multiplied and facilitated as well as industry be excited by new     rewards when the greater plenty of money in circulation has produced an advance in the price of provision corresponding to the advanced price of labour its effect ceases the labourer no longer gains any thing by the increase of his wages it is not therefore the quantity of specie collected into a country but the continual increase of that quantity from which the advantage arises to employment and population it is only the accession of money which produces the effect and it is only by money constantly flowing into a country that the effect can be constant now whatever consequence arises to the country from the influx of money the contrary may be expected to follow from the diminution of its quantity and accordingly we find that whatever cause drains off the specie of a country faster than the streams which feed it can supply not only impoverishes the country but depopulates it the knowledge and experience of this effect have given occasion to a phrase which occurs in almost every discourse upon commerce or politics the balance of trade with any foreign nation is said to be against or in favour of a country simply as it tends to carry money out or bring it in that is according as the price of the imports exceeds or falls short of the price of the exports so invariably is the increase or diminution of the specie of a country regarded as a test of the public advantage or detriment which arises from any branch of its commerce iv taxation as taxes take nothing out of a country as they do not diminish the public stock only vary the distribution of it they are not necessarily prejudicial to population if the state exact money from certain members of the community she dispenses it also amongst other members of the same community they who contribute to the revenue and they who are supported or benefited by the expenses of government are to be placed one against the other and whilst what the subsistence of one part is profited by receiving compensates for what that of the other suffers by paying     the common fund of the society is not lessened this is true but it must be observed that although the sum distributed by the state be always equal to the sum collected from the people yet the gain and loss to the means of subsistence may be very unequal and the balance will remain on the wrong or the right side of the account according as the money passes by taxation from the industrious to the idle from the many to the few from those who want to those who abound or in a contrary direction for instance a tax upon coaches to be laid out in the repair of roads would probably improve the population of a neighbourhood a tax upon cottages to be ultimately expended in the purchase and support of coaches would certainly diminish it in like manner a tax upon wine or tea distributed in bounties to fishermen or husbandmen would augment the provision of a country a tax upon fisheries and husbandry however indirect and concealed to be converted when raised to the procuring of wine or tea for the idle and opulent would naturally impair the public stock the effect therefore of taxes upon the means of subsistence depends not so much upon the amount of the sum levied as upon the object of the tax and the application taxes likewise may be so adjusted as to conduce to the restraint of luxury and the correction of vice to the encouragement of industry trade agriculture and marriage taxes thus contrived become rewards and penalties not only sources of revenue but instruments of police vices indeed themselves cannot be taxed without holding forth such a conditional toleration of them as to destroy mens perception of their guilt a tax comes to be considered as a commutation the materials however and incentives of vice may although for instance drunkenness would be on this account an unfit object of taxation yet public houses and spirituous liquors are very properly subjected to heavy imposts nevertheless although it may be true that taxes cannot be pronounced to be detrimental to population by any absolute necessity     in their nature and though under some modifications and when urged only to a certain extent they may even operate in favour of it yet it will be found in a great plurality of instances that their tendency is noxious let it be supposed that nine families inhabit a neighbourhood each possessing barely the means of subsistence or of that mode of subsistence which custom hath established amongst them let a tenth family be quartered upon these to be supported by a tax raised from the nine or rather let one of the nine have his income augmented by a similar deduction from the incomes of the rest in either of these cases it is evident that the whole district would be broken up for as the entire income of each is supposed to be barely sufficient for the establishment which it maintains a deduction of any part destroys that establishment now it is no answer to this objection it is no apology for the grievance to say that nothing is taken out of the neighbourhood that the stock is not diminished the mischief is done by deranging the distribution nor again is the luxury of one family or even the maintenance of an additional family a recompense to the country for the ruin of nine others nor lastly will it alter the effect though it may conceal the cause that the contribution instead of being levied directly upon each days wages is mixed up in the price of some article of constant use and consumption as in a tax upon candles malt leather or fuel this example illustrates the tendency of taxes to obstruct subsistence and the minutest degree of this obstruction will be felt in the formation of families the example indeed forms an extreme case the evil is magnified in order to render its operation distinct and visible in real life families may not be broken up or forced from their habitation houses be quitted or countries suddenly deserted in consequence of any new imposition whatever but marriages will become gradually less frequent it seems necessary however to distinguish between the operation of a new tax and the effect of taxes which have been long     established in the course of circulation the money may flow back to the hands from which it was taken the proportion between the supply and the expense of subsistence which had been disturbed by the tax may at length recover itself again in the instance just now stated the addition of a tenth family to the neighbourhood or the enlarged expenses of one of the nine may in some shape or other so advance the profits or increase the employment of the rest as to make full restitution for the share of their property of which it deprives them or what is more likely to happen a reduction may take place in their mode of living suited to the abridgement of their incomes yet still the ultimate and permanent effect of taxation though distinguishable from the impression of a new tax is generally adverse to population the proportion above spoken of can only be restored by one side or other of the following alternative by the people either contracting their wants which at the same time diminishes consumption and employment or by raising the price of labour which necessarily adding to the price of the productions and manufactures of the country checks their sale at foreign markets a nation which is burthened with taxes must always be undersold by a nation which is free from them unless the difference be made up by some singular advantage of climate soil skill or industry this quality belongs to all taxes which affect the mass of the community even when imposed upon the properest objects and applied to the fairest purposes but abuses are inseparable from the disposal of public money as governments are usually administered the produce of public taxes is expended upon a train of gentry in the maintaining of pomp or in the purchase of influence the conversion of property which taxes effectuate when they are employed in this manner is attended with obvious evils it takes from the industrious to give to the idle it increases the number of the latter it tends to accumulation it sacrifices the conveniency of many to the luxury of a few it makes no return to the     people from whom the tax is drawn that is satisfactory or intelligible it encourages no activity which is useful or productive the sum to be raised being settled a wise statesman will contrive his taxes principally with a view to their effect upon population that is he will so adjust them as to give the least possible obstruction to those means of subsistence by which the mass of the community is maintained we are accustomed to an opinion that a tax to be just ought to be accurately proportioned to the circumstances of the persons who pay it but upon what it might be asked is this opinion founded unless it could be shown that such a proportion interferes the least with the general conveniency of subsistence whereas i should rather believe that a tax constructed with a view to that conveniency ought to rise upon the different classes of the community in a much higher ratio than the simple proportion of their incomes the point to be regarded is not what men have but what they can spare and it is evident that a man who possesses a thousand pounds a year can more easily give up a hundred than a man with a hundred pounds a year can part with ten that is those habits of life which are reasonable and innocent and upon the ability to continue which the formation of families depends will be much less affected by the one deduction than the other it is still more evident that a man of a hundred pounds a year would not be so much distressed in his subsistence by a demand from him of ten pounds as a man of ten pounds a year would be by the loss of one to which we must add that the population of every country being replenished by the marriages of the lowest ranks of the society their accommodation and relief become of more importance to the state than the conveniency of any higher but less numerous order of its citizens but whatever be the proportion which public expediency directs whether the simple the duplicate or any higher or immediate proportion of mens incomes it can never be attained by any single tax as no single object of taxation     can be found which measures the ability of the subject with sufficient generality and exactness it is only by a system and variety of taxes mutually balancing and equalising one another that a due proportion can be preserved for instance if a tax upon lands press with greater hardship upon those who live in the country it may be properly counterpoised by a tax upon the rent of houses which will affect principally the inhabitants of large towns distinctions may also be framed in some taxes which shall allow abatements or exemptions to married persons to the parents of a certain number of legitimate children to improvers of the soil to particular modes of cultivation as to tillage in preference to pasturage and in general to that industry which is immediately productive in preference to that which is only instrumental but above all which may leave the heaviest part of the burthen upon the methods whatever they be of acquiring wealth without industry or even of subsisting in idleness v exportation of breadcorn nothing seems to have a more positive tendency to reduce the number of the people than the sending abroad part of the provision by which they are maintained yet this has been the policy of legislators very studious of the improvement of their country in order to reconcile ourselves to a practice which appears to militate with the chief interest that is with the population of the country that adopts it we must be reminded of a maxim which belongs to the productions both of nature and art that it is impossible to have enough without a superfluity the point of sufficiency cannot in any case be so exactly hit upon as to have nothing to spare yet never to want this is peculiarly true of breadcorn of which the annual increase is extremely variable as it is necessary that the crop be adequate to the consumption in a year of scarcity it must of consequence greatly exceed it in a year of plenty a redundancy therefore will occasionally arise from the very care that is taken to secure the   0 people against the danger of want and it is manifest that the exportation of this redundancy subtracts nothing from the number that can regularly be maintained by the produce of the soil moreover as the exportation of corn under these circumstances is attended with no direct injury to population so the benefits which indirectly arise to population from foreign commerce belong to this in common with other species of trade together with the peculiar advantage of presenting a constant incitement to the skill and industry of the husbandman by the promise of a certain sale and an adequate price under every contingency of season and produce there is another situation in which corn may not only be exported but in which the people can thrive by no other means that is of a newly settled country with a fertile soil the exportation of a large proportion of the corn which a country produces proves it is true that the inhabitants have not yet attained to the number which the country is capable of maintaining but it does not prove but that they may be hastening to this limit with the utmost practicable celerity which is the perfection to be sought for in a young establishment in all cases except those two and in the former of them to any greater degree than what is necessary to take off occasional redundancies the exportation of corn is either itself noxious to population or argues a defect of population arising from some other cause vi abridgement of labour it has long been made a question whether those mechanical contrivances which abridge labour by performing the same work by fewer hands be detrimental or not to the population of a country from what has been delivered in preceding parts of the present chapter it will be evident that this question is equivalent to another—whether such contrivances diminish or not the quantity of employment the first and most obvious effect undoubtedly is this because if one man be made to do what three men did before two are immediately discharged but     if by some more general and remoter consequence they increase the demand for work or what is the same thing prevent the diminution of that demand in a greater proportion than they contract the number of hands by which it is performed the quantity of employment upon the whole will gain an addition upon which principle it may be observed first that whenever a mechanical invention succeeds in one place it is necessary that it be imitated in every other where the same manufacture is carried on for it is manifest that he who has the benefit of a conciser operation will soon outvie and undersell a competitor who continues to use a more circuitous labour it is also true in the second place that whoever first discover or adopt a mechanical improvement will for some time draw to themselves an increase of employment and that this preference may continue even after the improvement has become general for in every kind of trade it is not only a great but permanent advantage to have once preoccupied the public reputation thirdly after every superiority which might be derived from the possession of a secret has ceased it may be well questioned whether even then any loss can accrue to employment the same money will be spared to the same article still wherefore in proportion as the article can be afforded at a lower price by reason of an easier or shorter process in the manufacture it will either grow into more general use or an improvement will take place in the quality and fabric which will demand a proportionable addition of hands the number of persons employed in the manufactory of stockings has not i apprehend decreased since the invention of stockingmills the amount of what is expended upon the article after subtracting from it the price of the raw material and consequently what is paid for work in this branch of our manufactories is not less than it was before goods of a finer texture are worn in the place of coarser this is the change which the invention has produced and which compensates to the manufactory for every     other inconveniency add to which that in the above and in almost every instance an improvement which conduces to the recommendation of a manufactory either by the cheapness or the quality of the goods draws up after it many dependent employments in which no abbreviation has taken place from the reasoning that has been pursued and the various considerations suggested in this chapter a judgement may in some sort be formed how far regulations of law are in their nature capable of contributing to the support and advancement of population i say how far for as in many subjects so especially in those which relate to commerce to plenty to riches and to the number of people more is wont to be expected from laws than laws can do laws can only imperfectly restrain that dissoluteness of manners which by diminishing the frequency of marriages impairs the very source of population laws cannot regulate the wants of mankind their mode of living or their desire of those superfluities which fashion more irresistible than laws has once introduced into general usage or in other words has erected into necessaries of life laws cannot induce men to enter into marriages when the expenses of a family must deprive them of that system of accommodation to which they have habituated their expectations laws by their protection by assuring to the labourer the fruit and profit of his labour may help to make a people industrious but without industry the laws cannot provide either subsistence or employment laws cannot make corn grow without toil and care or trade flourish without art and diligence in spite of all laws the expert laborious honest workman will be employed in preference to the lazy the unskilful the fraudulent and evasive and this is not more     true of two inhabitants of the same village than it is of the people of two different countries which communicate either with each other or with the rest of the world the natural basis of trade is rivalship of quality and price or which is the same thing of skill and industry every attempt to force trade by operation of law that is by compelling persons to buy goods at one market which they can obtain cheaper and better from another is sure to be either eluded by the quicksightedness and incessant activity of private interest or to be frustrated by retaliation one half of the commercial laws of many states are calculated merely to counteract the restrictions which have been imposed by other states perhaps the only way in which the interposition of law is salutary in trade is in the prevention of frauds next to the indispensable requisites of internal peace and security the chief advantage which can be derived to population from the interference of law appears to me to consist in the encouragement of agriculture this at least is the direct way of increasing the number of the people every other mode being effectual only by its influence upon this now the principal expedient by which such a purpose can be promoted is to adjust the laws of property as nearly as possible to the following rules first to give to the occupier all the power over the soil which is necessary for its perfect cultivation secondly to assign the whole profit of every improvement to the persons by whose activity it is carried on what we call property in land as hath been observed above is power over it now it is indifferent to the public in whose hands this power resides if it be rightly used it matters not to whom the land belongs if it be well cultivated when we lament that great estates are often united in the same hand or complain that one man possesses what would be sufficient for a thousand we suffer ourselves to be misled by words the owner of ten thousand pounds a year consumes little more of the produce of the soil than the owner     of ten pounds a year if the cultivation be equal the estate in the hands of one great lord affords subsistence and employment to the same number of persons as it would do if it were divided amongst a hundred proprietors in like manner we ought to judge of the effect upon the public interest which may arise from lands being holden by the king or by the subject by private persons or by corporations by laymen or ecclesiastics in fee or for life by virtue of office or in right of inheritance i do not mean that these varieties make no difference but i mean that all the difference they do make respects the cultivation of the lands which are so holden there exist in this country conditions of tenure which condemn the land itself to perpetual sterility of this kind is the right of common which precludes each proprietor from the improvement or even the convenient occupation of his estate without what seldom can be obtained the consent of many others this tenure is also usually embarrassed by the interference of manorial claims under which it often happens that the surface belongs to one owner and the soil to another so that neither owner can stir a clod without the concurrence of his partner in the property in many manors the tenant is restrained from granting leases beyond a short term of years which renders every plan of solid improvement impracticable in these cases the owner wants what the first rule of rational policy requires sufficient power over the soil for its perfect cultivation this power ought to be extended to him by some easy and general law of enfranchisement partition and enclosure which though compulsory upon the lord or the rest of the tenants whilst it has in view the melioration of the soil and tenders an equitable compensation for every right that it takes away is neither more arbitrary nor more dangerous to the stability of property than that which is done in the construction of roads bridges embankments navigable canals and indeed in almost every public work in which private owners of land are     obliged to accept that price for their property which an indifferent jury may award it may here however be proper to observe that although the enclosure of wastes and pastures be generally beneficial to population yet the enclosure of lands in tillage in order to convert them into pastures is as generally hurtful but secondly agriculture is discouraged by every constitution of landed property which lets in those who have no concern in the improvement to a participation of the profit this objection is applicable to all such customs of manors as subject the proprietor upon the death of the lord or tenant or the alienation of the estate to a fine apportioned to the improved value of the land but of all institutions which are in this way adverse to cultivation and improvement none is so noxious as that of tithes a claimant here enters into the produce who contributed no assistance whatever to the production when years perhaps of care and toil have matured an improvement when the husbandman sees new crops ripening to his skill and industry the moment he is ready to put his sickle to the grain he finds himself compelled to divide his harvest with a stranger tithes are a tax not only upon industry but upon that industry which feeds mankind upon that species of exertion which it is the aim of all wise laws to cherish and promote and to uphold and excite which composes as we have seen the main benefit that the community receives from the whole system of trade and the success of commerce and together with the more general inconveniency that attends the exaction of tithes there is this additional evil in the mode at least according to which they are collected at present that they operate as a bounty upon pasturage the burthen of the tax falls with its chief if not with its whole weight upon tillage that is to say upon that precise mode of cultivation which as hath been shown above it is the business of the state to relieve and remunerate in preference to every other no measure of such extensive concern appears to me so practicable     nor any single alteration so beneficial as the conversion of tithes into cornrents this commutation i am convinced might be so adjusted as to secure to the titheholder a complete and perpetual equivalent for his interest and to leave to industry its full operation and entire reward chapter    of war and military establishments because the christian scriptures describe wars as what they are as crimes or judgements some have been led to believe that it is unlawful for a christian to bear arms but it should be remembered that it may be necessary for individuals to unite their force and for this end to resign themselves to the direction of a common will and yet it may be true that that will is often actuated by criminal motives and often determined to destructive purposes hence although the origin of wars be ascribed in scripture to the operation of lawless and malignant passion and though war itself be enumerated among the sorest calamities with which a land can be visited the profession of a soldier is nowhere forbidden or condemned when the soldiers demanded of john the baptist what they should do he said unto them do violence to no man neither accuse any falsely and be content with your wages† in which answer we do not find that in order to prepare themselves for the reception of the kingdom of god it was required of soldiers to relinquish their profession but only that they should beware of the vices of which that profession was accused the precept which follows be content with your wages supposed them to continue in     their situation it was of a roman centurion that christ pronounced that memorable eulogy i have not found so great faith no not in israel the first gentile convert† who was received into the christian church and to whom the gospel was imparted by the immediate and especial direction of heaven held the same station and in the history of this transaction we discover not the smallest intimation that cornelius upon becoming a christian quitted the service of the roman legion that his profession was objected to or his continuance in it considered as in any wise inconsistent with his new character in applying the principles of morality to the affairs of nations the difficulty which meets us arises from hence that the particular consequence sometimes appears to exceed the value of the general rule in this circumstance is founded the only distinction that exists between the case of independent states and of independent individuals in the transactions of private persons no advantage that results from the breach of a general law of justice can compensate to the public for the violation of the law in the concerns of empire this may sometimes be doubted thus that the faith of promises ought to be maintained as far as is lawful and as far as was intended by the parties whatever inconveniency either of them may suffer by his fidelity in the intercourse of private life is seldom disputed because it is evident to almost every man who reflects upon the subject that the common happiness gains more by the preservation of the rule than it could do by the removal of the inconveniency but when the adherence to a public treaty would enslave a whole people would block up seas rivers or harbours depopulate cities condemn fertile regions to eternal desolation cut off a country from its sources of provision or deprive it of those     commercial advantages to which its climate produce or situation naturally entitle it the magnitude of the particular evil induces us to call in question the obligation of the general rule moral philosophy furnishes no precise solution to these doubts she cannot pronounce that any rule of morality is so rigid as to bend to no exceptions nor on the other hand can she comprise these exceptions within any previous description she confesses that the obligation of every law depends upon its ultimate utility that this utility having a finite and determinate value situations may be feigned and consequently may possibly arise in which the general tendency is outweighed by the enormity of the particular mischief but she recalls at the same time to the consideration of the inquirer the almost inestimable importance as of other general rules of relative justice so especially of national and personal fidelity the unseen if not unbounded extent of the mischief which must follow from the want of it the danger of leaving it to the sufferer to decide upon the comparison of particular and general consequences and the still greater danger of such decisions being drawn into future precedents if treaties for instance be no longer binding than whilst they are convenient or until the inconveniency ascend to a certain point which point must be fixed by the judgement or rather by the feelings of the complaining party or if such an opinion after being authorised by a few examples come at length to prevail one and almost the only method of averting or closing the calamities of war of either preventing or putting a stop to the destruction of mankind is lost to the world for ever we do not say that no evil can exceed this nor any possible advantage compensate it but we say that a loss which affects all will scarcely be made up to the common stock of human happiness by any benefit that can be procured to a single nation which however respectable when compared with any other single nation bears an inconsiderable proportion to the whole these however are the     principles upon which the calculation is to be formed it is enough in this place to remark the cause which produces the hesitation that we sometimes feel in applying rules of personal probity to the conduct of nations as between individuals it is found impossible to ascertain every duty by an immediate reference to public utility not only because such reference is oftentimes too remote for the direction of private consciences but because a multitude of cases arise in which it is indifferent to the general interest by what rule men act though it be absolutely necessary that they act by some constant and known rule or other and as for these reasons certain positive constitutions are wont to be established in every society which when established become as obligatory as the original principles of natural justice themselves so likewise it is between independent communities together with those maxims of universal equity which are common to states and to individuals and by which the rights and conduct of the one as well as the other ought to be adjusted when they fall within the scope and application of such maxims there exists also amongst sovereigns a system of artificial jurisprudence under the name of the law of nations in this code are found the rules which determine the right to vacant or newly discovered countries those which relate to the protection of fugitives the privileges of ambassadors the condition and duties of neutrality the immunities of neutral ships ports and coasts the distance from shore to which these immunities extend the distinction between free and contraband goods and a variety of subjects of the same kind concerning which examples and indeed the principal part of what is called the jus gentium it may be observed that the rules derive their moral force by which i mean the regard that ought to be paid to them by the consciences of sovereigns not from their internal reasonableness or justice for many of them are perfectly arbitrary nor yet from the authority   0 by which they were established for the greater part have grown insensibly into usage without any public compact formal acknowledgement or even known original but simply from the fact of their being established and the general duty of conforming to established rules upon questions and between parties where nothing but positive regulations can prevent disputes and where disputes are followed by such destructive consequences the first of the instances which we have just now enumerated may be selected for the illustration of this remark the nations of europe consider the sovereignty of newly discovered countries as belonging to the prince or state whose subject makes the discovery and in pursuance of this rule it is usual for a navigator who falls upon an unknown shore to take possession of it in the name of his sovereign at home by erecting his standard or displaying his flag upon a desert coast now nothing can be more fanciful or less substantiated by any considerations of reason or justice than the right which such discovery or the transient occupation and idle ceremony that accompany it confer upon the country of the discoverer nor can any stipulation be produced by which the rest of the world have bound themselves to submit to this pretension yet when we reflect that the claims to newly discovered countries can hardly be settled between the different nations which frequent them without some positive rule or other that such claims if left unsettled would prove sources of ruinous and fatal contentions that the rule already proposed however arbitrary possesses one principal quality of a rule—determination and certainty above all that it is acquiesced in and that no one has power to substitute another however he might contrive a better in its place when we reflect upon these properties of the rule or rather upon these consequences of rejecting its authority we are led to ascribe to it the virtue and obligation of a precept of natural justice because we perceive in it that which is the foundation     of justice itself—public importance and utility and a prince who should dispute this rule for the want of regularity in its formation or of intelligible justice in its principle and by such disputes should disturb the tranquillity of nations and at the same time lay the foundation of future disturbances would be little less criminal than he who breaks the public peace by a violation of engagements to which he had himself consented or by an attack upon those national rights which are founded immediately in the law of nature and in the first perceptions of equity the same thing may be repeated of the rules which the law of nations prescribes in the other instances that were mentioned namely that the obscurity of their origin or the arbitrariness of their principle subtracts nothing from the respect that is due to them when once established war may be considered with a view to its causes and to its conduct the justifying causes of war are deliberate invasions of right and the necessity of maintaining such a balance of power amongst neighbouring nations as that no single state or confederacy of states be strong enough to overwhelm the rest the objects of just war are precaution defence or reparation in a larger sense every just war is a defensive war inasmuch as every just war supposes an injury perpetrated attempted or feared the insufficient causes or unjustifiable motives of war are the family alliances the personal friendships or the personal quarrels of princes the internal disputes which are carried on in other nations the justice of other wars the extension of territory or of trade the misfortunes or accidental weakness of a neighbouring or rival nation     there are two lessons of rational and sober policy which if it were possible to inculcate them into the councils of princes would exclude many of the motives of war and allay that restless ambition which is constantly stirring up one part of mankind against another the first of these lessons admonishes princes to place their glory and their emulation not in extent of territory but in raising the greatest quantity of happiness out of a given territory the enlargement of territory by conquest is not only not a just object of war but in the greater part of the instances in which it is attempted not even desirable it is certainly not desirable where it adds nothing to the numbers the enjoyments or the security of the conquerors what commonly is gained to a nation by the annexing of new dependencies or the subjugation of other countries to its dominion but a wider frontier to defend more interfering claims to vindicate more quarrels more enemies more rebellions to encounter a greater force to keep up by sea and land more services to provide for and more establishments to pay and in order to draw from these acquisitions something that may make up for the charge of keeping them a revenue is to be extorted or a monopoly to be enforced and watched at an expense which costs half their produce thus the provinces are oppressed in order to pay for being illgoverned and the original state is exhausted in maintaining a feeble authority over discontented subjects no assignable portion of country is benefited by the change and if the sovereign appear to himself to be enriched or strengthened when every part of his dominion is made poorer and weaker than it was it is probable that he is deceived by appearances or were it true that the grandeur of the prince is magnified by those exploits the glory which is purchased and the ambition which is gratified by the distress of one country without adding to the happiness of another which at the same time enslaves the new and impoverishes the ancient part of the empire by whatever names it may be known     or flattered ought to be an object of universal execration and oftentimes not more so to the vanquished than to the very people whose armies or whose treasures have achieved the victory there are indeed two cases in which the extension of territory may be of real advantage and to both parties the first is where an empire thereby reaches to the natural boundaries which divide it from the rest of the world thus we account the british channel the natural boundary which separates the nations of england and france and if france possessed any countries on this or england any cities or provinces on that side of the sea recovery of such towns and districts to what may be called their natural sovereign though it may not be a just reason for commencing war would be a proper use to make of victory the other case is where neighbouring states being severally too small and weak to defend themselves against the dangers that surround them can only be safe by a strict and constant junction of their strength here conquest will effect the purposes of confederation and alliance and the union which it produces is often more close and permanent than that which results from voluntary association thus if the heptarchy had continued in england the different kingdoms of it might have separately fallen a prey to foreign invasion and although the interest and danger of one part of the island were in truth common to every other part it might have been difficult to have circulated this persuasion amongst independent nations or to have united them in any regular or steady opposition to their continental enemies had not the valour and fortune of an enterprising prince incorporated the whole into a single monarchy here the conquered gained as much by the revolution as the conquerors in like manner and for the same reason when the two royal families of spain were met together in one race of princes and the several provinces of france had devolved into the possession of a single sovereign it became unsafe for the inhabitants of great britain any longer to     remain under separate governments the union of england and scotland which transformed two quarrelsome neighbours into one powerful empire and which was first brought about by the course of succession and afterwards completed by amicable convention would have been a fortunate conclusion of hostilities had it been effected by the operations of war these two cases being admitted namely the obtaining of natural boundaries and barriers and the including under the same government those who have a common danger and a common enemy to guard against i know not whether a third can be thought of in which the extension of empire by conquest is useful even to the conquerors the second rule of prudence which ought to be recommended to those who conduct the affairs of nations is never to pursue national honour as distinct from national interest this rule acknowledges that it is often necessary to assert the honour of a nation for the sake of its interest the spirit and courage of a people are supported by flattering their pride concessions which betray too much of fear or weakness though they relate to points of mere ceremony invite demands and attacks of more serious importance our rule allows all this and only directs that when points of honour become subjects of contention between sovereigns or are likely to be made the occasions of war they be estimated with a reference to utility and not by themselves the dignity of his crown the honour of his flag the glory of his arms in the mouth of a prince are stately and imposing terms but the ideas they inspire are insatiable it may be always glorious to conquer whatever be the justice of the war or the price of the victory the dignity of a sovereign may not permit him to recede from claims of homage and respect at whatever expense of national peace and happiness they are to be maintained however unjust they may have been in their original or in their continuance however useless to the possessor or mortifying and vexatious to other states the pursuit of     honour when set loose from the admonitions of prudence becomes in kings a wild and romantic passion eager to engage and gathering fury in its progress it is checked by no difficulties repelled by no dangers it forgets or despises those considerations of safety ease wealth and plenty which in the eye of true public wisdom compose the objects to which the renown of arms the fame of victory are only instrumental and subordinate the pursuit of interest on the other hand is a sober principle computes costs and consequences is cautious of entering into war stops in time when regulated by those universal maxims of relative justice which belong to the affairs of communities as well as of private persons it is the right principle for nations to proceed by even when it trespasses upon these regulations it is much less dangerous because much more temperate than the other ii the conduct of war if the cause and end of war be justifiable all the means that appear necessary to the end are justifiable also this is the principle which defends those extremities to which the violence of war usually proceeds for since war is a contest by force between parties who acknowledge no common superior and since it includes not in its idea the supposition of any convention which should place limits to the operations of force it has naturally no boundary but that in which force terminates—the destruction of the life against which the force is directed let it be observed however that the licence of war authorises no acts of hostility but what are necessary or conducive to the end and object of the war gratuitous barbarities borrow no excuse from this plea of which kind is every cruelty and every insult that serves only to exasperate the sufferings or to incense the hatred of an enemy without weakening his strength or in any manner tending to procure his submission such as the slaughter of captives the subjecting of them to indignities or torture the violation of women the profanation of temples the demolition of public buildings libraries statues and     in general the destruction or defacing of works that conduce nothing to annoyance or defence these enormities are prohibited not only by the practice of civilised nations but by the law of nature itself as having no proper tendency to accelerate the termination or accomplish the object of the war and as containing that which in peace and war is equally unjustifiable—ultimate and gratuitous mischief there are other restrictions imposed upon the conduct of war not by the law of nature primarily but by the laws of war first and by the law of nature as seconding and ratifying the laws of war the laws of war are part of the law of nations and founded as to their authority upon the same principle with the rest of that code namely upon the fact of their being established no matter when or by whom upon the expectation of their being mutually observed in consequence of that establishment and upon the general utility which results from such observance the binding force of these rules is the greater because the regard that is paid to them must be universal or none the breach of the rule can only be punished by the subversion of the rule itself on which account the whole mischief that ensues from the loss of those salutary restrictions which such rules prescribe is justly chargeable upon the first aggressor to this consideration may be referred the duty of refraining in war from poison and from assassination if the law of nature simply be consulted it may be difficult to distinguish between these and other methods of destruction which are practised without scruple by nations at war if it be lawful to kill an enemy at all it seems lawful to do so by one mode of death as well as by another by a dose of poison as by the point of a sword by the hand of an assassin as by the attack of an army for if it be said that one species of assault leaves to an enemy the power of defending himself against it and that the other does not it may be answered that we possess at least the same right to cut off an enemys defence that we have to seek     his destruction in this manner might the question be debated if there existed no rule or law of war upon the subject but when we observe that such practices are at present excluded by the usage and opinions of civilised nations that the first recourse to them would be followed by instant retaliation that the mutual licence which such attempts must introduce would fill both sides with the misery of continual dread and suspicion without adding to the strength or success of either that when the example came to be more generally imitated which it soon would be after the sentiment that condemns it had been once broken in upon it would greatly aggravate the horrors and calamities of war yet procure no superiority to any of the nations engaged in it when we view these effects we join in the public reprobation of such fatal expedients as of the admission amongst mankind of new and enormous evils without necessity or advantage the law of nature we see at length forbids these innovations as so many transgressions of a beneficial general rule actually subsisting the licence of war then acknowledges two limitations it authorises no hostilities which have not an apparent tendency to effectuate the object of the war it respects those positive laws which the custom of nations hath sanctified and which whilst they are mutually conformed to mitigate the calamities of war without weakening its operations or diminishing the power or safety of belligerent states long and various experience seems to have convinced the nations of europe that nothing but a standing army can oppose a standing army where the numbers on each side bear any moderate proportion to one another the first standing army that appeared     in europe after the fall of the roman legion was that which was erected in france by charles vii about the middle of the fifteenth century and that the institution hath since become general can only be attributed to the superiority and success which are every where observed to attend it the truth is the closeness regularity and quickness of their movements the unreserved instantaneous and almost mechanical obedience to orders the sense of personal honour and the familiarity with danger which belong to a disciplined veteran and embodied soldiery give such firmness and intrepidity to their approach such weight and execution to their attack as are not to be withstood by loose ranks of occasional and newly levied troops who are liable by their inexperience to disorder and confusion and in whom fear is constantly augmented by novelty and surprise it is possible that a militia with a great excess of numbers and a ready supply of recruits may sustain a defensive or a flying war against regular troops it is also true that any service which keeps soldiers for a while together and inures them by little and little to the habits of war and the dangers of action transforms them in effect into a standing army but upon this plan it may be necessary for almost a whole nation to go out to war to repel an invader beside that a people so unprepared must always have the seat and with it the miseries of war at home being utterly incapable of carrying their operations into a foreign country from the acknowledged superiority of standing armies it follows not only that it is unsafe for a nation to disband its regular troops whilst neighbouring kingdoms retain theirs but also that regular troops provide for the public service at the least possible expense i suppose a certain quantity of military strength to be necessary and i say that a standing army costs the community less than any other establishment which presents to an enemy the same force the constant drudgery of low employments is not only incompatible with any great degree of perfection or expertness in     the profession of a soldier but the profession of a soldier almost always unfits men for the business of regular occupations of three inhabitants of a village it is better that one should addict himself entirely to arms and the other two stay constantly at home to cultivate the ground than that all the three should mix the avocations of a camp with the business of husbandry by the former arrangement the country gains one complete soldier and two industrious husbandmen from the latter it receives three raw militiamen who are at the same time three idle and profligate peasants it should be considered also that the emergencies of war wait not for seasons where there is no standing army ready for immediate service it may be necessary to call the reaper from the fields in harvest or the ploughman in seedtime and the provision of a whole year may perish by the interruption of one months labour a standing army therefore is not only a more effectual but a cheaper method of providing for the public safety than any other because it adds more than any other to the common strength and takes less from that which composes the wealth of a nation—its stock of productive industry there is yet another distinction between standing armies and militias which deserves a more attentive consideration than any that has been mentioned when the state relies for its defence upon a militia it is necessary that arms be put into the hands of the people at large the militia itself must be numerous in proportion to the want or inferiority of its discipline and the imbecilities or defects of its constitution moreover as such a militia must be supplied by rotation allotment or some mode of succession whereby they who have served a certain time are replaced by fresh draughts from the country a much greater number will be instructed in the use of arms and will have been occasionally embodied together than are actually employed or than are supposed to be wanted at the same time now what effects upon the civil condition of the   0 country may be looked for from this general diffusion of the military character becomes an inquiry of great importance and delicacy to me it appears doubtful whether any government can be long secure where the people are acquainted with the use of arms and accustomed to resort to them every faction will find itself at the head of an army every disgust will excite commotion and every commotion become a civil war nothing perhaps can govern a nation of armed citizens but that which governs an army—despotism i do not mean that a regular government would become despotic by training up its subjects to the knowledge and exercise of arms but that it would ere long be forced to give way to despotism in some other shape and that the country would be liable to what is even worse than a settled and constitutional despotism—to perpetual rebellions and to perpetual revolutions to short and violent usurpations to the successive tyranny of governors rendered cruel and jealous by the danger and instability of their situation the same purposes of strength and efficacy which make a standing army necessary at all make it necessary in mixed governments that this army be submitted to the management and direction of the prince for however well a popular council may be qualified for the offices of legislation it is altogether unfit for the conduct of war in which success usually depends upon vigour and enterprise upon secrecy despatch and unanimity upon a quick perception of opportunities and the power of seizing every opportunity immediately it is likewise necessary that the obedience of an army be as prompt and active as possible for which reason it ought to be made an obedience of will and emulation upon this consideration is founded the expediency of leaving to the prince not only the government and destination of the army but the appointment and promotion of its officers because a design is then alone likely to be executed with zeal and fidelity when the     person who issues the order chooses the instruments and rewards the service to which we may subjoin that in governments like ours if the direction and officering of the army were placed in the hands of the democratic part of the constitution this power added to what they already possess would so overbalance all that would be left of regal prerogative that little would remain of monarchy in the constitution but the name and expense nor would these probably remain long whilst we describe however the advantages of standing armies we must not conceal the danger these properties of their constitution—the soldiery being separated in a great degree from the rest of the community their being closely linked amongst themselves by habits of society and subordination and the dependency of the whole chain upon the will and favour of the prince—however essential they may be to the purposes for which armies are kept up give them an aspect in no wise favourable to public liberty the danger however is diminished by maintaining on all occasions as much alliance of interest and as much intercourse of sentiment between the military part of the nation and the other orders of the people as are consistent with the union and discipline of an army for which purpose officers of the army upon whose disposition towards the commonwealth a great deal may depend should be taken from the principal families of the country and at the same time also be encouraged to establish in it families of their own as well as be admitted to seats in the senate to hereditary distinctions and to all the civil honours and privileges that are compatible with their profession which circumstances of connexion and situation will give them such a share in the general rights of the people and so engage their inclinations on the side of public liberty as to afford a reasonable security that they cannot be brought by any promises of personal aggrandisement to assist in the execution of measures which might enslave their posterity their kindred and their country             this book is set in janson text janson was designed not

inquiry concerning the principles of morals sect ix p      if any positive signification distinct from what we mean by pleasure can be affixed to the term happiness i should take it to denote a certain state of the nervous system in that part of the human frame in which we feel joy and grief passions and affections whether this part be the heart which the turn of most languages would lead us to believe or the diaphragm as buffon or the upper orifice of the stomach as van helmont thought or rather be a kind of fine network lining the whole region of the praecordia as others have imagined it is possible not only that each painful sensation may violently shake and disturb the fibres at the time but that a series of such may at length so derange the very texture of the system as to produce a perpetual irritation which will show itself by fretfulness impatience and restlessness it is possible also on the other hand that a succession of pleasurable sensations may have such an effect upon this subtile organization as to cause the fibres to relax and return into their place and order and thereby to recover or if not lost to preserve that harmonious conformation which gives to the mind its sense of complacency and satisfaction this state may be denominated happiness and is so far distinguishable from pleasure that it does not refer to any particular object of enjoyment or consist like pleasure in the gratification of one or more of the senses but is rather the secondary effect which such objects and gratifications produce upon the nervous system or the state in which they leave it these conjectures belong not however to our province the comparative sense in which we have explained the term happiness is more popular and is sufficient for the purpose of the

has no limits that one excess draws on another that the most easy therefore as well as the most excellent way of being virtuous is to be so entirely ogden serm xvi  yet the law has provided no punishment for this offence beyond a pecuniary satisfaction to the injured family and this can only be come at by one of the quaintest fictions in the world by the fathers bringing his action against

and english law there is nothing to hinder a man from marrying his greatniece  this equality is not exact the number of male infants exceeds that of females in the proportion of nineteen to eighteen or thereabouts which excess provides for the greater consumption of males by war seafaring and other dangerous or unhealthy occupations  nothing i mean compared with a state in which marriage is nearly universal where marriages are less general and many women unfruitful from the want of husbands polygamy might at first add a little to population and but a little for as a variety of wives would be sought chiefly from temptations of voluptuousness it would rather increase the demand for female beauty than for the sex at large and this little would soon be made less by many deductions for first as none but the opulent can maintain a plurality of wives where polygamy obtains the rich indulge in it while the rest take up with a vague and barren incontinency and secondly women would grow less jealous of their virtue when they had nothing for which to reserve it but a chamber in the haram when their chastity was no longer to be rewarded with the rights and happiness of a wife as enjoyed under the marriage of one woman to one man these considerations may be added to what is mentioned in the text concerning the easy and early settlement of children in the world  see deut xvii

should be celebrated in churches till the thirteenth century of the christian aera marriages in england during the usurpation were solemnised before justices of the peace but for what purpose this novelty was introduced except to degrade the clergy does not appear  the ancient assyrians sold their beauties by an annual auction the prices were applied by way of portions to the more homely by this contrivance all of both sorts were disposed of in marriage  cùm vis prolem procreandi diutiùs haereat in mare quàm in foeminâ populi numerus nequaquam minuetur si seriùs venerem colere inceperint viri  amongst the athenians if the parent did not put his child into a way of getting a livelihood the child was not bound to make provision for the parent when old and necessitous  the health and virtue of a childs future life are considerations so superior to all others that whatever is likely to have the smallest influence upon these deserves the parents first attention in respect of health agriculture and all active rural and outofdoor employments are to be preferred to manufactures and sedentary occupations in respect of virtue a course of dealings in which the advantage is mutual in which the profit on one side is connected with the benefit of the other which is the case in trade and all serviceable art or labour is more favourable to the moral character than callings in which one mans gain is another mans loss in which what you acquire is acquired without equivalent and parted with in distress as in gaming and whatever partakes of gaming and in the predatory profits of war the following distinctions also deserve notice a business like a retail trade in which the profits are small and frequent and accruing from the employment furnishes a moderate and constant engagement to the mind and so far suits better with the general disposition of mankind than professions which are supported by fixed salaries as stations in the church army navy revenue public offices c or wherein the profits are made in large sums by a few great concerns or fortunate adventures as in many branches of wholesale and foreign merchandise in which the occupation is neither so constant nor the activity so kept alive by immediate encouragement for security manual arts exceed merchandise and such as supply the wants of mankind are better than those which minister to their pleasures situations which promise an early settlement in marriage are on many accounts to be chosen before those which require a longer waiting for a larger establishment  upon which two phrases this is right

the reformed churches of christendom sticking close in this article to their guide have laid aside prayers for the dead as authorised by no precept or precedent found in scripture for the same reason they properly reject the invocation of saints as also because such invocations suppose in the saints whom they address a knowledge which can perceive what passes in different regions of the earth at the same time and they deem it too much to take for granted without the smallest intimation of such a thing in scripture that any created being possesses a faculty little short of that omniscience and omnipresence which they ascribe to the deity  matt xviii  0 † heb x     from the mention of the sabbath in so close a connexion with the descent of god upon mount sinai and the delivery of the law from thence one would be inclined to believe that nehemiah referred solely to the fourth commandment but the fourth commandment certainly did not first make known the sabbath and it is apparent that nehemiah observed not the order of events for he speaks of what passed upon mount sinai before he mentions the miraculous supplies of bread and water though the jews did not arrive at mount sinai till some time after both these miracles were wrought  upon complaint in writing by or on behalf of any person in confinement to any of the four courts of westminsterhall in termtime or to the lord chancellor or one of the judges in the vacation and upon a probable reason being suggested to question the legality of the detention a writ is issued to the person in whose custody the complainant is alleged to be commanding him within a certain limited and short time to produce the body of the prisoner and the authority under which he is detained upon the return of the writ strict and instantaneous obedience to which is enforced by very severe penalties if no lawful cause of imprisonment appear the court or judge before whom the prisoner is brought is authorised and bound to discharge him even though he may have been committed by a secretary or other high officer of state by the privy council or by the king in person so that no subject of this realm can be held in confinement by any power or under any pretence whatever provided he can find means to convey his complaints to one of the four courts of westminsterhall or during their recess to any of the judges of the same unless all these several tribunals agree in determining his imprisonment to be legal he may make application to them in succession and if one out of the number be found who thinks the prisoner entitled to his liberty that one possesses authority to restore it to him  amongst the checks which parliament holds over the administration of public affairs i forbear to mention the practice of addressing the king to know by whose advice he resolved upon a particular measure and of punishing the authors of that advice for the counsel they had given not because i think this method either unconstitutional or improper but for this reason that it does not so much subject the king to the control of parliament as it supposes him to be already in subjection for if the king were so far out of the reach of the resentment of the house of commons as to be able with safety to refuse the information requested or to take upon himself the responsibility inquired after there must be an end of all proceedings founded in this mode of application  if this right be natural no doubt it must be equal and the right we may add of one sex as well as of the other whereas every plan of representation that we have heard of begins by excluding the votes of women thus cutting off at a single stroke one half of the public from a right which is asserted to be inherent in all a right too
