the apology  price one shilling  the apology  addressed to the critical reviewers  by c churchill  tristitiam et metus tradam protervis in mare criticum portare ventis london printed for the author and sold by w flexney near graysinngate holborn mdcclxi  the apology addressed to the critical reviewers laughs not the heart when giants big with pride assume the pompous port the martial stride over arm herculean heave the enormous shield vast as a weavers beam the javelin wield with the loud voice of thundering jove defy and dare to single combat  what  a fly and laugh we less when giant names which shine established as it were by right divine critics whom every captive art adores to whom glad science pours forth all her stores who high in lettered reputation sit and hold astraea like the scales of wit with partial rage rush forth  oh shame to tell  to crush a bard just bursting from the shell great are his perils in this stormy time who rashly ventures on a sea of rhyme around vast surges roll winds envious blow and jealous rocks and quicksands lurk below greatly his foes he dreads but more his friends he hurts me most who lavishly commends look through the world  in every other trade the same employments cause of kindness made at least appearance of good will creates and every fool puffs off the fool he hates cobblers with cobblers smoke away the night and in the common cause even playrs unite authors alone with more than savage rage unnatral war with brother authors wage the pride of nature would as soon admit competitors in empire as in wit onward they rush at fames imperious call and less than greatest would not be at all smit with the love of honor  or the pence oerrun with wit and destitute of sense if any novice in the rhiming trade with lawless pen the realms of verse invade forth from the court where sceptered sages sit abused with praise and flattered into wit where in lethargic majesty they reign and what they won by dullness still maintain legions of factious authors throng at once fool beckons fool and dunce awakens dunce to hmltns the ready lies repair  never was lie made which was not welcome there  thence on maturer judgments anvil wrought the polished falshoods into public brought quick circulating slanders mirth afford and reputation bleeds in every word a critic was of old a glorious name whose sanction handed merit up to fame beauties as well as faults he brought to view his judgment great and great his candor too no servile rules drew sickly taste aside secure he walked for nature was his guide but now oh strange reverse our critics bawl in praise of candor with a heart of gall conscious of guilt and fearful of the light they lurk enshrouded in the veil of night safe from detraction seize the unwary prey and stab like bravoes all who come that way when first my muse perhaps more bold than wise bad the rude trifle into light arise little she thought such tempests would ensue less that those tempests would be raised by you the thunders fury rends the towering oak rosciads like shrubs might scape the fatal stroke vain thought a critics fury knows no bound drawcansir like he deals destruction round nor can we hope he will a stranger spare who gives no quarter to his friend voltaire unhappy genius placed by partial fate with a free spirit in a slavish state where the reluctant muse oppressed by kings or droops in silence or in fetters sings in vain thy dauntless fortitude has borne the bigots furious zeal and tyrants scorn why did thou safe from homebred dangers steer reserved to perish more ignobly here thus when the julian tyrants pride to swell rome with her pompey at pharsalia fell the vanquished chief escaped from caesars hand to die by ruffians in a foreign land how could these selfelected monarchs raise so large an empire on so small a base in what retreat inglorious and unknown did genius sleep when dullness seized the throne whence absolute now grown and free from awe she to the subject world dispenses law without her license not a letter stirs and all the captive criss cross row is here is the stagyrite who rules from nature drew opinions gave but gave his reasons too our great dictators take a shorter way  who shall dispute what the reviewers say their words sufficient and to ask a reason in such a state as theirs is downright treason true judgment now with them alone can dwell like church of rome they are grown infallible dull superstitious readers they deceive who pin their easy faith on critics sleeve and knowing nothing every thing believe but why repine we that these puny elves shoot into giants  we may thank ourselves fools that we are like israels fools of yore the calf ourselves have fashioned we adore but let true reason once resume her reign this god shall dwindle to a calf again founded on arts which shun the face of day by the same arts they still maintain their sway wrapped in mysterious secrecy they rise and as they are unknown are safe and wise at whomsoever aimed however severe the envenomed slander flies no names appear prudence forbid that step  then all might know and on more equal terms engage the foe but now what quixote of the age would care to wage a war with dirt and fight with air by interest joined the expert confedrates stand and play the game into each others hand the vile abuse in turn by all denied is bandyd up and down from side to side it flies  hey  presto  like a juglers ball till it belongs to nobody at all all men and things they know themselves unknown and publish every name  except their own nor think this strange  secure from vulgar eyes the nameless author passes in disguise but vetran critics are not so deceived if vetran critics are to be believed once seen they know an author evermore nay swear to hands they never saw before thus in the rosciad beyond chance or doubt they by the writing found the writers out  that is lloyds  his manner there you plainly trace  and all the actor stares you in the face  by colman that was written  on my life  the strongest symptoms of the jealous wife  that little disingenuous piece of spite  churchill a wretch unknown perhaps might write how does it make judicious readers smile when authors are detected by their style though every one who knows this author knows he shifts his style much oftener than his clothes whence could arise this mighty critic spleen the muse a trifler and her theme so mean what had i done that angry heaven should send the bittrest foe where most i wished a friend often has my tongue been wanton at thy name and hailed the honors of thy matchless fame for me let hoary fielding bite the ground so nobler pickle stand superbly bound from livys temples tear the historic crown which with more justice blooms upon thine own compared with thee be all lifewriters dumb but he who wrote the life of tommy thumb who ever read the regicide but swore the author wrote as man never wrote before others for plots and underplots may call here is the right method  have no plot at all who can so often in his cause engage the tiny pathos of the grecian stage whilst horrors rise and tears spontaneous flow at tragic ha and no less tragic oh his nervous weakness all to praise agree and then for sweetness who so sweet as he too big for utterance when sorrows swell the too big sorrows flowing tears must tell but when those flowing tears shall cease to flow why  then the voice must speak again you know rude and unskilful in the poets trade i kept no naiads by me readymade never did i colors high in air advance torn from the bleeding fopperies of france no flimsey linseywoolsey scenes i wrote with patches here and there like josephs coat me humbler themes befit secure for me let playwrights smuggle nonsense duty free secure for me ye lambs ye lambkins bound and frisk and frolic over the fairy ground secure for me thou pretty little fawn lick sylvias hand and crop the flowery lawn uncensurd let the gentle breezes rove through the green umbrage of the enchanted grove secure for me let foppish nature smile and play the coxcomb in the desert isle the stage i chose  a subject fair and free  it is yours  it is mine  it is public property all common exhibitions open lie for praise or censure to the common eye hence are a thousand hackneywriters fed hence monthly critics earn their daily bread this is a general tax which all must pay from those who scribble down to those who play actors a venal crew receive support from public bounty for the public sport to clap or hiss all have an equal claim the cobblers and his lordships right the same all join for their subsistence all expect free leave to praise their worth their faults correct when active pickle smithfield stage ascends the three days wonder of his laughing friends each or as judgment or as fancy guides the lively witling praises or derides and where is the mighty difference tell me where betwixt a merry andrew and a playr the strolling tribe a despicable race like wandering arabs shift from place to place vagrants by law to justice open laid they tremble of the beadles lash afraid and fawning cringe for wretched means of life to madam mayress or his worships wife the mighty monarch in theatric sack carries his whole regalia at his back his royal consort heads the female band and leads the heirapparent in her hand the pannierd ass creeps on with conscious pride bearing a future prince on either side no choice musicians in this troop are found to varnish nonsense with the charms of sound no swords no daggers not one poisoned bowl no lightning flashes here no thunders roll no guards to swell the monarchs train are shown the monarch here must be an host alone no solemn pomp no slow processions here no ammons entry and no juliets bier by need compelled to prostitute his art the varied actor flies from part to part and strange disgrace to all theatric pride his character is shifted with his side question and answer he by turns must be like that small wit in modern tragedy who to support his fame  or fill his purse  still pilfers wretched plans and makes them worse like gypsies least the stolen brat be known defacing first then claiming for his own in shabby state they strut and tattered robe the scene a blanket and a barn the globe no high conceits their moderate wishes raise content with humble profit humble praise let dowdies simper and let bumpkins stare the strolling pageant hero treads in air pleased for his hour he to mankind gives law and snores the next out on a truss of straw but if kind fortune who we sometimes know can take a hero from a puppetshew in mood propitious should her favorite call on royal stage in royal pomp to bawl forgetful of himself he rears the head and scorns the dunghill where he first was bred conversing now with welldressd kings and queens with gods and goddesses behind the scenes he sweats beneath the terrornodding plume taught by mock honors real pride to assume on this great stage the world no monarch ever was half so haughty as a monarchplayer does it more move our anger or our mirth to see these things the lowest sons of earth presume with selfsufficient knowledge graced to rule in letters and preside in taste the towns decisions they no more admit themselves alone the arbiters of wit and scorn the jurisdiction of that court to which they owe their being and support actors like monks of old now sacred grown must be attacked by no fools but their own let the vain tyrant sit amidst his guards his puny greenroom wits and venal bards who meanly tremble at the puppets frown and for a playhouse freedom lose their own in spite of newmade laws and newmade kings the freeborn muse with liberal spirit sings bow down ye slaves before these idols fall let genius stoop to them who have none all never will i flatter cringe or bend the knee to those who slaves to all are slaves to me actors as actors are a lawful game the poets right and who shall bar his claim and if oerweening of their little skill when they have left the stage they are actors still if to the subject world they still give laws with paper crowns and sceptres made of straws if they in cellar or in garret roar and kings one night are kings for evermore shall not bold truth even there pursue her theme and wake the coxcomb from his golden dream or if well worthy of a better fate they rise superior to their present state if with each social virtue graced they blend the gay companion and the faithful friend if they like pritchard join in private life the tender parent and the virtuous wife shall not our verse their praise with pleasure speak though mimics bark and envy split her cheek no honest worths beneath the muses praise no greatness can above her censure raise station and wealth to her are trifling things she stoops to actors and she soars to kings is there a man in vice and folly bred to sense of honor as to virtue dead whom ties nor human nor divine can bind alien to god and foe to all mankind who spares no character whose every word bitter as gall and sharper than the sword cuts to the quick whose thoughts with rancour swell whose tongue on earth performs the work of hell if there be such a monster the reviews shall find him holding forth against abuse  attack profession  it is a deadly breach   the christian laws another lesson teach   unto the end should charity endure  and candor hide those faults it cannot cure thus candours maxims flow from rancours throat as devils to serve their purpose scripture quote the muses office was by heaven designed to please improve instruct reform mankind to make dejected virtue nobly rise above the towering pitch of splendid vice to make pale vice abashed her head hang down and trembling crouch at virtues awful frown now armed with wrath she bids eternal shame with strictest justice brands the villains name now in the milder garb of ridicule she sports and pleases while she wounds the fool her shape is often varied but her aim to prop the cause of virtue still the same in praise of mercy let the guilty bawl when vice and folly for correction call silence the mark of weakness justly bears and is partaker of the crimes it spares but if the muse too cruel in her mirth with harsh reflections wound the man of worth if wantonly she deviate from her plan and quits the actor to expose the man ashamed she marks that passage with a blot and hates the line where candor was forgot but what is candor what is humours vein though judgment join to consecrate the strain if curious numbers will not aid afford nor choicest music play in every word verses must run to charm a modern ear from all harsh rugged interruptions clear soft let them breathe as zephyrs balmy breeze smooth let their current flow as summer seas perfect then only deemed when they dispense a happy tuneful vacancy of sense italian fathers thus with barbarous rage fit helpless infants for the squeaking stage deaf to the calls of pity nature wound and mangle vigor for the sake of sound henceforth farewell then fevrish thirst of fame farewell the longings for a poets name perish my muse  a wish bove all severe to him who ever held the muses dear if ever her labors weaken to refine the generous roughness of a nervous line others affect the stiff and swelling phrase their muse must walk in stilts and strut in stays the sense they murder and the words transpose lest poetry approach too near to prose see tortured reason how they pare and trim and like procrustes stretch or lop the limb waller whose praise succeeding bards rehearse parent of harmony in english verse whose tuneful muse in sweetest accent flows in couplets first taught straggling sense to close in polished numbers and majestic sound where shall thy rival pope be ever found but whilst each line with equal beauty flows even excellence unvaryd tedious grows nature through all her works in great degree borrows a blessing from variety music itself her needful aid requires to rouse the soul and wake our dying fires still in one key the nightingale would teize still in one key not brent would always please here let me bend great dryden at thy shrine thou dearest name to all the tuneful nine what if some dull lines in cold order creep and with his theme the poet seems to sleep still when his subject rises proud to view with equal strength the poet rises too with strong invention noblest vigor fraught thought still springs up and rises out of thought numbers ennobling numbers in their course in varied sweetness flow in varied force the powers of genius and of judgment join and the whole art of poetry is thine but what are numbers what are bards to me forbid to tread the paths of poesy  a sacred muse should consecrate her pen  priests must not hear nor see like other men  far higher themes should her ambition claim  behold where sternhold points the way to fame whilst with mistaken zeal dull bigots burn let reason for a moment take her turn when coffeesages hold discourse with kings and blindly walk in paper leadingstrings what if a man delight to pass his time in spinning reason into harmless rhyme or sometimes boldly venture to the play say where is the crime  great man of prudence say no two on earth in one thing can agree all have some darling singularity women and men as well as girls and boys in gewgaws take delight and sigh for toys your sceptres and your crowns and such like things are but a better kind of toys for kings in things indiffrent reason bids us choose whether the whims a monkey or a muse what the grave triflers on this busy scene when they make use of this word reason mean i know not but according to my plan it is lordcheifjustice in the court of man equally formed to rule in age and youth the friend of virtue and the guide to truth to her i bow whose sacred power i feel to her decision make my last appeal condemned by her applauding worlds in vain should tempt me to resume the pen again by her absolved my course i will still pursue if reasons for me god is for me too finis
