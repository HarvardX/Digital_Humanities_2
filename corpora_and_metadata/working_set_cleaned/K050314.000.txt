memoirs of count tariff etc  omnibus in terris quae sunt a gadibus usque auroram and gangem pauci dignoscere possunt vera bona atque illis multum diversa remota erroris nebula juv sat  0 london printed for john morphem near stationers hall      price   s  memoirs of count tariff etc count tariff whose history we are now to write is a person who has been so much misrepresented among us and painted in such monstrous shapes that it is but a piece of justice to a stranger to rescue his character from the mob and to search what may be found in ancient history concerning him  so far as we have searched into antiquity we find him lineally descended from the ancient line of the tariffs a family of such quality as well as antiquity in france that they trace their genealogy as high as any history can be found and they appear equal in birth to commerce it self whose antiquity no body doubts of  the present count tariff the chief of his family is a person who as well for his proper merit as his high birth as aforesaid has been esteemed and respected all over europe and for the great interest he has in his country has been sought unto by most of the nations in europe upon many occasions  he always appeared to be a patron of trade as what he esteemed was exceedingly conducive to the general good of mankind as this was his especial aim so he did not so much apply himself to this or that particular branch or part of trade but endeavored upon all occasions to show himself a friend to universal commerce as it respected the improvement and general advantage of the world and from this rule he constantly employed the influence he had on affairs which was not small to the regulation and good government of trade in his own country  he took on him the general management of commerce on the   th of september      which being the first time of his public appearance in the world we shall not enquire into any part of his conduct before that time  he had no sooner settled and made public his rules of commerce but all the trading part of the world were made sensible of the advantage they received thereby and consequently began to entertain a true and very great opinion of his worth and very quickly courted his friendship this nation especially made great advantage of his correspondence for he was a particular friend to the english trade and encouraged it upon all occasions it is true he acted upon open measures of correspondence and was a friend to universal trade as above he abhorred prohibitions restrictions and exclusion of nations in trade but if he had any peculiar if he treated any one nation with distinction more than another it was england which was all the reason that has yet been assigned why some people in the kingdom have treated him with such rudeness and disrespect ever since but however they have used him it is most certain england felt the sensible advantage of his acquaintance and corresponded with him to their great profit as well as satisfaction for several years receiving every year great sums of money from him and by his means  he was particularly a very great friend to the english manufacture he always appeared at court in a suit of english broad cloth and clothed all his servants in the same and though his liveries were plain they were handsomer and richer than any in that country  it happened however after some time divisions prevailing there as well as in other courts that he began to be in less repute with some people than before yet he still went on as well as circumstances would admit in his own way  viz of encouraging trade he received all the equipages of his servants and furniture of his houses from england notwithstanding the fine brocades and rich silks which are made in france he clothed his countess and the young ladies his daughters and their attendants in rich east india silks fine muslins etc bought in england and brought from the indies by the english east india company  upon building his fine countryseat of tariffcastle in france all the fine locks and keys and several other parts of the furniture came from england the roof was covered with lead to distinguish his respect for the english commerce and all the vessels and utensils of his family which it was proper to have so were of english pewter  this particular conduct of the count with respect to the english trade gave some umbrage in france and whether it were by the artifice of some of his neighbors who always envied and rivalld the english or whether it was merely the inclination of the people there to set up manufactures of their own authors are not agreed about it but it procured count tariff many enemies at home as is before observed nay even his own tenants and neighbors complained that he favored foreigners and foreign manufactures alleging that his coaches were lined with english cloth his rooms hanged with english stuffs that all his servants smoaked tobacco and other circumstances falling in with this at the same time the count was obliged to alter his measures and first declined some part of the english trade by several public acts as particularly on the   th of april      the  0th of december      and at last he was obliged wholly to renounce it on the  th of september   0  upon these disturbances count tariff being necessitated as abovesaid to lay aside all correspondence with his english friends they on the other hand acted the weakest part that ever was known among trading men and merchants for however he had been their friend and however absurd it was on their side to forbid the exportation of their own manufactures yet they took that simple step and without respect to count tariff or the injury they did to their own workmen in the countries and their families truly they cut off their own trade and would not suffer any more broadcloth or serges stuffs bays kersies dozens or any woollen manufactures or other goods to be sent to count tariff by which piece of wisdom they lost their country the exportation of above six hundred thousand pounds a year in goods of their own growth or manufactures besides those of the growth and produce of their plantations and other countries  count tariff being treated thus by his english friends it was not to be wondered if mynheer coopmanschap an old carrier and a cunning tricking circumventing sharping dutch broker fell in with him this coopmanschap was a great dealer in the manufactures and produce of other countries but had very few or none at all of his own he drove indeed a great trade to most parts of the world it was he who made that famous voyage to japan where when he was asked by the emperor whether he was a christian or not he answered he was a a hollander he had been all over the east indies and particularly was governor at amboyna upon a certain butcherly occasion which authors say is nothing to the purpose now because it was a great while ago he has driven a great trade ever since by interloping into the trade of other nations but is especially remarkable for keeping his word no longer than he finds it for his gain and then complaining that others do so it was not many years before this that he was in partnership with a great german merchant one mynheer leopoldus of vienna in which they had agreed not to lay down their trade but by mutual consent and particularly old coopmanschap bound himself not to contract any partnership without the consent of leopoldus and without taking him in but he broke his word and left old leopoldus in the lurch before the voyage was half finished which is mentioned for their service who pretend to say he was injured lately that may himself  count tariff was not ignorant of the subtilty and knavery of this tricking dutchman for he had heard his character and had dealt with him before but his circumstances requiring him to settle a correspondence some where and having been ill used where he inclined to settle he found it for his advantage to engage with mynheer and accordingly articles of partnership were signed between them on the  th of december       it was no small surprise to the rest of the trading nations of europe that count tariff had settled with mynheer and though it had been better for them all that he had continued to trade with the whole world on equal terms as before yet when they found that could not be they would all have been glad to have had him exclusively to themselves but old coopmanschap according to custom was too cunning for them all and knowing the worth of the count he supplanted all the world and got him to himself  one of the principal businesses of mynheer after he had secured count tariff to himself was to prevent his trading with any body else and fain he would have had the count have entered into some exclusive terms with him which at first he could not obtain it being not included in their articles but it fell in afterward upon the occasion of some of his old correspondents prohibiting their factors to send him any woollen manufactures as aforesaid  no sooner had old coopmanschap and the count engaged but the dutchman began to insult all count tariffs old correspondents and put the dice upon all that traded with him before for no body could trade with count tariff at all now but they must pay toll to old coopmanschap no goods could be sent to count tariff but in old coopmanschaps wagons and ships so that he became the general carryer to all the trade of that side of the world and got something by every thing that other people dealt in  this made him so insolent that if any proposals of peace or trade were made to him his answer was always count tariff count tariff ick vil hab count tariff nothing must be done without count tariff  at last mynheer thinking he had effectually secured all the trade of the world and that he was able to keep every body else out of it truly he began to use count tariff himself very scurvily and on several occasions abused him very grossly insomuch that the count who easily saw himself maltreated grew weary of him he found that this coopmanschap was but a jobber of other peoples trade a mere pedlar a waggoner or carrier for other merchants that all the goods he count tariff bought of him were brought to him at second hand and that he might much better have them directly from the makers and manufacturers and the countries where they were produced wherefore he count tariff resolved at last to put an end to it and accordingly he wrote him a very plain letter telling him what a cozening old knave he had been how rich he was grown by means of the partnership and yet how basely he had treated his partner and in short told him in so many words at the end of his letter that he would have no more to do with him  it is not to be wondered if mynheer was thunderstruck at this surprising letter for by it on a sudden he lost all those advantages which had for some time raised up both his purse and his pride and which had enabled him to hold up his head and think himself equal with the richest merchant in europe but from this disappointment he began to alter his tone and talk a little humbler than he was wont to do mean time he omitted nothing to recover his former interest in count tariff and if possible to retrieve the partnership and to that purpose he dispatched two of his factors to go to count tariffs house and to try if they could by any offers submissions and promises and on any conditions whatsoever retrieve this blow that he might preserve his governing influence on the trade of europe but after several vain attempts of this nature he found that it was impracticable and that count tariff was resolved for his sake that he would never more engage in a separate partnership but that he had reassumed his former generous principle  viz of encouraging universal commerce a thing that did not suit with mynheers designs at all who always advanced himself by encroaching on other mens trade rather than by carrying on any particular trade of his own as is evident by his trade to the east indies which he rifled a great portuguese merchant of his herring fishery which he got by encroachment on the scots merchants and by his trade to the brazils and surinam which he stole from the spaniards and the like  but mynheer who never used to give a game over while he had any cards left in his hand to play when he found he could not get count tariff to himself his next concern was to take care that the count should not engage with any body else and particularly he was sensible it would be a very great loss to him if any english merchants should embark with him it seems he had had some private intimation that count tariff was about making a new partnership with one mr traffic an eminent merchant and alderman of london this mr traffic traded it seems in company with one harry woolpack a famous clothier in the west and together they two managed the whole trade of the woollen manufacturers on that side of the world  it was a mortal blow to mynheer to think that count tariff should engage with these people and it put him into a cold sweat immediately for these were the very men that he had bubbled for so many years past for having kept count tariff under his thumb he got all the trade into his own hand made those english merchants glad to sell their woollen manufactures to him some finished some unfinished as he pleased to take them and at what price he pleased to give for them so that they only furnished count tariff at secondhand and old coopmanschap got the profit  all the while he did thus he wheedled mr alderman traffic and harry woolpack with fine stories of his being their only friend of his taking off such vast quantities of their manufactures more than other nations nay sometimes he would say more than all the nations of the world and that no body could do this but he whereas the truth was that all this while he was only the middleman or broker between both for count tariff was really the man who procured most of the trade and made the great consumption of the woollen manufactures by encouraging the wearing thereof as aforesaid among his tenants and servants and this subtle dutchman had only been a pickpocket on both sides as soon as mr traffic and harry wolpack and their other partners came to understand this it gave them a most contemptible opinion of old coopman schap and made them reflect with great regret on those councils which had led them into such a noose and caused them to be so dupd and made fools of by this old dutch man for so many years to the ruin of their trade and the enriching of him and his hangers on when their eyes were thus opened and they saw clearly how they had been played upon and cozened they entertained with great readiness the proposals of a new partnership with count tariff which the count by his agents had offered them about that time  upon this the treaty of partnership between alderman traffic and the count having gone on with great sincerity and application on both sides it was concluded and signed between arbitrators employed by both parties on the   st of march      though this was not brought to pass without a mighty opposition of old copmanschap and his friends  it was thought at first that the treaty having been thus finished and all parties being thus agreed there could not have been any room for a miscarriage after that and it was not doubted but messieurs traffic and company would have driven a gallant trade the next year with count tariff but it proved quite otherwise by the subtilty and indefatigable cunning and diligence of that old fox coopmanschap the particulars of whose intrigues make the next part of our story  old coopmanschap having been alarmed as is said already by the report of a treaty being set on foot between count tariff on one hand and the said mr alderman traffic of london and his partners in the country on the other hand he found there was no time to be lost for these as aforesaid were the greatest dealers in the british woollen manufactures that were in the world and the very same men who he had bought all the woollen goods of which he had supplied count tariff with during their late partnership he knew also if the count sell in with them he should not only be circumvented and become useless in the trade but that all his cunning and knavery would be exposed on either hand that first count tariff would see how he had made him pay through the nose for every thing which he had bought and that he could buy cheaper of alderman traffic and company and not only so but the alderman and his partners would discover also how when he had beaten down the price and brought them to sell their goods so monstrous cheap that their poor workmen could hardly get bread by their labor he sold those goods at the same time for a great price to count tariff and so he had gotten the profit of all the trade to himself  he was conscious that when both sides came thus to see into his knavery they would equally resent his former correspondence with them and never have any thing to do with him in that respect again that by this means he should lose his cullies and be quite stripped of the advantage he had always made by them  upon this and many other mischiefs which he foresaw would follow he resolved to go over for england and by all means possible endeavor to prevent the partners making their new treaty of partnership effectual  he was encouraged to make this attempt by a secret correspondence which he always held in that country with a certain club or society of men who having certain private wicked projects of their own to carry on by his assistance were declared enemies to count tariff for his sake and by consequence would be sure right or wrong to oppose the new partnership count tariff was making with their fellowcitizens however it might be to the prejudice of their country or of themselves envy and revenge being the most selfdenying vices in the world these people pretended indeed to be very great friends to alderman traffic and henry woollpack his partner yet they had given several sufficient testimonies of their being willing to sacrifice them both for the interest of old coopmanschap and even to sell them and their country too into slavery to him to work in his rasphouse in amsterdam rather than not oblige him to be their friend in those other projects which they were carrying on as aforesaid  having such an interest there he made the best of his way for england and had the good luck to come there before the articles of copartnership which the arbitrators on both sides had made between count tariff and his new partners were arrived  as soon as he was come to london he gave notice to his trusty friend sir politic falsehood who was generally chairman of that society that he purposed to be at the club the next day who accordingly intimated the same to the whole party in order to have a full assembly  being come to the club and having saluted the members he stood up and made a speech to them to the following purpose  here follows an account of the speech which mynheer van coopmanschap made at his first appearance in the club first he gave them thanks for the great services they had done him upon all occasions in time past and the great obligations which they had laid upon him for that not regarding their country their liberty their present advantages or their posterity they had with a steady and unshaken zeal always preferred his interest to their own  he acknowledged that in a former partnership wherein they had been engaged with him they never insisted upon his paying in the proportions of stock agreed upon between them but had very kindly carried on their own part and most of his too though at the same time they were fain to run themselves into heavy debts more than ever they were like to have paid besides several other inconveniences to do it and also although the greatest part of the profit of the partnership fell to his share all which he told them added to the generosity of their treatment of him and which therefore obliged him to this grateful remembrance thereof  he owned and therewith he made them a grimace that they had been very friendly to him in not examining his accounts relating to the said partnership but had passed them upon his credit which he being utterly unable to make a fair account was very much obliged to them for  he could not forget he said how frankly they had furnished the greatest part of the ships employed in their partnership even without charging him for his share of the freight whereby he had been at leisure to carry on the northseastrade which was quite out of the partnership at their expense and which had encouraged him to charge even those ships also which were employed in the said separate trade to the northseas as if employed in the said partnership to his unspeakable advantage for which he said he was infinitely obliged to them  that whereas they had been equally concerned for several years past in carrying on an undertaking for the french philosophers stone which as it had been both hazardous and expensive so it had been owned to be as such projects generally are very unlikely to succeed especially to the height that some proposed he told them he thought himself obliged to confess that they had generously supplied more workmen for the said undertaking than they were bound to furnish by their agreement and yet had not made him pay toward the extraordinary charge of it it is true said he you once proposed to me that in consideration thereof i should break my partnership with count ta and have no more to do with him  upon my representing to you faithfully how much it would be to my prejudice though to your advantage you were so kind as not to insist upon it which i acknowledge said he and made them a dutch bow was a great instance of selfdenial in you and disinterested friendship to me  but he told them he had yet greater things than those to thank them for and particularly that bold step they took on his account and which few partners but they would have ventured at  viz that when several of his principal correspondents in england were in danger of being turned out of their shops and employments by their landlady the club had appeared so much interested in their behalf as to depute some of their rudest members to her to tell her very respectfully that she ought not to do so that she ought to have consulted them in the management of her servants and family that if she ventured to do it she would entirely lose their favor and did not stick to threaten her though she was their own landlady too that in such case they would show their resentment and would neither give her or her tenants or her workmen credit for one farthing of money nor suffer any body else to do it nay nor pay her their rent neither if they could help it which threatening though it did not succeed according to expectation yet was such an extraordinary step in his favor as he could not but think himself very much obliged to them for it  he told them farther that he was particularly obliged to thank them for another instance of their zeal for his interest  viz that when some british merchants came over to a place called vtrecht a city in his country in order to recover a certain branch of trade out of his hands which he had circumvented them of before the society had endeavored to expose and ruin those merchants loudly declaring in all their societies as well grecian as english that it was neither just nor honest to take any thing away from mynheer van coopmanschap or to get any thing for alderman traffic and company without letting him have an equal share of it or in short to disoblige him in any respect whatsoever so that they justified him highly in the practice of what every one knew was his principle viz that what every one else got should be part of it his and what he himself got should be all his own  he thanked them he said that in their late famous voyage or adventure to terra gertrudenburg incognita in which they had been also partners yet the club had generously left the management of the whole voyage to him owning themselves not fit to be trusted in affairs though their own of so nice a nature by which had not his unhappy native avarice prompted him to grasp the shadow and let slip the substance he might have made a very good voyage for himself at the expense of all the rest of his partners but as he had no body to blame for the miscarriage but himself so he thanked them for their good will whatever loss he sustained by the voyage  it was true he said that another miscarriage of his had been the effect of their advice to him  viz when they persuaded him to adhere to the executors of old leopoldus and prefer his germanpartnership to all other engagements which piece of council overthrew the whole voyage for as on the one hand he slipped a good opportunity and refused an advantageous offer of another partnership which he inclined to embark in and which had he closed with it would have prevented the dismal events that followed so on the other hand he not only was disappointed in all his chimerical hopes of that voyage but had all his vessels plundered his goods and merchandises taken away and most of his agents and servants were knocked on the head and thrown overboard or carried into slavery which forced him at last shamefully to quit the said german partnership and to lose all those advantages that had been offered him at first as aforesaid however he said as he believed the society did it for the best and had only acted by him as they did for themselves and according to their kown politics viz never to know when they are well so he could not blame them in the least  he acknowledged that their general conduct had been always with an eye to his interest and grandeur which they had given him so many testimonies of that it was very much to his satisfiction and which he had so far depended upon as had made him talk in a different tone from what he used to do to several of his other partners for that he knew they were always ready to back him in and approve of all the measures he took for advancing his own trade and that they were always willing to sink their own stocks and throw away their own estates rather than he should be a sufferer  he told them also that he thankfully remembered how they had given him timely notice when they designed to ruin the public credit if it had been in their power that he might have sufficient time to draw out his money whereas had their design succeeded he might without such notice have been a very great loser  it was true he said he had observed that although they had informed him that their landlady was a bankrupt and her credit broke and persuaded him not to lend her money yet as soon as she had offered them a small advantage in the loan they all run in privately and lent their own money leaving him out but as this was nothing but what he taught them and as he would have done by them if it had been in his power he was not at all disobliged by it knowing they would make him amends for it many other ways  he told them he was in a particular manner obliged to them in other affairs of their partnership especially for drawing up proper memorials for him upon certain occasions in which they were so zealou for his interest and so willing to make him popular that they had frequently ventured to print them before they had been delivered and if at any time his secret management had been discovered and the people began to entertain a mean opinion of his honesty they always had employed their whole set of pamphleteers to vindicate him who had covered the foulest of his actions with the most popular lies they could invent of which they were very fruitful and by an infinite number of abuses invectives and libels even against their landlady herself and all her family and servants they had diverted the rage of the people and imposed upon them in such a manner that his character which was much in danger by some mistakes he had fallen into stood very right again with the people and as he had maintained a kind of correspondence from the teeth outward only with their landlady which however he was alwas ready to break off when their interest should require it he had thereby he hoped kept himself in a condition to requite the favors he had received from them  that for his part he said though he should not boast of his merit yet he hoped he had not been wanting on all occasions to show his respect to them and to lay all the obligations upon them which it was in his power to do that upon all occasions he had supported them in their private designs and contrivances against their landlady and her adherents family and servants that he had acquiesced in all the memorials they had drawn up for him and been as well satisfied with them when they were drawn up at the farther end of piccadilly as when they were done at amsterdam which also had saved him a great deal of trouble and though in one of those memorials they had committed a fatal mistake in acknowledging the fact which it was intended to deny  viz about his having not supplied the quota of ships to the partnership which he had agreed to furnish yet he was very well satisfied with the invention they found out to cover it whether it were truth of fact or no  he modestly put them in mind of his great concern for them in another affair wherein he had made himself arbitrator for the succession of their trade in the next age and preserving a partnership which it was agreed should be entered into after a certain engagement was expired with some merchants of brunswick which though they all knew there was not the least need of that it was in it self nothing at all that contract being effectually secured by the circumstances and nature of the thing yet as it was of use to them otherways and served to make the reputation of the club swell among some people so he had done it to serve them at the same time taking such effectual care to preserve their trade in flanders by securing it all into his own hands that he hoped it was to their exceeding great satisfaction he put them in mind how for their sakes he had continued his partnership with the executors of old leopolaus merchant of vienna although count tariff had made him very great offers to break the same and although he had met with very great losses in carrying it on and although one merchant eugene who was factor for the said partnership had imposed upon him and outstood his market having been outwitted by count tariffs factors and so had spoiled the whole voyage as he had just now told them  he assured them in the next place that as he had served them with all his usual sincerity in these and many other occasions so he was still ready to assist and stand by them in their private concerns and to renew the partnership they had carried on so long and which they had so successfully been engaged in for as many years as they should think fit that especially he was ready to support them and assist them in any measures which they should think proper against their landlady whether to expose ridicule and affront her person and the management of her family and household or to oppose any of her designs however laudable and useful for the good of her tenants at which words the assembly in token of gratitude and accepting the offer stood all up and mynheer making another dutch bow went on   he told them that he was still very ready to settle matters of trade for this part of the world if they would but stick fast to their old maxims of leaving it all to him and being willing that his interest should be secured first and then their own brought in as subservient and finally he professed himself ready to require their kindness at all times if he might but enjoy the benefit of their trade exclusive of themselves as he had dne  he then came to the main point he told them that he understood there was a private clandestine negotiation on foot between merchant traffic of london and his partner henry woolpack of the west for a partnership with count tariff of france the articles whereof if they came to be made effectual would be very prejudicial to his affairs and that therefore he desired their utmost assistance against is he told them that this count tariff was always partner with him and had left him without warning that it would disable him from driving his trade and consequently from buying so many woollen manufactures  as he used to do because count tariff would take them here himself and in srt he told them that if they had any respect for him or expected any of his assistance in their other secret affair which he had always been their friend in they must stand his friend at this time and prevent the articles of this partnership from being made effectual  then he fell to railing at count tariff told them he was a frenchman and a papist and a tricking false fellow that never kept his word with any body that he was a bankrupt and not able to make good what he had promised that he would crowd them with his own goods such as wine brandy silk linen paper etc but would take little or nothing of them in return only give them large promises and good words with which he would feed them till the partnership was settled and made effectual and then he would laugh at them and with much more of this kind he ended his speech  mynheer coopmanschap having thus finished his speech and sat down sir pol the chairman seeing the club in an unusual agitation and mightily incensed against count tariff and also against alderman traffic and his partners called for a bottle of neatport for they always drink port at that club and beginning a health which for their reputations sake as they pretend to be christians is not fit to be named the unnatural pleasure of that infamous practice took them a little off of their fury indeed authors do not say it cooled the ferment they were in but it turned it another way though by a worse inflammation and having twice cursed the landlady and five times her servants sir pol stood up and addressing himself to mynheer he spoke in the name of the whole society by way of answer to his speech to the purpose following  first he told him they were very glad the endeavors of the club had been of service to him that they had faithfully pursued his interest at all times without respect to any obligation they were under to the contrary either to their landlady or otherwise and that it was very much to their satisfaction that he was sensible thereof  they condoled with him he said in all his misfortunes particularly that which he had mentioned to them viz of having the british merchants get the better of him in all his projects of trade especially that with the spanish merchant d philippo and his factor seignior  which he could not but be sensible they had done their endeavor to prevent however it might be against the honor and the interest of their country  he told him the club was very sorry they had been any way instrumental to the loss of that voyage of his where his ships were taken his goods plundered and his men thrown overboard or carried into slavery but that the advice they gave him for adhering to his german partnership was chiefly founded on the assurances which he had sent them word were given him that merchant eugene who was factor for mynheer leopoldus would carry on that trade successfully without any farther help or any auxiliary stock and that they never suspected that those promises of merchant eugene had been all but mere gasconades and that he was not able to perform them for that the said eugene was always esteemed an expert merchant and one who being bred to business always kept right accounts and might be depended upon in adventures of the nicest nature that therefore the miscarriage ought to be placed to merchant eugenes account and not to theirs who had advised him for the best   he told him the society were sorry he had been obliged to quit his german partnership in such a manner as he did but they were glad for his sake that he had at last put an end to it being afraid his german partner would ruin himself by following the precipitant measures of his said factor merchant eugene especially in carrying on that trade which was too hazardous and expensive for his strength of stock and that it was rumoured already upon change that his bills had been protested in diverse parts of europe so that it was feared we should quickly hear there was a commission of bankrupt taken out against him and that he would make a composition with his creditors  he told him though the society had been disappointed in every thing they had undertaken for him and were at this time but in mean circumstances their character declining their reputation very low and most of their valuable men gone off from them to the interest of their landlady having by her advice joined in a new partnership with merchant moderation an old and known enemy to the whole society yet as their spirit  malice was not in the least abated and that they had yet members enough left to make a great effort noise in his favor so he might depend upon their utmost assistance in every thing whatsoever that he desired in return whereof they hoped mynheer would continue to be their constant friend and correspondent in the same manner as he had done before adding that they had one farther request to make to him  viz that whereas they might probably find it needful sometimes in carrying on his intrigues or their own to make themselves obnoxious to the law and which was likely to be very frequent to fly from justice run away from bail and such like he would engage to receive their criminals and make them burgesses in his cities and free denizens naturalizing them among the servants of his family as would be most suitable to them and to him also whether they were feloniousbankrupts murderers of nobility duellers scots libellers traitors or what kind of offenders soever  that as to the new treaty of partnership with count tariff he told him there was no doubt but the club would espouse his cause right or wrong against that frenchman and all his attempts that the name of french would make it exceeding popular and they would presently spread it over the whole nation that he was a pickpocket a conjurer and dealt with the devil and they doubted not to have him mobbd if he came hither  he told him that as to alderman traffic he knew he was an eminent dealer and understood trade and perhaps he might be steady as to his old notions of the liberty of trade but as for honest woolpack he knew him well enough that he was a wellmeaning countryfellow but very passionate and ignorant and he did not question but the club would find means to impose upon his judgment by telling him a hundred stories and shams of this frenchman count tariff and if they did but once make him believe that count tariff would take off none of his manufactures he would go stark mad and break off the new partnership at once or quarrel with alderman traffic his partner and refuse to go on with the trade concluding upon the whole in the name of the society that he might depend upon it they were all mynheers hearty friends more than their own  the chairman having ended his speech a tool of his who sat at his elbow lately turned malecontent because he was left out of a certain commission made a motion to the club that they should declare their assent to all that sir pol had said which was done the following minute being extracted out of the journal of the club  resolved nemine contradicente that the thanks of the club be given to sir pol falsehood the chairman for his excellent speech to mynheer van coopmanschap  sir pol having gone thus far proceeded then to put the grand question which was also carried as follows  resolved nemine contradicente that this club will stand by assist and support mynheer van coopmanschap their old and constant partner confederate and ally with all their art and skill not only against count tariff and alderman traffic but against all the harry woolpacks in england and against all other opposers whatsoever landlady and all  this vote being past sir pol stood up and made another speech and directed himself then to the club mynheer being withdrawn in which he spoke with a great deal of heat and with all that sense and passion he used to speak with elsewhere  he told them that having heard what had been said by mynheer van coopmanschap and what return had been made to him he expected no other but that they would resolve to assist and stand by him etc as they had done and that now having thus entered upon the thing the next and immediate step was that they should consider of ways and means to put in execution what they had resolved on that no time was to be lost that they expected every post to hear that count tariff was come over and that the articles of partnership between him and alderman traffic etc would presently be ratifyed and a law pass to make them effectual and that then all was lost and their fast friend coopmanschap would be ruined  then he run out in the praise of mynheer how necessary it was to them to support him how they could never hope to carry on their secret designs against the landlady if they lost mynheer and that all their trade juggling which they had carried on so long with mynheer van coopmanschap would be spoiled if they did not prevent it just now   then he fell foul upon count tariff you have heard his character said he from mynheer van coopmanschaps own mouth what a tricking cozening bankrupt fellow he is and what a trade we are like to have with him if this partnership should proceed and therefore continued sir pol my good friends i would not have you be deceived by those who talk of your having a great trade with him it is all a cheat how should he want any of your manufactures when he can make them all himself by his own tenants and servants whom he has lately set up and given great encouragement to them out of his own estate and as to the defect of wool which they pretend to say will prevent this that is effectually answered by the news which came to me by the last post and which i thought fit to communicate to you that it may by your diligence and correspondence in the country be spread about among the woollen manufacturers and clothiers of britain viz that this count tariff has found out a new invention not only to supply his own tenants and servants with good woollen manufactures but that in a little time he would be able to supply the whole world with woollen manufactures even britain and all for that by this new invention they could make fine manufactures of coarse wool and he was told of another new project setting up just now among them of making all the english manufactures in france without any wool at all which if they should bring to perfection as he feared they would the english trade would be quite ruined and the french tenants of count tariff would undersell them at all the markets in europe so that he doubted not but the club would be convinced that it was their own interest as well as his to prevent count tariff entering into any measures here  the club were mightily affected with this part of sir pols speech and the noise interrupted him for some time they appeared in a great consternation as well they might at the mention of such a project being set on foot in france for making broadcloth sarges etc without wool and a wise senator of the club wrs observed to shake his head and with a deep sigh to send forth this ejaculation laurd said he what will become of poor england this will ruin us all with a witness what the french manufactures without wool good lack this is the effect of making peace with the french this is a french popish project indeed i will warrant the new ministry have a hand in it we shall be all undone alas poor england  there was a general murmur through the whole society on this surprising information insomuch that the house seemed in some commotion and sir pol could not yet proceed but the wise expressions which on that occasion dropped from sundry members of the society being yet reserved in whispers only history has made mention of no more than what is hinted above which silence has been a sensible loss to posterity who are thereby deprived of the many weighty sentences dropped on that occasion  after some time the club being a little recovered sir pol reassumed his former discourse and went on to lay down his measures which as he said he would have them take to prosecute this design and the ways and means thereof as aforesaid and first  he told them he had been with alderman traffic and it is true says he i found him inflexible he talked loudly of the vast advantages of the partnership with count tariff the great quantities of english manufactures he was formerly accustomed to take off and would now again take off of our hands but said sir pol i will confute them all by one piece of conduct of mine for since alderman traffic cannot be brought over we must overpower him and run him down by our numbers and noise for this end says he it is absolutely necessary to separate harry woolpack from him that is to sow such jealousies and misunderstandings between the country manufacturers and the merchants that they may not join together in this partnership and therefore continues he i design in the next place to attack my old acquaintance harry woolpack and i doubt not with a little help to make this affair so popular that i will make harry ashamed to show his face in the country if he does not break off this partnership with tariff   to this purpose says he we must in the first place set to work all our agents to expose bespatter villify blacken and defame count tariff and that not only here in the town which we can do by the assistance of our friends at norths and at the amsterdam coffeehouses not forgetting our learned statesmen at the grecian but also in all the clothing and manufacturing towns and countries throughout england for this work says he turning to two blackwellhallfactors who sat next him here is my friend josiah whitecloth and phil medley men of interest in the country shall write our minds to harry woolpack and if they should not be able to prevail there is old joshua doubledozen the yorkshire man shall threaten him with his mob out of the north and there is no doubt but harry woollpack will come up to town and tell alderman traffic to his face that he will have nothing to do with count tariff  sir poll received several humms and other testimonies of applause from the club as he went on with this by which they signified their full approbation of every thing he said to them which encouraged him to proceed as follows   he told them the breaking of harry woollpack from his engagements with alderman traffic was though in it self a trifle of very great consequence to many other of their designs as well as this of count tariff for it would immediately affect all the people of britain it would alarm all the manufacturers and make them believe their trade was to be lost and undone and that they should be ruined it will make says he all the clothing towns write up to their representatives and persuade them that all is at stake and that they will choose them no more if they do not take care about it in parliament nay says sir poll in some extacy it is not to be imagined how far we may run this thought i question not srys he but we shall make it a doctor sacheverell to us and perhaps may make as good use of it for our purpose as was made by other people of that affair of dr sacheverells which it is evident was improved to a quite contrary purpose to what it was designed for and as the former part said he will be easily managed by our assistants at the places before named so we can never want a detachment of bullies from jenny mans and st jamess coffeehouse to assist in the latter and make a tumult for us if there be occasion  our business then continued he is to raise harry wool packs passions for he is naturally a hotheaded fellow and as furious and inconsiderate as my self when he is moved and when we have screwed him up to a pitch he will make such a noise no body else shall be heard all over the kingdom but he besides he has a prodigious interest in the country as well landedmen and tradingmen as moniedmen they are all of his side and if once he raises his voice he can call a strange multitude about him there is sergius perpetuanus the spaniard of exeter is always at his elbow with an hundred thousand devonshiremen and as many from tauntondean there is joshua doubledozen and tom kersie out of the north from hallifax and leeds they were famous for their numbers in qu elizabeths time then there is goad cotton esquire and flanel ap plane the welchman they are all at his beck and are able to raise all north wales shropshire and lancashire for him besides henry stroudwater of cirencester sir isaac rebay of colchester jack allstuff of norwich benjamin drugget of newberry and several others who are all such dependants upon this woollpack that if he does but hold up his finger they are at his beck so that in short the sum of this matter is to persuade harry woollpack to break this bargain and to fright him with the apprehensions of losing all his trade let us get but this done then says he and we need not value old traffic for if he insists upon it never so much if woolpack does not come in it can never go on or be made effectual  it follows next says sir pol that we consider of the methods to bring this to pass and the only way to do this as i said before is to bespatter count tariff and heap up all the scandal we can upon him by which we shall make him frightful and odious to woollpack and his friends and if he should venture after this to come over hither to get the articles of his new partnership made effectual well bring harry woollpack in as plaintiff get him indicted for a cheat and a pickpocket and have him tried for his life  this speech was too full of gall partyrage and particular malice not to suit well and be very acceptable to the whole assembly for temper and moderation was long ago hissed out of the club as an enemy to the being and nature of their constitution like a coward who is troopd out of a camp by beat of drum as a person of no manner of use in the army  being then sufficiently prepared by this plan of their proceedings laid down by sir poll they fell to work immediately and first they voted that count tariff was a frenchman and therefore let the gain of the partnership be what it would we had better be without him this was voted with such a clamor in the club that nothing could be heard for a great while but the repeated cry of no french man no french wine no french trade no brandy sell no manufactures to a frenchman and the like  the last word startled a certain warehouseman in the club whose interest could not tell how to lie like the rest hold there a little says he sell no manufactures to a frenchman hang it says he i cannot go that length neither for i sold one of count tariffs friends a thousand pounds worth of druggets and serges but last week that will not do says he and so taking the opportunity of the hurry he sneaked out of the club  but the vote passed as above with too much noise for any thing of reason or argument to be heard this was no sooner over but another wiseman stands up whether he was a salter or a grocer authors are not agreed about it but addressing himself to the chair  sir pol says he i understand this count tariff is a frenchman then to be sure he is a jacobite and will bring in the pretender upon us ergo all they who are for count tariff are jacobites i desire it may be put to the question which was done thus  resolved that it is the opinion of this society that all those who are for trading with a frenchman are jacobites upon which the house divided yeas     nos     so it was carried by a great majority but that not being satisfactory to the citizen who proposed it who was for thorough work he moved again and said it was a dishonor to the club that such a significant vote as that should not have passed nemine contradicente and therefore the    nos ought to be expelled the house which was accordingly done  the    members who were voted expelled desired to explain themselves but a scots pamphleteer since fled from justice stood up and said the tories condemned a peer to lose his head in his country for offering an explanation to a public act and he was sure those    members were tories in disguise for sure none but a tory would trade with a frenchman and therefore he was for farther prosecution against them upon which the    withdrew for fear of some of his justice  the next question was what religion count tariff was of this produced a hideous cry of a papish a papish a papish no trade with a papish no trade with a papish and such as that and this rung round the clubroom like a vote in the common hall when a sheriff is put up from the hustings which is usually a quarter of an hour a sounding  after many debates of this nature it was resolved that the votes of the club should be made public and be sent down into the west to their honored friend henry woollpack esquire and that he be admonished by his trusty correspondent josiah whitecloth and phil medley that as it is resolved in the committee that it cannot be safe for england that he should trade with count tariff who is a frenchman a jacobite and a papist so that this is the advice of the whole club to him and that he should take care not to be wheedled into it by alderman traffic for that although the said traffic was an experienced merchant and generally speaking an honest man yet he was lately turned about and was on the wrong side that it was to be feared he was inclined to the pretender and therefore he should have a care of him for if he was drawn in to join in the partnership he was undone  nor did they stop here but they ordered that the character of count tariff should be defamed and bespattered as much as possible by their scots pamphleteer aforesaid as long as he durst stay for fear of the pillory and by their lying posts their daily libels circular letters and scurrilous prints of every kind for which they had their authors and printers of the society always in pay and they gave them a general order not to stick at any thing so it would but blacken count tariff and alderman traffic nor to stick at any person that spoke in their behalf though it were the landlady herself agreeing also that they would carry on the same design themselves in all their conversation and at all the committees of their society held at the usual places to wit the grecian jenny mans st jamess and those in the city viz norths the amsterdam hamlins etc and that this should be carried on universally without respect of persons as aforesaid but especially upon their landlady who they reported to be sick and dying and openly acknowledged they wished it was so till the brewer in thames street was taken up for it which terrified the disbanded officer aforesaid and others his neighbors and made them more careful of their tongues  in the mean time alderman traffic whose genius was turned for trade and who understood it better than sir pol or any of them being convinced that the partnership with count tariff was wellgrounded and that it was calculated for the general good not of himself only but of his partner harry woollpack and all his dependants he resolved to regard none of them but to go on steadily in his design of making the partnership effectual  but the alderman knowing what sort of people he had to do with and what he was to expect from them afterward that he might leave them without excuse resolved to have their own testimonials to what he was doing and therefore long before he concluded the treaty for this partnership by his agents abroad he snt letters down into the country not only to harry woollpack himself but to all his frementioned friends and dealers such as joshua doubledozen of leeds tom  perpetuanus of exet sir isaac  of colchester goad cotton esquire and flannel ap plane clothiers of north wales and to many more which it would be too long to name here signifying his intention of entering into partnership with count tariff and asking their opinion of the same whether they thought it might be for the public advantage or no particularly and expressly desiring them if they had any objections to make or any thing to propose for their own advantage in the said trade and partnership with count tariff that they would send up their said requests and objections before the partnership was concluded and particularly their opinions as to the trade it self after it should be agreed whether it was for the public advantage or no  in answer to this harry woollpack in particular and all the rest also however they have been misguided since sent up long memorials and representations expressing their full satisfaction in the said partnership and proposing such and such alterations and additions as they thought necessary to be provided against altered or added upon doing whereof they all gave it under their hands that the said partnership would be very advantageous to them and that a trade with count tariff had been before and would be again with such regulations a very beneficial trade to them and all their neighbors which memorials and representations under their hands are yet to be produced to their faces when occasion requires  as alderman traffic was thus confirmed in his opinion of the goodness of his design not only by his own judgment but by the said memorials and representations of harry woollpack and all his friends he gave count tariff an invitation to come over to england in order to have the partnership consummated and the articles made effectual who accordingly arrived here the   st day of march last being the same day that sir pol laid the plan in the club for his destruction as aforesaid  no sooner was the count arrived but the club began to put their measures which they had resolved on in execution and first in order to make the affair of the said partnership a partycause they railed at him as a jacobite and caused a report to be spread all over the kingdom that he had brought the pretender with him and particularly they took care to make harry woollpack really believe it which was the first beginning of the breach on that side  the poor count who never knew what whig and tory meant and was of no party but for the universal good of mankind was surprised to hear them call him a jacobite and asked what trade that was he told them he never concerned himself with government it was his business always to submit to the legal establishment of the country he was in to pay customs and duties cheerfully and not only to augment the revenues of the princes who reigned but to assist and enable their people to pay cheerfully and willingly whatever the laws obliged them to that it was his constant custom to acknowledge the power but never concerned himself about the persons reigning much less about those who should or should not succeed and that for being a jacobite he knew nothing of it  but let the count say what he would it was to no purpose sir pol and his club had voted it and the cry was gone out into the country that count tariff was come over with the french ambassador and had brought over the pretender nay and that he was actually lodged in somerset house the design of this was to have the count mobbd and torn to pieces in the street or else which would answer mynheer coopmanschaps end better that he should be terrified with the apprehensions of it and should be obliged to retire with him to holland  but they were disappointed in the first part of their project for the count having given alderman traffic full satisfaction that he was a person wholly concerned in matters of trade and in them only and that he desired to have no other business here the alderman protected him from the mob and from the fury of sir pol and also cleared up his character as to jacobitism well enough  the party then finding themselves unable to hurt the count this way apply themselves to their other method  viz to attack his character as to trade and here indeed they met with better success though it was by the help of the most scandalous methods and the unjust practices in the world as will appear in the sequel of our history  to enter into the better description of these things we must go back to the club and to sir pol their director sir pol who is naturally choleric and abominably revengeful having been heated with the disappointment he had received as above and not being able to get the count mobbd for a jacobite and for bringing over the pretender he called a club on a saturday night late and coming into the assembly in a great passion told them the alderman had basely entertained count tariff by authority and that he believed that even the landlady her self was a jacobite and he did not question but the pretender might have been found hid under count tariffs cloak or was packed up in his equipage if the officers might have searched him whereas alderman traffic had forbidden them to affront him but that he had been even both with the alderman and the landlady too for that and had taken care they should be both exposed for it over the whole nation and upon this he called for the scots pampleeter who pulled out two printed ballads which he said would do their business one was the merchant alamode the other the ambassadresses speech which he gave about to the whole club and ordered copies to be distributed to harry woollpack and his friends by the printer to the society  it was true that those wicked measures of sir pol and his fraternity did a little stagger harry woollpack and his friends so that they began to decline the partnership which alderman traffic had made and sent up letters and addresses to the alderman not to go on with it and made some clamours against making it effectual as shall be shown in its place which proceedings occasioned some delay in the matter at first but their eyes were soon opened and they were all convinced of their mistake at last and though it is true it was too late to retrieve the first damages of the thing yet it taught them to know sir pol a little better than they did before and to have a care of him accordingly which tended in the end to the effectual settling the affair but to return to sir pol and the club  the club received his last harangue with great satisfaction and were more especially diverted with the ballads for any thing that affronted their landlady was always agreeable to the club but their mirth was almost spoiled by an unlucky motion made by one of their own body though innocently for he was as much a wellwisher to sir pol and to his countrys disorder as any of them but was not let into the whole secrets of management and did not know that the work was to be done per fas aut ne fas this grave citizen was a warehouseman by occupation and therefore mightily concerned for the woollen manufacture though history has not recorded his name this man standing up in his place told the chairman that he approved very well of what sir pol had proposed as to defaming and blackning count tariff and his adherents to  harry woolpack and his friends against the proposed partnership and to raise the mob upon count tariff only says he i think it would be necessary to get a certain eminent old citizen whom i was formerly acquainted with on our side in all we do of this nature one says he you have all heard of for he fined for alderman in the time of sir william turner was well acquainted with the french trade and might be a match for old alderman traffic or any of them and this is old merchant fact for continues he the reputation of this old gentleman is such that no body will question what we say if he is on our side and on the other hand if count tariff should get him from us it will put us to a very great nonplus  upon this motion sir pol stood up and first looking about to see if the door was shut and none of the drawers in the room gentlemen says he what deputy has proposed is very good and would be to the purpose and i have been trying some time to get this old gentleman on our side but i must tell you in confidence that he is gone out of the way and i fear is gone over to the enemy or at least has withdrawn himself whereupon having seriously bethought my self i have found out two expedients in order to supply his place    says he i own it is absolutely necessary to make harry woolpack and his people believe that merchant fact is really on our side and therefore i have resolved to take that part upon my self and set up a counterfeit merchant fact in his room which i will show to the mob as i find occasion nay rather than fail says sir pol i will counterfeit merchant fact my self indeed i must be concealed from those peoples view who are well acquainted with his countenance or with his mind but as to harry woollpack he will take any thing we say to him upon trust and we have nothing to do as to him but to say we have got merchant fact on our side and he will presently cry out of all that count tariff and his friends can say that it is all lies and therefore if you please leave this to my management it is but putting a good face to it i make no question but we shall carry it as well as if we had merchant fact along with us for noise and falsehood at this time of day will with good management go as far as fact and truth can do    to carry on this disguise with the greater certainty of success continues he i have found out an excellent assistant and one that stood a fast friend to me in former days when the citizens our ancestors had just such another game to play upon king charles ii  this assistant says he has misled the city these thirty years with such dexterity and such admirable success that no body has discovered or detected him yet having thirteen or fourteen hands of the principal merchants of london to a certificate of his integrity in the year      these he drew in at that time without any enquiry to vouch for him taking all he said upon trust and that i may hold you in suspense no longer this is the famous scheme of trade brought up with old whiston the devils broker and as accurate a lvar as ever his master was  the assembly received this proposal of sir pols with a general approbation and recommended to him the necessary dispatch in the mean time count tariff began to appear abroad again and alderman traffic declared that he had entered into partnership with him and that he had resolved to apply to the landlady to have the articles of the said partnership made effectual by law  now was sir pol to play his game or never for alderman traffic pushed on his design to a hearing before such judges as the landlady had directed it to be laid before wherefore in the first place sir pol attacks him with public defamation as was agreed before and spread a thousand clandestine stories about of his behavior as that he was clandestinely run away from his partners abroad that he had broke his word there and never kept his articles with any body so that there was no depending upon any thing he said that he was a bankrupt and had not paid his debts and therefore it was not safe to enter into any treaty of partnership with him that he pretended to come hither for trade and to buy a great many woollen manufactures but that his design was of another kind that he was no friend to trade at all but a mere papish and a jacobite and had a design to bring in the pretender that he intended not to buy any of our manufactures and was so far from wanting woollen manufactures at home that he was the inventor and encourager of that new invention among his own tenants of making fine goods of coarse wool as abovesaid and of making sundry woollen manufactures without any wool at all in which he had made a very considerable progress now though among merchants this way of defaming a man is very barbarous and infamous also yet count tariff bore it without any concern and went on with his business  sir pol and his party then finding this would not do neither and that count tariffs reputation was so clear that if they did not find out some other way to ruin him he would not carry his point they resolved to spring their last mine and blow him up at once to this purpose old scheme the fellow mentioned before who as above had lived several years by cheating and counterfeiting names making false accounts forming abstracts of the customhouse books and the like is brought out to act his part upon count tariff to get him indicted for a cheat and so they resolved to bring him to a trial this old knight of the post having his lesson given him alleged that the count came hither to sell his goods for ready money and carry it away in specie contrary to the act of parliament in that case made and provided that he had contracted to turn owler and carry away our wool vnmanufactured into france that all the accounts given by alderman traffic of the large commissions the count had brought from france for buying english woollen manufactures was a mere cheat that he had    ships already upon the coast laden with wine and brandy which must be all paid for in money the bills being drawn already and accepted that he was in a plot to introduce the french wines to be the common draught instead of neatport contrary to the inclination of our sovereign lord the people and to poison us all with french brandy our own malt spirits being known to be much wholsomer  these and many other heinous crimes being laid to count tariffs charge by this suborner old scheme they pushed on the process and got count tariff arraigned for a cheat in the name and at the suit of henry woollpack and company though without their actual consent too  the count who knew his own innocence did not question but in such a religious nation as this was famed to be he should have justice done him and therefore though he might have pleaded to the jurisdiction of the court as having entered into a partnership which those who contracted it with him were undoubtedly empowered by their own natural right to engage in and that without giving an account to any body and though also he might have pleaded the law of nations for protection yet waving all these things he frankly offered himself to the court and desired to be brought to trial which accordingly was done  upon his trial the usual forms having passed and the charge being read the first thing that gave the court some diversion was the detecting sir pol for he had disguised himself and appeared in court under the name of merchant fact but as he was personating the old man and endeavoring also to speak as if he had lost his teeth that he might conceal the hesitations which want of truth obliged him frequently to make by great misfortune all on a sudden his false beard fell off this made him be more strictly observed and some persons in court who formerly had some acquaintance with the real merchant fact spoke openly and offered to prove that this was not the man upon which all the honest people that stood by hissed at him most intolerably and if ever he could have blushed in his life it was thought it would have been at this time  though he found himself thus detected yet wanting no assurance he turned it off with a ready shift that indeed he was not merchant fact of london but he was goodman fact of gloucestershire and he hoped he said that if he was a true fact the difference of cityfact or countryfact would not be much  the court allowed that in his favor and then put him to the proof of what he had said for which he appealed all along to his factor old scheme  the whole charge being read and all sir pol and his voucher old scheme had to say being heard with the utmost patience by the court count tariff was allowed to speak for himself  he spoke with great modesty of himself he said that he was no cheat  and had no evil design that he had always been a friend to the british commerce and that he had been suspected in his own country on that account that he came to reside here for the benefit of great britain that he could have had very advantageous conditions if he would have joined with mynheer van coopmanschap and never have come here at all and that he could still be very well received if he would engage with him instead of the english merchants that he was so far from being in debt abroad that on the contrary mynheer van coopmanschap owed him twenty millions of guilders and he was ready to prove it by his books but that he feared very much he should never get his money   he told them that considering how well it was known that he came hither with no other intent but purely to do the nation service and that the dutch might not run away with their trade he was surprised that he should meet with such treatment that he expected better usage that he had been promised he should be amicably received when he came hither and that by some who he saw appeared very warm against him now and who he took for men of more honor this reflected upon harry woollpack and his friends who indeed began to be ashamed of sir pol and to sneak away one by one  he went on to complain that the witnesses who appeared against him were scandalous fellows that merchant fact was personated indeed but it was a counterfeit for merchant fact was his old acquaintance and correspondent and he knew him very well he was a middle sized fair gentleman of an honest countenance and a calm composed temper but as to that tall black passionate hangman looked fellow who called himself merchant fact he was not in the least like him and he much wondered he said that any court of justice should admit counterfeit facts for true especially after they were so openly detected  then a to old scheme he said he was an upstart that indeed he had not heard of before but upon hearing his evidence he would undertake to prove upon the spot that he was guilty of lying and counterfeiting and that he had practiced those things ever since the year      and he desired he might call his witnesses to this  the court was very much moved at this discourse and readily gave the count leave to call his witnesses which made every body believe that he would carry his cause and indeed sir pols friends began to despair for him for the count in the first place produced a whole cartload of books draughts accounts and other papers from the customhouse with the proper officers attending to vouch their being authentic and the commissioners hands to them upon examining whereof it appeared that old scheme had really drawn false accounts counterfeited the names who he had pretended had attested them and that none of all the accounts he had produced agreed with the originals in the customhouse books from whence he pretended he had copied them  this caused the court very much to resent the usage they had met with from the old knave and some authors affirm that it was moved he should be exposed and his accounts burnt by the hangman but the turn that afterward happened to these things saved him from receiving his just reward at that time  this put sir pols party into a great consternation but sir pol who never was at a loss produced in the next place a great number of petitions from country and city the first procured by the two blackwellhall factors formerly mentioned these had sent blank petitions of their own drawing up to harry woollpacks friends all over england telling the country clothiers by letters that if they did not sign them they were undone and their trade would be all given away to france the last was from the weavers and companies in london procured by the same solicitation and most of the said last petitions having the same hands to them all  against these alderman traffic in behalf of count tariff produced a multitude of representations from all parts of england to himself being the same formerly mentioned entreating him to invite count tariff over hither and to engage in partnership with him expressing their great satisfaction and how advantageous it would be to the nation if he could be prevailed upon to become partner with harry woolpack and himself as aforesaid representing also what an advantageous trade great britain enjoyed formerly when the old real merchant fact and the count corresponded together and that which was most surprising in this part of the counts defense was that many of these petitions and representations were from the very same places and signed by the very same hands which had signed sir pols petitions  viz from harry woollpack and his friends abovenamed which was a clear proof that party and faction had procured the last and truth and reason had procured the first  sir pol finding that it thus went against him and that he was in danger of losing his cause had got one card left to play which indeed carried the whole cause and ruined all the measures which alderman traffic had laid for making this partnership effectual and this was to bring a mob and make a tumult round about the court these old scheme had prepared for his attendants consisting of harry woollpacks servants and dependants though their master was withdrawn as before  viz clothworkers dyers packers calenders setters hotpressers blackwellhall factors with their apprentices porters carmen and whatever sir pol and scheme by their mighty interest could get together these raised a hubbub without the court crying out no count tariff no tariff send away count tariff let the dutch or the devil have count tariff and alderman traffic too we care not no tariff no tariff likewise all the while the court were considering of the case and preparing to give their opinion sir pol and old scheme who had now no other game to play and were at their wits end interrupted them with a hideous noise and clamor crying no tariff no tariff nay some it seems cried no trade no tariff  this as noise generally does in the like cases was said to have influenced many whether it intimidated any or no history is silent as to that but sir pol saw evidently that it had turned the scale very much on his side at length a certain suffolk gentleman then in court desired leave to offer an expedient to appease the present tumult and satisfy all parties which having been granted he began to speak he acknowledged  that he had been as forward as any for the counts coming over he said that he was still of the opinion that count tariff was capable of laying a good foundation for the interest of great britain and that he abhorred the tricks and forgeries of sir pol and his shamevidence old scheme as much as any one did that he had given his assistance in drawing the partnership now in debate and did think the articles of it were a sufficient ground to establish the commerce of the nation upon but that in regard the noise was so great and the clamor without doors so loud that neither the count nor his witnesses could be heard and that the term being now expiring the court could not sit long enough to determine a thing of so great consequence he proposed therefore that persons might be chosen on both sides and appointed to adjust such matters as were not fully settled and to explain the several meanings of both sides so that an entire scheme of the trade which count tariff proposed might be framed which might fully answer the good intentions of the landlady for the good and welfare of her tenants and that to this purpose the debate about confirming the articles of the partnership with count tariff and making the same effectual might be delayed for the present to be reassumed the first cause next michaelmasterm and then to be fully discussed tried and determined by a jury of landedmen to be returned by all the high sheriffs of great britain and that in the mean time direction might be given that the court might be imposed upon by no more counterfeits no more goodman facts but that the true merchant fact of london might be found out and desired to appear to whom all due respect honor and regard should be shown by the court  this after some debate being put to the question and carried by a majority of nine voices the cause was put off accordingly  as soon as mynheer van coopmanschap who lay all this while concealed at a certain lawyers chamber in the temple had an account of this success he came down to the club with great joy having first by advice of sir pol and other members of his acquaintance sent several loads of fagots to basinghallstreet spittlefields ludgatebill and other convenient places to make bonfires and please their mob  being come into the club he returned them his hearty thanks for the great service they had done him which he assured them he would endeavor to return upon all occasions if they should have any need of him whether upon falling out with their landlady or in whatever business they should require his assistance  he told them he hoped they would continue the same care for his affairs against the next term and especially to provide good advocates to plead for him he likewise told them he doubted not but he should renew his partnership with count tariff the next morning for he was a person that could not be out of business and so making a very low bow he offered to take his leave  but sir pol making a sign to him to stay stood up and spoke to him to the following purpose  he told him the society was very glad they had been serviceable to him in this affair that they were well satisfied that he should enter into the partnership with count tariff as he desired though thereby he should engross all the trade to himself that they would not fail to use their interest to get him good lawyers to plead for him against next term and particularly he told him that they would use their endeavors to get the high sheriffs to return him a good jury who should be as willing to give up the trade of the kingdom to him as the club had been which he said required a great deal of art and good management on their part to bring to pass  he put him in mind however that the club had pawned their credit with harry woolpack and his friends in the country and with all the mob that they had gotten together to make a noise for him that he  mynheer and his partners in holland would take off all their woollen manufactures and fish and that they should have no loss by their refusing the partnership with count tariff which if i had not done says sir pol and my good friend here mr scheme you had had no appearance for you to day and had certainly lost your point and therefore mynheer said sir pol we hope you will be as good as your word and keep up our credit with the country without which we shall never be able to get you a good jury chosen  mynheer changed the air of his countenance upon this proposal and told them coldly he would do them what service he could but that as to the fishtrade it was out of his way to buy any in britain he having ships of his own with which he could catch them on our northcoasts sooner than we did our selves  but as to our woollen manufactures he said he would take a pretty large quantity of glocestershirecloths and exeterserges only he said he must have the cloths white and the serges in the grease because the dying dressing etc was to be done in holland that his own poor servants might be employed    having said thus he withdrew and the next morning having entered into a parnership with count tariff for one year certain they went away together for amsterdam where as we are informed they drive a very great trade and count tariff in particular has already bought a very great quantity of east india goods of him with  0000 hogsheads of guelderland tobacco and other goods in proportion  the club being thus disappointed appeared very much dejected and we hear that harry woollpack and his friends are gone home into the country in a fret disobliged and dissatisfied as they might very well be their manufactures being thrown back upon their hands by the dutchman now his own ends were served  mynheer van coopmanschap being gone and count tariff also the chairman thought fit to appoint that the committee should meet every evening to concert measures for the carrying on the interest of mynheer according to their promise and to oppose every one that in the least countenanced the partnership with alderman traffic and to the end that this might be done more effectually sir pol proposed that they should send for their scots pamphleteer who had formerly done them very good service in frequent publishing their scandals and who being lately fled from justice had been entertained in coopmanschaps family abroad this was no sooner agreed to but the fugitive appeared in the club having been lurking about the town for some time and was set immediately to work to write pamphlets in favor of mynheer coopmanschap  it cannot be expected we can collect all the scurrilous invectives which history has given an account of that were written upon this occasion as well against count tariff as against the landlady her self the first were especially directed to reconcile the people to the breaking off the partnership between count tariff and alderman traffic and to inflame harry woollpack again so that instead of being sensible of his loss and the injury done to his trade he should like well to have all the business go through old coopmanschaps hands and himself be a jackholdmystaff to the dutchman  this was the more difficult for them to effect because harry woollpack had been so ill used by mynheer and had seen so much of his knavery in the late trial especially when the pretended merchant facts false beard dropped off and discovered him to be no fact but mere sir pol falsehood disguised in the habit of the true merchant fact that he was gone down in the country disgusted and had openly said they were a pack of knaves and that he would never have any more to do with them that they were in a confederacy with old coopmanschap to enrich him at the expense of their country and to let him make a monopoly of the english trade  sir pol was not ignorant that it was absolutely necessary in order to prevent their present design that they should bring over this harry woollpack again and to this end they were to set all their engines at work to blow dust into his eyes that he should not see too far into their measures the methods they took for this as is said before are too many to be inserted in this place but the histories of those times cannot fail to supply the want it may suffice to let the reader know that this was diligently endeavored by charging alderman traffic with the breach of a partnership he had been engaged in with don sebastian a portuguese merchant and with threatening what a great damage it would be to harry woollpack if don sebastian should take the pett and refuse to trade with him and his friends although it was well known that don sebastian had no other market for his own goods nor could he be supplied any other way with such goods as harry woollpack traded in and besides all that don sebastian was so embarrassed with reference to a neighboring merchant who demanded great arrears from him of an old contract that was between them which amounted to more than the said don sebastian was able to pay that he was fain to make use of alderman traffic and his interest to prevent a very great suit at law being commenced against him and it was very improbable that he would do any thing so very affronting to alderman traffic as what these men talked of at the same time that he was so much obliged to him other ways  on the other hand don sebastian saw that there was so much necessity for what alderman traffic had done with respect to some particulars of their partnership that he appeared very well satisfied therewith and did not pretend to take any step that looked as if there was any unkindness between them so that all the clamor on that side ceased and don sebastian very freely offered to renew his partnership with alderman traffic upon terms of friendship and good correspondence and to trade together as much as ever they did on the other hand alderman traffic espoused the interest of don sebastian so heartily and so effectually being made arbitrator between him and his neighbor don philippo the spanish merchant that he got that breach amicably made up and a chargeable suit at law which he was threatened with effectually prevented  this was such a piece of service to don sebastian and he being a person of great honor and gratitude was made so sensible of it that it prevented all manner of misunderstanding between him and alderman traffic to the great mortification of sir pol and his friends who had made a mighty great noise of this business  being disappointed in their measures in this particular and not able to bring over harry woollpack as they designed to do to their party the next thing they went about was to see what they were able to do as to getting a packed jury against count tariffs trial came on  writing pamphlets and filling the country with most abominable untruths scandal slander and false rumors to make the people uneasy this was their stated neverfailing method but the main point was to bring the character of count tariff into contempt to which nothing was wanting that could possibly be done by men who neither valued their own reputation or any mans else nay even the landlady her self was in a most unchristian manner insulted by their writers and treated with the greatest indecency imaginable although they knew her to be the best of landladies and though they enjoyed their shops with the utmost quiet under her paying as little rent as could be expected and although she had successfully protected them against all those who would have disturbed them  whenever these pamphleteers had printed any thing that treated their said landlady either disrespectfully or injuriously or that insulted her in the government of her own affairs the club industriously conveyed those prints throughout the whole kingdom and spread them among all her tenants and servants in order to accustom and inure them to treat her in the same manner  as to her immediate servants they were treated by these people in the most scandalous manner imaginable and upon all occasions so scurrilously and injuriously used in their ordinary business and in the discharge of their duty to their landlady and mistress that it looked not only as if these men had a right superior even to their landlady her self but that she was not lawfully lady of the manor or were not rightful possessor of the tenements which she had let to them  this they thought was useful to awe and browbeat those good country people whose proper business it was to bring the names of those gentlemen to the high sheriffs etc who were to return the jury by whom count tariff was to be tried  but this had a quite contrary effect for when the country tenants especially harry woollpack and his people came to see how their good landlady was served for whom they had an unseigned zeal and affection and upon what account and with what little reason she was so unmannerly and undutifully handled it raised their passions to the highest degree and they resolved to have nothing to do with sir pol and his party  this also had a good effect the other way for it discovered the designs of sir pol and his club and it gave the people warning against being farther imposed upon by which means there appears a general good disposition among them all to choose such a jury as shall hear the cause of count tariff with impartiality and that will not be bullied by sir politic falsehood and his falsebeard or be put off from doing justice by the noise of his rabble so that there is no question but the partnership between count tariff and alderman traffic will be approved and the articles thereof upon a fair and full hearing of the cause be made effectual  postscript since the aforesaid memoirs were written we are given to understand that there are diverse accounts come from abroad of the great joy which the rejecting count tariff in england had occasioned in france especially among the manufacturers of woollen goods in the several provinces of languedoc pictou anjou etc where upon the first news of the treaty of a partnership between count tariff and harry woollpack alderman traffic and others in london the people were under the greatest consternation imaginable knowing that if that partnership went on and should be made effectual by alderman trafficks landlady and that count tariff had come off at his trial with that applause which they heard was expected their several undertakings of woollen manufactures in those places would be ruined  they had represented this before to count tariff himself humbly addressing and entreating him not to enter into partnership with alderman traffic for that it would be to the ruin of his own country if he did they also applied themselves to their own landlord to try if he could be prevailed upon to prevent count tariff from entering into any engagement which would be so fatal to all his tenants  but the landlords circumstances were at that time such that he could not conveniently interpose in the matter for alderman trafficks landlady and he had newly ended a long and chargeable suit at law and being made friends he was unwilling to disoblige her though he complied with conditions which at other times he would not have done nor had the partnership with count tariff ever been made upon such advantageous terms if it had not been so  being thus repulsed by their landlord the poor manufacturers had no recourse but to count tariff entreating him not to engage with alderman traffic and representing that it would be their utter ruin if they did that they should never get any wool to go on with their manufactures and without which it was impossible for them to carry on their trade they knew they said that alderman traffic and his partner harry woollpack were utter enemies to them and to their employment and would effectually put a stop to their having any wool from great britain or ireland without which they should be all undone whereas those people who had managed the trade in great britain formerly were very easy in that affair and at least were slack in preventing the exportation of their wool so that they could get over whatever quantity they had occasion for  they farther represented to him that if he went on with this partnership it would bring in such a prodigious quantity of woollen manufactures from england upon them and that so much better than any they could make at home that no one would buy their goods made in france as to the high duties which they were informed he would take off they represented that the english manufactures would not only be better than theirs but would thereby be cheaper also for that notwithstanding their people worked as cheap and fared as hard as any people in the world yet they were but young and unexperienced in the trade and had not the arts of doing every thing so at first hand as the english nor had they materials as the english had but at very remote distances and upon much dearer terms than the english had so that as it had been impossible for them to set up their several manufactures if it had not been for count tariffs breaking off his former partnerships in britain in the years           and   0  by which the markets were their own and they were admitted to sell at what price they pleased so it would be impossible for them to go on with any success if he should renew his said business and engage anew with the said traffic and woollpack who were sworn enemies to their trade  these representations however importunate and made by vast numbers of the said counts tenants and servants yet could not prevail with the count at all especially when alderman trafficks landlady interposed her good offices to have the partnership agreed on so that as you have heard the affair went on successfully and the partnership was concluded only that it wanted some ratifications to make the same effectual among harry woollpacks friends and others as has been shown  the poor manufacturers being thus repulsed were driven even to despair and had no remedy but prayers and tears for they are not such noisie fellows as our sir pol and old scheme brought along with them to the parliament they dare not come up with their mob at their heels and interrupt the assembly and parliaments of their country with their clamours and cries of no tariff no tariff no english partnership and the like but seeing the same like to go on they sat down with a profound submission to their landlord but at the same time crying universally to one another that they were all undone and their trade ruined  as their grief was inexpressible at the prospect of the opening of the english commerce into france so when they understood how things were like to go in england they began to revive in their hopes and having their trusty agents in the club in self at london by whom they had intelligence every post how things went on those agents did not fail to push forwards sir pol and the club to insult count tariff as much as possible and in order to this they scattered about private papers signifying that count tariff had little or no influence on the woollen manufactures in his own country that they were now come to that perfection that they valued no english manufactures at all but made them better at home and were able not only to supply themselves but all the world and even britain it self  these were the men that put it into sir pols head to impose a distracted notion upon the club  viz that there was a project set up in france to make woollen manufactures without wool at all and thus they helped blow the coals up in the club against count tariff when at the same time they in france were in the utmost consternation for fear his articles with alderman traffic should be made effectual  but it is impossible to express the joy of the poor people all over the aforesaid provinces where the woollen manufactures are made when their agents in the club wrote them the following letter which being written in french we thought fit to translate for the benefit of the public  messieurs we do our selves the honor to acquaint you that we are just now returned from the assembly of estates of this country where the case of count tariff and his new partnership was brought to a trial we have been assisting in the club of the citymalecontents and others in raising an hideous outcry in the streets and outer courts of the parliament where we met with a great number of their canaille to say no tariff no tariff which has had the desired success for the court has refused to make the said partnership effectual and have put off the cause till the next meeting so messieurs you are secure of enjoying your manufactures for one whole year longer and that you may carry them on the more successfully we have according to your order bought you a large parcel of fine wool to be ready as usual when your boats shall come for it which with what we formerly shipped off from ireland will be of great service to you  your most obedient servants etc p s the club are very well satisfied that you should have what wool can be conveyed away though traffic and woollpack had proposals ready for the preventing it if their partnership had gone forward    london august         this news occasioned such a universal joy through all that country that nothing could exceed it except the extravancies of the club and their agents in britain though history has not yet let us know how their friends reconciled it to reason that both the french could rejoice and they also upon the same occasion perhaps time may assist us to unfold the mystery  finis
